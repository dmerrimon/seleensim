POPULATION: 
The population for this study includes men and wome n 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive, with a 
body mass index <40 kg/m2, fasting LDL-C levels >70 mg/dL, and TG levels <400 mg/dL at the 
Screening Visit, who are currently recei ving high-intensity statin therapy. 
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: This study will be a placebo-controlled, double-
blind, randomized, Phase [ADDRESS_1277679] at 
approximately 20 sites in the [LOCATION_002]. Screening Period 
At the Screening Visit, participants will be requir ed to sign an informed consent form (ICF) before 
any study-related procedures are performed. After signing the ICF, participants will be assessed 
for study eligibility. Treatment Period 
Up to 2 weeks after the Screening Visit, participants will return to the site on Day 1 (Visit 2) and 
confirm study eligibility before bein g randomized and beginning treatment. 
Approximately 114 eligible participants (38 participants per treatme nt group) will be randomized 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of th e following treatment groups: 
 Combination therapy: Obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg (administered as one 10 mg 
obicetrapib tablet and one 10 mg ezetimibe capsule); 
 Obicetrapib monotherapy: Obicetrapib 10 mg (ad ministered as one 10 mg  obicetrapib tablet 
and 1 placebo capsule); or 
 Placebo (administered as [ADDRESS_1277680] acebo capsule). 
During the 12-week Treatment Pe riod, the assigned study drugs wi ll be administered by [CONTACT_910165], once daily on Day 1 to Day 84 at approximately  the same time each 
morning. Participants will retu rn to the site on Day 28 ( 2 days), Day 84 ( 2 days), and Day 112 
(2 days) for efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments. Participants, Investigators, 
the Clinical Research Organizati on, and the Sponsor will be blinded to all lipid results from Day 1 
(Visit 2) for the first participant until all enrolled participants complete the Day 84 (End o f 
Treatment) visit or are withdr awn from the study, in order to protect blinding to treatment 
assignment.

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 Safety Follow-Up Period 
Participants will return to the site for a Safety  Follow-up Visit (Visit 5) approximately 4 weeks 
after the end of the Treat ment Period for safety and PK assessments.  
DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUT E OF ADMINISTRATION: 
The study drugs include obicetrapib 10 mg, eze timibe 10 mg, and matching placebo for each. 
Participants will be randomized to receive combination therapy 
(obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg [administered as one 10 mg obicetrapib tablet and 
one 10 mg ezetimibe capsule]);  obicetrapib monotherapy (obicet rapib 10 mg [administered as 
one 10 mg obicetrapib tablet and 1 placebo capsule]), or placebo (administered as 1 placebo tablet 
and 1 placebo capsule) on Day 1 to Day 84. Study drugs (1 tablet and 1 capsule) will be 
administered by [CONTACT_910166],  once daily on Day 1 to Day 84 at approximately 
the same time each morning. 
EFFICACY VARIABLES:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is  the percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in LDL-C for the 
obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg combination treatme nt group compared with the placebo 
group. The secondary efficacy endpoints include the following, in hierarchical order: 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in LDL-C for the obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy 
treatment group compared with the placebo group; 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in ApoB for the obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg 
combination treatment group compar ed with the placebo group; and 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in A poB for the obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy 
treatment group compared with the placebo group. 
The exploratory efficacy endpoi nts include the following: 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in non- HDL-C, VLDL-C, HDL-C, TG, ApoE, Lp(a), 
and HDL-ApoE for the obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg combin ation treatment group 
compared with the placebo group and for the obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy treatment group 
compared with the placebo group; and 
 Proportion of participants at Day 84 that ach ieve LDL-C <2.6 mmol/ L (<100 mg/dL), LDL-C 
<1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL), and LDL-C < 1.3 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) for the 
obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg combination trea tment group compared with the 
placebo group and for the obicetr apib 10 mg monotherapy treatme nt group compared with the 
placebo group. 
PHARMACOKINETIC VARIABLES: 
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations, both in co mbination with ezetimibe and as monotherapy, will 
be assessed at the schedu led PK collection times.

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 SAFETY VARIABLES: 
The safety and tolerability profile of obicetrapi b 10 mg, both in combination with ezetimibe 10 mg 
and as monotherapy, will be assessed by [CONTACT_910167] (chemistry and 
hematology), vital signs, phys ical examinations, and the incidence of AEs. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock. Any changes to the 
methods described in the SAP will be described a nd justified as needed in the Clinical Study 
Report. All study-collected data will be summ arized by [CONTACT_21753], graphs, and/or raw data listings. Descript ive statistics for cont inuous variables will 
include number of participants (n), mean, st andard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and 
maximum values. Analysis of categorical variables will include frequency and percentage. 
Analysis Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Popula tion will include all participants randomized into the study. 
Treatment classification will be based on the randomized treatment.  The Modified ITT (mITT) Population will include  all participants in the ITT Population who 
receive at least [ADDRESS_1277681] a baseline valu e for the LDL-C assessment. Any 
efficacy measurement obtained dur ing the Safety Follow-up Visit (Visit 5) after a participant 
permanently discontinues the study drug or after a participant r eceives an excluded medication 
and/or procedure wi ll be removed from the mITT analysis. Treatment classification will be based 
on the randomized treatment. The mITT Population will be used for the primary analysis of all 
efficacy endpoints. The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all partic ipants in the mITT Population who have 
a baseline value for the LDL-C assessment, have a Day [ADDRESS_1277682] 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual  treatment received. The Safety Population will 
be the primary population used  for the safety analyses. 
Analysis of Efficacy  
The mITT Population will be the primary population for the efficacy analyses . Efficacy will also 
be analyzed using the ITT Population and the PP Population as supportive analyses. 
The primary efficacy analysis of the percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in LDL-C will be 
performed using a mixed model fo r repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The analysis will 
include fixed effects for treatment , visit, and treatment-by-visit in teraction, along with a covariate 
of the baseline value as a continuous covariate. The Restricted Max imum Likelihood estimation 
approach will be used with an un structured covariance matrix. Th e least squares means, standard 
errors, and 2-sided 95% confiden ce intervals for the combination group and for comparison of the 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-202 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 8 of 54 
Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 combination treatment group to the placebo gr oup will be provided. Sensitivity analyses for 
various assumptions of missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation methodology. 
Results will be combined using Rubin’s method. Full details of the model(s) and imputation will 
be provided in the SAP.  
Similar MMRM models will be developed to exa mine the secondary efficacy endpoints. In order 
to maintain the overall Type I error rate, the secondary effica cy endpoints will be tested 
sequentially at the 0.05 significance level according to the order of hierarchy specified above. 
Similar MMRM models will be us ed for the percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in non-HDL-C, 
VLDL-C, HDL-C, TG, ApoE , Lp(a), and HDL-ApoE. 
The proportion of participants at Day 84 that  achieve LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), LDL-C 
<1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL), and LDL-C <1.3 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) will be examined through 
logistic regression models for bi nary variables with covariants of the treatment groups and the 
baseline variable.  
No adjustment will be made for multiplicity in testing the explor atory efficacy endpoints. Nominal 
p-values will be provided when applicable. Any additional sensitivity and/or supplemental 
analyses will be defined in the SAP. 
Analysis of Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations will be summar ized with descriptive statistics based on the 
PK Population. Exploration of any relationships with obicetrapib exposure will be performed, as 
appropriate. 
Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the safety analyses. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical in ference will be applied to the safety endpoints. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: A sample size of at least 108 evalua ble participants (ie, 36 partic ipants per treatment group) will 
provide >90% power to detect a 30% difference in LDL-C reduc tion at Day 84 (SD of 15%) for 
each of the obicetrapib treatment groups compared  with the placebo group at a 1-sided significance 
level of 0.025. The sample size for this study was de termined in order to provide su fficient power fo r the analyses 
of the primary and first seconda ry efficacy endpoints describe d above. Therefore, assuming an 
approximately 5% dropout rate, en rollment of approximately 114 part icipants (ie, 38 participants 
per treatment group) is planned for this study. This sample size will also contribute sufficient 
participant exposure and safety data. 
Participants will be stratified according to their Screening Visit LDL-C levels ( 100 or 
<100 mg/dL).

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_910153], including lipopro tein overproduction or 
deficiency, which may be manifested by [CONTACT_371956], 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C ) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations, and a 
decrease in the levels of high-density lipoprotei n (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration. These 
disorders are generally diagnosed by [CONTACT_371957][INVESTIGATOR_910154]/reduction in the lipid/lipoprotein fracti ons. Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_371944], but it can lead to symptomatic vascular disease including coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease.  It is acknowledged that while th ere are a number of genetic and 
lifestyle factors which contribute to the developmen t of vascular disease, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_179559] [ADDRESS_1277687] prominent risk factors and normalization of  the lipid profile has been a major target in 
cardiovascular (CV) protection strategies.
[ADDRESS_1277688] tolerate d drugs for reducing LDL-C levels. Many patients, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_371945]-inte nsity statin therapy, do not achieve acceptable levels of LDL-C 
with statins alone.  
There is a need for chronic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_371946]-C levels when used 
adjunctive to high-inte nsity statin therapy.  
1.1 Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibitors 
Cholesteryl ester transfer protei n (CETP) is a plasma glycoprotein produced in the liver and 
adipose tissue. It circulates in the blood, bound primar ily to HDL-C, and is invo lved in the transfer 
of cholesteryl esters and TG between lipoprotein s. In particular, it mediates the transfer of 
cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containing pa rticles, eg, very low-density 
lipoprotein and LDL-C, in exchange for TG. As a result, cholesteryl ester from HDL can be taken 
up by [CONTACT_371958] B type 1; this action also leads to decreased 
HDL-C and ultimately to increased LDL-C.  Inhibition of CETP activity reduces ApoB an d LDL-C and increases HDL-C. CETP-inhibiting 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_910155]-C levels would 
prevent CV events. However, clinical study re sults and Mendelian randomization data have 
revealed that these effects are caused by [CONTACT_910168]-containing particles 
(including LDL particles) rather th an changes in the HDL-C levels.
2,[ADDRESS_1277689] recently investigat ed the association between changes in LDL-C 
levels (and other lipoproteins) and th e risk of CV events related to variants in the CETP gene alone 
and in combination with variants in the 3- hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl -coenzyme A reductase 
(HMGCR) gene.2 The results of these Mendelian randomization analyses demonstrate that 
treatment with a CETP inhibitor ha s the potential to effectively reduc e the risk of CV events. Both 
genetic and therapeutic inhibition of CETP leads to quantitatively  concordant changes in LDL-C 
and ApoB levels. A further Mendelian randomization analysis concluded that the clinical benefit 
of lower LDL-C levels per unit difference may speci fically be related to the absolute reduction in 
ApoB-containing lipoprotein particles.4

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 1.2 Obicetrapib (TA-8995) 
Obicetrapib (TA-8995) is a select ive CETP inhibitor. Inhibition of CETP by [CONTACT_910169]-atherogenic HDL partic les to particles in lipoprotein 
fractions (including LDL) that cau se atherosclerosis and reduces th e concentration of cholesterol 
in LDL, as well as other athe rogenic lipoproteins. Obicetrapi b also has several additional 
compound-specific activities that are hypothesized to be  beneficial in patients. In a recent study, 
obicetrapib treatment not only reduced the number of ApoB-containing particles that constitute 
LDL-C, it also increased apolipopr otein E (ApoE), which led to the removal of cholesterol via the 
liver and also reduced lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]).5 Finally, obicetrapib not only potently increases 
HDL-C and the concentration of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)-containing lipoproteins but has been 
demonstrated to be a potent inducer of choleste rol efflux, which is the main driver of reverse 
cholesterol transport.[ADDRESS_1277690] is considered importa nt because it is expected to reduce 
established atheroma burden. 
1.3 Clinical Development of Obicetrapib 
Both single ascending dose (TA-8995-01) and multiple ascending dose (TA-8995-02) studies of 
obicetrapib have been conducted in healthy volunteers. A formal, thorough QT/QTc study 
(TA-8995-04) demonstrated that obicetrapib has no effect on the QTcF. A drug-drug interaction 
study (TA-8995-05) showed no significant effect of obicetrapib on P-glycoprotein activity, but 
showed that obicetrapib is a mild inducer of  cytochrome P450 3A4. A mass balance study in 
healthy males concluded that obicetrapib is steadily absorbed, and the principal route of excretion was in the feces (TA-8995-07). Finally, bioequivalence between obicetrapib capsule and tablet formulations was investigated (TA-8995-08). 
The first patient study conducted was a Phase 2 clinical study (TA-8995-03 ) in Denmark and The 
Netherlands where the aim was to evaluate the optimal dose of obicetrapib alone and in 
combination with statins in pati ents with mild dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. Th is study concluded that a 10 mg 
daily dose of obicetrapib thera py resulted in an LDL-C reduction of 45.4%, an HDL-C increase of 
179.0%, an ApoA1 increase of 63.4%, and a significant increase of HDL-C efflux capacity. 
Furthermore, given on top of at orvastatin 20 mg, obicetrapib 10 mg resulted in an additional 
50.3% reduction in LDL-C. A second patient study (TA-8995-06) showed a st atistically significant 
reduction in Lp(a) levels following 12  weeks of obicetrapib treatment. 
Two Phase 2 studies of obicetrapib (TA- 8995-303 and TA-8995-201) are currently nearing 
completion. The first study, TA-8995-303, is ev aluating the LDL-lowering effects of 
obicetrapib 5 mg in combination wi th ezetimibe 10 mg in participants with mild dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. The 
second study, TA-8995-201, is evaluating the LDL-lowe ring effects of obicet rapib (both 5 mg and 
10 mg) as an adjunct to high intensity statin ther apy in participants with dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_910156]-intensity statins. 
Two Phase 3 studies of obicetrapib 10 mg investiga ting the treatment of elevated LDL-C levels in 
participants with esta blished atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD), as  well as heterozygous 
familial hypercholestero lemia, are currently in development. One study (TA-8995-301) will 
include participants on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering thera py, including max imally tolerated 
doses of statins with an LD L-C inclusion criterion of 100 mg/dL. The other study (TA-8995-302) 
will also include participants who are on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy, including 
maximally tolerated doses of statins with an LDL-C inclusion criterion of 70 mg/dL and

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 <100 mg/dL. Together, these [ADDRESS_1277691] Phase 3 study (TA-8995-304) will investigate the effect of obicetrapib 10 mg on clinical 
outcomes (ie, major adverse CV  events, including CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, 
non-fatal stroke, or non-elective coronary revascularization). 
1.4 Rationale 
Chronic LDL-C elevation leads to progressive accumu lation of arterial atherosclerotic lesions that 
require long-term management. While lifestyl e changes are the prim ary intervention, these 
measures seldom reduce plasma LDL-C by [CONTACT_726] 15%, and pharmacologic treatments are 
required to adequately treat hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].[ADDRESS_1277692]-line therapy fo r reducing LDL-C levels. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_910157], many patients are una ble to achieve acceptable levels of LDL-C.  
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCS K9) inhibitors are one al ternative to statins. 
However, there are several limitations with these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including high costs, limited long-term 
outcome data relative to statins,  and muscle-related events. In addition, because PCSK9 inhibitors 
are injectable, this poses a less attractive opti on for patients who prefer oral medications.  
Accordingly, there remains an unmet need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_24305] e ffectively reduce elevated LDL-C 
levels and CV risk at an acceptable cost, a convenient dosage form, and a more favorable safety profile to encourage long-term us e and patient compliance. Obicetra pib, an oral CETP inhibitor, 
has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the redu ction of LDL-C, in addi tion to other beneficial 
effects. The combination of obicetrapib and ezeti mibe, an oral cholesterol absorption inhibitor, 
could be a valuable alternativ e to a PCSK9 inhibitor in patie nts who require additional LDL-C 
lowering despi[INVESTIGATOR_287]-inte nsity statin therapy. 
1.4.[ADDRESS_1277693] acebo-controlled studies, with a statistically 
significant mean reduction in LDL-C of 18.58% compared with placebo.
8 Ezetimibe in 
combination with statin therapy further reduces  LDL-C levels. A meta-a nalysis of 27 studies, 
including more than 21,000 patients, demonstrated  a 15.1% greater reduction in LDL-C in patients 
treated with statin and ezetimibe in co mbination compared with statin alone.[ADDRESS_1277694] 
but statistically significant further reduction in future CV events (a 2% absolute risk reduction over 
7 years) in the combination group compared with statins alone. Th ese large long-term studies have 
also demonstrated an excellent safety profil e for ezetimibe. Important ly, additional Mendelian 
randomization studies have reveal ed that the CETP inhibitor HM GCR inhibitor interaction does 
not occur when a CETP inhibito r is combined with ezetimibe.

combination with ezetimibe 10 mg in participants currently receiving high-i ntensity statin therapy 
(atorvastatin 40 or 80 mg or rosuvastatin 20 or 40 mg) as part of their guideline-directed medical 
therapy. 
1.4.2 Dose Selection Rationale for Obicetrapib 
In clinical studies in healthy volunteers, obicetrapib was generally well tolerated in single doses 
up to 150 mg and multiple doses up to 25 mg/day for [ADDRESS_1277697] atins. Near maximal effects we re observed with the 10 mg 
obicetrapib dose. At this dose leve l, CETP activity and concentrati ons were reduced, HDL-C levels 
were increased, and LDL-C levels were decrea sed. There were no dose-related adverse events 
(AEs) identified and no clinically  significant changes in vital sign s, electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
or hematology or biochemistry pa rameters in any clinical studi es. A statistically significant 
reduction in Lp(a) levels from base line was also observed at the 10 mg obicetrapib dose level. 
Therefore, the present study will utilize a dose of 10 mg obicetrapib in participants with ASCVD 
who are not adequately controlled despi[INVESTIGATOR_910159]-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
1.5 Risk/Benefit 
The primary pharmacology in  in vitro, ex vivo, a nd in vivo studies have demonstrated that 
obicetrapib has the ability to i nhibit CETP, decrease LDL-C leve ls, increase HDL-C levels, and 
importantly, reduce the number of atherogenic ApoB-containing partic les in a way that is useful 
in the treatment of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
The safety pharmacology studies have demonstrated that obicet rapib has no adverse effect on 
critical physiological systems (eg,  central nervous syst em, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], gastric emptying, 
urinary tract, and steroidal hormonal production [including aldoste rone levels]) at doses up to 
300 mg/kg in rats. In clinical studies in patients, obicetrapib was also well tolerated after daily dosing of 10 mg for 
12 weeks, both alone and in combination with 2 di fferent statins. There were no dose-related AEs 
identified and no clinically signifi cant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or hematology or biochemistry 
parameters in any clinical studies.

5.1 Treatment Groups 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 Combination therapy: Obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg (admin istered as one 10 mg 
obicetrapib tablet and one 10 mg ezetimibe capsule); 
 Obicetrapib monotherapy: Obicetrapib 10 mg (ad ministered as one 10 mg  obicetrapib tablet 
and 1 placebo capsule); or 
 Placebo (administered as [ADDRESS_1277724] acebo capsule). 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
In clinical studies in healthy volunteers, obicetrapib was generally well tolerated in single doses 
up to 150 mg and multiple doses up to 25 mg/day for [ADDRESS_1277725] atins. Near maximal effects we re observed with the 10 mg 
obicetrapib dose. At this dose leve l, CETP activity and concentrati ons were reduced, HDL-C levels 
were increased, and LDL-C levels were decrease d. There were no dose-related AEs identified and 
no clinically significant changes in vital signs, ECGs, or he matology or bioche mistry parameters 
in any clinical studies. A statistically significan t reduction in Lp(a) levels from baseline was also 
observed at the [ADDRESS_1277726] udy. Participants will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive combin ation therapy (obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg 
[administered as one 10 mg obicetrapib tablet  and one 10 mg ezetimibe capsule]), obicetrapib 
monotherapy (obicetrapib 10 mg [administered as one 10 mg obice trapib tablet and 1 placebo

5.5.2 Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing 
The study drugs include obicetrapib 10 mg, ezet imibe 10 mg, and matching placebo for each. 
Participants will be randomized to receive combination therapy 
(obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg [administered as one 10 mg obicetrapib tablet and 
one 10 mg ezetimibe capsule]); ob icetrapib monotherapy (obicetrap ib 10 mg [administered as one 
[ADDRESS_1277728] acebo capsule]), or placebo (admin istered as 1 pl acebo tablet and 
1 placebo capsule) on Day 1 to Day 84. Study drugs (1 tablet and 1 capsule ) will be administered 
by [CONTACT_910166], once daily on  Day 1 to Day 84 at approximately the same time 
each morning. 
At Visit 2 (Day 1), participants will receive 1 kit (containing 32 obicetrapib tablets or matching 
placebo tablets and 32 ezetimibe capsules or matching placebo capsules totaling 
64 tablets/capsules per kit) with  the study drugs appropr iate for the pa rticipant’s treatment group. 
At Visit 3 (Day 28), participants will receive 2 kits as describe d above. Each kit will provide a 
sufficient supply for 28 da ys of dosing, with enough for an extr a 4 days of dosing in case the 
participant needs to postpone the ne xt visit. Participants will be in structed to take  2 units from the 
kit each day. The kit will be clea rly labelled to indicate which tablets/capsules to use on each day. 
Participants will be instructed to bring all unus ed study drugs to the site at the next visit. 
This study protocol includes contingency measures to manage disruptions due to COVID-[ADDRESS_1277729], it is  expected that Investig ators and participants

7.1 Efficacy Assessments 
The primary efficacy endpoint is  the percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in LDL-C for the 
obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg combination treatment group compared with the placebo 
group. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints include the following, in hierarchical order: 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in LD L-C for the obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy 
treatment group compared with the placebo group; 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in ApoB for the obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg 
combination treatment group compar ed with the placebo group; and 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in ApoB for the obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy 
treatment group compared with the placebo group. 
The exploratory efficacy endpoi nts include the following: 
 Percent change from Day 1 to Day 84 in non- HDL-C, VLDL-C, HDL-C, TG, ApoE, Lp(a), 
and HDL-ApoE for the obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe 10 mg combination treatment group 
compared with the placebo group and for the obicetrapib 10 mg monotherapy treatment group 
compared with the placebo group; and 
 Proportion of participants at Day 84 that achieve LDL-C <2.6  mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), LDL-C 
<1.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL), and LDL-C < 1.3 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) for the 
obicetrapib 10 mg  ezetimibe [ADDRESS_1277733] be obtained under fasting conditions (ie, after the participant has fasted for approxi mately 10 hours). For th e purposes of this study, fasting will be 
defined as nothing by [CONTACT_910175]. If a participant is not 
fasting, the Investigator should re schedule the visit as soon as possible. LDL-C level will be 
calculated using the Friedewald equation unless TG 400 mg/dL or LDL-C 50 mg/dL; in both 
cases, LDL-C level will be measured directly by [CONTACT_248139], also referred to 
as beta quantification.
13 Additionally, LDL-C will be measured by [CONTACT_248139], 
also referred to as beta quantification, at baseli ne (Visit 2) and at the end of the 12-week Treatment 
Period (Visit 4) for all participants. 
7.2 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations, both in combination with ezetimibe and as monotherapy, will 
be assessed at the scheduled PK collection times as indi cated in Appendix A. At  visits with dosing 
scheduled (ie, Visits 2, 3, and 4), PK samples w ill be collected with fasting laboratory samples

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
The safety and tolerability profile of obicetrapi b 10 mg, both in combination with ezetimibe 10 mg 
and as monotherapy, will be assessed by [CONTACT_910167] (chemistry and 
hematology), vital signs, phys ical examinations, and the incidence of AEs. 
8.[ADDRESS_1277736] a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unf avorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the in vestigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, which include clinical laboratory assessment variables, will be monitored and documented 
from the time of first dose of study treatment until comp letion of Visit 5. Pa rticipants should be 
instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigat or, whether or not they think the 
event is due to study drug. Beginni ng at the date of the first dose  of study treatment , Investigators 
should make an assessment for AE s at each visit and record the ev ent on the appropriate AE eCRF. 
Wherever possible, a specific dise ase or syndrome rather than in dividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  [CONTACT_445239]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not cons idered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should be reco rded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medi cal or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be  recorded as an AE, not  the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already presen t at the date of the first dos e of study trea tment should be 
recorded as medical history and not be reported as an AE unless the medical conditio n or signs or 
symptoms present at baseline changes in severi ty, frequency, or seriousness at any time during the 
study. In this case, it should be reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or ot her examination findings (eg, ECG) that are 
detected during the study or are present at th e date of the first dos e of study treatment and 
significantly worsen during the study should be reported as AEs, as described below. The 
Investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or ot her abnormal assessment is clini cally significant. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory va lues occurring during the study wi ll be followed until repeat 
tests return to normal, stabilize,  or are no longer clin ically significant. Abnormal test results that 
are determined to be an  error should not be reported as an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or other 
abnormal clinical findings (eg, ECG abnormalities) s hould be reported as an AE if any of the 
following are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 

 If action taken with the study drug is require d as a result of th e abnormality; or  
 Based on the clinical judgm ent of the Investigator.

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All noxious and unintended respon ses to a medicinal product re lated to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal product m eans that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal pr oduct and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the 
relationship cannot  be ruled out. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_1277737] information.  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Even ts by [CONTACT_248128] (intens ity) of each AE as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of severity 
Mild – An event that is easily tolerated and generally not interfering with normal daily activities. Moderate – An event that is su fficiently discomforting to interfere with normal daily activities. 
Severe – An event that is incapacitating with inab ility to work or perform normal daily activities. 
Causality assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of  the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: No (unrelated, not related, unlikely to be related) – The time cour se between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules out a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defin itely related) – The time course  between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  is consistent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  complications, etc) can be identified. 
The definition implies a reasonabl e possibility of a causal relati onship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that  there are facts (e vidence) or arguments to s uggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
The event should occur after the study drug is  given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be  evaluated in the clinical  context of the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be ev aluated in the context of  the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other dise ase the participant may have. 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-202 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 36 of 54 
Version 1.0, 16 September 2021  Concomitant drug- 
The other drugs the participant is taking or th e treatment the participant receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might  be recognized to cause the event in question. 
 Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate wh ether a particular respon se is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/ or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induc e adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_445214] a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, me tabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is consid ered serious if, in the view of e ither the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death. 
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_445216]; 
Note: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overn ight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room or urgent care visit without hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_349937] a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled or planned before signing of informed consent,  or elective treatment of  a pre-existing condition 
that did not worsen from baseline. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_293750] r during elective surgery should be re corded as AEs and assessed for 
seriousness. Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l for social or situational reas ons (ie, no place to stay, live 
too far away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042], re spi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]) will not be considered inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important medical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the a bove criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical ju dgment, they may jeopardize the participant 
and may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include alle rgic bronchospasm requir ing intensive treatment

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 in an emergency room or at home, blood dys crasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency. 
8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of the first dose of study treatment until [ADDRESS_1277738] be reported to  or the 
Sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form elect ronically in the electr onic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is comple ted,  personnel will be notified 
electronically by [CONTACT_445240] e form. If the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to  at 
 or call the  reporting line (phone 
number listed below), and fax/email the comp leted paper SAE form to (contact 
[CONTACT_248130] 8.6 ) within [ADDRESS_1277739] co ntinue to follow the participant until  the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the 
participant dies. Within [ADDRESS_1277740] update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any s upporting documentation 
(eg, participant discharge summary or autopsy re ports) to  via fax or 
email. If it is not po ssible to access the EDC system, refer to  the procedures outlined above for 
initial reporting of SAEs.  
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a participant becomes pregnant  during the study or within the Safety Fo llow-up Period defined 
in the protocol, the Investigator is to stop dosi ng with study drug(s) immediately and the participant 
should be withdrawn from the study. Early termina tion procedures should be  implemented at that 
time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it must be reported to  
 within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  will then 
provide the Investigator/site the Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to .  
If the female partner of a male participant beco mes pregnant while the participant is receiving 
study drug or within the Safety Follow-up Period de fined in the protocol, the Investigator should 
notify  as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 

NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-202 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 38 of 54 
Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 . If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immedia te 
classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complica tion, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator sh ould follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.5 Expedited Reporting 
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant in formation about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that are fatal or life-threatening as soon as possible to the FDA, and 
in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee of such a case. Relevant 
follow-up information will subsequently be co mmunicated within an additional [ADDRESS_1277741] knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country-specifi c legislation.

Confidential & Proprietary Page [ADDRESS_1277751] of the Study 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an internationa l ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording,  and reporting studies that involve human participants. 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and wellbeing of 
study participants are protected, co nsistent with the principles th at have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that th e clinical study data are credible. 
11.[ADDRESS_1277752] (IRB) will review all appropriate study documentation in order to 
safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of participants. The study will only be conducted at 
sites where IRB approval has been obtained. Th e protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, ICF, 
advertisements (if applicable), written information given to the pa rticipants, safety updates, annual 
progress reports, and any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_3786]. 
Federal regulations and ICH Guidelines require that approval be obtained from an IRB prior to 
participation of participants in research studies . Prior to study onset, th e protocol, any protocol 
amendments, ICFs, advertis ements to be used for participan t recruitment, and any other written 
information regarding this study to  be provided to a participant or participant’s legal guardian must 
be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. No study drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization has been 
received by [CONTACT_1034]. 
11.[ADDRESS_1277753] ensure that the 
participant has been informed of  his/her rights to privacy. The I nvestigator will obtain written 
informed consent from each part icipant before any study-related activity is perfo rmed and should 
document in the source documentation that consen t was obtained prior to en rollment in the study. 
The original signed copy of the ICF must be main tained by [CONTACT_349994] a representative of  the Sponsor, their representative s, auditors, the IRB, and/or 
regulatory agencies. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the participant. 11.4 Study Monitoring Requirements 
It is the responsibil ity of the Investigator to ensure that the study is c onducted in accordance with 
the protocol, Declaration of Hels inki, ICH GCP, and applicable re gulatory requireme nts, and that 
valid data are entered into the eCRFs. 
To achieve this objective, the CRA’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor in the maintenance of complete, legibl e, well organized, and eas ily retrievable data. 
Before the enrollment of any participant in th is study, the Sponsor or their designee will review

Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-202 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 47 of 54 
Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 with the Investigator and site personnel the following docu ments: protocol, Investigator’s 
Brochure, eCRFs and procedures  for their comp letion, informed consen t process, and the 
procedure for reporting SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor or thei r designee to monitor the study as frequently as 
deemed necessary to determine that data recordi ng and protocol adherence are satisfactory. During 
the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents and requests for clarifi cation or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered 
by [CONTACT_779], the CRA will review the data for safety inform ation, completeness, accuracy, and 
logical consistency. Computer prog rams that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator an d his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the Sponsor or 
their designee and provide any missi ng information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigationa l site by [CONTACT_76775]-related monitoring log.

11.6 Retention of Records 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulat ory authorities or the Sponsor, the Investigator 
will keep records, including the identity of all part icipants (sufficient information to link records, 
eg, eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed ICFs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_64349], SAE forms, source 
documents, and detailed records of  treatment disposition.  The records should be  retained by [CONTACT_248136], local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is l onger. The Investigator must obtain written 
permission from the Sponsor before disposing of a ny records, even if retention requirements have 
been met. 
If the Investigator relocates, re tires, or for any reas on withdraws from the st udy, the Sponsor should 
be prospectively notified. The study records must be transferred to an a cceptable designee, such 
as another Investigator, another institution, or to the Sponsor.

Version 1.0, 16 September 2021 Note: For the purposes of this study, fasting will be define d as nothing by [CONTACT_910178] r and any essent ial medications. 
a. If laboratory abnormalities during screening are considered by [CONTACT_248123], then the laboratory tests may be repeated once during screening. The Investigator’s 
rationale for retesting should be documented . If the retest result is no longer exclus ionary, the participant may be randomized . 
b. A participant who is screened and does not meet the study eligib ility criteria may be considered for rescreening upon Sponsor a nd/or Medical Monitor consultation and approval. 
Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant number. Rescreening should occur no less than [ADDRESS_1277761] Screening Visit. 
c. Participants will be required to sign an ICF before any study-re lated procedures are performed. 
d. Confirm the participant continues to meet  the inclusion and exclusion criteria and assess any updates since the Screening Visit . 
e. Weight and height will be measured at the Screening Visit and will be used to calcul ate body mass index. Measurement of weight should be performed with the participant 
dressed in indoor clothing, with s hoes removed, and bladder empty. 
f. Vital signs will include body temperature, h eart rate, and triplicate blood pressure (systolic and di astolic) measurements. Par ticipants should be in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_260038] [ADDRESS_1277762] will be performed in women <55 years of age for whom it has been [ADDRESS_1277763] menstrual period. 
j. At the Screening Visit only, chemistry panel will include HbA1c. 
k. LDL-C level will be calculated using the Friedewald equation unless TG 400 mg/dL or LDL-C 50 mg/dL; in both cases, LDL-C level will  be measured directly by [CONTACT_371969], also referred to as beta quantification (Source: LDL calculated. MDCalc. h ttps://www.mdcalc.com/ldl-calcul ated. Accessed [ADDRESS_1277764] 2021). Additionally, 
LDL-C will be measured by [CONTACT_248139], also referred to as beta quantification, at baseline (Visit 2) and at the end of the 12-week Treatment Period (Visit 4) 
for all participants. 
l. At visits with dosing scheduled (ie, Visits 2, 3, and 4), PK samples will be collected with fasting laboratory samples (pre-dos e). At Visits [ADDRESS_1277765] dose 
of study drug and PK sampling will be >[ADDRESS_1277766]-dose PK sample at Visit 5 should be collected at approxima tely the same time as the previous visits.  
m. PK samples will not be collected during the Safety Follow-up Vi sit for participants who discon tinue study drug early without wi thdrawing consent or for participants who 
withdraw prematurely from the study. 
n. A serum archiv e sample will be obtained and stored for future an alysis. If the sample is analyz ed, it will be for non-genetic t ests.  
o. At Visit 2 (Day 1), participants will receive 1 kit (containing 32 obicetrapib tablets or matching placebo tablets and 32 ezeti mibe capsules or matching placebo capsules totaling 
64 tablets/capsules per kit) with the study drugs appropriate for the participant’s treatment group . At Visit 3 (Day 28), parti cipants will receive 2 kits as described above. Each 
kit will provide a sufficient supply for 28 days of dosing, with  enough for an extra 4 days of dosing in case the participant n eeds to postpone the next visit. Participants will be 
instructed to take 2 units from the kit each day. The kit will be  clearly labelled to indicate which tablets/capsules to use on  each day. Participants will be instructed to bring all 
unused study drugs to the si te at the next visit. 
p. Study drugs (1 tablet and 1 capsule) will be  administered by [CONTACT_248140] w ith water, once daily on Day 1 to Day 84 a t approximately the same time each morning. On 
days with visits scheduled, study drugs s hould be administered with water following all fasted blood samples. At Visits 3 and 4 , participants will dose from the kit received at 
the previous visit (Visits 2 and 3, respectively).

Recros Medica - Confidential   Protocol CLP-0002, Amendment [ADDRESS_600534]-2018 (FINAL) 2 of 4 Investigational Device :  
Recros Medica Focal Contouring System to perform Rotational Fractional Resection (skin 
resection and focal lipectomy) 
Study Objective : 
The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using Rotational Fractional Resection in 
improving submental contouring.   
Clinical Hypotheses : 
Primary Efficacy: 
Removal of skin and fat using Rotational Fractional Resection will result in a noticeable 
improvement of submental contour, as determined by a mean 0.75 grade improvement on either 
the Submental Skin Laxity Scale or Submental Lipodystrophy Scale. 
Primary Safety: 
Post-procedure scarring will be assessed using the Manchester Scar Scale. 
Study Design 
Structure: Prospective, multi-center, single-arm (non-randomized), interventional cohort, non-
significant risk (NSR) study  
Duration: Approximately [ADDRESS_600535] from the screening visit to the exit visit.  
Visit Schedule : Screening, procedure, Day 1, 7, 14, 30, [ADDRESS_600536]-procedure.  
Indication for Use : The Recros Medica focal contouring system is intended for resecting skin 
and removing fat for the purpose of focal aesthetic contouring of the submentum. 
Study Population Characteristics 
Number of Subjects :  Up to approximately [ADDRESS_600537]-2018 (FINAL) 3 of 4 Condition/Disease :  Adult subjects with mild to moderate submental fat and mild to moderate 
submental skin laxity. 
Key Inclusion Criteria:  Healthy male or female, at least 30 years old; mild to moderate 
submental lipodystrophy; mild to moderate submental skin laxity; Fitzpatrick skin phototype 1, 2 
or 3; agree to maintain weight (5%) for the duration of the study 
Key Exclusion Criteria:   History of any intervention to treat submental fat or skin laxity (e.g., 
liposuction, surgery, chemical lipolysis, cryolipolysis); history of psoriasis, hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
eczema, rosacea or vitiligo; history of keloids, hypertrophic scarring, or other skin condition that 
may result in excessive scarring; history of folliculitis in hirsute areas; body mass index >30 
kg/m2; treatment with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_203802] (e.g., Excedrin), NSAIDS, vitamin E 
within 14 days of the procedure. 
Response Measures 
Primary Efficacy: 
 Submental Skin Laxity Scale, as assessed by [CONTACT_468565]  
 Submental Lipodystrophy Scale, as assessed by [CONTACT_468566]: 
 Submental Skin Laxity Scale, as assessed by [CONTACT_093] 
 Submental Lipodystrophy Scale, as assessed by [CONTACT_093] 
 Subjects with at least a 1-point improvement on the Submental Skin Laxity or 
Lipodystrophy Scales, as assessed by [CONTACT_468565] 
 Subject Satisfaction Questionnaire, as assessed by [CONTACT_748] 
 Image Analysis (IA) of facial photography for skin laxity 
 Pre- and post-procedure photography comparison, as assessed by [CONTACT_468567]: 
 Manchester Scar Scale 
Recros Medica - Confidential   Protocol CLP-0002, Amendment [ADDRESS_600538]-2018 (FINAL) 4 of 4 Secondary Safety: 
 Adverse events  
 Visible scarring  
 Visual skin assessment in procedure area by [CONTACT_27379] 
 Pain assessment, using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (0 to 10), as assessed by [CONTACT_1560]  
 Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) 
Sample Size Calculation and Analysis Methods:  
The sample size calculation is based on two t-tests of the hypotheses for the primary efficacy 
endpoints.  One endpoint is the change in the Skin Laxity Scale from baseline to 90 days; the 
other is the change in the Skin Lipodystrophy Scale from baseline to [ADDRESS_600539] deviation (SD) is 
0.7 points, the sample size required for combined power of 91% and Type 1 error of 5% is 55.  
The sample size calculation was done with PASS [ADDRESS_600540] of one mean. 
To accommodate approximately 10% attrition, the number of subjects undergoing the procedure 
will be 55/.9 ≈ 60.

Study  Synopsis:  
Title : INVEST  REGISTRY:  Minimally  Invasive  Endoscopic S urgical  Treatment with  Apollo / Artemis  in 
patients  with  Brain Hemorrhage: A Prospective Multicenter  Registry  
 
Objective: The primary  objective of this multicenter  prospective registry  is to provide additional safety,  technical  
outcomes and clinical  outcomes data for minimally  invasive endoscopic surgery  (MIES)  with Apollo / Artemis  for 
the evacuation  of supratentorial brain  hemorrhage  in adult patients  who do not qualify for the concurrent  INVEST  
Feasibility study  at active  United  States  (US) INVEST  centers.  
 
Study  Design : This study  will be a prospective, non-randomized, multi- center,  single  arm registry  that will enroll  
up to 50 patients  at up to  30 US centers.  
 
Patient  Population : Adult patients  with supratentorial brain  hemorrhages (ICH  and/or IVH)  who do not meet  all 
INCLUSION  criteria  or who meet  one or more  EXCLUSION criteria  for the INVEST  feasibility study , but who will 
ultimately  undergo MIES  with Apollo or Artemis  at active  INVEST  centers.  
 
Indication : The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device is used for the controlled aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448981]/or fluid during 
surgery of the Ventricular System or Cerebrum in conjunction with a Penumbra Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448982]. The Penumbra 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_448983] a vacuum source for the Penumbra Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_820583]. The  Apollo system  has been  
cleared  for the controlled  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_863974]/or  fluid  during  endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_863975]. In the present  study,  we propose to investigate  the safety  and efficacy  of this system  for the 
minimally  invasive evacuation  of brain  hemorrhage  – both IVH,  IVH with  ICH  and ICH  alone – in patients  who do 
not qualify for the INVEST  trial.

1. Introduction:  
 
As discussed  in detail  in the companion INVEST  submission, intracranial  hemorrhage is a devastating  disease  
associated  with poor clinical  outcomes. To date,  no surgical  or medical  therapy  (with  the exception  of blood 
pressure  management)  has been  demonstrated  to definitively  improve outcomes  in these patients.  Of all the 
interventional therapeutic  strategies  tested,  the most encouraging data exist  for minimally  invasive surgery1. The 
primary  aim of minimally  invasive surgery  (MIS)  for brain  hemorrhage  is to achieve  an atraumatic  evacuation  of 
blood products from  the brain  to prevent the secondary  injury that occurs  after the initial bleed.  To date,  several  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_448998] a small Phase II feasibility  trial have suggested  that MIS with catheter  mediated  thrombolytic  
irrigation  may be associated  with an improvement in clinical  outcomes in ICH.  Similarly,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_863977]2. While,  initial data derived  from  these preliminary  studies of thrombolytic- assisted  catheter  drainage  
have been  encouraging,  but there are significant  potential shortcomings of this technique compared  to the purely 
mechanical  approach with the Apollo system  or Artemis Device . 
 
2. Purpose  and Hypothesis  
 
The Artemis  Device or its predecessor the Apollo System ha ve been  commercially  available in the US for the surgery 
in the ventricular system or cerebrum for over three years and early  experience with the system  in regards to  its 
application  to remove parenchymal  and intraventricular  hemorrhages has evolved1, 3, 4. As such, now that the 
technical  approach  has matured,  it is necessary  to proceed  with a feasibility  study  to assess the potential clinical  
impact  of the Artemis  system  in patients  with supratentorial ICH.  Currently no prospective study of any kind has 
evaluated  the efficacy  minimally  invasive endoscopic surgery  (MIES)  with the Apollo or Artemis  system  for brain  
hemorrhages. The purpose of this prospective registry  is to capture data from  patients  who do not qualify  for 
INVEST  feasibility study , but who undergo Apollo or Artemis  treatment  at participating  US INVEST  centers.  We 
anticipate  that these  registry  data will be useful to more  fully  understand the Apollo and/or Artemis  procedure. Since 
this is a single -arm study of Apollo / Artemis  MIES  treatment,  a formal  hypothesis test is not planned. 
 
Rationale for the INVEST Registry Design 
 
The INVEST Feasibility study  was specifically designed to provide an assessment of enrollment and follow up for this 
patient population after being treated with Apollo / Artemis  MIES. There are other patients who will come to the 
INVEST centers who, in the experienced physicians’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may benefit from the Apollo / Artemis  MIES procedure, 
but are excluded from the feasibility study  protocol for various reasons (e.g , large IVH with a small ICH, low 
admitting GCS score, large hemorrhage (>80cc), baseline mRS >1). In some cases, physicians at INVEST centers may decide to offer Apollo / Artemis  MIES to these patients outside of the INVEST Feasibility study . The INVEST r egistry 
will allow experienced operators at these INVEST centers to enroll such patients into a prospective observational 
registry. This mechanism serves several important purposes. First, the INVEST REGISTRY data may be informative 
to a subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_863978] . Second, these data 
will provide a valuable surveillance of the application of MIES surgery and the Apollo system / Artemis Device  in 
clinical practice at major academic institutions within the controlled, monitored setting provided by [CONTACT_863992] . A core lab will assess technical outcomes in these patients independently.  The study’s Medical Monitor and 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will actively monitor clinic al outcomes. Finally, the registry allows centers to 
enroll most all patients who are considered candidates for Apollo / Artemis  MIES into a prospective study. It is our 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_863979] a mechanism will facilitate the Feasibility  enrollment at INVEST cen ters and will enhance the 
efficiency of the study. Avid enrollment in the INVEST studies increases protocol awareness, familiarity with mechanisms for screening and enrollment, familiarity with both protocols and protocol adherence.   
The INVEST REGISTRY w ill allow the inclusion of patients with low presenting GCS ( < 4).  Patients with very 
low presenting GCS (3- 4) represent a heterogeneous group. Many will have severe unrecoverable injuries potentially 
involving the brain stem. We did not want to potentially dilute our ability to detect a signal for a treatment effect by 
9  
including these patients in the Feasibility study . However, if operators feel that some patients in this group could 
potentially benefit from the Apollo  / Artemis  procedure and intend to treat the patients outside of the INVEST 
Feasibility , the INVEST REGI STRY will allow the prospective collection of data within the context of a controlled, 
monitored clinical study. These data may be informative to the subsequent Phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_863980] a potential for these patients to respond to treatment (i.e., if these registry patients have outcomes similar to GCS 5 -8 patients in the feasibility study ) or confirm that they do not respond. 
 
The INVEST REGISTRY will include patients with isolated  intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or IVH with a 
small ICH. The Apollo system and Artemis Device  are cleared for the minimally invasive removal of tissue and fluid 
from the ventricular system. The INVEST Feasibility is specifically designed for the assessment of this technology to 
improve outcomes in ICH. The INVEST REGISTRY represents the first prospective study, which will monitor 
technical and clinical outcomes in patients  with IVH.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1204800]  of care for the initial evaluation  and follow- up of patients  with intracranial hemorrhage. 
The Apollo / Artemis  MIES  procedure is performed  in a manner,  which  is similar  to that of other neuroendoscopic 
procedures, and the associated  risks  are likewise  similar.  In brief  (see Section  5 for a detailed description  of the 
procedure), the Apollo / Artemis  MIES  procedure itself  involves the creation  of a burr hole or mini- craniectomy  and 
dural incision. An endoscopic sheath  (19-22F)  is then placed  through this access  site into the hematoma  or 
ventricular  system  under imaging  control using neuronavigation. Then, under endoscopic guidance,  the hemorrhage 
is evacuated  with the Apollo  system  / Artemis Device . Following the evacuation, the endoscope and Apollo system  / 
Artemis Device  are removed.  Control operative CT imaging  is performed  to assess the remaining  hemorrhage  
volume and to assess for immediate  procedural complications.  Based  on the operative control CT imaging,  either  an 
additional pass(es)  are made,  or the procedure is terminated.  Following  the procedure, all equipment is removed  and 
the
 cranial  access  is closed  in a standard manner. 
 
Ris
ks related  to the procedure include bleeding,  infection  or damage to surrounding structures  during the creation  of 
the cranial  access  or placement  of the sheath.  These risks  are all unlikely and  are estimated  to occur  in less than 5% 
of cases.  During  evacuation  of hemorrhagic  products with the Apollo system  / Artemis Device , there is the 
possibility  of inducing or encountering additional hemorrhage in the operative bed. In a retrospective multicenter  
study of the Apollo / Artemis  procedure for the treatment  of ICH,  re-bleeding was encountered  in 2 of 29 patients  
(6.9%).  The risk related  to the general  anesthetic in this patient  population is estimated  to be approximately  1-5% 
for major  morbidity and mortality  (e.g. airway  management  issues,  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], hypotension or drug reaction),  given  
that their ASA score  would  typi[INVESTIGATOR_448999] 4 or 4e in this category  of patients.  
 
All information  concerning subjects will be kept confidential. Subjects  will be assigned  study ID #. No personal  
identifying  information  will be used in presentation  or publication of data from  this study.  
 
A list of all anticipated  adverse events  is listed  in Appendix 1.

Potential study participants  and/or their legal  authorized  representative will be identified  by [CONTACT_449024].  Up to 30 United  States  sites will be included in this study  and enroll  
up to 50 patients.  
 
 
4.6 Screening  and Baseline  Evaluation  
 
Consent is obtained, medical  history screened,  and available clinical/neurological exams  obtained, and lab work  and 
imaging  information  per institutional standard  of care is evaluated  to determine patient  eligibility.  The baseline  
neurologic examination  will be performed  by a health  care provider or study team  member,  certified  to administer  
the exams  and able to give an unbiased neurological and functional assessments (NIHSS,  Glasgow  Coma Score  
(GCS),  and mRS).  CT imaging  must be performed  to provide an initial diagnosis of ICH.  Hemorrhage volume will 
be determined  using the A x B x C/2 method for ICH  and a modified  Graeb  score (Appendix 2) for IVH.  Subsequent  
stability  imaging  (CT (preferred)  or MR)  must be obtained at least 6 hours after the presenting  scan to confirm  
stability  in the hemorrhage  volume. A CTA  (preferred) or MRA  must also be performed, as standard  of care;  either at  
presentation  with the diagnostic CT or with the stability  scan to exclude a vascular  lesion  or “spot sign”.  
Enrollment will occur  in consented  patients  with a stable  hemorrhage  volume on follow up CT or MR  (< 5 cc 
increase in volume). In  the case that the stability  scan demonstrates  hemorrhage volume increase (> 5 cc) or an 
increase in intraventricular  hemorrhage (mGraeb  score increase of > 3), a second stability  scan can be obtained q12 
hours until stability  is demonstrated. In  the case of a “spot sign”,  follow up CTA  (preferred) or MRA  can be 
obtained q12 hours to show resolution of the “spot  sign”  prior to enrollment.  A pregnancy test will be conducted for 
applicable subjects  (<50  years  old and of child  bearing potential). Once  the patient  meets  all eligibility  criteria,  and 
the patient  or LAR  has provided written  informed  consent, and a burr hole has been  performed  to initiate  the Apollo 
/ Artemis  procedure, the patient  will be considered enrolled  into the study.  Operators  should attempt to perform  
13  
Apollo / Artemis  MIES within  72 hours of the ictus.  
 
4.7 Informed  Consent  
 
A member  of the research  team  will explain  the study’s  objectives to potential candidate patients,  including 
describing  standard  treatment  with the study device,  the requirements  of the clinical  investigation, and risks  and 
benefits  of participating.  All informed  consent documents used under this study protocol will be consistent with  
applicable elements  of ISO14155, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines  and 21 CFR  Part 50, and will be approved by 
[CONTACT_779]’s  reviewing  IRB/EC  prior to study initiation.  The study informed  consent  is included in Appendix 3. 
 
 
5. Study  Screening  and Treatment  Procedure  
The treatment  procedure is described  briefly  below.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1204807] and CTA  (MRA  is acceptable in CTA  ineligible  patients)  is 
required  to confirm  the diagnosis of ICH and exclude a vascular  etiology.  Cerebral  hemorrhage  volume will be  
measured  using an A x B x C/[ADDRESS_1204808]  evaluation  for non-spontaneous hemorrhage  etiology.  In 
patients  with a CTA “spot sign”  on presentation  imaging,  a follow up CTA  must be performed  at 12 hours to verify 
resolution of this finding prior to enrollment.  Increase in cerebral  hematoma  size of <5 cc will be considered  “stable”  
on the stability  scan.  In the case that the stability  scan demonstrates  hemorrhage volume increase  > 5 cc, a second 
stability  scan can be obtained q12 hours until either  stability  is demonstrated or the patient  is outside of the window 
for treatment (72 hours from  the time of ictus).  Ventricular  hemorrhage will be considered  stable  if the mGraeb  score 
increases  by < [ADDRESS_1204809] MM for intrac erebral and/or intraventricular  hemorrhage  as determined  by [CONTACT_863993] . All attending physicians  will follow current

cone beam  computed tomography systems 
will be allowed  in the study.  
 
 
The specific  types  of devices  used in each Apollo / Artemis  MIES  procedure will be recorded  in the patient  CRF.  
  
 
5.5 Procedural Protocol  
 
Appropriately  protocoled  (depending  on the institution and neuronavigation units)  MR or CT imaging  studies  
will be uploaded  into  the neuronavigation software  (e.g., iPlan Net,  Brainlab,  Feldkerchin [LOCATION_013])  for 
procedural  planning  and guidance.  A trajectory  will be selected  by [CONTACT_863996]  (for ICH)  or optimal  position 
within the ventricular  system (for IVH).  
 
Patients  will be placed  supi[INVESTIGATOR_863984],  and a sterile field  prepared.  An external  localization  
array or other  neuronavigation localization  mechanism  (e.g.  Skull  Reference Base  with  Skull  Reference Array  
with  Reflective  Marker  Spheres,  Brianlab)  will be placed  for registration.  Following  registration,  a second  
sterile  field  will be prepared  over the region of the cranial  access.  A burr hole  or minicraniotomy  will then be 
created  in a standard  manner  of a size  large  enough  to accommodate  the selected  endoscopy  sheath.  A 
localization array  (e.g., Instrument Adapter  Clamp  with  Instrument Adapter  Array,  Brainlab)  will be attached  
to the selected  neuroendoscopic  sheath  (e.g.,  Aesculap  Inc, Center  Valley,  PA) and registered  to the navigation  
system. The sheath  will then  be advanced  using  neuronavigation into  the targeted  landing  zone  within the 
distal  aspect of the hematoma  and the inner  obturator  removed.  The sheath  will then be stabilized  (e.g.,  
manually  stabilized,  mechanically  stabilized,  or peeled  away  and stapled  down)  into  position.  The 
15  
 
neuroendoscope (e.g.,  Lotta,  Karl  Storz,  Tuttlington,  [LOCATION_013])  will then  be inserted  into  the sheath  and under  
direct visualization the Apollo Wand or Artemis  Device will be placed  through  the working  channel  of the 
trocar.  The sheath  will be irrigated  at the discretion of the operator  using  the irrigation  port  of the endoscope  
and the irrigant will be intermittently  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_863985]  a clear  
working view  is created  within the sheath  that  allows  visualization of the surgical  field  at the sheath  tip. 
When  organized  hematoma  is visualized  at the tip of the sheath,  the Apollo Wand or Artemis  Device will be 
advanced  under  direct  visualization to, or just beyond  the tip of the sheath  and actuated  to evacuate  the blood  
products.  If the working  view  becomes  obscured  by [CONTACT_863997],  additional  irrigation 
and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_449003].  When  all blood  products  are cleared  from  
the working field,  the sheath  will be retracted  serially  and the procedure  repeated.  The position of the sheath  
will be continually  monitored  directly  using  the neuronavigation system. After  the evacuation is completed,  
the neuroendoscopic  trocar  and Apollo Wand or Artemis  Device will be removed.  An intraoperativ e CT (e.g. 
dyna
CT, Siemens,  Medical  Imaging,  Erlangen,  [LOCATION_013])  will then be performed  using cone- beam CT, an 
intraoperative or portable conventional CT unit, or the OR room will be held open for re- operations  and  the 
patient may  be scanned  on a conventional  departmental  CT unit with  the option  to immediatel y return  to the 
OR room  if necessary. The  control CT  will function to  confirm  adequate hematoma  evacuation and to assess 
for any complications (e.g., re- bleeding, hydrocephalus, increased mass effect).  
Additional  evacu ation will be performed  as specified  above  at the discretion of the operator,  based  upon  the 
data from  the CT. After  the hemorrhage  evacuation is  completed,  the sheath  will be removed  and the cranial  
access  site will be closed  in a standard  manner.

• General  medical  management according  to AHA guidelines5 
• Admission  to monitored or intensive care unit for at  least 24 hours 
• Close monitoring of BP and glucose  with treatment according  to AHA guidelines5 
• Follow-up imaging  study required  in any patient  with neurologic deterioration  
 
An immediate  post-procedural CT scan will be obtained in all patients  after Apollo / Artemis  MIES.  Neurological  
and functional exams  will be conducted within  24 hours (+/- 12 hours) of the procedure.  A CT (preferred)  or MR 
scan will  also be obtained [ADDRESS_1204812] practices.  
 
5.6.1 Discharge  
 
At discharge,  the following will be completed  by a qualified  member  of the research  or clinical  care team:  a focused 
physical  exam,  a neurological exam  (including GCS,  NIHSS  and mRS)  and a review  of any adverse  events.  If 
discharge occurs before  [ADDRESS_1204813] (preferred) or MR will be obtained at that time.

hemorrhage, and number of days spent in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (ICU  and non- ICU length  of stay).  In summary,  the total 
amount billed  and the total amount reimbursed  will be assessed.

1. modified  Rankin Scale (mRS,  Appendix 4): mRS  is an overall assessment  of global  
handicap. In the original Rankin Scale,  a score  of zero indicates  the absence of symptoms 
and a score of 5, severe disability.  The modified  Rankin Scale adds a score of 6 for fatal 
outcomes. A historical mRS  will be obtained to assess the patient’s  level  of function prior 
to the ICH.  The score will be repeated  as specified  in Table 1. 
2. The National  Institutes  of Health  Stroke Scale (NIHSS,  Appendix 5) is a 42-point scale  
that quantifies neurologic deficits  in 11 categories.  Normal  function without neurologic  
deficit  is given  a score of zero.  NIHSS  should be done by a certified  examiner  as close to 
the specified  times  as possible. 
3. EQ-5D- 5L (Appendix 6) is a standardized  instrument for use as a measure of health 
outcome. Applicable to a wide  range  of health  conditions and treatments,  the 
questionnaire provides a simple  descriptive profile  and a single  index value for health 
status.  
 
All day 7, discharge,  day 30, day 90 and day 180 clinical  outcome measures  will be assessed  by a 
qualified  member  of the research  or clinical  team  either  in person at a clinic  visit,  by [CONTACT_863999]. The schedule of neurological assessments  is listed  in Table 1. At each visit,  the patient’s 
medical  record  will be surveyed  for any new or interim neurological adverse or serious adverse  events.  In 
addition, the patient  or LAR  will be asked  about any interim neurological  adverse or serious adverse  
events.  The subject  or LAR  will also be specifically  asked  about any interim neurosurgical procedures.

[ADDRESS_1204818]  diameter  (B), represents  the second  diameter.  The third  diameter  (C) will be calculated  either 
by [CONTACT_449030][INVESTIGATOR_863986]. The volume of hemorrhage plus peri-hematomal  edema  (PHE)  will 
also be similarly  calculated.  Hemorrhage  and hemorrhage  + PHE  volume as a percentage of presenting 
volumes will be calculated.  Mass effect  will be graded  with each subsequent scan compared  to the 
presentation  scan (decreased,  increased,  no change).  Intraventricular  hemorrhage will be assessed  on each 
scan and graded  according  to a modified  Graeb  score  (Appendix 2). A detailed  description of the imaging 
assessments are specified  in the Imaging  Interpretation  Guidelines. 
 
Scheduled  imaging  studies include the diagnostic/admission  scan,  the stability  scan(s)  (at least 6 hours

6. Study  Primary  Endpoints  
 
Primary  Endpoint : 
 
The primary  objective of this multicenter  prospective registry  is to provide an additional safety,  technical  and  
clinical  outcomes data for minimally  invasive endoscopic surgery  (MIES)  with Apollo / Artemis  for the evacuation  of 
brain hemorrhage in patients  who do not qualify for the concurrent  INVEST  Feasibility study  at active  INVEST  
centers:  
 
20  
• Clinical Efficacy  Endpoint: 180-day global disability  assessed  via the modified  Rankin score (mRS), 
categorized  as either  mRS  < 3 or mRS  > 3 
• Technical  Efficacy  Endpoint: Rate of surgical  success  
o Predominantly or Only  ICH:  Reduction to < 15 cc total volume AND >60%  reduction in hemorrhage  
volume on immediate  post- treatment  CT scan. 4 
o Predominantly or Only  IVH:  mGraeb  score of < [ADDRESS_1204826] scan7 
• Safety  Endpoint: Rate of mortality  at [ADDRESS_1204827]  multi- center  Feasibility study  and 
who are to be treated  with Apollo / Artemis  MIES  at an INVEST  center.  
 
2. Intent to Treat  Sample  
 
As the primary  analysis,  all efficacy  and safety  outcome measures  will be analyzed  under the intent- to-treat 
(ITT)  principle. Under this principle, the evaluable  sample  includes all subjects  who are enrolled. 
 
3. Per Protocol Sample  
 
In addition to  the defined  ITT analysis  sample,  a per -protocol sample  is defined  as a subset of the ITT 
sample.  This  sample  will be used  for secondary sensitivity  analyses  of the primary  and secondary outcomes.  
 
The per-protocol sample  will include all subjects  that do not have the following protocol violations or 
deviations: 
a. Eligibility  violation  
b. Treatment  failure  (no Apollo  / Artemis  MIES  performed) 
c. Missing  180-day primary  efficacy  outcome (not including missing  due to death  prior to the 180 days)  
 
4. As Treated  Sample  
 
This sample  will be used for analyses  of the safety  outcomes. The as treated  sample  will include all subjects 
that are enrolled  and have Apollo / Artemis  MIES  performed.  
 
 
7. General  Statistical  Considerations  
General  Design  Issues  
 
The primary  objective of this multicenter  prospective registry  is to provide additional safety,  technical  outcomes and 
21  
clinical  outcomes data for minimally  invasive endoscopic surgery  (MIES)  with Apollo / Artemis  for the evacuation  
of brain hemorrhage in patients  who do not qualify for the concurrent  INVEST  feasibility study at active  INVEST  
centers.  This structure  will allow  INVEST  centers  to consider all patients  presenting with intracranial  hemorrhage  
who are potentially  candidates  for the Apollo / Artemis  MIES  procedure for a clinical  research  trial, which  will 
facilitate  enrollment as well as protocol familiarity  and adherence.  This structure  will also yield  the highest  possible 
amount   of data about this new procedure. 
 
General Statistical Methods  
 
As a single  arm registry,  all statistics  reported  for the entire  cohort as well as subgroups will be purely descriptive. 
All confidence intervals  presented  will be two-sided.  Statistical tests between  subgroups will be two-tailed  with a 
significance level  of 0.05. Summary  tables  (descriptive statistics  and/or frequency tables)  will be provided for all 
baseline variables,  effectiveness  variables,  and safety  variables,  as appropriate.  Continuous variables  will be  
summarized  with descriptive  statistics  (n, mean,  standard  deviation, range,  and median).  Frequency  counts and 
percentag e of subjects  within  each category  will be provided for categorical  data.  The specific details  of the  
statistical analyses  will be described  completely  in the statistical analysis  plan. The statistical analysis  plan will be  
finalized  prior to database lock. 
 
Res
ults collected  at multiple  visits  will be summarized  at each visit for which  they are collected  as described  in 
Table [ADDRESS_1204828]  feasibility study. A sample  
size of 200 provides 180 subjects  at 180 days,  with an estimated  10% attrition  rate. Since this is a single - arm study of 
Apollo / Artemis  MIES  treatment,  a formal  hypothesis test is not planned. Assuming an effectiveness  primary 
endpoint response rate for mRS  0 to 3 of 34% (61/180), the expected  normal  approximation to the binomial two- 
sided  95% confidence interval  around the primary  endpoint rate is (27%,  41%).  Hence,  the proposed sample  size 
provides a precision  estimate  of ± 7% which  is sufficient  to assess the Apollo  / Artemis  MIES  treatment.  The 
precision  for the  estimated  single  proportion was calculated  using SAS v 9.4 (SAS  Institute,  Cary,  NC).  
 
 
7.2 Statistical Evaluation  of Primary  Endpoint  
 
Statistical  Analysis of Primary  Clinical Efficacy  Outcome  
 
The primary  clinical  efficacy  endpoint will be calculated  as the proportion of subjects  with a 180 day mRS  of 0 to 3. 
Subjects  who die prior to the 180 day mRS  assessment  will be included in the analysis  with an mRS  score of 6. The 
proportion of patients  with favorable clinical  outcomes  based  on this criterian  will be calculated,  and a 95% 
confidence interval  will be presented.  The number and percentage  of subjects in each mRS  category  (0 to 6) will also 
be presented.  
 
Statistical  Analysis of Primary  Technical  Efficacy  Outcome  
 
The proportion of subjects experiencing  surgical  success  based  on the following  criteria  will be calculated,  and a 
95% confidence  interval  will be presented.  
o Predominantly or Only  ICH:  Reduction to < 15 cc total volume AND >60%  reduction  in hemorrhage  
volume on immediate  post- treatment  CT scan 
o Predominantly or Only  IVH:  mGraeb  score of < [ADDRESS_1204829] scan 
22  
 
7.3 Missing  Data  and Imputation Methods  
 
Under the ITT  principle,  all patients  who are enrolled  are included in the analysis.  Therefore,  missing  data, 
especially  in the outcome measures,  can be problematic.  Every  effort  is to be made  to keep  all missing  data, 
particularly  the Day 180 outcomes, to a minimum.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_863989]’  best efforts,  some missing  data may be 
inevitable  mainly  due to lost- to-follow-up (LTFU).  The number and proportion of subjects  eligible  for and compliant  
with each follow-up examination  will be presented. Subjects  who withdraw from  the study will be tabulated  with 
reasons  for withdrawal.  Since the primary  endpoint is defined  using mRS,  subjects  deceased  during study follow- 
up will be scored  as mRS  6. Other  subjects  not completing  the 180-day follow-up visit will be categorized  for the  
primary  endpoint using the mRS  as of the last available  follow-up visit or discharge  (whichever  is later).  As a 
sensitivity  analysis,  we will also perform  analysis  after excluding subjects without 180-day follow-up evaluations. 
Additional details  will be provided in the Statistical Analysis  Plan (SAP).  
 
7.4 Secondary Statistical Analysis  
 
7.4.1 Secondary  Endpoints  
 
The secondary effectiveness  variables:  
• mRS  at 30 and 90 days - The number and percentage of subjects who experience mRS  0 to 3 will be  
calculated  along with the 95% confidence interval.  Frequency  counts and percentage of subjects  within  each 
category  will be provided. 
• Length  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] - The  median  total length  of stay and median  ICU  length  of stay along  with the inter- 
quartile  range will be provided. 
• Requirement  for VPS - The number and percentage of subjects  who have VPS placement  will be calculated 
along with the 95% confidence interval.  
 
 
7.5 Safety Analysis  
 
7.5.1 Safety  Outcomes  
 
Several  specific adverse events  are monitored throughout the study.  However  the primary  safety  outcome to be 
assessed  at completion  of the trial will be death  within  30 days.  
 
The proportion of deaths for any reason  through 30 days will be calculated  and a 95% confidence interval  will be  
presented.  Survival estimates  will be generated  to evaluate  the time-to-death  using the Kaplan -Meier  methodology 
for all deaths through 30 days.  
 
All adverse events  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_864000]. 
Events will also be reported  by [CONTACT_864001].  
 
 
7.5.2 Interim  Safety  Monitoring

increase in size of pre- existing  hemorrhage (IPH,  IVH  or extra- axial  bleed)  within  30 days 
associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_1204830] 24 hours, and/or requiring emergency  surgical  decompression or resulting  in death.  
• Symptomatic  Evolution of Peri-hematomal  Edema:  Edema with increased  mass  effect  or 
uncontrolled ICPs  within  30 days requiring emergency  surgical  decompression  NOT  related  to 
new or increased  hemorrhage (i.e. edema related)  associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  
pointon the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_1204831] 24 hours and/or requiring 
emergency  surgical  decompression  or resulting  in death.  
• Symptomatic  Ischemic Stroke: A new ischemic  stroke (ipsilateral,  contralateral;  contiguous with 
bleed/operative site or remote; cortical,  subcortical or perforator distribution) within  30 days 
associated  with an increase  of 4 or more  points on the NIHSS  or GCS  increase > [ADDRESS_1204832] 24 hours and/or requiring emergency  surgical  decompression or resulting  in death.  
• Surgical  complications  related  to Apollo / Artemis  MIES:  Surgical  site infection, brain

the clinical  site Principal  Investigator, the study coordinator assures  that all study requirements  are fulfilled,  and is 
the contact  [CONTACT_449033].  
 
The Investigator will allow  direct  access  to source data/documents for trial related  monitoring,  audit, IRB/EC  review 
and regulatory inspection. Also,  the investigator will allow  auditing of their clinical  investigational procedure(s).

and IRB approved consent and privacy statement,  the investigator’s agreement,  Medical  License,  and financial  
disclosures, fully -executed  contract,  and others  listed  above, have been  received.  No additional Investigators may 
participate  in the study,  however,  until a copy  of their CV and all other required  documents have been  provided to 
the TOC.  
 
 
15. Investigator Records  
The Investigator  must ensure that all study subject  records  are stored  for at least [ADDRESS_1204838] the investigational site so that arrangements  can be made for the handling or transfer  of study records.  
 
The Investigator will also maintain  original source documents from  which  study- related  data are derived,  which 
include, but are not limited  to: 
 
Clinic  progress notes recording subject’s  medical  history and medications;  
Medical  charts  with operative reports  and condition of subject  upon discharge;  
Medical  records  regarding  AEs/SAEs,  including treatment  and clinical  outcome; 
Results  of diagnostic examinations,  imaging  (such  as x-rays,  MRIs),  as well as the report  of the radiologist’s 
reading/interpretation  of diagnostic imaging;  
 
Signed  notes of phone calls and/or correspondence indicating  investigational site’s  attempts  to follow study subjects 
at the required  follow-up visits  until subject’s  participation  in the study is complete  or terminated;  
 
Records  relating  to patient death  (e.g.,  death  certificate,  autopsy report,  if available,  or terminal medical  records).  
 
15.1 Data  Collection  
 
 
15.1.1 Data  Management Overview  
Data management  will  be handled by [CONTACT_449035], which  is housed in the 
Department  of Neurological  Surgery  at the Mt. Sinai  Medical  Center  (MSMC).  All activities  will be conducted in 
coordination with the study  PI, the sites,  and the TOC.  The data validation  procedure will be implemented  in two 
stages.  First,  the automated  data checks  will flag items  that fail a rule, and the rule violation  message  will appear  on 
the data entry  screen  at the time of data entry.  The Study Coordinator at a site will see these rule violations and will 
be required  to provide a response. His/her  choices  are to: (1) correct  the entry  immediately; (2) correct  the entry  at a 
later time; or (3) if the entered  data are confirmed  to be correct,  dismiss  the rule by [CONTACT_864003].  Any changes  made to the data will have a full audit trail. Second, for some checks  that are more 
complicated,  additional consistency checks  will be run periodically after data entry  occurs  at the site. All data items 
that fail the programmed  consistency checks  will be queried  via the data clarification  request  (DCR)  process  
initiated  by [CONTACT_864004].  Site Monitors will als o be able to generate DCRs  when  discrepancies  are 
found during source document verification.  The DCRs  will be generated,  communicated  to the sites,  and resolved  on 
the secure  study website.  
In addition to t he study database,  MSMC  will provide the site staff password  protected  access  to a standard  set of 
web-enabled  tools, including subject  visit calendar,  subject  accrual  status,  case report form  completion status,  and 
outstanding DCR  status  pertaining to their respective sites.  
 
 
15.1.2 Data  Acquisition  and Central  Study  Database  
The entire  study will be conducted using an electronic data acquisition  method where all clinical  data on enrolled 
subjects  will be data entered  (single -keyed) by [CONTACT_449038] a web-based  data management  system, 
REDCap.  In order  to provide user-friendly and easy-to-navigate  interfaces,  the REDCap  data capture screens  are 
designed  based  upon individual CRFs.  Additionally,  REDCap  provides 24/[ADDRESS_1204839] progress. The reports  are presented  in a manner  that protects  the 
integrity  of the study (e.g.,  blinded). 
 
MSMC  will provide the TOC  and authorized study personnel access  to a standard  set of web-enabled  tools within 
REDCap.  These tools allow  the authorized research  personnel to receive regular  updates on accrual  status  and CRF 
status  of enrolled subjects.  Examples  of available reports  include subject  enrollment logs,  basic subject  
demographics, CRF  completion rate and number of data queries  outstanding and resolved. Like all reports  generated 
on the system,  data reported  are in real time.  
 
 
15.[ADDRESS_1204840] part of security  is physical  protection  of the hardware  systems  employed  by [CONTACT_449039].  The facility  
housing the MSMC  hardware is protected  24/[ADDRESS_1204841]  and secure  the data stored  in REDCap’s  back  end database, 
the software  application  employs  various methods to protect  against malicious  users  who may attempt  to identif y and 
exploit any security  vulnerabilities  in the system.  In REDCap,  all incoming data gets intentionally  filtered, sanitized,  
and escaped.  Server  environment variables  that are vulnerable to forgery by [CONTACT_124702]-users  are also checked  and 
sanitized.  To specifically  protect  against Cross -Site Request  Forgery (CSRF),  which  is another  method  of attack, 
REDCap  utilizes  a “nonce” (a secret,  user-specific  token) on every  web form  used in the application.  The nonce is 
generated  as a unique value for each new REDCap  session  
 
 
To maintain  electronic records  in the database as adequate and accurate,  REDCap  system  tracks  all changes made to 
any study patient -related  and dynamically  managed electronic records.  REDCap  has a built- in audit trail that 
automatically  logs all user activity  and logs all pages viewed  by [CONTACT_449041],  including contextual  information  (e.g. 
the project  or record  being  accessed).  The logging  record  can itself  be viewed  within  a project  by [CONTACT_864005].  The Logging  page allows  such users  to view  or export the entire  
audit trail for that project,  and also to filter  the audit trail in various ways  based  upon the type of activity  and/or user. 
This audit- trail information is created  with a computer  generated  time-stamp  and the user name [CONTACT_864010],  when  the original data is modified  or deleted.  
 
 
16. Adverse Events  
28  
Adverse events  (AEs) may occur  at any time after randomization. Pre-existing  conditions (existing  prior to 
randomization) will be documented  in the subject’s medical  record  as part of prior medical  history but will not count  
against  either  study procedure unless there is a worsening of the condition during the study.  Adverse  events  (serious 
and non-serious) will be documented on an Adverse Event CRF.  Non-serious  adverse events  will be recorded  from  
randomization through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53767] 7 days whichever is earlier.  Serious adverse events  will be recorded 
from  randomization through the end of study (i.e., 180 day follow-up). 
 
Investigators will record  characteristics  of each adverse event  on an Adverse Event CRF.  Each  adverse event  will be  
judged by [CONTACT_449043]. 
In addition, the Investigator will identify  the date of onset, severity  and duration. Severity  will be judged  using the  
scale noted in Table 10. All adverse events  will be monitored until they are adequately  resolved  or explained  or until  
the subject  reaches  the end of the study.  
 
Table 10. Definition  of event severity  for judgment by [CONTACT_10670]. 
 
Term  Definition  
Mild  Patient  is aware  of a sign or symptom, but that sign or 
symptom  does not interfere  with normal activity  or symptom  
is both transient  and resolved  
Moderate  Symptoms  interfere  with the subject’s  usual  activity  or 
symptoms  
require  treatment  
Severe  Symptom(s)  cause  either  severe  discomfort  or have  a 
significant  impact  
of the subject’s usual activity  and symptoms  require  treatment  
 
16.[ADDRESS_1204842]  and may require  medical  or 
surgical  intervention to prevent  one of the outcomes listed  in this definition.  Examples  of such medical  events 
include (but are not limited  to): allergic  bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment  in an emergency  room or at 
home; blood dyscrasias  or convulsions that do not result  in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or, the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  Serious adverse events  should not be reported  for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449008]:  for a diagnostic or elective  surgical  procedure related  to a pre-existing 
condition; to allow  for an efficacy  measure for the study;  or, for a planned surgical  procedure that was not the result  
of a condition worsening due to participation  in the study.  
 
An assessment  should be made regarding  the seriousness,  severity  and relationship  to the investigational devices  and 
investigational procedure.  The following factors  should be considered  when  evaluating  causality  of adverse events:  
1) the temporal  s equence from  the study procedure;  2) patient's  response after discontinuation or re-introduction;  
and, 3) severity  of the event.  The investigators, on the basis  of their clinical  judgment and guided by [CONTACT_449044], should determine  the relationship  of an adverse  event  to the administration  of the investigational device, 
and/or study procedure(s) as: definitely  related,  i.e. following in a reasonable temporal  sequence,  known to be a 
complication,  and having no other explanation; probably related,  i.e. following in a reasonable  temporal  sequence  
and not reasonably explained  by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical  state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; possibly related,  i.e. could  have been 
explained  by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_449009]’s  clinical  state;  or not related.  
 
29  
16.2 Reporting and Review  of Adverse Events  
 
To provide for consistent reporting  of adverse events,  serious and non- serious  adverse events  will be recorded  on the  
Adverse Event CRF.  Non-serious adverse events  will be recorded  from  randomization  through Day 7 or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_426634] (whichever  occurs  first).  Serious adverse  events  will be recorded  from  randomization through the end of 
study (i.e., 180 day final follow-up visit,  death,  or withdrawal  of consent). 
 
In order to ensure prompt reporting of adverse events, we require that all adverse events  (as well as all related  study 
data)  be entered  into the REDCap  web-based  database (REDCap)  within  five working days of their becoming aware  
of the event  during the initial admission. For all serious adverse events  (SAEs),  we require that they be reported  in 
the REDCap  within  [ADDRESS_1204843] being made aware of the occurrence of the SAE.  The 24- 
hour reporting  requirement for SAEs  applies  to all study phases.  
 
Reporting of serious or life-threatening  adverse events  will trigger notification  of the event  to the Medical  Monitor 
(MM).  The MM will conduct an independent review  of these specific  SAE.  If the MM believes  the adverse  event  is 
serious, unexpected  and either  definitely,  probably, or possibly related  to the investigational device(s)  and/or study 
procedures, the TOC  staff will forward  a Safety  Report (pre-filled  with as much  data as possible) to the clinical  site 
Investigator to be completed  with any additional information  that may be relevant  to the SAE.  The Safety  Reports 
will be included in the reports  prepared  for the DSMB.  The principal investigator,  at each clinical  site, will be  
responsible for reporting to his/her own IRB/EC  according  to individual IRB/EC  policies.  After the submission of 
the initial Safety Report, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_449010]-up information  about the event,  and reporting it to the TOC.  
 
If it is determined  that an unanticipated  adverse device effect  presents  an unreasonable risk to subjects,  the Principal  
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_449011]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_449012] a determination  regarding  termination  not later than [ADDRESS_1204844] been  deemed  to present the risk(s) shall  occur  not later than 5 working days after the PI [INVESTIGATOR_449013].  
 
The trial will resume only after determining  there is sufficient  evidence to reinstate  the trial, and after each clinical  
site obtains IRB/EC  approval. 
 
 
17. Ethical  Considerations  
 
The rights,  safety  and well-being of clinical  investigation  subjects  shall  be protected  consistent with the ethical  
principles laid down in the Declaration  of Helsinki.  This shall  be understood, observed and applied  at every  step in 
this clinical  investigation.  
 
It is expected  that all parties  will share  in the responsibility  for ethical  conduct in accordance  with their respective  
roles  in the investigation. The Sponsor and the Investigator(s)  shall  avoid improper influence or inducement  of the  
subject,  monitor, the clinical  investigator(s) or other parties  participating  in or contributing to the clinical  
investigation.  
 
18. Protection  of Patient  Confidentiality  
At all times  throughout the clinical  investigation, confidentiality  will be observed  by [CONTACT_449045]. All data 
shall  be secured  against unauthorized access.  Privacy  and confidentiality  of information  about each subject  shall  be 
preserved  in study reports  and in any publication. Each  subject  participating  in this study will be assigned  a unique  
identifier.  
 
The Investigator will maintain  a confidential study subject  list identifying  all enrolled  subjects.  This list will contain 
[ADDRESS_1204845]’s unique identifier  and name.  The Investigator bears  responsibility for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_143097]. 
 
Monitors and auditors will have access  to the study subject  list and other information  that personally identifies  study 
subjects  to ensure that data reported  in the CRF  corresponds to the person who signed  the ICF and the information 
contained  in the original source documents. Such  personal  identifying  information  may include, but is not limited  to 
the subject’s  name,  address, date of birth, and medical  record  number. 
 
 
19. Ethics  Committee/Institutional  Review  Board Approval  
Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  / Ethics  Committee  (EC) approval is required  prior to study commencement.  The 
Investigator must also obtain renewal  of IRB/EC  approval as dictated  by [CONTACT_449046]  (but at least annually) 
during the entire  duration of the study.  The Investigator is responsible for fulfilling  any conditions of approval  
imposed by [CONTACT_3488]/EC,  such as regular  reporting,  study timing,  etc. Study data required  to be included in 
IRB/EC  reports  (e.g.,  Continuing Reviews)  must be obtained from  the SDMC;  in order to ensure that accurate and 
consistent data are presented.  
 
The Investigator will provide the Project  Management  (PM) team  with copi[INVESTIGATOR_449014]. 
Withdrawal  of IRB/EC  approval must be reported  to the PM team  immediately  following  the investigator’s 
knowledge of the withdrawal.  
 
The rev
iewing  Independent Review  Board  (IRB)  / Ethics  Committee  (EC) must review  and approve an Informed 
Consent Form  (ICF)  specific  to this study.  Prior to the start of the trial, the PM team  will provide each study center 
with a sample  ICF.  The study center,  to meet  specific  requirements,  may modify this sample  ICF;  however,  the ICF 
must contain  all of the elements  required  by [CONTACT_760], regulations, and GCP.  Each  investigational site will submit  
a copy  of their ICF to the TOC  prior to submission to their IRB;  and, the IRB/EC  approved ICF  and renewal  
approvals to the PM team  as required  for the duration of the study.  The original, signed  and dated  ICF should be  
retained  by [CONTACT_449047],  and a copy  provided to the subject.  
 
 
20. Informed  consent  
Upon confirmation  of  patient’s  eligibility,  a written  informed  consent document must be obtained prior to any study- 
specific evaluations being  conducted. In accordance with US FDA  regulations (21 CFR  50) and ICH -GCP 
Consolidated Guidelines (Federal  Register,  May 9, 1997, Vol. 62, Number 90), a witnessed,  IRB-approved, 
informed  consent will be required  from  all subjects  or their legal  representative (LAR)  or family  member,  as  
defined  in 21 CFR  50.3(m), prior to participating  in this trial. At the initial contact  [CONTACT_4490] a potential candidate,  the 
investigator(s)  will provide an adequate explanation  of the purpose, procedures,  possible risks/benefits,  and 
participant  responsibilities; in addition to the fact that his/her participation  is voluntary, that he/she may withdraw 
from  the study at  any time,  and that the decision  not to participate  or to withdraw will not affect  subject’s  care in any 
way.  Potential participants  or their legal  representative or family  membe r will be given  ample  opportunity to ask 
questions and to consider their decision. If the subject  expresses  a sustained  interest,  a signed  and dated  written 
informed  consent will be obtained. A copy  of the consent form  will be given  to the participant  or their legal  
representative or family  member,  and another copy will be placed  in his/her medical  reco rd. The informed consent  
must be obtained by [CONTACT_449048] [INVESTIGATOR_449015]. Each  of the study team  members  with this delegation  must be qualified  in  
terms  of education, experience,  and training  to obtain informed  consent. 
 
The wr
itten informed  consent  document (and any other  written  information  to be provided to the study subject) 
should be updated  whenever  new information  becomes  available that may require significant revisions to the 
informed  consent document previously signed  by a subject.  Any such revision or update must be approved by [CONTACT_373319]/EC  before being  provided to the study subject.  Previously consented subjects  will be made aware  of 
the changes  and depending on the extent  and/or severity  of the new information  a subject  may be asked  to “re- 
31  
consent” to continued participation  in the trial. 
 
 
21. Quality  Assurance  
To ensure monitoring  responsibilities  are performed  to the fullest extent  possible on a real-time basis  through the  
RedCap,  an experienced  clinical  research  group will perform  on-site and centralized  monitoring for the trial 
uploading of all source documents within  the REDCap  system.  MSMC  staff will manage the assignment  of monitors 
to performance sites,  the coordination of monitoring visits,  and provide support to monitors while  they are in the 
field.  In addition to on-site monitoring, centralized  monitoring (per the FDA’s  most recent  monitoring  guidance  
developed in August  2011) reflects  a modern, risk-based  approach. Centralized  monitoring focuses  on critical  study 
parameters  and relies  on a combination of monitoring activities.  In this recent  guidance,  the FDA  has encouraged 
the implementation  of centralized  monitoring due to its ability  to ensure quality  and integrity  of data.  Centralized 
monitoring is also very effective at identifying  data fraud,  data fabrication, and data errors . 
 
For the first subject  enrolled  at any site, 100% of the data will be verified  to source documents. For subsequent  
subjects,  a checklist  of key outcome and safety  data variables  requiring source document verification  (SDV)  has  
been  developed  based  on the trial’s  safety  and efficacy  endpoints. Source documents verifying  each data point  
collected  in the trial will be uploaded into REDCap  for all study subjects.  This will allow  for data to be monitored in 
a real-time fashion and for any errors  in data to be identified  more  quickly. A target  of no less than 50% of the trial 
data submitted  to the REDCap  database will be verified  against  source documents from  the performance  sites prior  
to finalization  of the database.  Safety  and efficacy  variables  represent  approximately  half of the data to be verified. 
The remaining  half of source monitored data include:  100% of deaths  and 100% of serious adverse events and all 
MSMC  requested  source data reviews  based  on the per-subject evaluation  of safety  parameters  defined in the 
protocol. All data monitored are verified  for accuracy  and thoroughness using the most appropriate source documents 
for all subjects.  
 
Sign
ed informed  consent documents and HIPAA  are monitored for all subjects. Additional monitoring verification 
will include: ongoing evaluation of the adequacy  of site facilities  and staff,  site recruitment,  subject  randomization, 
the presence  of regulatory documents, and specific review  of documents and data as requested  by [CONTACT_864006]. 
Each  site will be monitored on a real-time basis  through the uploading of all source documents into the REDCap 
system.  Sites  are evaluated  in an ongoing manner by [CONTACT_864007] a need  to 
monitor more  frequently or more  thoroughly or via on- site evaluation. 
 
Any omissions and corrections to data submitted  to the database are noted and queries  are generated  by [CONTACT_864008]’s  automated  system.  All queries  will be stored  in REDCap’s  logging and audit  
trail so that all data changes  or questions regarding  data accuracy  are tracked  and permanently recorded.  The 
auditing trail will contain  information  regarding  which  monitor issued  the query,  which  user was assigned  the query 
at each site, the complete  free text conversations discussing  data questions and/or changes,  and will provide time and 
date stamps  for all query related  processes.  
 
Monitors will perform  closeout-monitoring evaluations at the completion  of subject  enrollment.  The monitor will 
again  review  all regulatory files and verify  documents for accuracy  and completeness  as directed  by [CONTACT_864009].  Sites  are instructed  in the record  retention  of all trial documents. Principal Investigators are directed  to close  
the trial and issue  a final report  to their IRB/EC  following  resolution of any and all outstanding issues at that site. 
Finally,  any additional special  considerations for the auditing of any additional safety  issues will be made.  
 
All doc
uments and data shall  be produced and maintained  in such a way to assure  control of documents and data to 
protect  the subject’s  privacy  as far as reasonably  practicable.  Only  users  with password- protected  REDCap  access 
will have the ability  to view  study data within  the secure  REDCap  database.  The Primary  Investigator,  Sponsor and 
representatives  of regulatory authorities  are permitted  to inspect  the study documents (e.g.,  study protocol, CRFs, 
and original study- relevant  medical  records/files)  as needed.  All attempts  will be made to preserve subject  
confidentiality.  
[ADDRESS_1204846]  in an emergency.  Investigators will also adhere to procedures  for reporting study deviations to their IRB/EC  
in accordance with their specific  IRB/EC  reporting  policies  and procedures.  
 
Good Clinical Practice  Guidelines require  that Investigators  maintain  accurate,  complete and current  records, 
including documents showing the dates  of and reasons for each deviation from  the protocol. 
 
 
23. Final  Report  
A final report will be completed,  even  if the study is prematurely  terminated.  At the conclusion of the trial, a multi- 
center  abstract  reporting  the results  will be prepared  and may be presented  at a major  meeting(s).  A multi- center 
publication may also be prepared  for publication in a reputable scientific  journal. The publication of results  from  any 
single  center  experience within  the trial is not allowed  until the aggregate study results  have been  published, unless 
there is written  consent from  the study PI. 
 
 
24. Information Confidentiality  
All information  and data generated  in association  with this study will be held in  strict confidence and  remain  the sole  
property of Principal  Investigator.  The Investigator  agrees  to use this information  for the sole purpose of completing 
this study and for no other purpose without written  consent from  the Trial  Operating  Committee.  
 
25. Trial  Registration  
The study will be registered  in a publicly accessible trial database  (e.g.,  clinicaltrials.gov)  prior to study initiation.  
 
 
26. Risk  Analysis  
A thorough risk analysis  was performed  as part of design  control recommendations of the Quality  System  
Regulation  (21 CFR  820). 
 
 
27. Publication  Policy  
Publication  of the results  of this trial will be governed by [CONTACT_449054].  The Publication Policy  will be fully compliant  with the voluntary  NIH Public  Access  
Policy  mandated by [CONTACT_449055] 2008 (Division G, Title  II, Section  [ADDRESS_1204847] 110- 
161).

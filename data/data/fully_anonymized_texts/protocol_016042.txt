Changes in Autoreactive Memory B Cells as Biomarker of Response to ACTH in Patients with 
Membranous Nephropathy  
1. Hypothesis : 
We hypothesize that adrenocort icotropic hormone (ACTH, Acthar) reduces  proteinuria in patients with 
membranous nephropathy by [CONTACT_457709] B cells  and by [CONTACT_457710] T cells . 
Therefore, the  number of  circulating autoreactive B cells can be used as  a biomarker of disease activity  and 
response to Acthar therapy . 
 
2. Rationale for the study:  
Membranous nephropathy ( MN) is an autoantibody -mediated glomerular disease and is the major cause of 
nephroti c syndrome (NS) in adults worldwide . The disease is caused by [CONTACT_457711] . These immune deposits contain podocyte antigens 
and circulating antibodies specific to those antigens, resulting in complement activation , podocyte injury, 
proteinuria, and renal failure . In 2009, podocyte phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA 2R) was reported as the 
antigenic target in over 70% of adult patients with MN 1. The disease shows a benign or indolent course in the 
majority of cases, but about 30 -40% of affected patients progress to end -stage kidney disease (ESKD) 5 -10 years  
after diagnosis  2.  
Treatment with steroids in association with  immunosuppressants including alkylating agents and 
calcineurin inhibitors ha s been suggested for patients with persistent NS 3. However, these  medications are 
burdened by [CONTACT_457712] a dverse events . Starting from the evidence that 
B cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease, both as precursors of autoantibody -producing cells 
and as antigen -presenting cells, we performed a series of prospective studies show ing that anti-CD20 B-cell 
depleting monoclonal antibody rituximab safely reduce s proteinuria in MN patients 4-7. About 30% of patients 
treated with rituximab or other immunosuppressive agents, however, do not respond to these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_457704] , possibl y because these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including rituximab ) are only partially effective 
in inhibiting memory B cells, a B-cell subset important in autoantibody production . 
Adrenocorticopropic  hormone (ACTH) has been recently proposed as an alternative therapy for MN, 
after the incidental finding by B erg et al . that this hormone  had antiproteinuric effects in [ADDRESS_584717] for the five melanocortin receptor s (MC1R -MC5R) . MC1R has been implicated in mediat ing ACTH  
protective effects on podocytes  by [CONTACT_457713], apoptosis, injury and loss in the proteinuric 
kidney  disease models  12. The podocyt e protective effects of ACTH are at  the basis of its antiproteinuric effects 
in a wide range  of glomerular diseases, including, besides MN , IgA nephropathy, focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ), lupus nephritis, and minimal change disease.  
More importantly  in the context of MN , publis hed data by [CONTACT_457714]-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions on T and B lymphocytes,  
including  reduction of pro -inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, adhesion molecules, and production of anti -
inflammatory IL -[ADDRESS_584718] syndrome  14, ACTH administration resulted in helper T cell and total 
B cell inhibition. Evidence is also available that ACTH inhibits the recruitment of memory B cells in the cerebral 
fluid of patients with opsoclonus -myoclonus syndrome  15. In a mouse model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis  
 
Page 2 of 5 16, ACTH  inhibited autoreactive Th17 cells and promoted a significant increase in regulatory T cells (Treg) , a T 
cell subset with  important   immune protective roles in autoimmune diseases, including MN 17. These immune 
modulating effects are consistent with the reported reduction of anti-PLA 2R autoantibodies described in MN 
patients treated with ACTH 10. 
Building on this evidence , we hypothesize that the antiproteinuric effects of ACTH in MN are mediated by  
[CONTACT_457715] a utoreactive memory B cells and the  promotion of Treg . These unique effects, together with 
ACTH direct nephroprotective activity on podocytes, make ACTH a valuable option for MN patients , including 
those  who do not respond or relapse after other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_457705] . The number of autoreactive memory B cells could also represent a biomarker of disease activity 
and response to ACTH therapy.  
To address our hypothesis , we designed a mechanistic prospective, open -label study to evalua te the effects 
of Acthar  on autoreactive memory B cells and regulatory T cells  in MN patients. This study is expected 1) to 
provide crucial knowledge on the mechanism of action of Acthar in MN, 2) identify aut oreactive memory B cells 
as a biomarker of response to Acthar, and 3) collect  additional information on the safety/efficacy of this 
treatment.

Research strategy  
Clinical study design  
This will be a prospective -cohort study in which all eligible patients will receive  Acthar  therapy. After inclusion , 
patients will undergo monthly evaluations of clinical parameters  (body weight and BP), biochemistry, 
proteinuria and serum creatinine  up to month 3, then at month 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_584721] blood (30ml)  to 
measure  circulating  anti-PLA 2R reactive memory B cells , Treg 
numbers, and anti-PLA 2R autoantibodies  (Fig ).  
Fig . Study design.  
Treatment.  ACTH (Acthar) will be administered 
subcutaneously (SC) at the dose of [ADDRESS_584722] week 
and then 80 units SC t wice weekly to complete 6 months  of 
therapy, with a  cumulative drug exposure of  3,920  units.  
- Data handling:  A password -protected and coded, electronic database will be created to include patient 
demographics, physical and laboratory results including BP, serum creatinine, immunosuppressive drug doses 
and trough levels. Acthar  doses will be also recorded at the t ime of each blood withdrawal, to monitor response 
to Acthar  therapy.  
Ex vivo studies  
- T and B cells . PBMC will be isolated by [CONTACT_457716]. Flow cytometry assays will be performed 
on fresh cells. We will use standardized multicolor flow cytometry to phenotype CD4+ and CD8+ T cells  and B 
cells , including regulatory (CD127loFoxP3+) , naïve (CD45RA+CD27+), central memory (CD45RO+CD27+), effector 
memory (CD45RO+CD27-) and T cells , naïve B cells (CD19+CD27-IgD+), non -class -switched memory B cells 
(CD19+CD27+IgD+), class -switched memory B cells (CD19+CD27+IgD-IgM-CD20+CD38+/-), and CD3+CD4+CXCR5+ 
and follicular helper T cells . Appropriate isotype matched monoclonal antibodies will be used as controls. 
Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_457706] 3 -colo r flow cytometry on a Canto analyzer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin 
Lakes, NJ).   
MC1R surface expression on T and B cells will be also assessed using  AMNIS Imaging Flow Cytometer MKII (EMD 
Millipore, Darmstadt,  [LOCATION_013]) . PBMC from age - and gender -matched healthy subjects will be used as controls.   
- Anti-PLA 2R B cells and antibodies. Anti-PLA 2R reactive B cells will be measured according to the protocol 
described in the preliminary data. Anti-PLA 2R circulating autoantibodies in the serum will be measured by [CONTACT_457717] (EA 1254 -9601 G) . 
- MC1R polymorphisms . The human  MC1R  gene is highly polymorphic, with >35 genetic variants identified at 
present. We will perform MC1R genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_457707] t hat 
different genotypes are associated with different responses to A cthar  therapy. We will also compare changes in 
immunological parameters (Treg, Teff, anti -PLA 2R B cells and antibodies) after A cthar  therapy according to the 
MCR1 polymorphi sms.  
We have standardized both flow cytometry assessments 18 for us e in clinical trials. We will perform all assays 
under good laboratory practice (GLP) compliance; previous work shows high reproducibility. We have published 
experience in performing serial measurements of Teff and Treg numbers and function in dialysis pat ients 19, 
which documents the feasibility of the proposed study.

Analysis plan and statistics:  The clinical analyses will primarily evaluate the change in proteinuria and its 
relationship with autoreactive Bmem after Acthar therapy  and secondarily they will assess rate of complete or 
partial remission changes in serum albumin, and eGFR over the [ADDRESS_584723] received the entire cour se of Acthar treatment.  A p value of <0.[ADDRESS_584724] with these 
analyses ( http://icahn.mssm.edu/research/grant -application -resource -center/statistical -support ). 
 
Sample size estimation. This will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], explorative study and the sample size will not be calculated on the  
basis of the expected treatment effect. However, according to previous reports, we expect that approximately 
70% of patients will reach complete or partial remission during the first year of follow -up and that [ADDRESS_584725] a significant difference in PLA 2R antibodies 10. To account 
for possible drop -outs, we will include 25 patients.  The data generated from this study will form the basis for 
the sample -size estimation of a larger prospective study testing the utility of anti -PLA 2R memory B cells as a 
biomarker for response to Acthar therapy in MN patients.

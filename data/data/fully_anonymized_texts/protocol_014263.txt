Amendment 4 AMENDMENT HI STORY  
 
The purpose of this am endment is:  
 
• To re vise the  approach of handling of missing d ata in the prim ary efficacy analysis 
. Specifi cally, the n ew statistical app roach will dir ectly 
impute missing  data at Day 150 visi t. For those  subjects who di ed prior  to Day 150 a nd 
the d eaths a re adjudi cated to be R SV related, their  missing prim ary endpoi nt wi ll be 
imputed a s “eve nt oc curred”. Remainin g early termination subj ects (including  non-RSV 
deaths) a cross a ll treatment groups, will be  imputed to t he average placebo score 
(estimated pla cebo event rate). The approach to es timating the pl acebo event rate is the 
Kaplan-Meier estimate  at Day 150. 
 
Rationale:  To take  into conside ration the possibi lity of a study  subj ect 
contrac ting RSV wh en addr essing miss ing data i n the primary  efficacy anal ysis 
for a study subje ct that doesn’ t complete  Day  150 follow-up due  to early 
termination. 
 
Enrollment in to the stud y will e nd with t he 2016 -2017 R SV season in the N orthern He misphere 
due to the Sponsor ’s administrative decis ion.  The  expected e nrollm ent wi ll be approx imately 
1200 inf ants resulting in a smalle r sample size for a nalysis.  The 2 followi ng changes are a r esult: 
 
• Added pow er calculation for  anticipated sm aller sample size. 
 
Rationale:   T o unde rstand the impac t of the r educed study  enrollm ent on t he 
primary e fficacy analysi s. 
 
• Revised statisti cal app roach to cont rolling the o verall type I error for the primary efficacy 
analysis. 
 
Rationale:  To retain suff icient study  pow er for the primary  efficacy endpoint 
given the r educed sample  size. 
 
Other Changes to t he Statistical P lan in clude:  
 
• To re move c ompl ete and worst-case sensitivity analyses. 
 
Rationale:  The compl ete analysis us es only  data of  a subset of subje cts, thus 
results are not ge neralizable  to the subj ect popul ation. T he wors t-case analysis 
may unrealistically inflate the primary  endpoint  event rat e abov e the expected 
small e vent rat e in this sub ject popul ation. 
 
• To clarify timing of statistical an alyses. Specif ically, the efficacy analysis will be 
conduc ted following completion of the  150-day efficacy assessment pe riod by [CONTACT_587016]. Th is will r epresent the final analysis of  all efficacy endpoint s. 
 
Rationale:  Due to the time sensitivity of fu ture study init iation, thi s will support 
timely init iation of  such studies and av oid long d elays wa iting for the start  of a 
RSV s eason.

Other changes include : 
 
• To add assessment of  negative RSV nose  swab specimens for  othe r common respi[INVESTIGATOR_46264].  
 
Rationale:  to ass ess co mmon r espi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y 
pathogens, in addit ion to  RSV, in c linical develo pment. 
 
• To add te xt to clarify what is meant by “reached primary endpoint ” when determining if 
the second dose  of study drug  should be  administered, ie onl y those subje cts who ha ve 
had a posit ive RT-PCR test at the stu dy centr al laboratory or at a CLIA-certified (or 
equival ent) laboratory after receipt  of D ose #1 of  study drug, but prior to receipt  of D ose 
#2 should not r eceive D ose #2. 
 
Rationale:  To clarify those  subj ects w ho should not r eceive a s econd dose  of study 
drug at Vis it 4, due to r educed potential  for be nefit. 
 
• To clarify that the s ymptom of c hest wall indr awing us ed in t he definiti on of  the stu dy 
prim ary endpoint  is to be conside red as low er chest wall indr awing. 
 
Rationale:  To align the protocol w ith the eCRF and our c ommunication w ith 
investigators, e g Investigator’s M eeting, on thi s topi c. The Sponsor conside rs that 
chest wall indrawing and  lower chest wall indraw ing are  impl icitly the  same; 
chest wall indrawing i s the inward movem ent of the lower chest wall. 
 
• To clarify wording r elated to pedi atric clinic visits.  
 
Rationale:  To prov ide m ore expl icit exa mples of t he types of v isits to be 
conside red as "outpat ient medically attend ed visits" or "pediatric clinic v isits". 
This information has be en collected in the e CRF,  but clarif ications are m ade in 
response to di fferent interpr etations noted by  [CONTACT_587017] t o how they are 
capturing dat a within the eCRF. 
 
• To clarify information collected dur ing the V isit 2 (Baseline and First Dosing  Visit, 
Day 1) to ass ess Risk Fa ctors. 
 
Rationale: T his informat ion has alway s been c ollected at Vis it 2 [pe r the E DC], 
but detai ls are  being added to c larify. 
 
• To clarify text related to follow up in the  Study Enrollm ent and A ssessm ent section. 
 
Rationale:  To clarify that  the fol low up pe riod f or the o ccurre nce of m edically 
attended respi[INVESTIGATOR_586911] t he 150- day study 
period. 
 
• To add te xt related to t he Endpoint Adjudic ation Com mittee assessment of  subj ect de aths 
after the first dos e of st udy drug as RSV-related or not. 
 
Rationale:  Text w as adde d that  any subj ect deaths that oc cur after the 
administrat ion of  the f irst dose of s tudy drug and pr ior to Day  150 wi ll be 
assesse d to det ermine  their association w ith RSV f or purposes of det ermining 
handl ing in r evised approac h to miss ing data.

• To clarify, in the Temperature/Safety Procedures Section, the specifi cs related to the 
restrictions to dosing  of febrile subj ects and us e of antipyretics, including a llowance for 
re-evaluation wi thin 48 hours. 
 
Rationale:  Provide c larity from pr evious v ersions of the protoc ol and t o ma ke 
consistent w ithin al l sections of the protoc ol. 
 
• To clarify, in T able 2, that two vi tal signs assess ments (te mperature, bloo d pressure, 
pulse, a nd respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) w ill be p erformed on dosi ng days, before study drug 
administration (or blood dra w, if applicable) and after. 
 
Rationale:  Provide c larity from pr evious v ersions of the protoc ol. 
 
• To correct the definiti on of  high titer to >10 000 i n the A ntidrug Antibod y Section. 
 
Rationale:  Corre ction of typographi cal error from pr evious v ersions of the 
protoc ol, w hich had om itted one  "0". 
 
• To clarify that s afety and tolerability will a lso be  descriptiv ely summa rized in t he 
combi ned RE GN2222 t reatment arms 
 
Rationale:  Provide c larity from pr evious v ersions of the protoc ol. 
 
• To clarify wording  in the Investigator Alert Not ification Section that investi gators will be 
notified in a blinded fa shion of a ny SAE that poss ibly meets the relevant requirements for 
expedited reporting . 
 
Rationale:  Updat ed wording to add t hat the notification wi ll be blinded as  per 
risk manage ment and ph arma covigilance  proc edures. 
 
• To clarify wording  in the Demogr aphic and B aseline characteristics section related to 
pharmacoeconom ics and risk factor  assessment.  
 
Rationale:  Provide c larity from pr evious v ersions of the protoc ol. 
 
• To upda te wording for the  safety variables in P art B related to the de finiti ons for  the [ADDRESS_772023] dose of  study drug  + [ADDRESS_772024]-TREATMEN T period: de fined as starting the d ay after the end of the

Amendment 3 
 
 
  
• To add 2 s econd ary endpoints to P art B 
 
− Rationale:  The addi tion of  secondary  endpoint s for PK and ADA ti ters are to 
align wi th agr eed P IP. 
 
• To add R SV LRTI Analysis and Alte rnative LRTI Definiti on Ana lysis as sensitivity 
analyses to t he prim ary endpoint  
 
− Rationale:  To align wi th the E U protoc ol and r equested by  [CONTACT_587019], r espectively 
 
  
• To clarify language in E xclusion Crit eria for the M other  
 
− Rationale:  To add that  infant s of mothe rs who ar e either 16 years or  younger or 
of an age whe re they c annot legally pro vide inform ed consent in their 
state/country  are excluded. 
 
The following a dditional changes were made: 
 
• To upda te the  scientific /medi cal m onitor 
 
• To clarify the w indow in Part B during which assessment of pr imary and seconda ry 
clinical endpoints wi ll occur  
 
− Rationale:  Although no change  of the actual window  in w hich primary  and 
secondary  endpoint  acquisition was made , the c hange  was to c larify that t he 
window s end at di fferent times dur ing the study pe riod. 
 
• To clarify that subj ects who c ompl ete Day 150 may be eligible to enroll in a  subseque nt 
extension s tudy 
 
• To change the s creening period in P art B from 14 to 28 da ys 
 
− Rationale:  Based on fe edbac k from s tudy PIs that a longe r period f rom s creening 
to enrollm ent is requir ed if infants are  enrolled in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586916] c are unit but are  enrolled in the study c linic. 
 
• To re move thr oat swab collection 
 
− Rationale:  Based on fe edbac k that because  of hi gh sensitivity of R T-PCR f or 
diagnosis of  RSV, a thr oat swab in addi tion to no se swab is not ne cessary  and c an 
be challenging t o collect in some  preterm infants.  
 
• To clarify phrasing of the target popul ation definiti on and Exclusion Crit erion #1 
 
− Rationale:  The original  phrase “eligi ble to r eceive pal ivizumab…”  was m eant to 
indicate that any infant  who is e ligible or can acce ss pa livizumab as standa rd of 
care is excluded from the  study.  The  phras ing was  clarified indi cate this.

in hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
• To clarify language and exceptions in Exclusion C riterion #6 
 
− Rationale:  Certain labor atory abnormali ties are  expected in pr eterm infants due 
to bone grow th and phy siological or breastf eeding j aundice  and is not al ways 
conside red an unde rlying  medical disorde r. Clarification is made  to ensure  that 
the uppe r limit of normal laboratory  range s are appropriat e for pr eterm infants 
and for ne onates, if appl icable, as the se range s may be signi ficantly different to 
full term infants.  
 
• To add de tails about spa rse blood collect ion 
 
− Rationale:  To add an e xplanat ion for the  blood d rawing sche dule uti lized in this 
study to minimize  the total  numbe r of planned blood draw s requir ed during the

• To add respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV)-posit ive reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction (RT -PCR) t est result after receipt of first dose but prior to s econd dose as a 
reason f or permanent discontinuation of  study drug 
 
− Rationale:  Although thi s was alr eady in the proto col in section [IP_ADDRESS] 
unde rlying Study  Enrol lment and A ssessm ent, it should al so be  include d in t he 
section on R easons f or Study  Discontinuation. 
 
• To add a new section to detail the temp erature acquis ition method a nd add a table  of 
conve rsions for  the different modalities of t emperature measurement  
 
− Rationale:  R ectal  temperatur es are in cluded in the D AIDS severi ty score table 
and is c onside red the m ost ac curate  method.  H owever, many  sites indi cated that 
rectal  temperatur es are n ot rout inely me asured in pr eterm infants.  A c onversion 
of temperatur e using di fferent modal ities of te mperatur e measure ment is included 
to allow for s tandardized c onversi on int o an e quivalent r ectal  temperatur e.

recorde d or if unabl e to obt ain either s ystolic or dias tolic pressures, “ unable to 
obtai n” should be  recorde d. 
 
• To add de tailed instru ction for blood re draw procedures 
 
− Rationale:  Because  of challenges of obtai ning ad equate blood v olum es for 
screening bl ood tests, t he clarification is to al low for bl ood r edraw  as long as the 
total volume  is within the limits out lined by  [CONTACT_5737] o r national  guidelines on blood 
sampling l imits i n children. 
 
• To add de tailed instru ction for laboratory reference ranges for p reterm inf ants 
 
− Rationale:  Preterm reference range s for laborat ory tests may  be different from 
full term reference rang es and because  there is no standardiz ed univ ersal 
reference range s available for pret erm infants, the c larification is to prov ide 
standard guidanc e on pr eterm reference rang es using l iterature and adv ice from 
subject mat ter exp erts. 
 
• To add V ersion 2.0 of  Division of A IDS (DAIDS) (Appendix F), a DAIDS Fever 
Grading Scale (Appendix G), and to cl arify which DAIDS ve rsion s hould b e used for 
evaluation of a dverse event (AE) severity 
 
− Rationale:  T he original  DAIDS severity scale w as versi on 2004 and was used in 
the original protocol. An updated s cale was publ ished in 2014.  B ecause  there are 
some  differences in de finition of  severi ty between 2004 and 2014 versi ons, the 
origi nal 2004 v ersion is  main tained in the ame ndment with addi tions f rom the 
2014 versi on related spe cifically to pr eterm infants, suc h as total  bilirubin. 
 
• To add de tailed instru ctions for  how inf ormation and test r esults are collected if  an

Exploratory Objectives •  To collect DNA for the prospective study of the associatio n of host 
biomarkers with RSV infection and severity 
•  To summarize the effect of REGN2222  on RSV-confirmed 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, including the following: 
−  Number of days on RSV mechanical ventilation 
−  Number of days requiring supplemental oxygen 
•  To assess the impact of REGN2222  on pharmacoeconomic 
outcomes (number of medical visits for RSV infection, total number 
of medical visits, associate d medical interventions or treatments, 
number of missed days of work by [CONTACT_7071][s] or guardian[s] in 
associatio n with each medically attended RSV event). 
•  To detect and identify the presence of other common respi[INVESTIGATOR_586922]. 
 
Study  Design This is a Phase 3 study that will be conducted in 2 parts. Part A is an 
open -label, 1-cohort, multicenter PK study. Subjects in Part A may enroll 
anytime during the RSV season. Part B is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
3-arm, multicenter study. In Part B, the spons or (Regeneron 
Pharmaceuticals,  Inc.) will provide permitted windows for proph ylaxis of 
subjects in each geographical area based on historic data on the timing and 
duration of the RSV season. 
 
Part A will assess the PK of REGN2222.  
 
Subjects will be assigned open-label treatment with a single dose of 
REGN2222  30 mg/kg during the RSV season. Of the [ADDRESS_772026] 
48 hours apart; safety data through at least Day [ADDRESS_772027] 3 subjects 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_587024]’s medical monitor 
prior to subsequent dosing. The remaining 21 subjects may be dosed with no 
more than 10 subjects dosed on the same day. 
 
After obtaining informed consent from the parent(s) or legal guardian(s), 
subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Subjects 
will undergo screening within 14 days prior to baseline (Day 1). Subjects 
who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1 
baseline assessments and will receive REGN2222  30 mg/kg (maximum 
1 dose). Subjects will be monitored in the clinic for 3 hours after dosing, 
followed by [CONTACT_173484]. An emergency phone number will be provided to 
parent(s) or guardian(s) who will also be given written and verbal 
instruction s to call with any change in the subject’s status. In additio n, the 
study staff will contact [CONTACT_7071](s) or legal guardian(s) at the end of Day [ADDRESS_772028]’s status, the subject will return to 
the study site on Day [ADDRESS_772029] the 
  parent(s) or legal guardian(s) on Day 3 to inquire about any change in the

VV-RIM -00012444 -1.0 Approved - 11 Apr 2017 GMT -5:[ADDRESS_772030]’s status; this will provide at least daily contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] [ADDRESS_772031] will also need to be seen 
within 24 hours by [CONTACT_5984]. The end of study will occur 150 days after 
REGN2222  dose. 
 
Dose Selecti on for Part B: Enrollment in Part B will only start following the 
recomme ndation to do so by [CONTACT_587025] 
(IDM C), after the IDMC has reviewed at a minimum the Day [ADDRESS_772032] 18 subjects who were enrolled in Part A and received a single 
dose of REGN2222.  Regeneron will confirm the dose for Part B. The dose 
will remain the same as that in part A if the PK data up to Day 57 (from 
subjects enrolled in Part A) are consistent with the predicted  concentration s, 
after age and body weight corrections. 
 
Part B will assess the efficacy, safety, and immu nogenicity of REGN2222.  
 
Subjects (n=1515)  will be randomly assigned  in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 arms 
(REGN2222  30 mg/kg single dose [maximum 1 dose REGN2222  and 1 dose 
placebo], REGN 2222 30 mg/kg Q8 weeks [maximum 2 doses], or placebo 
[maximum 2 doses]) and stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (North America or rest of the 
world) and gestational age (≤31 weeks, 6 days GA or from 32 weeks, 0 days 
to 35 weeks, 6 days GA) in a multicenter, double-blind study. 
 
Assessment of the primary and secondary clinical endpoints will only occur 
through Day 150. If a primary endpoint is reached during the study period, 
ongoing assessments will continue until the end of the study period. Any 
subject who has had a positive RT PCR RSV nasal swab result, either at the 
study central laboratory or at an outside institution in a CLIA-certified (or 
equivalent) laboratory, should not receive a second dose of study drug. The 
risk of a second RSV infection is reduced substantially (~70%) for [ADDRESS_772033] infection and this practice is also consistent with the 2014  
American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation s for palivizumab 
(Synagis®) proph ylaxis. Subjects who have a RSV infection (positive RT- 
PCR RSV nasal swab result) will continue to be monitored for additio nal 
medically attended acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_586923]. 
 
After the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) provide informed consent, the subject 
will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Subjects will 
undergo screening within [ADDRESS_772034] 1 hour after dosing, followed by 
[CONTACT_173484], when appropr iate. 
 
The parent(s) or guardian(s) will be provided with an emergency phone 
  number and will be given written and verbal instructions to call with any

[CONTACT_7078](s) or legal guardian(s) at the end of the day and daily over [ADDRESS_772036]’s status. Any new signs or symptoms 
that have developed  in the subject since the last dose will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_587026] a need for imme diate medical attention 
and if that subject will also need to be seen within [ADDRESS_772037] dose. 
 
During the study period, data will be collected  on subjects with any acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y illness requiring medical attention. After enrollment into the 
study, subjects taken by [CONTACT_29382](s) or guardian(s) to a healthcare 
provider (inpatient or outpatient, including emergency room [ER], urgent 
care [UC], or pediatric clinic visits) for any of the following symptoms will 
be asked to contact [CONTACT_587027]: fever, cough, earache, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, vomiting after 
coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing (labored, rapid, or shallow). 
Study site personnel will evaluate the subject during an unscheduled visit 
within [ADDRESS_772038] presents for medical attention 
(which may or may not be the study site). All nose swabs will be tested using 
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for RSV, 
which will be conducted in a central laboratory. All RSV isolates will be 
subtyped. 
 
When the parent(s) or guardian(s) takes their child for medical attention for 
an acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], they will be instructed to take a Med ical 
Information Packet with them for the treating clinician. For emergency and 
other visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical records 
will be obtain ed by [CONTACT_587028]. 
 
It is recommended that site personnel contact [CONTACT_7071](s) or legal 
guardian(s) weekly between routine study visits, to obtain  information about 
medically attended acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_586924](s) or 
legal guardian(s) about the next scheduled study visit. Parent(s) or 
guardian(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_587029] s, including any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586925], during the 
intervals between study visits and to come to the study site if medical 
evaluation is needed and the urgency of the situation permits. The follow-up 
period for the occurrence of RSV-confirmed medical attention will continue 
  through Day 150. Safety, laboratory, and other clinical assessments will be

samples and will not require a separate blood draw or visit. 
 
Efficacy Procedures (Part B only): 
 
During the study period, efficacy data will be collected  by [CONTACT_587031][INVESTIGATOR_586928]-confirmed. An RSV LRTI event in an infant is defined as an 
RSV-proven respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] (ie, positive RSV RT-PCR test) with 
parent(s)/ guardian(s) report of cough or difficulty breathing, and with 1 of 
the following signs of LRTI, as assessed by a healthcare provider: lower 
chest wall indrawing, hypoxemia (peripheral capi[INVESTIGATOR_19365] 
<95% breathing room air), and/or wheezing or crackles. The RSV LRTI 
definition is used to assess the occurrence of outpatient or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586929]. Data  will be collected  on all 
medical visits for RSV and any associate d medication s, treatments, or 
procedures associated with that visit. 
 
Statistical Plan Sample Size 
 
For Part A: The goal is to confirm infant PK and therefore no formal 
sample size calculation will be conducted. A total of 24 subjects will receive 
REGN2222  in Part A as this is considered a sufficient number of subjects to 
confirm PK parameters. 
 
For Part B: A total of 1515  subjects are planned  to enroll in Part B. Subjects 
will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio (505 subjects in each arm for a 
total of 1010  assigned  to receive REGN2222  [505 subjects in each of the 
2 REGN2222  arms] and 505 subjects to receive placebo). 
 
There will be at least 90% power to detect the difference between either dose 
of REGN2222  and placebo using a chi-square test with continuity correction 
at 2-sided test alpha=0.025 for each comparison between treatment group 
and placebo assuming the following: a placebo incidence rate of the primary 
endpoint of 10% and an efficacy of REGN2222  of at least 60% in reducing 
the rate of the primary endpoint compared with placebo and 5% early 
dropout rate. 
 
Sample size may be re-estimated at the end of each RSV season. If the study 
is fully enrolled at that time, then the sample size will be re-estimated before 
database lock. Sample size re-estimation will be based on the blinded and 
pooled  event rate and hypothesized treatment effect. The hypot hesized 
treatment effect for each arm of REGN2222  will be a 60% reduction in event 
  rates compared with the placebo arm. The blinded sample size re-estimation

objective of this sample size re-estimation is to ensure that the study is 
adequately powered in case of a milder-than-expected RSV season, leading 
to low medically attended visits for RSV infection. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Primary Efficacy Analyses for Part B: The primary endpoint will be 
analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel methods to assess the differences in the 
proportions between each REGN2222  treatment and placebo, stratifying by 
[CONTACT_11338] (North America or rest of the world) and GA (≤31 weeks, 6 days GA 
or from 32 weeks, 0 days to 35 weeks, 6 days GA). 
 
Safety Analyses: Safety and tolerability will be descriptively summarized by 
[CONTACT_5268], including TEAEs, laboratory variables, vital signs, and 
physical examination. 
 
For Part B, the analysis will be conducted in [ADDRESS_772044] been 
collected  and validated; this will consist of the final analysis of all efficacy 
endpoints. The safety analyses will be performed on all safety data collected 
and validated at the time of the first step analysis. The results of the first step 
analysis will not be used to change the conduct of the ongoing study in any 
aspect. Since all the efficacy measure data collectio n will have been 
concluded at the time of this first step analysis, the significance level for the 
study remains at 2-sided 0.05. 
 
The second step analysis will be performed at the end of the study and will 
consist of the final analysis of the safety measures.

1. INTRODUC TION AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1. Introduction 
 
Glob ally, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) is the second le ading cause of mort ality in infants 
[ADDRESS_772055] 
infection (LRTI) in c hildren unde r 5 years of age  (Lapi[INVESTIGATOR_58026] 2013 ). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_586931] r ange from m ild uppe r respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (URTI) to s evere LRTI, including 
bronc hiolitis and pne umoni a. In the United S tates (US), c ompa red with i nfluenza, RSV is 
associ ated w ith a 9-fold greater risk for  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916] (Iwane 2004) a nd approx imately 9-fold 
higher mortality rate in i nfants less than 1 year of age (Thompson 2003) . Furthermore, RSV 
disease in early infancy may also pr edispose  children to r eactive airway disease in early 
childhood ( American Academy of Pedi atrics 2009 , Amb rose 2014, B lanken 2013, 
Yoshiha ra 2013) . 
 
Passive immunoproph ylaxis wi th an RSV neutralizing antibody is a safe and effective approach 
for reducing RSV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586932] s been in us e for almost 2 decade s. 
Palivizumab (c ommercially available as Synagis®), a humani zed monoclon al antibo dy, is the 
only RSV preventive agent cu rrently available. W hen given monthly for 5 mont hs during  the 
RSV season, S ynagis resulted in a 55%  reduction in RSV-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586933] w ithout chr onic lun g disease (CLD) compa red with pl acebo 
(Palivizumab 1998) . 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_3404] e fficacy and excellent safety record of  palivizumab, the m ajority of in fants at risk for 
severe RSV do not r eceive palivizumab ( Hall 2013) . Whi le palivizumab is  indicated for the 
broader population of  high- risk c hildren for the  prevention of  serious R SV lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_586934], the A merican A cademy of Pedi atrics (AAP) and other  pediatric society posit ion 
statements r ecom mends r estricting  its use to onl y infants at the  highest-risk category due to the 
high cost of palivizumab (H all 2013, Robinson 2011) . In the U S, these  highest-risk inf ants 
include  prematu re infants who a re less t han 29 w eeks gestational age (GA) and inf ants with C LD 
or congenital heart dise ase during  their first year of life  (AAPCID 2014) . However, infants who 
are at least 29 w eeks GA, including  full-term infants, are also at h igh risk f or severe RSV 
infection (Hall 2013) . This burd en of R SV infection in all  young infants ha s kept RS V vaccine 
developm ent a h igh prio rity for the p ast 50 years, a lthoug h the re is still no l icensed RSV vaccine 
available. T here remain  many challenges in t he developm ent of a  RSV vaccine f or use  in infants, 
including  an immatu re immune system ( Anderson 2013, Am erican Academy of Pedi atrics 2009) . 
 
The purpose of this stu dy is to demonstr ate the  safety, efficacy, pharmacoki netics (PK ), and 
immunog enicity of RE GN2222, a  new fully human immunog lobul in G1 ( IgG1) monoc lonal 
antibody directed against the R SV fusion g lycoprotein in i nfants born no more  than

compa red to pla cebo. T he doses studied in the FIH  study include d a 3 mg/kg intravenous ( IV) 
(maximum 1 dos e), 10 mg /kg IV (maximum 1 dos e), 30 m g/kg IV Q4 (every 4) weeks 
(maximum 2 dos es), 3 mg /kg intramuscul ar (IM) Q4 weeks ( maximum 2 d oses), and 10 m g/kg 
IM Q4  weeks (maximum 2 dos es). REG N2222 w as generally well-tolerated at all ev aluated 
doses. Th ere were no s erious a dverse events (SAEs) or dos e-limiting toxicities. The observed 
treatment-emergent immunog enicity (antidrug antibody [ADA] formation)  in 2 subje cts was 
transient a nd not assoc iated with a ny adverse events (A Es). 
 
1.2. Rationale 
 
1.2.1. Rationale for Study Design 
 
This i s a 2-part stu dy. 
 
Part A is a n ope n-label PK stu dy of RE GN2222 to det ermine  the PK in pr eterm inf ants after a 
single dose  to enable the  selection of  dosing re gimens for  Part B. It will also provide  initial 
evaluation of s afety and tolerability in infants. Because the p rimary goal of Part A is to  
determine the PK in i nfants for  REGN2222 a nd not for  efficacy, a placebo cohort a nd bl inding  of 
treatment are not r equired. At a  dose  of 30 m g/kg of RE GN2222, it i s expected th at prote ction 
will be  provided to the m ajority of infants duri ng the R SV season. 
 
Part B is a random ized, doubl e-blind, pla cebo- controlled, stu dy designed to evaluate  efficacy, 
safety, mont hly serum c oncentr ation of  REGN2222, and immunog enicity of IM administration 
of RE GN2222 in pre term inf ants who a re not eli gible, recom mended, nor  is access to 
palivizumab a vailable. U p to 1515 subjects (1010 assigned to receive RE GN2222 [ 505 subjects 
in each of the  2 arms] and 505 to r eceive p lacebo ) are planned to be e nrolled and random ized 
1:1:1 into 3 a rms. The  study design is opt imal f or evaluatin g safety, efficacy, PK, and 
immunog enicity of 2 different dosi ng regimens of  REGN2222 ( sample size is further described 
in Section 9.2) . The use of a placebo arm is j ustified because infants enrolled into the stud y 
would not r eceive l ess than standard of  care for RSV prevention be cause only infants who are 
not eli gible, recommended, nor  is access av ailable to receive p alivizumab w ill be in cluded in the  
study. 
 
1.2.2. Rationale for Dose  Selection 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part A: Pharmacokinetics and  Safety of  REGN2222 
 
The study drug REGN2222 will  be administered as a single do se of 30 m g/kg IM (Figure 1). 
This dose  has been s elected based on the s afety profile establis hed in nonc linical sa fety studi es 
and results from the FIH study (R2222 -HV-1326)  in norm al healthy adult subj ects. 
 
Nonclinical safety studie s in c ynomol gus monke ys have shown REG N2222 to be we ll tolerated a t 
IV, IM, and sub cutaneous doses up to 100 m g/kg every week with no ob served adverse effect 
level for 10 w eeks. In the  FIH study, single and m ultiple administration of  REGN2222 w ith up to  
30 m g/kg for IV dos es and 10 m g/kg for IM dos es have been well tolerated in a h ealthy 
population of a dults (132 total; 110 e xposed to REGN2222)  with no stud y drug-associ ated SAEs 
or drug-limiti ng toxicities.

VV-RIM -00012444 -1.0 Approved - 11 Apr 2017 GMT -5:00  
  
 
For the  FIH adult study, PK analyses indi cate lin ear dose  proportion al kinetics with a re lative ly 
long half-life (mean up to 36 da ys) in h ealthy adult volunt eers. It is expected that dosing 
regimens of REG N2222 at 30 m g/kg IM dosed Q8 weeks or  a 30 m g/kg IM sin gle dose  will 
maintain s erum lev els similar to the  serum lev els of RE GN2222 in c otton rat experiments that 
were associ ated w ith a 2-log (or 99 %) reduction in RS V viral titer in the  lung  for sub type A 
(5 µg/mL) and subt ype B (27 µ g/mL) for most of the  RSV season. This s erum level is attained a t 
an effective dose  (ED) to attain a 99%  reduction in l ung RSV viral titer, here after referre d to as 
ED 99. Final dose  regimens used in P art B will be  informed b ased on a dditional s afety and PK 
data from P art A of this stu dy. Alte rnative dose  regimens for Part B may be selected if the PK 
parameters of RE GN2222 obs erved in i nfants are significantly different than the one  estimated 
from adult P K data. A  dose higher than 30 m g/kg is not i ncluded in thi s study because, as 
currently formul ated, it  would re quire  more than  2 simultaneous IM in jections in som e larger 
infants. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Part B: Sa fety, E ffica cy, and Immunoge nicity of 2 Dosi ng Regimens of 
REGN2222  
 
Two dosing  regimens will be  assesse d in P art B. The planne d regimens are REGN2222 30 m g/kg 
single dose  (maximum 1 dose) and RE GN2222 30  mg/kg, Q8 w eeks (m aximum 2 dos es) 
(Figure 2). However, following  evaluation of the  PK data from inf ants studied in P art A, an 
adjustment to dose l evel may be implem ented (Appendix B). 
 
The currently propos ed dose (30 mg/kg) for Pa rt B is propos ed based on modeling  of available 
PK data from a dults to pr edict e xposure  in infants. The pre diction wi ll be r e-evaluated when 
compl ete data are available from the a dult study and ini tial data  are available from inf ants in 
Part A. If the PK parameters indic ate exposure  sign ificantly exceeds pr ediction from the model, a  
lower dose  (eg, 20 m g/kg) w ill be us ed in P art B instead of 30 m g/kg. 
 
1.3. Benef it/Risk Assessment 
 
REGN2222, a  human IgG1 monoc lonal a ntibody targeting RSV-F, is bei ng developed f or use  as 
passive immuniz ation for the  prevention of  LRTI caused by [CONTACT_587032]. REGN2222 m ay 
provide  a more  conve nient dosing  regimen (less frequent than mont hly dosing of palivizumab)  to 
justify use in the larger population of a t-risk inf ants including late preterm and full-term infants, 
who a re not el igible, recommended, nor  is access a vailable to pr ophylaxis accordi ng to local 
stand ard of  care. 
 
There are no identified risks for  REGN2222 ba sed on clinical experience to date. 
 
 
  
 
The following  list of pot ential risks c onside red was based on known r isks associ ated w ith other 
monoclona l antibodi es with a si milar mechanism  of action, pr eclinical/toxicology data, as well as 
risks a ssoci ated w ith monoclona l antibo dy therapi[INVESTIGATOR_14953] g eneral, such a s changes in s alivation, 
hypersensitivity reactions, and immunog enicity (antidrug antibody formation). T he 
treatment-emergent ad verse events (TEAEs) in t he FIH adult study described above  that w ere 
associ ated w ith the pot ential risks of c hanges in sa livation or  hypersensitivity reactions w ere

risks, a nd moni toring  and mitigation str ategies for those r isks is found in t he Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
 
In the  current infant study, appropriate exclusion criteria, close monitoring of the  subjects, and 
periodic  review of safety data will be p erformed to  minimize and mana ge the potential risks to 
the in fants. An Independent Data Monitori ng Com mittee (IDMC) is i n pla ce to fu rther suppor t 
the p rotection of  subjects.  The safety data available to d ate and safety precautions tha t will be 
taken by [CONTACT_587033] b enefit of RE GN2222 in these  infants and c ontinued

• A decision is made  by [CONTACT_216450] s top treating an indi vidual subj ect wi th stud y 
drug 
 
• A decision is made  by [CONTACT_216450] s top the study  (Section 3.2) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reason s for Temporary Discontinuation o f Study Drug 
 
For Pa rt B only: The investigator m ay tempo rarily discontinue  study drug dosing  at any time, 
even without  consultation wi th the m edical monitor, if  the u rgency of the  situation r equires 
immedi ate act ion and if t his is determined to be in the subje ct’s best interest. How ever, the 
medi cal m onitor should be  contact[CONTACT_104240] p ossible in a ny case of tempor ary or perm anent 
study drug discontinua tion. Resumpt ion of  study drug requires consultation and a greement 
between the inv estigator and the m edical monitor. 
 
5.3. Management of  Injection Site Reactions 
 
In both P art A and Part B, inj ection site react ions will be  man aged accord ing to the type of 
reaction. 
 
5.3.1. Acute Systemic Injection Reactions  
 
Acute s ystemic inject ion reactions are AEs that o ccur during the IM in jection of  study drug or 
within [ADDRESS_772084] eted. E mergency equipm ent and  medi cation for the 
treatment of these  potential AEs ( eg, antihistamines, bronc hodilators, IV saline, c orticosteroids, 
acetaminophen, and/or e pi[INVESTIGATOR_6327]) must  be available for imme diate  use. Study personnel must 
be trained to recognize and treat an aphylaxis. If generalized urticari a, wheezing, hypotension, or 
anaphylaxis occurs, dos ing should be  discontinue d immedi ately, and treatment will be  given f or 
severe symptoms as me dically indicated in an a ppropriate timeframe b ased on symptom sev erity. 
 
An acute s ystemic reaction after injection must be re ported as an AE  of special in terest (AESI) 
and graded according to the Com mon Terminology  Criteria for Ad verse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0 c riteria for grading a llergic reactions and anaphylaxis (Appendix D). Management of 
acute h ypersensitivity reactions is a ddressed in  Section 5.3.3. 
 
5.3.2. Delayed On set Reactions  
 
A delayed ons et reaction (defined as a reaction tha t occurs from 2  hours to 48 hours a fter IM 
injection), w hich is c onside red an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, must be re ported as an 
AESI (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and g raded according  to the CTCAE Ve rsion 4.0 c riteria for grading 
allergic reactions a nd anaphylaxis (Appendix D), if the A E is conside red to be a llergic in na ture. 
 
Management of  delayed hypersensitivity reactions is a ddressed in  Section 5.3.3. 
 
For delayed injection site  reactions tha t are not c onside red to be a llergic or hypersensitivity 
reactions, r efer to S ection 5.3.4.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Emergency Un blinding 
 
Unblindi ng of treatment assignment f or a subj ect may be necessary due to a m edical emergency 
and other  significant m edical event or for expedited reporti ng. 
 
If unblinding  is required at the site: 
 
• Only the inve stigator will make the d ecision to un blind the t reatment assignm ent. 
 
• Only the affected subj ect will be unblinded. 
 
• The designated stu dy pharmacist(s) (designee) at the study site will pro vide the 
treatment ass ignment to t he investi gator. If there is no s tudy pharmacist (or designee) 
available, the  invest igator for the  site will unbl ind the subje ct, using the IVRS/IWRS. 
 
• The investig ator w ill notify the spons or (designee) before unbl inding the subject, 
whenever possibl e. 
 
The treatment ass ignment is not to be pr ovided to site pe rsonne l, including the inve stigator, at 
any time du ring the conduct of the  study, except i n the case  of a true emergency. 
 
For individua l cases, serious, r elated (as assesse d by [CONTACT_587041]/or company) and unl isted 
events, pha rmacovigilance (designee) will unbl ind the treatment ass ignment  before reporti ng to 
the h ealth authorities. B ased on Section 3.3, Section 7.4, and the  IDMC c harter, the  IDMC may 
also be unblinde d as part of the  safety review.

6.3.1. Vital Sig ns 
 
Vital sig ns (in cluding temperature, blood pr essure, puls e, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]) will be  collected 
before dosi ng at time point s spe cified in t he schedule of  assessments ( Section 6.1) . On the stud y 
drug dosing days, vital s igns will be a ssessed p rior to colle ction of  blood s ample, prior  to 
injection of  study drug, and after compl etion of  the inje ction (Pa rt A a t 1, 2 , and 3 hour s 
[±10 m inutes] after completion of the  injection and Part B at 1 hour [ ±10 minutes]  after 
compl etion of  the inje ction). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Temperature  
 
Dosing  may only proceed if the  subj ect is afebrile (rectal temperature <101°F (38.3°C) w ithout 
the use  of antipyretics in the p receeding [ADDRESS_772127]'s rectal temperature is ≥101°F 
(38.3°C) on a  dose administration day then no do sing will occur  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] f or 
temp erature conve rsions ). The  subj ect wi ll be th en be re-evaluated with in 48 hour s; if the 
subject's tem perature is ≤101°F  (38.3°C) w ithout t he use of antipyretics dur ing the p revious [ADDRESS_772128]'s temp erature 
is still ≥101°F  (38.3°C) or  the subj ect has r eceived antipyretics in t he previous [ADDRESS_772129] 1 dose  of stu dy drug was administered.

Primary and second ary endpoint s are listed in  Section 8.2 a nd Section 8.3, r espectively. 
Results from P art A and Part B of this stu dy will be  analyzed separately. 
 
9.1. Statistical Hypothesis 
 
The null hypothesis of t he study is that the proportions  of m edically attended RSV 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586987] t he REGN2222 g roups  are the 
same (H 0: p1 = p2). The alternative hypothesis i s that the  rate for each RE GN2222 g roup is 
different from the rate for the placebo group ( H1: p1 ≠ p2). 
 
9.2. Sample Size  
 
For Pa rt A, the  goal of t he study is to study infant PK, and the refore no formal s ample size 
calcul ation will  be condu cted. 
 
For Pa rt B, the s ample size estimation i s based on the pr imary efficacy endpoint  of m edically 
attended RSV infection (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586988]). Literature (Hall 2009, 
Amb rose 2014) show  that the event rate in th is endpoint  is in the ra nge of 12% to 22% in the 
studi ed infant popul ations. As the e vent rate may vary over RSV season or  geographic region, it 
is assum ed that e vent rate is 10%  for the pl acebo group,  and either dose of RENG2222 w ould 
reduce the event rate from placebo b y 60% (event rate of 4%). Wi th 505 ra ndom ized subj ects per 
arm or a  total of 1515 randomized subj ects, t he study has 90% pow er to d emonstr ate a 60%  or 
greater reduction at 2-sided si gnificance level α=0.025. This s ample size also incorpora ted a 
5% early dropout r ate. The sample size calculation is ba sed chi-square test with continui ty 
correction and pe rformed using  nQuery version 7. 0 (St atistical S olutions L td, Cork, Ireland). 
 
The significant level of 2 -sided 0.025 is set in c onside ration of  multiplicity of 2 compa risons 
between each o f the 2 REGN2222 dose  arms with p lacebo. 
 
With a total of 1515 ra ndom ized subj ects and 1:1:1 random ization ratio, it is expected

9.2.1. Blinded Sample Size Re-estimation  
 
Sample size may be re-estimated at the end of  each RSV season. If the study is ful ly enroll ed at 
that ti me, th en the s ample size will be re-estimated before database lock. Sample si ze 
re-estimation wil l be b ased on the blinded a nd po oled e vent rate and hypothesized treatment 
effect. The  hypothesi zed treatment effect for each arm of RE GN2222 w ill be a 60%  reduction in 
event rates compa red with t he placebo arm. A s stated b y Gould and Shih (Gould 1998) , the 
blinded sample size re-estimation does not a ffect t ype I error mat erially for binom ially 
distribut ed data. The objective of this s ample size re-estimation i s to ensur e the stu dy will be 
adequately powered in case of a milder-than-expected R SV season, l eading to low m edically 
attended vis its for R SV infection. Sample size re-estimation wil l be done  using  the formula  from 
Gould ( Gould 1992) . If the re-estimated sample size is less than [ADDRESS_772148] anned sample size (the 
study will ha ve approximately 86% or mo re power with p laned sample size). If the re-estimated

America or rest of the  world)  and GA  (≤31 weeks, 6 da ys GA or from 32 w eeks, 0 da ys to 
35 w eeks, 6 da ys GA). 
 
The proportion of pr imary endpoint  events for  primary analysis will be  calculated as numbe r of 
subjects wi th a medi cally attended RSV infection (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_586989] V LRTI) 
during  the [ADDRESS_772151] who dis continued stud y treatment early (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) , the subj ect wi ll be 
follow ed to D ay 150 f or assessment of  prim ary endpoint  events. The e vent observed after the 
early termination of  study treatment wi ll be c ounted as an event and w ill be include d in t he 
prim ary analysis. 
 
For early termination sub jects (ie, those  who did n ot complete  Day 150 visi t), the  prim ary 
endpoint  will be  handled accordi ng to the following  rules in t he primary analysis: 
 
• Early termination subj ects who ha d a prim ary endpoint  event during  the 1 50-day efficacy 
assessment p eriod ( regardless of  treatment status, ie, w hether the subj ect received a ll 
study drug doses or discontinued dosing ) will be u sed in t he prim ary analysis and

include d as “ev ent oc curred”. 
 
o Remaining  early termination subje cts (including  non-RSV deaths) a cross a ll 
treatment groups, w ill be imputed to the a verage placebo s core (estimated placebo 
event rate). The approa ch to estimating  the pl acebo event rate is the  Kaplan-Meier 
estimate  at Day 150. 
 
• Imput ed scores along with obs erved subj ect data will be  utilized in the Co chran-Mantel- 
Haenszel analysis. Imput ed scores along with obs erved subj ect data  will be  utilized in t he 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) a nalysis (with stratum adjusted by [CONTACT_535519]-Haenszel

document ation of  approv al must be pr ovided to the sponsor  before study drug will be  shippe d to 
the stu dy site. 
 
It is the respons ibility of the inve stigator (designee; if acceptable  by [CONTACT_427]) to obtain 
written in formed consent from e ach subj ect's parent(s) or l egal guardian(s) prior  to the subj ect’s 
participation i n the stud y and after the aims, meth ods, objectives, and potent ial hazards of  the 
study have been explain ed to full est pos sible extent in lan guage that the p arent(s) or l egal 
guardian(s) can und erstand. The  ICF will be  signed and da ted b y the subj ect’s p arent(s) o r legal 
guardian(s) a nd the s ame investi gator (designee) who e xplain ed the  ICF. 
 
Local law must be  observed in de ciding whether the consent of 1 o r both parent(s) o r legal 
guardian(s) is required. If only [ADDRESS_772162]’s parent(s) o r legal

If the subj ect’s p arent(s) or legal guardian(s) c an write but c annot r ead, the  assent f orm w ill be 
read to t hem before writing  their name [CONTACT_71966]. If the subj ect’s p arent(s) or l egal guardian(s) 
can unde rstand but c an neither write nor read, the  ICF will be  read to t hem in the pre sence of an 
impartial witness, who will  sign and da te the  ICF to confirm that informed consent was given.  
 
The original ICF must  be retained by [CONTACT_587076]'s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must  be given to the subj ect’s p arent(s) o r legal guardian(s). 
 
If new safety information results in s ignificant c hanges in t he risk/bene fit assessment, the ICF 
must  be reviewed and up dated a ppropri ately. All parent(s) o r legal guardian(s) of stu dy subjects 
must  be informed of  the new information and pr ovide the ir written c onsent if they wish the 
subject to continue in the stud y. The  original s igned revised  ICF must  be maintained in the 
subject’s stu dy record and a copy must  be given t o the subj ect’s p arent(s) or legal guardian(s). 
 
13.3. Subject Confidentiality and Data Protection

1. DAIDS AE Grading Table Version 2.0, November 2014,  page 30. 
2. Severity grading for total bilirubin in neonates is complex because of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_587015]. Severity grading in this appendix corres ponds approx imately to cut-offs for phototherapy at grade 3 and for 
exchange transfusion at grade 4. 
3. A laboratory value of 1 mg/dL is equivalent to 17.1 μmol/L. 
4. Definitions: Term is defined as ≥37 weeks gestational age; near-term, as ≥35 weeks gestational age; preterm, as 
<35 weeks gestational age; and neonate, as 0 to 28 days of age.

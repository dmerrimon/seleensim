Number:  VA L -181388 -P101  
Title:  A Phase 1, Randomized, Placebo- Controlled, Dose -Ranging Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of V AL -181388 in Healthy 
Adults in a Non -endemic Chikungunya Region  
Study Phase:  1 
Study Site:  One site in the [LOCATION_002]  
Objectives:  Primary:  
• To assess the safety of VAL -181388 relative to placebo. 
Secondary:  
• To determine the immunogenicity of 3 dose levels o f  VA L -181388 
to inform the choice  of dose for further development of this vaccine. 
Immunogenicity assessment will be based on cha nges from baseline 
in the following: 
o Serum neutralizing antibody titers  to chikungunya virus 
(CHIKV)  
o Serum binding antibody titers to CHIKV- specific proteins 
Exploratory: 
• To assess the cross -reactivity of serum antibodies to related viruses, 
including alphaviruses and  flaviviruses 
• To explore other  assays to characterize the immune response to  
CHIKV 
Study Design 
and 
Methodology: This is a Phase 1, first -in-human, randomized, observer -blind ed, 
placebo -controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and 
immunogenicity of  3 dose levels of  VA L -181388 in healthy adult 
subjects (18 to 49 years  of age, inclusive ). VA L -181388 is a messenger 
RNA ( mRNA)- based vaccine being developed  for prevention of disease 
associated with CHIKV infection . 
Chikungunya virus is a positive -sense, single -stranded  RNA virus, of the 
alphavirus family, in the genus of the togavirus family. It can cause 
disease in humans and other mammals. It is an arbovir us that is 
transmitted by  a mosquito vector ( Aedes spp). Currently there is no 
approved vaccine to protect against this disease, which has recently 
spread through tropi[INVESTIGATOR_190566]. 
This is a 2-part study, with Part A including  dose escalation and safety 
and immune testing through 28 days following the final vaccination. 
Once subjects complete Part A they will transition  to Part B. Part B is a 
conti nued safety follow -up through 12 months  and an assessment of 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 9 immunogenicity and immune persistence  at approximately 6 and 
12 months after final vaccination.  
Part A  
In Part A,  sequential dose escalation o f  VA L -181388 is planned in 3 dose 
level cohorts ( 25, 50, and 100 µg ) with each subject receiving 
2 vaccinations separated by 28 days . Subjects will be r andom ly assigned  
to receive either V AL -181388 or placebo.  
For each cohort, a sentinel safety group of 4 subjects will be enrolled 
who will be random ly assigned  to VA L -181388 or placebo (3:1) and 
followed for [ADDRESS_607949] vaccination  with review of 
reactogenicity and safety laboratory results prior to randomizing the 
remainder of the cohort. An internal safety team (IST) will oversee the 
safety of the trial and will review blinded safety data during Part A of the study to ensure adherence to the protocol, monitor safety laboratory test results and reactogenicity, and raise concerns to the Safety Monitoring 
Committee (SMC) should there be safety issues or operational 
challenges that could affect subject safety. Only after review by [CONTACT_474474] (reactogenicity, safety lab oratory result s, and 
adverse events [ AEs]) through [ADDRESS_607950] vaccination of the 
sentinel safety lead -in for each cohort planned, will approval be given to 
allow randomization of the remainder of that cohort. The SMC will 
approve escalation to the next higher dosing cohort after review of 
blinded safety data of the currently dosed cohort through 7 days 
following the second vaccination and any cumulative safety data of all cohorts as the trial advances. The SMC will also be convened (ad  hoc 
meeting) if a pause rule is triggered.  
Dose Level Cohort Assignments : VA L -181388 (or placebo)  
administered IM at Visit 1 and a second dose adminis tered 28 days later  
(Visit 4). 
Cohort 1 ( N = 20): 25 µ g  VA L -181388 or placebo (ratio = 3:1) 
Cohort 2 ( N = 20): 50 µ g  VA L -181388 or placebo (ratio = 3:1) 
Cohort 3 ( N = 20): 100 µ g VA L -181388 or placebo (ratio = 3:1)

Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 10 VA L -181388 (or placebo) will be administered as an intramuscular (IM) 
injection (0.5 mL) into the deltoid muscle , preferably in the 
non-dominant arm, as a 2-dose schedule; the first dose will be given at 
Visit [ADDRESS_607951] of the study. The remainder of t he site staff 
and all subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment.  
Consent and S creening will occur over a 28-day period prior to 
randomization. A total of 20 subjects will be randomly assigned to each 
dose level cohort, 4 subjects (3 VAL -181388 and 1 placebo) to the 
sentinel safety group and 16 subjects (12 V AL -181388 and 4 placebo) to 
the expansion group, resulting in 15 subjects being randomly assigned to VA L -181388 and 5 
subjects being randomly assigned to placebo 
(3:1 ratio overall). Subjects meeting all eligibility  criteria will receive the 
first vaccination at  Visit 1. Each subject will be monitored in the clinic 
for at least [ADDRESS_607952] 
a systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate , or respi[INVESTIGATOR_474442] 2 or higher  toxicity  after 2 measurements 
(even after relaxing or resting) ; has an acute illness ; or has an oral 
temperature >38°C , the subject should not receive a  vaccination on that 
day and will need to return on subsequent days for their vaccination. 
All subjects will return to the clinic at 7  (+3), 17 (±3), and 28 (+7) days 
following each vaccination. In addition, the  sentinel safety group will 
return to the clinic at 1 , 2, and 21 (+3)  days following the first 
vaccination. A second vaccination will occur [ADDRESS_607953] 
vaccination (+7  days).  
Subjects will be instructed on recording solicited (local and systemic 
reactogenicity  events ) and unsolicited AEs, temperature,  and 
medications (prescription or over -the- counter) on their memory aid 
(ie, diary  card). Subjects will also be asked to call/ret urn to the clinic 
within [ADDRESS_607954] 7  days 
following each vaccination to answer any questions and ensure that the memory aid is being completed correctly  and consistently.  
Safety assessments will include toxicity grading of solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity  events ) and unsolicited AEs
, vital sign 
measurements, physical examination findings, and clinical laboratory 
test results  for hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis. 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 11 All unsolicited AEs will be collected and additional specific categories 
will include serious adver se events (SAEs); AEs of special interest 
(AESIs) ; and medically attended AEs . Subjects will self -report (using a 
memory aid) solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity events) and 
unsolicited AEs  and medication usage (over -the- counter and 
prescription) through [ADDRESS_607955] to ensure consistency. 
Safety laboratory tests will be performed at Screening, on vaccination 
days (before dosing ), and at 7 (+3) days after each vaccination. At  
17 (±3) days f ollowing each vaccination and at  28 (+7) days after the 
second vaccination , safety laboratory tests will be performed for 
coagulation and liver function tests only . The sentinel safety group will 
also have coagulation and liver function tests collected at 21 (+3) days 
after the fi rst vaccination . Additional safety laboratory tests may be 
conducted at any time by [CONTACT_474475].  
Blood samples for immunogenicity will be collected on dosing days 
(pre-dose) and at 28 (+7 ) days after the final vaccination.  
Subjects unable to complete their second vaccination due to 
noncompliance with the visit schedule and not due to a cohort pause will 
still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule. 
Specifically, these subjects will be asked to undergo blood collection to 
comply with a second immune test at 56 (+10) days (Visit 7) following 
the first vaccination.  
To allow cohort advancement, the following data from the highest dosed cohort are expected to be reviewed by [CONTACT_4484]: 1)  toxicity scoring of 
safety laboratory test results through 7 
days following the second 
vaccination (through Visit  5); 2) toxicity scoring of vital signs and 
reactogenicity through [ADDRESS_607956] and second vaccination (through Visit  5); 3)  all unsolicited AEs (with g rading and attribution). 
Data will be prepared by [CONTACT_474476]. As safety data on all cohorts accumulate, the SMC also 
review ongoing AEs as well as cumulative safety laboratory test results, reactogenicity, and AEs across vaccine doses for subjects remaining in Part 
A of the study, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a cumulative and comprehensive 
review of safety. Should a cohort pause occur due to pre -specified 
criteria, the SMC will be convened for an unscheduled (ad hoc) meeting and be provided with specific safety data related to the trigger of the 
pause.

 Part B  
To monitor for longer- term safety and immune persistence, each subject 
will be entered into a continued blinded follow -up period (Part  B). This 
period will be conducted such that subjects and safety monitors will 
remain blinded to treatment assignment. Par t B of the study is initiated 
for a subject once they have returned for Visit  7 (28 days following the 
second vaccination).  
Once entered into Part  B, each safety contact [CONTACT_474477]

Study Drug, 
Dosage, and 
Route of Administration  25, 50, or 100  µg VAL -181388 or placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP) will be prepared as outlined in the pharmacy manual and 
administered via IM injection (0.5 mL) into the deltoid muscle on 
designated vaccination days, preferably in the non-dominant arm. 
Samp le Size:  Approximately 60 subjects are planned to be randomized, 20 per dose 
level . Formal sample size calculations were not performed  as this is an 
observational safety and immunogenicity study with no formal null 
hypotheses being tested.  
Statistical Methods:  Safety : Data for subjects receiving placebo will be pooled across all dose 
levels for all presentations . Reactogenicity will be summarized by [CONTACT_5264] s (25, 50, or 100 µg or placebo), vaccination (first or second), 
duration, relationship to study vaccine, and severity. Adverse events will 
be coded by [CONTACT_474482], treatment, 
vaccination (first or second), and overall. Adverse events will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_474483]. Descriptive statistics will be presented and the difference in the proportion of AEs 
will be provided comparing each dose level with placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_474445] . Adverse events for s ubjects in the safety 
cohort for each dose level will be provided in a separate subject listing. Adverse events leading to withdrawal, AESIs, medically attended AEs, 
and SAEs will be provided by [CONTACT_474484] a listing.  
Safety data f rom clinical laboratory test results  and vital sign 
measurements will be graded by [CONTACT_474485] (first or second). Absolute and change from 
baseline values will be provided according to the toxicity table, along with mean, median, and standard deviation. Results of hematology, 
serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis assessments; 
urine drug 
screen ; and pregnancy testing will be listed for all subjects randomly 
assigned to receive study treatment.

Baseline demographic and background variables will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_474486]. The number of subjects who enr
oll in the study and the number and percentage of subjects who 
complete the study will be presented. Frequency and percentage of 
subjects who withdraw or discontinue from the study, and the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation, will also be summarized.  
Prior and concomitant medication will be listed (with start and stop 
dates) for each subject and summarized by [CONTACT_474487]. Any vaccinations that occur during the trial conduct will also be captured and summarized . 
Immunogenicity : The following immunogenicity outcome measures 
(for serum  neutralizing antibody titers and serum  binding antibody titers 
to CHIKV -specific proteins) and their 95%  confidence intervals, where 
appropriate, will be summarized by [CONTACT_474488], and by [CONTACT_474489]- vaccination : 
• Geometric mean titer (GMT) at baseline (pre -vaccination  at Visit 1) 
and at  post-dose time points   
• Geometric mean ratio Post/Pre : the ratio of post -vaccination GMT to 
pre-vaccination ( Visit 1) GMT of subjects who have a baseline 
sample and post-vaccination results at post-dose time points   
• Seroresponse : The proportion of subjects in each treatment group 
who either had an undetectable titer at baseline and detectable titer after vaccination, or detectable titer at baseline and at least a 4 -fold 
increase (of baseline titer) after vaccination will be calculated.   
Following completion of each dose level cohort in Part A, the database 
will be locked for that cohort and safety and/or immune testing results

1.1 Background  
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito -borne alphavirus posing a significant public health 
problem in tropi[INVESTIGATOR_151394] . While chikungunya has been present in Africa for 
centuries, it has recently caused outbreaks and epi[INVESTIGATOR_474446]. A chikungunya epi[INVESTIGATOR_474447] 2004 in 
Kenya, which spread  to the Indian Ocean islands and to India, and was exported to nearly all 
regions of the world via infected travelers, resulted in millions of infected individuals and 
brought chikungunya to the attention of the western world. As of April 2016, chikungunya  
cases had been reported in 103 countries and territories around the world, including 
46 countries and territories throughout the Americas  (Center s for Disease Control and 
Prevention 2016). There are an estimated 3 million cases of chikungunya globally. 
Chikungunya virus infection causes chikungunya, characterized by [CONTACT_474490], 
rash, myalgia, and debilitating polyarthralgia ( Schwartz and Albert 2010; Weaver et al 2012 ), 
from which it derives its name [CONTACT_474543] “that which bends up” when tran slated from 
Makonde (language spoken by [CONTACT_474491]) ( Halstead  2015). It is rarely fatal, but neurological sequelae such as 
Guillain -Barre syndrome and chronic arthritides have been increasingly recognized. 
Since its identification in 1952 ( Robinson 1955), CHIKV isolates from around the world have 
been grouped into three broad genotypes which correspond to geographic origin: (1)  Asian, 
(2) West African, and (3) East Central South African (ECSA) ( Weaver et al  2012). Isolates 
from the Indian Ocean region since 2000 are closely related to the ECSA lineage, and many 
harbor mutations that augment replication and transmission in Aedes albopi[INVESTIGATOR_474448] 
(Tsetsarkin et al 2011 ; Weaver et al 2012 ). The Aedes aegypti  mosquito is the classical vector 
for CHIKV and is widely distributed across equatorial countries, and the jump to Aedes albopi[INVESTIGATOR_474449], as this 
species is found in these more temperate climates and is considered a strong viral vector for 
spread of disease ( Weaver and Lecuit 2015).  
Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus of t he Togaviridae  family with a positive -strand RNA 
genome of 11.8 kilobases. Like other alphaviruses, the genome is capped and polyadenylated, 
and encodes 2 open reading frames (ORFs). The 5´ ORF (2/3 of the genome) encodes 4

Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 24 nonstructural proteins required for viral replication and the 3 ´ ORF encodes the structural 
proteins. The structural proteins are expressed as a single polyprotein from a subgenomic 
promoter and are cleaved by [CONTACT_474492] (C) and envelope glycoproteins E3, E2, 6K, and E1 ( Figure  1-1) ( Kuhn 2007). The mature chikungunya virion 
is 70 nm in diameter and contains 240 heterodimers of E1/E2 arranged as 80 trimer ic spi[INVESTIGATOR_474450] ( Figure  1-2) (Strauss JH and Strauss EG 1994; Zhang et al 201 1). The E1 protein 
serves as the fusion protein and the E2 as the attachment protein.

Although the detailed mechanism of protection against CHIKV infection in humans is not 
completely understood, it is clear that neutralizing antibodies play an important role ( Couderc 
et al 2009). Natural CHIKV infection of humans induces high neutralizing antibody titers 
(Lanciotti et al 2007) and immunoglobulin G  (IgG)  levels correlate with viral clearance and 
protection ( Kam et al 2012a , Kam et al 2012b ). Human CHIKV -specific neutralizing 
monoclonal antibodies have also been isolated and shown to protect animals from experimental CHIKV infection ( Smith et al 2015). The majority of these monoclonals recognize the 
E2 protein and are able to cross -neutralize CHIKV from all genotypes, including currently 
circulating ECSA strains ( Smith et al 201 5). Passive immunotherapy of convalescent sera has 
also been shown to protect animals from CHIKV infection ( Partidos et  al 2011 ).

1.[ADDRESS_607986] few weeks of lif e, but 
adult wild -type mice are resistant ( Couderc et al 2008), which makes testing of prophylactic 
vaccines challenging. Adult inbred mice with a partial or complete defect in the interferon 
(IFN) pathway are widely used as animal models for CHIKV research. Inoculation of these 
strains with CHIKV results in high levels of viremia and nearly systemic virus dissemination 
to other tissues, with high viral loads ( Couderc et al 2008; Partidos et al 2011 ; Gardner et al 
2012; Plante et al 2015 ). After initial replication in the liver of sensitive mice, the virus 
primarily targets muscle, joint, and skin fibroblasts, and viral RNA has been shown to persist in joint -associated tissue for months ( Couderc et al 2008;  Hawman et al 2013 ). These findings 
are relevant to human disease, as similar tissue and cell tropi[INVESTIGATOR_474451] -infected patients ( Couderc et  al 2008), although detailed, comprehensive human 
biopsy evaluations have not been performed. Mice with severe disease also develop a central nervous system infection ( Couderc et  al 2008), as do some humans. One particularly sensitive 
animal model is the AG129 mouse, which has null mutations in the IFN -α/-β and - γ receptors 
(van der Broek et al 1995 ). Inoculation of AG129 mice with 1 × 10
4 plaque- form ing units of 
attenuated CHIKV vaccine strain 181/25 via the intradermal ( ID) route results in rapid onset 
of clinical signs of disease, including ruffled fur and hunched posture, followed by [CONTACT_279358] 3 to 4 days ( Partidos et al 2011). Although these mi ce are deficient in IFN signaling, they are 
able to mount B - and T -cell responses. Neutralizing antibodies are believed to be the primary 
effectors of protection against CHIKV , and indeed immune serum can afford protection in this model ( Partidos et al 2011). A number of CHIKV candidate vaccines have been evaluated in 
AG129 and related mouse models carrying a deficiency in only IFN -α/-β receptor signaling 
(A129) and have been shown to elicit neutralizing antibodies that protect from a lethal CHIKV challenge ( Partidos et al 2011; Plante et al 2011 ; Brandler  et al 2013; Metz et al 2013 ). Some 
of these candidate vaccines have also demonstrated efficacy in nonhuman primate challenge 
models ( Akahata et al 2010 ; Roy et al 2014 ) and have induced neutralizing antibody responses 
in humans ( Edelman et al 2000 ; Chang et al 2014 ; Ramsauer et al  2015 ). Based on these 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 27 findings, the AG129 mouse is considered an appropriate model for efficacy evaluation of 
CHIKV vaccines.  
The efficacy of the CHIKV C -E3-E2-6k-E1 mRNA vaccine and E2 and E1 mRNA vaccines 
(mRNA encodes envelope glycoproteins E2 or E1, respectively) given in various combinations 
of route of administration (ID or intramuscular [ IM]), number of vaccinations (1 or 2), and 
dose (2 µg or 10 µg) was determined in fem ale AG129 mice (lacking the IFN -α/β 
and -γ receptors). The C -E3-E2-6k-E1 mRNA vaccine provided full protection against the 
attenuated CHIKV strain 181/clone 25 (181/25) infection regardless of the route of administration, number of vaccinations, or dose. Two vaccinations of the E2 mRNA vaccine 
were also efficacious with either route of administration or dose, but a single vaccination was 
not effective with any combination of route of administration and dose. The E1 mRNA vaccine was only efficacious after 2 vaccinations of 10 μ g mRNA.  
Neutralizing antibody titers were measured in female 129S6 mice that received either 2  µg or 
10 µg of the CHIKV C -E3-E2-6k-E1 mRNA vaccine administered via the IM route either once 
or twice. Higher CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers were observed with higher vaccine dose levels and with greater number of vaccinations. The resulting CHIKV -specific antibodies 
neutralized all 3 CHIKV strains tested ([ZIP_CODE], LaReunion, and Centers for Disease Control Caribbean), representing all major  CHIKV lineages. 
The efficacy of lower doses of V AL -[ADDRESS_607987] a lethal challenge of CHIKV 181/25 was 
studied in female AG129 mice that were vaccinated via the IM route in various combinations 
of number of vaccinations (1 or 2) and dose (0.4 µg, 2  µg, or 10 µg). Following a lethal 
challenge with CHIKV 181/25 at either Day  56 or Day  112, IM vaccination with V AL -181388 
provided full protection for mice that received 2 μg or 10 μg VA L -181388, while mice that 
received 0.4 µg V AL -181388 had survival rates si milar to those in mice that received the 
negative control phosphate- buffered saline (ie, all mice were deceased by [CONTACT_2006]  5 after CHIKV 
challenge). Serum samples were tested for reactivity in an enzyme- linked immunosorbent 
assay for mouse IgG against CHIKV structural glycoproteins E1 and E2 and CHIKV lysate. 
For the Day  56 serum samples, antibody titers were both dose - and schedule- dependent, with 
higher titers in mice vaccinated twice compared to those vaccinated once. For Day  112 serum 
samples, antibody tite rs were increased in mice that received either 2  µg or 10 µ g VA L -181388. 
Chikungunya virus neutralizing antibody titers were also measured in Day  56 and Day  112 
serum samples. VAL -181388 induced high titers of CHIKV -specific neutralizing antibodies for

Caribbean ) at Day  56 and for CHIKV strain [ZIP_CODE] at Day  112 (the only strain tested at 
Day 112), and the neutralizing antibody response was both dose - and schedule-dependent , with 
the highest titer observed in mice vaccinated with two [ADDRESS_607988] a lethal challenge of CHIKV  181/25 was 
demonstrated in female AG129 mice. Mice were vaccinated via the IM route twice (prime and

In support of V AL -181388, the immunogenicity of similar mRNA -based influenza vaccines 
VA L -339851 (encoding hemagglutinin [HA] from the H7N9 influenza strain) and 
VAL-506440 (encoding HA from the H10N8 influenza strain) was assessed in cynomolgus 
monkeys to provide immunogenicity data in a larger animal species. Both vaccines utilize the same lipid nanoparticle ( LNP ) composition as V AL -181388 but contain different mR NA 
sequences. Vaccinations were given in various combinations of route of administration (ID or 
IM), number of vaccinations (1 or 2), and dose (0.2 mg or 0.4 mg). Anti -HA antibodies for 
VA L -[ADDRESS_607990] H7 and H10  in cynomolgus monkeys, and ID administration was as 
effective as IM administration.  
1.2.2 Distribution  
Pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism studies are not normally performed for vaccines. 
However, because VAL -181388 is composed of an mRNA complexed with an LNP matrix, the 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 29 Sponsor has completed a distribution study with the similar mRNA -based influenza vaccine, 
VA L -506440 (encoding HA antigen from the H10N8 influenza strain), to assess the tissue 
distribution and persistence of the mRNA component. 
VA L -181388 consists of an mRNA Drug Substance (CX -000314) coding for the structural 
polyprotein (capsid and envelope glycoproteins E3, E2, 6k, and E1) of CHIKV combined with 
LNP components. Ultimately, the distribution of the mRNA is driven by [CONTACT_474493]. Thus, using the same matrix, with the same route of administration, distribution is anticipated to be identical for any comparably sized mRNAs. Unlike DNA, mRNA has a finite lifetime within cells (measured in hours), does not  replicate or integrate, 
and is not anticipated to persist long -term following IM delivery. Hence, a single dose 
pharmacokinetic biodistribution study was performed in male mice with the similar 
mRNA- based influenza vaccine, V AL -506440, which uses the same  LNP composition as 
VA L -181388. 
Following a single IM dose in male mice, the peak plasma concentration of V AL -[ADDRESS_607991] quantifiable concentration was observed for V AL -506440 
were 5470 pg/mL and 35,500 pg•h/mL, respectively.  
VA L -506440 was broadly distributed into all analyzed tissues at 2 hours after dosing (bone 
marrow, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph nodes [proximal and distal], gastrointestinal tract, stomach, spleen, testes , and the injection site), but with varying concentrations. When 
estimable, the half -life was variable among the tissues and ranged from 3.[ADDRESS_607992] been performed. 
1.2.3 Toxicology  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Single -Dose Toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity s tudies were performed with V AL -181388. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repeat -Dose Toxicity  
The Sponsor has completed a repeat -dose IM toxicology study with V AL -[ADDRESS_607993] examined the mutagenic potential of the novel lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_474452]2000- DMG and MC3, 
and an in vivo genetic bone marrow mutagenicity study has been performed with the similar 
mRNA- based influenza vaccine, V AL -506440, in support of V AL -181388. Results of these 
supportive studies are contained in the IB .  
The rat was chosen as the nonclinical species for the toxicity studies as it is an accepted species by [CONTACT_474494]- operation and Development, the European Medicines 
Agency, and the US Food and Drug A dministration  (FDA)  for the development of vaccines, 
and is a species with which the testing laboratories have ex tensive experience. The Sprague 
Dawley rat is considered a relevant species for safety evaluation with respect to desired and potential exagger ated immunological responses induced by [CONTACT_474495] -based 
vaccines.  
Toxicological evaluation of the novel excipi[INVESTIGATOR_474453] (namely MC3 and PEG2000- DMG) requires the selection of species that reliably predict the occurrence of 
compleme nt activation. Complement activation is observed after intravenous ( IV) 
administration of a variety of compounds including liposomal drugs, contrast agents, pegylated proteins, and antibodies ( Szebeni 2014). The complement cascade is relatively conserved 
across species, and therefore the rat is likely to be sensitive to potential complement activation 
following administration of the LNP matrix. However, systemic complement activation is 
unlikely to be relevant for a product that is administered via the IM r oute where minimal 
systemic exposure is expected.

Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 31 In a repeat -dose study in rats, V AL -181388 was administered via IM injection  to groups of 
male and female Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 10, 40, or 160 μg/rat on Days 1, 22, and 43. 
Overall, V AL -181388 was clinically well tolerated up to 40 µg/dose, with more pronounced 
injection site reactions and s ystemic inflammatory responses observed at the 160 µg/dose. No 
mortality occurred during the course of the study. 
There were no V AL -181388- related changes in food consumption or ophthalmology. Lower 
body weight gain was observed during dosing weeks while the gain was higher during the 
off-dose weeks resulting in no effect on the overall body weight. V AL-181388- related clinical 
signs were observed at the injection site/area and were noted at all dose levels. Hematologic 
and clinical chemistry changes were consistent with administration of an immunostimulatory 
vaccine.  
Intramuscular dosing with V AL -[ADDRESS_607994] to the specific immune response t o the vaccine, 
significant dose -dependent anti -CHIKV antibody responses were noted at all dose levels. 
Responses were higher on Day  71 when compared with Day  44 results for animals dosed at 
greater than or equal to the 40 μg/dose. 
The majority of macroscopic  and microscopic findings observed were at or adjacent to the 
primary injection sites (subcutaneous inflammation, muscle fiber degeneration/necrosis) with 
other changes attributed (spleen, thymus, bone marrow, adrenal glands) to test item -induced 
stress or compensatory changes in both microscopic and clinical pathology. 
Most of the c hanges were either totally or partially resolved following a 4 -week recovery 
period. However, increases in prothrombin time for females at the 160 μg/dose correlating with 
partial recovery of microscopic findings seen at the injection sites, inguinal and popliteal 
lymph nodes, and/or sciatic nerve were observed. 
Based on these findings, the Sponsor has determined the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) to be 40 μg/dose for the IM route of administration in male and female rats.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_607995] or in a mammalian cell mutation study with human peripheral blood lymphocytes. 
In the mouse micronucleus in vivo mutation assay, V AL -506440 produced some toxicity and 
mortality in mice following IV dosing at doses ranging from 1.5 to 10 mg/kg. It must be noted 
that this test is designed to use a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) level via the systemic IV 
route, and these higher doses were also associated with significant bone marrow toxicity. Based 
on the known properties of the lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], these findings are likely attributable to a complement 
activation -related pseudoallergy ( CARPA ) response ( Szebeni 2014) specific to IV systemic 
administration of LNPs such as those in both V AL -181388 and V AL -506440. The doses of 
VA L -506440 used in this in vivo genetic toxicology study represented the MTD levels , were 
several fold greater than the 10-μg doses typi[INVESTIGATOR_474454] , and are 
therefore anticipated to represent significantly greater systemic/plasma exposure than is 
expected via IM administration at the doses used in the Phase [ADDRESS_607996] far exceeded the limit of to lerance in this 
assay. No substantial increases in the incidence of micronucleated immature erythrocytes , or 
substantial decreases in the proportion of immature erythrocytes, were observed at any of the other VA L -506440 doses in males, nor in the females t ested at the MTD of 1 mg/kg. Hence, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_474455], V AL -506440 was considered 
equivocal for the induction of chromosome damage in mouse immature erythrocytes. Given that the Sponsor ’s vaccines consist of mR NA complexed with LNPs, and LNPs have been 
shown to be associated with complement -mediated toxicity specifically following IV 
administration, these findings would appear to represent an artefactual response to high IV 
doses of LNPs.

VA L -181388 has not yet been administered to humans. Thus, information on possible risks 
and adverse reactions associated with IM administration of V AL-181388 is derived from:  
• Animal studies with V AL -181388, LNP components, or the similar mRNA -based influenza 
vaccine, V AL -506440  
• Published clinical data on other mRNA -based investigational medicinal product s and 
products encapsulated in LNPs of similar com positio n as the LNP formulation of 
VA L -181388  
• The Sponsor ’s recent experience with mRNA -based influenza vaccines, V AL -[ADDRESS_607998] of pain, swelling, and erythema, 
which are transient and can be dose dependent. Possible mi ld to moderate systemic reactions, 
which are also transient, include fever, fatigue, chills, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias. In 
addition, other adverse events ( AEs) that have been generally associated with approved 
IM-administered vaccines have includ ed mild hematological and clinical chemistry 
abnormalities, which are usually reversible. 
Subjects receiving V AL -[ADDRESS_607999] agents, pegylated proteins, and antibodies ( Szebeni 2014), as well as for 
small interfering RNA products formulated in LNPs ( Coelho et al 2013; Fitzgerald et al 2014 ). 
The signs and symptoms of CARPA resemble those of an acute hypersensitivity reaction. These 
signs can also be seen preclinically in toxicology species. However, complement activation is 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 34 far less likely to be associated with clinical signs for LNP products such as V AL -181388 that 
are administered IM at a much lower dose on a mg/kg basis than other clinical entities that 
cause CARPA in humans and nonclinical species.

As of August 2016, over [ADDRESS_608001] been submitted to the respective 
regulatory authorities, the Paul Ehrlich Institute in [LOCATION_013], and the FDA. No vaccine -related 
serious adverse events (SAEs) have been observed and all AEs have resolved without 
intervention. The most common AEs have been local reactions of pain, redness, and occasional 
induration, and mild to moderate non- specific systemic AEs such as headache and malaise. 
The majority of these events are mild or moderate in grade and the frequency and severity of 
these expected AEs appears to be dose related. In study V AL -339851- P101 (H7N9), one 
subject had asymptomatic severe (Grade 3) elevation of ALT and AST which resolved. Minimal to mild elevations in LFTs have been observed in additional subjects without a consis tent trend. Based on preliminary data, the safety experience to date can be summarized 
as follows: 
• There have been no unexpected clinically significant AEs or persistent AEs observed, with 
the exception of a single case of reversible and asymptomatic Grade  3 elevation of 
transaminases . 
• Local and systemic events are dose related and comparable in frequency and nature to 
adjuvanted non- live vaccines.

levels of VAL -181388 to be evaluated in this study (25, 50, and 100 µg) are based on several 
data sources, including nonclinical studies (Section 1.2) using V AL -181388 and the similar 
mRNA- based influenza vaccine V AL -506440, and ongoing Phase 1 clinical studies with the

a very large safety margin ([ADDRESS_608005] weighing 70 kg) over the NOAEL in 
rats (102.6 μg/kg, based upon a mean body weight of 390 g) and yet still has the potential to 
elicit a meaningful immune response as demonstrated by [CONTACT_474496]. The highest dose proposed for administration, 100 μ g, is expected to provide a safety 
margin of approximately 72-fold over the NOAEL in rats. 
1.6 Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed  to evaluate the initial  safety and immunological outcomes of 
VA L -181388 for future clinical studies. Since the study will be conducted in non- endemic 
chikungunya region(s), where subjects are expected to be immunologically naive to the 
CHIKV components of VAL -181388, it is anticipated that a 2-dose schedule will be required 
to demonstrate a n adequate immune response. To ensure subject safety, dos e level cohorts will 
be sequential i n nature, starting with the lowest dose and requiring review by [CONTACT_474497]. For each cohort, a sentinel safety group of 4 subjects 
will be enrolled who will be random ly assigned  to VA L -181388 or placebo (3:1) and followed 
for [ADDRESS_608006] been 
pre-established to trigger ad hoc SMC reviews, if required, and an internal safety team (IST) 
will review (blinded review) clinically significant safety laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, reactogenicity, and any AEs (all with toxicity scoring/grading) during the active 
vaccination phase of the trial.  Immun ogenicity will be assessed prior to each vaccination, and

 Page 37 2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of V AL-181388 relative to placebo. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objective of the study is to determine the immunogenicity of 3 dose levels of 
VA L -181388 to inform the choice of dose for further development of this vaccine. 
Immunogenicity assessment will be based on changes from baseline in the following: 
• Serum neutralizing antibody titers to CHIKV  
• Serum binding antibody titers to CHIKV- specific proteins  
2.3 Exploratory Objective s 
The exploratory objectives of the study are to : 
• Assess the cross -reactivity of serum antibodies to related viruses, including alphaviruses 
and flaviviruses 
• Explore other assays to characterize the immune response to CHIKV  
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608008] -in-human, randomized, observer -blinded, placebo- controlled, dose 
escalation study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 3 dose levels of V AL -181388 in 
healthy adult subjects (18 to 49 years of age, inclusive). V AL -181388 is an mRNA -based 
vaccine being developed for prevention of disease associated with CHIK V infection . 
Chikungunya virus is a positive -sense, single -stranded RNA virus, of the alphavirus family, in 
the genus of the togavirus family. It can cause disease in humans and other mammals. It is an 
arbovirus that is transmitted by a mosquito vector ( Aedes spp ). Currently there is no approved 
vaccine to protect against this disease, which has recently spread through tropi[INVESTIGATOR_190566]. 
This is a 2 -part study, with Part A including dose escalation and safety and immune testing 
through 28 days following the final vaccination. Once subjects complete Part A they will 
transition  to Part B. Part  B is a continued safety follow -up through 12 months  and an 
assessment of immunogenicity and immune persistence at approximately 6 and 12 months after 
final vaccination.  
Part A  
In Part A, sequential dose escalation of V AL -181388 is planned in 3 dose level cohorts ( 25, 50, 
and 100 µg) with each subject receiving 2  vaccinations separated by 28 days. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned to receive either V AL -181388 or placebo.  
For each cohort, a sentinel safety group of 4 subjects will be enrolled who will be random ly 
assigned  t o  VA L -181388 or placebo (3:1) and followed for [ADDRESS_608009] of the blinded safety data (reactogenicity, safety laboratory results , and AEs ) through [ADDRESS_608010] vaccination of the sentinel safety lead -in for each cohort planned, will 
approval be given to allow randomization of the remainder of that cohort. The SMC will approve escalation to the next higher dosing cohort after review of blinded safety data of the 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 39 currently dosed cohort through 7 days following the second vaccination and any cumulative 
safety data of all cohorts as the trial advances. The SMC will also be convened (ad  hoc 
meeting) if a pause rule is triggered.  
Dose Level Cohort Assignments:  VA L -181388 (or placebo) administered IM at Visit 1 and a 
second dose adminis tered 28 days later (Visit 4). 
Cohort 1 (N = 20): 25 µ g  VA L -181388 or placebo (ratio = 3:1) 
Cohort 2 (N = 20): 50 µ g  VA L -181388 or placebo (ratio = 3:1) 
Cohort 3 (N = 20): 100 µ g VA L -181388 or placebo (ratio = 3:1) 
Vaccine Administration and Dose Escalation Schema 
 
VA L -181388 (or placebo) will be administered as an IM injection (0.5 mL) into the deltoid 
muscle , preferably in the non-dominant arm, as a 2-dose schedule; the first dose will be given 
at Visit [ADDRESS_608011] of the study. The remainder 
of the site staff and all subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment.  
Consent and Screening will occur over a 28- day period prior to randomization. A total of 
20 subjects will be randomly assigned to each dose level cohort, 4 subjects (3 V AL -181388 
and 1 placebo) to the sentinel safety group and 16 subjects (12 VAL -181388 and 4 placebo) to 
the expansion group, resulting in 15 subjects being randomly assigned to V AL -181388 and 
5 subjects being randomly assigned to placebo (3:1 ratio overall).  Subjects meeting all 
eligibility criteria will re ceive the first  vaccination at Visit 1. Each subject will be monitored 
in the clinic for at least [ADDRESS_608012] a systolic or diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_474456] 2 or higher toxicity after 2 measurements (even after relaxing 
or resting); has an acute  illness ; or has an oral temperature >38°C , the subject  should not 
receive a vaccination on that day and will need to return on subsequent day s for their 
vaccination.  
All subjects will return to the clinic at 7  (+3), 17 (±3), and 28 (+7) days following each 
vaccination. In addition, the sentinel safety group will return to the clinic at 1, 2, and 
21 (+3)  days following the first vaccination. A second vaccination will occur [ADDRESS_608013] vaccination (+7  days).  
Subjects will be instructed on recording solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity events) 
and unsolicited AEs, temperature, and medications (prescription or over -the-counter) on their 
memory aid (ie,  diary card). Subjects will also be asked to call/return to the clinic within 
[ADDRESS_608014] 7 days following each vaccination to answer any questions and ensure 
that the memory  aid is being completed correctly and consistently.  
Safety assessments will include toxicity grading of solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity 
events) and unsolicited AEs, vital sign measurements, physical examination findings, and clinical laboratory test results for hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis. 
All unsolicited AEs will be collected and additional specific categories will include SAEs; AEs of special interest (AESIs); and medically attended AEs. Subjects will self -report  (using a 
memory aid) solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity events) and unsolicited A Es and 
medication usage (over -the- counter and prescription) through [ADDRESS_608015] to ensure consistency. 
Safety laboratory tests will b e performed at Screening, on vaccination days (before dosing), 
and at 7 (+3) days after each vaccination. At 17 (±3) days following each vaccination and at 
28 (+7) days after the second vaccination, safety laboratory tests will be performed for coagulation and liver function tests only. The sentinel safety group will also have coagulation 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 41 and liver function tests collected at 21 (+3)  days after the first vaccination . Additional safety 
laboratory tests may be conducted at any time by [CONTACT_474498].  
Blood samples for immunogenicity will be collected on dosing  days (pre -dose) and at 
28 (+7)  days after the final vaccination.  
Subjects unable to complete their second vaccination due to noncompliance with the visit 
schedule and not due to a cohort pause will still be required to follow the original visit and 
testing schedule. Specifically, these subjects will be asked to undergo blood collection to comply with a second immune test at 56 (+10) days (Visit 7) following the first vaccination.  
To allow cohort advancement, the following data from the highest dosed cohort are expected 
to be reviewed by [CONTACT_4484]: 1)  toxicity scoring of sa fety laboratory test results through 7 days 
following the second vaccination (through Visit  5); 2) toxicity scoring of vital signs and 
reactogenicity through [ADDRESS_608016] and second vaccination (through Visit  5); 
3) all unsolicited AEs (with grading and attribution). Data will be prepared by [CONTACT_474499]. As safety data on all cohorts accumulate, the SMC also review ongoing AEs as well as cumulative safety laboratory test results, reactogenicity, and AEs across vaccine doses for subjects remaining in Part  A of the study, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a 
cumulative and comprehensive review of safety. Should a cohort pause occur due to pre-specified criteria, the SMC will be convened for an unscheduled (ad hoc) meeting and be 
provided with specific safety data related to the trigger of the pause.   
Part A is concluded for each subject when they return to the clinic for Visit 7 (28 days after 
final vaccination). At that time, subjects will transition to Part B of the study.  
The overview of study visit, safety, and immune assessments is presented in Table 3 -1 and the

1. A sentinel safety group of 4 subjects in each cohort will receive VAL -181388 or placebo (3:1) on Day 1.  
2. Review of safety subject data by [CONTACT_474500]  (IST)  through at least [ADDRESS_608018] vaccination (inclusive of 
reactogenicity, laboratory testing results, and adverse events) is required before the full cohort can be randomized.  
3. Safety assessment for dose escalation by [CONTACT_28749]  (SMC) will occur when all subjects in a dosing cohort 
have completed their 7-day post second vaccination visit (inclusive of reactogenicity, adverse events, and laboratory results) and 
will include safety data accumulation through the entire period for that  cohort and all previous dosing cohorts.  
4. The IST may perform additional reviews of blinded safety data during the active vaccination phase of the study, and will rais e 
concerns to the SMC if there are findings that could affect subject safety.  

Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608019] will be entered into a 
continued blinded follow -up period (Part  B). This period will be conducted such that subjects 
and safety monitors will remain blinded to treatment assignment. Part B of the study is initiated 
for a subject once they have returned for Visit  7 (28 days after the second vaccination).  
Once entered into Part  B, each safety contact [CONTACT_474477] (eg, telephone, text  
message, internet) every 28 (±7) days, and bl ood samples for immune persistence will be 
collected from each subject on Visit 1 2 (±15) and Visit 19 (+15) of the study. Each safety 
contact [CONTACT_474501]. 
The telemedicine visits may require additional data through medically attended visits, in 
addition to medications and vaccinations taken by [CONTACT_474502]. Subjects will have consented during study enrollment to allow access to additional medical records needed 
to complete Part B, thereby [CONTACT_474503].

Up to 60 subjects will receive 1 of the following treatments based on the treatment to which 
they are randomly assigned. Dos e level  cohorts will advance in a sequential manner after 
review of all safety data through 7 days after the final vaccination of the previous dose level 
cohort by [CONTACT_4484] (inclusive of reactogenicity, safety laboratory test results , and AEs). All 
vaccines will be administered as a 2 -injection schedule  (28 days apart), into the deltoid muscle

• Cohort 3 ( N = 20): 100 µ g VA L -181388 or placebo (ratio = 3:1) 
The clinic will be appropriately staffed, trained on emergency resuscitation, and have stocked 
available rescue medications (such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, antihistamines, and IV fluids) 
should any severe reaction (eg, anaphylactoid or profound urticaria) occur which requires immediate intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation  
Internal Safety Team  
An IST will oversee the safety of the trial and will review blinded safety data during Part  A of 
the study to ensure adherence to the protocol, monitor safety laboratory test results and 
reactogenicity, and raise concerns to the SMC should there be safety issues or operational 
challenges that could affect subject safety. Pause rules have been pre -established to trigger 
ad-hoc SMC reviews, if required (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and the IST will review (blinded review) 
safety laboratory test results, vital sign measurements, reactogenicity, and any AEs (all with 
toxicity grading) during the ac tive vaccination phase of the trial. In addition, recruitment rates, 
timing of vaccination sequence, and window adherence will be reported to the IST. The 
chairperson of the IST may request that additional data be provided to the SMC that relates to the safety of subjects (eg, study conduct, quality issues, or safety concerns).  
The [ADDRESS_608048] will be composed of the Sponsor ’s study medical monitor lead, the 
contract research organization ’s medical monitor, and the principal investigator. The 
pharmacovigilance officer will oversee safety aspects of the study and will participate as needed. Additional ad hoc members may be included as needed. 
Safety Monitoring Committee 
Dose escalation will proceed  following review of blinded safety data by [CONTACT_474507] 7 days following the second vaccination. In addition, the SMC will 
review prior dos e level  cohort reactogenicity and accumulated AEs at the time of the scheduled 
safety review to allow the SMC an aggregate view of overall safety. The SMC safety data assessment will include the following  blinded summary data: 1) toxicity scoring of safety 
laboratory test results through 7 days following the second vaccination (through Visit  5); 
2) toxicity scoring of vital signs and reactogenicity through [ADDRESS_608049] and second vaccination (through Visit  5); 3)  all unsolicited AEs (with grading and attribution). 
Data will be prepared by [CONTACT_474508]. As safety data on 
all cohorts accumulate, the SMC also review ongoing AEs as well as cumulative safety laboratory test results, reactogenicity, and AEs across vaccine doses for subjects remaining in 
Part A of the study, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a cumulative and comprehensive review of safety. 
Should a cohort pause occur due to pre -specified criteria, the SMC will b e convened for an 
unscheduled (ad hoc) meeting and be provided with specific safety data related to the trigger of the pause. If no pause rules  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) are triggered  or any other safety concerns are 
identified , the SMC may recommend escalation to the next dose level.   
In addition, the Sponsor will submit available safety data for the 25 and 50 µg dose cohorts and recommendations of the SMC  to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research 
(CBER) prior to initiation of the [ADDRESS_608050] and/or the protocol, or recommend additional operational considerations due to safety issues that arise during study conduct . The Sponsor has the authority to accept (or 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 53 amend) the SMC recommendations, to stop the study  at any time, to request a cohort pause for 
safety concerns (to be addressed by [CONTACT_4484]), and to request additional consultation during 
study conduct for either safety concerns or operational issues. The SMC will also be convened 
should a pause rule (Secti on [IP_ADDRESS]) be triggered or at the request of the IST, the investigator, 
or the Sponsor. 
The SMC will be comprised of 3 voting and independent members who are medical doctors 
familiar with Phase 1 clinical trial and safety review and independent from the trial. In addition, a biostatistician not associated with the trial will prepare the safety data (non -voting member), 
and a coordinator not associated with the trial will organize and record decisions of  the SMC 
(non- voting member). The SMC may decide to include a non- medical person to weigh in on 
ethical issues if the need arises.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pause Rules  
During the active vaccination period, if any of the following events occur and are assessed to 
be potentially VA L -181388 related, the study will be paused for further enrollment and 
vaccination and an unscheduled SMC will be convened to assess specific data concerns and make recommendations: 
• Two or more severe reactogenicity events of the same nature (whether syst emic or local) 
within a dose cohort following any single (eg, the first, the second) vaccination 
• Two or more Grade 3 (or greater) laboratory toxicit ies within a cohort  and of the same 
nature 
• One or more SAEs assessed as vaccine related, including any systemic hypersensitivity 
reaction  
An unscheduled SMC may also be convened (with vaccination pausing if deemed necessary), 
by [CONTACT_093], IST, or Sponsor, if any other significant safety or tolerability issues are 
identified in the comprehensive review of  available data that warrant further evaluation before 
additional subjects are dosed. This may include emerging nonclinical data, clinically relevant 
AEs, or relevant data from other sources indicating safety concerns even if the event(s) per se 
does not m eet the criteria specified in this section.  
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608051]’ s visits will continue until the next 
scheduled vaccination visit. Should a pause affect a subject ’s vaccination visit, then the 
window for that subject ’s vaccination visit will be suspended until the pause is lifted and 
vaccination can resume. Once the pause is lifted at the site, vaccination should be reinstated as 
soon as possible. Visits should thereafter be scheduled as if they had received their sec ond 
vaccination within the 28 (+7) day time window. 
Should a pause be prolonged such that the vaccination sequence cannot establish a 28 (+  7) day 
time window, the Sponsor has the option to add additional subjects in a dosing cohort to 
achieve the original  number of subjects planned to be dosed within the 28 (+7) day time 
window. If a subject is in the screening period during this pause and more than [ADDRESS_608052] the dose- finding nature of  this Phase 1 clinical study. Modifications to the dose level 
may be required to achieve the scientific goals of the study and/or to ensure appropriate safety monitoring of the study subjects. Identity of Investigational Product 
VA L -181388 is composed of 1.6 mg/mL of CX -000314, the V AL -181388 mRNA drug 
substance, formulated in a mixture of 4 lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], including MC3 (DLin- MC3 -DMA, a novel 
ionizable lipid), cholesterol, DSPC (1,2- Distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine), and 
PEG2000- DMG (1,2 -Dimyristoyl -sn-glyce rol, methoxypolyethyleneglycol), to form an 
mRNA- lipid complex ( LNP) in 7.0% propylene glycol, 1 mM DTPA  
(diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) , 100 mM Tris buffer.  
The placebo is 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or BP. 
3.4.3 Management of Clinical Supplies  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Packaging and Storage  
Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. will provide the investigator and study site with adequate 
quantities of V AL -181388. The placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP or BP) is 
commercially available and will be supplied by [CONTACT_3452]. VA L -181388 will be labeled 
“for clinical trial use ” and have all required labeling per regulations. V AL-[ADDRESS_608053] identification purpos es.  
VA L -181388 I njection will be supplied in 2 -mL glass vials with a 0.5 -mL fill volume  at a 
concentration of 1.6 mg/mL . The unblinded study site pharmacy personnel will prepare a single 
dose for each subject based on the dose level  cohort and randomization assignment. A single 
vial may be used for multiple subjects in a given day as long as the storage conditions are met 
and the vaccine is not refrozen. A pharmacy manual will be available and training provided to 
ensure pharmacy staff can comply with all vaccine storage, preparation, administration, and 
drug accountability procedures.  
VA L -[ADDRESS_608054] be stored in a secure area with limited access (unblinded pharmacy staff 
only), protected from moisture and light, and be stored at −20°C ± 5°C. The freezer should 
have an automated temperature recording and alert system. There must be an available back -up 
freezer. The freezers must be connected to a  back -up generator. The pharmacy must have in 
place a 24 -hour alert system that allows for rapid  response in case of freezer malfunctioning. 
In addition, drug accountability study personnel (eg, the unblinded pharmacy staff) are required 
to keep a temperature log to establish a record of compliance with these storage conditions. 
The placebo will be s tored according to the instructions on the product label and must also 
comply with storage in a restricted access area. Only drug accountability personnel should 
have access to the products used in this study.  
The site is responsible for report ing any VA L -181388 that was not temperature controlled 
during shipment or during storage to the unblinded site (pharmacy) monitor  and to the Moderna 
Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Supply Manager. Such VA L -181388 will be retained for inspection 
by [CONTACT_474509]. 
VA L -181388 determined to be questionable or unsuitable may be quarantined or disposed of 
upon approval by [CONTACT_474510]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug  Accountability 
It is the investiga tor’s responsibility to ensure that that the unblinded pharmacy personnel 
maintain accurate records of receipt of all VA L -181388, including dates of receipt. In addition, 
accurate records will be kept regarding when and how much VA L -[ADDRESS_608055] in the study  (including documentation of each dilutional record used to 
prepare the vaccine for injection) . Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing regimen 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608056] also be recorded. To satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all 
VA L -181388 will be reconciled and retained until study conclusion. At that time, VA L -181388 
will be destroyed or returned to the Sponsor according to applicable regulations. 
3.4.4 Blinding  
This is an observer -blinded  study. The investigator, study subjects, site monitors, and study site 
personnel will be blinded to the study drug administered, with the following exceptions: 
• Unblinded pharmacy personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to perform drug 
accountability p rocedures and to prepare and administer VA L -181388 (or placebo)  to all 
subjects. The unblinded pharmacy personnel will have no other study functions other than 
study drug management, documentation, accountability, preparation, and administration. 
They will not be involved in subject evaluations and will not reveal the study drug identity 
to either the subject or study site personnel involved in the conduct of the study, except  in 
the case of an emergency.  
• An unblinded study monitor, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be assigned as the drug accountability monitor. They will have responsibilities to ensure the site is 
following all proper drug accountability, preparation, and administration procedures.  
• An unblinded statistician will provide a descriptive analysis of safety and immunological 
endpoints after the completion of each dosing cohort. The interim analyses of 
immunogenicity data will be performed as outlined in Section 3.6.7. 
The treatment assignment will be concealed by [CONTACT_474511] a secure location that is not accessible to other study personnel. The 
syringe used will maintain the blind at the time of vaccination (eg, a sleeve will be used should 
the vaccine substance be distinguishable in appearance between the V AL -181388 and placebo). 
The unblinded pharmacy personnel  will conduct the vaccination procedure. Once the 
vaccination is completed, the blinded study staff will take over further assessments and 
interactions with the subjects. Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled at 
the pharmacy.  
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608057] ’s treatment options. In the 
event of a medical emergency requiring identification of the study drug administered to an individual subject, the investigator will make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_474512] 24 hours of opening the code. The investigator will be responsible for documenting the time, date, reason for the code break, and the names 
of the personnel involved. 
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data will also 
be unblinded to a statistical team at specif ied time points for each data lock  as outlined in 
Section 3.6.7. At the interim analysis of safety, reactogenicity , and immunogenicity data 
collected from Day 1 to Month 7, access to individual listings (unblinded) will be available to 
a restricted number of identified Sponsor team members and the clinical research organization  
unblinded statistician. Study sites will remain blinded.  
3.4.[ADDRESS_608058] observation of study site personnel and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF . Site personnel will 
confirm that the subject has received the entire dose of study drug. If a subject does not receive 
study drug or does not receive all of the planned doses, the reason for the missed dose will be 
recorded  in the source documents.  
Subjects that miss the second vaccination due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and not due t o a cohort pause will still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule. 
Specifically, these subjects will be asked to undergo blood collection to comply with a second immune test at 56 (+10) days (Visit 7) following the first vaccination . 
The study site is responsible for ensuring subjects comply with the study windows allowed. 
Should a subject miss a visit, every effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_474513] a 
visit within the defined visit window . If a subject exceeds their pos t-vaccination visit in excess 
of 28 days from the scheduled visit or misses a vaccination schedule by [CONTACT_726] 28 days (eg, 28 days beyond the scheduled time of vaccination) then that visit will be classified as a missed 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608059] will continu e with subsequent visits for P arts A and B of the study . All 
safety requirements of the missed visit will be captured and included in the follow -up visit (eg, 
safety laboratory testing, memory aid  review for reactogenicity, as applicable).  
3.4.7 Prior and  Concom itant  Medications 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76815] (including any prescription or over -the-counter 
medications, vaccines, or blood products) taken by [CONTACT_11766] 30 days before 
providing informed consent (or as  designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirements) will be 
recorded in the subject ’s eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_474459]  A of the study, concomitant medications include all medications (including vaccination 
outside of trial) taken by [CONTACT_474514] (ICF) 
through 28 days after the second vaccination (Visit  7) and will be recorded in the eCRF. In 
Part B, receipt of immunomodulators (including vaccines), immunosuppressants, or other 
concomitant medications that could potentially impact immune response will be collected 
through the end-of-study ( EOS ) visit.   
Subjects are prohibited from receiving immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months preceding the administration of the study drug or at any time during the study.  
Acetaminophen may be allowed at the discretion of the investigator. A daily dose of ≤100 mg 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_474458] a physician is not a contraindication to enrollment.  
To allow accurate assessment of analgesic/antipyretic use during the 7 days after each 
vaccination , subjects will be inquired directly as to use (absent or present) and if used will be 
inquired for treatment or prophylaxis. 
Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of an immunosuppressant 
or other immune modifying drug within 6 months prior to vaccine administration or any such products during the active vaccination period (through [ADDRESS_608060] planned vaccination) is prohibited. An immunosuppressant dose of a glucocorticoid will be defined as 
a systemic dose of ≥10 mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled, 
and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.

Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Dictionary. If prohibited drug therapy is taken, a j oint decision will be made by [CONTACT_474515], and whether the use of the medication wil l compromise the subject safety or interpretation of the data. It is the 
investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that details regarding the concomitant medication are 
adequately recorded in the eCRF.  
3.[ADDRESS_608061] signs the consent form. The investigator will also sign the ICF. Subjects will undergo study procedures at the time points specif ied in the schedule of events ( Table  6-1 and  Table  6-2).  
At any time during the study a subject can be seen for an unscheduled visit. This may be 
prompted by [CONTACT_474516], reactogenicity issues, or new or ongoing AEs. The site  also has the discretion to make reminder telephone calls or text  messages  to inform 
the subject on visits, request further laboratory assessments, review memory aid  content 
requirements, and follow -up on ongoing or outstanding issues.  As standard practice, a reminder 
call should be made to the subject by [CONTACT_474517] 7 days following each vaccination to ensure that the memory aid is being completed correctly  and consistently . 
Specific activities at each visit are outlined in Table  6-1 and Table  6-2 and may include the 
following: 
• Confirm subject identification and contact [CONTACT_3031]  
• Record vital  sign s (toxicity graded) and perform physical exam ination  
• Review memory aid  
• Grade reactogenicity

subject at the time points indicated in Table  6-2. 
Safety contacts  must be performed  by [CONTACT_474518]. If the initial contact  
[CONTACT_474519], the study site staff should make a total of [ADDRESS_608063] by [CONTACT_474520] (every 28 days  plus window allowance ).  
These contacts will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety 
infor mation. Each safety contact [CONTACT_474521]. Additional data may be requested through medically attended visits, and medications and vaccina tion will be

potential change based on further questioning and/or follow -up by [CONTACT_464]. Each subject 
will be instructed to complete a memory aid  to describe: 
• Solicited local and systemic AEs ( Section 3.5.6) occurring (with appropriate 
documentation to allow severity grading by [CONTACT_093])  during the day of each dose 
administration and for the following [ADDRESS_608065] temperature reading will be  
recorded . 
o For solicited local AEs that require measurement, the measurement of size will be 
performed using the ruler provided by [CONTACT_3452]. 
• All medications (excluding vitamins and minerals) taken during the day of each vaccine 
administration and for the following 28 days  
• Any uns olicited AE during the first [ADDRESS_608066] ’s source documents and the eCRF. 
3.5.3 Immunogenicity  Assessments  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessment will be collected at the time points indicated (Table  6-1 and Table  6-2). Sample aliquots will be designed so as to ensure that back-up 
samples  are available and adequate vial volumes will allow for testing needs. The actual time 
and date of each sample collected will be recorded in the eCRF and unique sample 
identification will be utilized to maintain the blind at the laboratory at all times and  to allow 
for automated sample tracking and housing. Handling and preparation of the samples for

3.5.5 Safety Assessments 
Safety  assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following: 
• Solicited (local and systemic reactogenicity events) and unsolicited AEs  
• SAEs  
• AESIs

3.5.6 Solicited Safety Measurements  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to selected signs and symptoms (AEs) occurring after dose 
administration, to be collected by [CONTACT_474523] [ADDRESS_608069] 7 days following vaccination.  
The following AEs are included in the memory aid . 
Solicited local AEs include: 
• injection site induration /swelling  
• injection site ten derness  
• injection site erythema /redness 
• injection site pain  
Solicited systemic AEs include: 
• body temperature (oral) 
• generalized myalgia (muscle ache or pain)  
• generalized arthralgia (joint ache or pain)  
• headache  
• fatigue/malaise  (unusual tiredness)

Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 64 • nausea/ vomiting  
• diarrhea  
The AEs  will be recorded  by [CONTACT_474524]; where appropriate 
reactogenicity measurements will be taken using the tools provided (oral thermometer and 
measuring device). The investigator will later review, confirm, grade, and attribute AEs including reactogeni city, as absent  (Grade 0) , mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe 
(Grade 3), or potentially life threatening (Grade 4) . The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent V olunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials (CBER  2007; Table  6-3) will be used to grade reactogenicity reactions . If a solicited local or 
systemic AE continues beyond 7 days after dose administration, it will also be recorded as an 
AE in the eCRF from 8 days after vaccination until resolved or stable. 
Other solicited reactions: 
Use of analgesics  and/or antipyretics will be recorded as absent or present, and it will be 
indicated if they were used for treatment or for prophylaxis.  
Solicited local and systemic AEs (including body temperature) will be collected using the 
memory aid  during the day of each dose administration (at approximately 6 hours) and for the 
following [ADDRESS_608070] visit for Part B occurs. At that time, any ongoing AEs will receive their 
final classification so that the safety database can be locked.   
A tabulation of all SAEs and AESIs, categorized by [CONTACT_194682] (MedDRA) preferred terms and assessed relationship to study drug , will be 
performed.  
3.5.7 Unsolicited Safety Measurements  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_608071] any AEs (solicited or unsolicited)  in the memory aid . 
A treatment -emergent AE is defined as any event not present before exposure to study drug or 
any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure.  
A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility ” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
drug a nd the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a study drug.  An adverse 
reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse 
reactions for which there are reasons to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the IB or 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed with the study dr ug being tested; or, if an 
IB is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the 
general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this 
definition, hepatic necrosis would be une xpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 66 referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism 
and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed 
only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs 
or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not speci fically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Adverse events will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_474525]: 
• Medically attended AE: an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to a healthcare practitioner  
Any solicited AE that meets any of the following criteria will be entered onto the AE page of 
the eCRF : 
• Solicited local or systemic AE leading to the subject withdrawing from the study or the 
subject being withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_093]  
• Solicited local or sy stemic AE lasting beyond 7 days duration 
• Solicited local or systemic AE that lead to subject withdrawal from study drug  
• Solicited local or systemic AE that otherwise  meets the definition of an SAE 
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Serious  Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious ” (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94137]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 67 • Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events  include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life threatening ” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_608072]  
Certain AESIs are evaluated after the administration of immunostimulatory agents. All subjects 
enrolled in the study will be monitored for AESIs from enrollment through the EOS visit. The occurrence of any of these AEs will be treated as an SAE, meeting the criterion of a “medically 
important event.” 
The list of AESIs is presented in  Appendix 2. 
A diagnosis of an AESI will be reported to the Sponsor in an expedited manner similar to  an 
SAE. The AESI diagnosis, as well as any medications taken to treat the condition, will be 
recorded in the subject ’s eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Pregnancy  
The investigator is required to inform the Sponsor about any unexpected case of pregnancy 
occurring during the study (for female subjects as well as for partners of male subjects), 
monitor the pregnancy until delivery and report whatever outcome to the Sponsor (no later 
than 1 week after becoming aware of the pregnancy).  
Pregnancy report fo rms will be distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608073] immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any 
case of pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome (miscarriage or newborn with congenital 
abnormality and/or stillbirth) according to the procedures described for SAEs. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and reported to Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. In Part A of the study, AEs will be assessed from 
the time of the first dose administration at Visit 1 through Visit 7. However, for the time period 
after the ICF is signed until before receiving the study drug, AEs will only be recorded when 
they are defined  as one or more of the following: SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to study 
withdrawal. In Part B of the study, AESIs and SAEs will be assessed from Visit [ADDRESS_608074] been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any a ccidents, used any new medications, 
or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter 
medications).  
In addition to subject observations, data from clinical laboratory test results, physical 
examination findings, or other documents relevant to subject safety classified as an AE will be 
documented on the AE page of the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adverse Events  
All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. 
Information to be collected includes drug treatment and dose, type of event, time of onset, 
dosage, investigator -specified assessment of severity and relationship to study drug, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. The AEs  resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, 
reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_11755]. The MedDRA will be used to code all AEs. 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608075] is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time durin g the 
study, it should be recorded as an AE. 
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_188532] (Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2) 
must be reported to the Sponsor immediately ( within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE ). 
The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused 
the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
any SAE as outlined in the 21 US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts [ADDRESS_608076]  (IRB) directly.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject ’s daily 
activities and will be classified as mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2),  severe (Grade 3), or 
potentially life threatening (Grade 4) using the following criteria:  
• Mild (Grade 1): These events do not interfere with the subject’ s daily activities.  
• Moderate (Grade 2): These events cause some interference with the subject ’s daily 
activities but do not require medical intervention.  
• Severe (Grade 3): These events prevent the subject ’s daily activity and require medical 
intervention. 
• Life threatening (Grade 4): These events require an emergency room visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent 
requires documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].

evidence (eg, laboratory test value, x -ray) will not be classified as an AE per se.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator ’s assessment of an AE ’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable pos sibility that the study 
drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the 
following classification: 
• Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor's product relationship: Subject 
did not receive the Sponsor’ s product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to 
administration of the Sponsor’ s product is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_26372]’ s product.  
• Related: There is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’ s product relationship: There is 
evidence of exposure to the Sponsor’ s product. The temporal sequence of the AE onset 
relative to the administration of the Sponsor’ s product is reasonable. The AE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_1034]’s product than by [CONTACT_5748]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -Up of Adverse Events 
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page of the eCRF and followed until the 
AE is resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_474526] A 
of the study. For Part B of the study, only AESIs and SAEs will be recorded . The investigator 
may request an  unscheduled visit at any time , if warranted.  
3.5.8 Clinical Laboratory Testing  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by [CONTACT_2237] , unless specified otherwise . 
Blood and urine will be collected in Part  A at the time points indicated in the schedule of events 
(Table  6-1). Fasting is not required before collection of laboratory samples. 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 71 The following hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysi s assessments will be 
performed. The results will be toxicity graded using Table  6-4. 
Hematology:  Hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular 
hemoglobin concentration, mean corpu scular volume, platelet count, red 
blood cell count, and total and differential leukocyte count 
Serum 
Chemistry:  Alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, 
amylase, lipase, bilirubin (total and direct ), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
random glucose, potassium, sodium, total protein, albumin, and calcium 
Females subjects only: β-human chorionic gonadotropin (childbearing 
potential) and follicle -stimulating hormone (post-menopausal) 
Coagulation : Prothrombin time, p artial thromboplastin time  
Urinalysis:  pH, protein, glucose, ketone, bilirubin, urobilinogen, blood, nitrite, 
leucocytes, and specific gravity  
A pregnancy test ( β-human chorionic gonadotropin) will be performed on all female subjects 
who have reproductive potential at Screening and before each dose administration (urine or 
serum). Only pregnancy tests at Screening and for unscheduled visits will be sent to the cent ral 
laboratory. P regnancy test ing prior to each study vaccination will be performed by [CONTACT_27396] . A follicle -stimulating hormone test will be performed at Screening, as necessary, to 
confirm post -menopausal status in female subjects, if not documented in the subject ’s medical 
records . 
Human immunodeficiency virus (types 1 or 2) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and 
hepatitis  C virus antibody will be assessed at Screening. 
A urine screen for drugs of abuse will be performed by [CONTACT_474527], opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], cocaine, phencyclidine, amphetamines, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and methadone.  
Should safety la boratory testing result in a Grade [ADDRESS_608078] occur 
within the next 10 days ; this may include an unscheduled visit. Should the subject ’s laboratory 
value not return to baseline then periodic testing may be needed until the abnormality is 
deemed to be associated with a new stable AE or determined to be not clinically significant by 
[CONTACT_093].  
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608079]  a toxicity of Grade 1 or higher will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_474528] “abnormal clinically significant ( CS)”, or “abnormal not 
clinically significant (NCS) ”. Investigators should use their clinical judgment when 
considering the clinical significance of any abnormal laboratory findings . All laboratory test 
values with a toxicity  of Grade [ADDRESS_608080] value that is associated with an identified ongoing AE where that event would be the classifying AE. 
3.5.9 Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and dia stolic blood pressures, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature (which is classified as a solicited systemic event). The 
subject will be seated for at least 5  minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will 
be measured in Part  A at t he time points indicated in the schedule of events ( Table  6-1).  
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur at the same time point, the order  of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then the blood collection. 
Of note, on the day of vaccination, if a subject is noted to have a systolic or diastolic blood 
pressure, heart rate, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_474460] 2 or higher toxicity after 
2 measurements (even after relaxing or resting) ; has an acute illness ; or has an oral temperature 
>38°C, the subject  should not receive a vaccination on that day and will need to return on 
subsequent days for their vaccination.  
If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical 
abnormalities ( Table  6-3) of Grade 3 or higher , the abnormal value  and grade will be 
documented on the AE page of the eCRF (unless there is another known cause of the 
abnormality and that would result in an AE classification). The investigator will continue to 
monitor the subject with additional assessments until the value has reached the reference range, 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -181388  
Protocol V AL -181388- P101 Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 3  
 Page 73 the value at Screening, is considered stable, or until the investigator determines that follow -up 
is no longer medically necessary.  
3.5.10  Physical Examinations  
In Part  A, a full physical examination will be performed at Screen ing and a symptom -directed 
(targeted) physical examination will be performed at all other scheduled time points indicated 
in the schedule of events (Table  6-1). The full examination will include assessment of skin, 
head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities. Interim physical examinations will be performed at t he discretion of the investigator, if necessary, to evaluate AEs or clinical 
laboratory abnormalities.  Prior to vaccination and at 7 days following vaccination, a physical 
evaluation of the arm that was vaccinated and the associated lymph nodes should be e valuated.  
Height and weight will be measured and body mass index will be calculated at Screening only.  
3.6 Statistical Analysis Plans  
3.6.1 Safety  Endpoints

or placebo).  All subjects in the Safety set will be analyzed according to the study drug actually 
received and not according to the study drug the subject was random ly assigned  to receive, in 
the event there is a discrepancy.  
The Per -Protocol set will include all subjects who did not observe a major protocol violation, 
received vaccine within the acceptable vaccination window (their full dose(s) of assigned study 
drug), had blood collection within accepted visit windows, and had a pre- vaccination and at 
least one serum sample from the p ost-vaccination testing period available for testing. All 
subjects in the Per -Protocol set will be analyzed according to the study  drug the subject was 
randomly assigned to receive and not according to what was actually received, in the event 
there is a discrepancy. In the case where there is not a paired sample for the specific time point 
that data will not be included in the analysis.  
The Intent -to-Treat set will provide supportive analyses. For the Intent -to-Treat set, all subject s 
who were random ly assigned to the study will be included regardless of protocol violations, 
exceeded visit windows, missed vaccination, or missing data.  
3.6.5 Statistical Analysis  
Details of all statistical analyses will be described in a statistical analysis plan. All data 
collected will be presented in data listings. Data from subjects excluded from an analysis 
population will be presented in the data listings but not included in the calculation of summary 
statistics.  
Data from subjects receiving placebo will be pooled across dose level cohorts for all 
presentations.

subjects are enrolled into an amended protocol. 
Moderna Therapeut ics, Inc. VAL -[ADDRESS_608096] ’s source documentation 
any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, 
or a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects without prior IRB approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or 
change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments should be submitted to the 
IRB for review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, 
if required.  
A deviation from the protocol  is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the procedures 
or processes approved by [CONTACT_474535]. Deviations 
usually have an impact on individual subjects or a small group of subjects and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. A protocol violation occurs when the subject 
or investigator do not adhere to the protocol, resulting in a significant, additional risk to the subject. Protocol violations can include non- adherence to inclusi on or exclusion criteria, 
enrollment of the subject without prior Sponsor approval, or non- adherence to FDA regulations 
or ICH E6(R1) guidelines. 
Protocol violations and deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_474536]. The investigator will be notified in writing by [CONTACT_474537]. The IRB should be notified of all protocol violations and deviations, if appropriate, in a timely manner.

EaseVRxTM, a software -based virtual reality ( VR) medical device , is intended to offer users a 
prescription pain management tool that manages the symptoms associated with chronic pain and 
reduces or eliminates the risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]. EaseVRx is based on principles of cognitive 
behavioral therapy, pain psychology, mindfulness -based stress reduction, biofeedback, and 
distraction therapy commonly used in interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation programs. We will 
conduct a proof -of-concept randomized , double -blind, placebo -controlled study to assess the 
feasibility and efficacy of using EaseVRx as an 8-week , VR-based, at -home program among 100 
chronic low back pain patients by [CONTACT_669827][INVESTIGATOR_669803], reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_243964], and improving pain -related 
quality of life . While VR has been tested in academic medical centers and shown to be 
efficacious in the management of acute pain, this study will investigate the feasibility of VR use 
at home to manage chronic pain in  preparation for a larger efficacy trial.

Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) 3 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
3.1 Chronic pain: an epi[INVESTIGATOR_669802] a major unmet medical need.  
Chronic pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care1: chronic pain affects 
between [ADDRESS_904466] that up to 40% of American adults suffer from 
chronic pain, ranging from mild to severe5. Pain treatment and management is traditionally based 
primarily around utilizing pharmacological management tools, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_669804]. 
Although some non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_669805] -pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_669806], there i s still significant unmet need for integrative, non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_669807].  
Approximately 25 million American adults are living with moderate to severe chronic pain (i.e. 
pain scoring 4 -7 on a Visual Analog Scale and lasting over 3 months) that limits their activities 
and diminishes their quality of life6, 7. Close to 85% of these patients do not find meaningful 
relief from current non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_142243] (i.e. they do not experience a long -term ≥ 50% 
reduction in their pain levels)8.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_669808]. These agents can yield 
both inconsistent and sub -optimal results9 and greatly increase the risk of the patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_669809] (OUD). Data from the U .S. Center s for Disease 
Control (CDC) revealed that even a single day of opi[INVESTIGATOR_669810] a 6% increase 
in the risk of the patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a dependency within a year10. 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_669811] a significant adverse event profile that includes hypotension, respi[INVESTIGATOR_669812], aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and/or vomiting. Although these risks are manageable, it is imperative to 
devise pain alternatives that are cost -effective and improve  the risk -benefit profile well above the 
current standard of care. To reduce addiction and provide relief for the millions of chronic pain 
sufferers, new low -risk, non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_669813].  
3.2 appliedVR’s answer for chronic pain: EaseVRx  
Therapeutic VR has emerged as an effective, non -pharmacological treatment modality for pain9. 
VR users wear a pair of goggles with a close -proximity screen that creates a sensation of being 
transported into immersive, three -dimensional worlds. One hypothesis for VR’s mechanism of 
action proposes that by [CONTACT_669828], 
VR is able to limit the user’s processing of pain signals9. 
The common nature of mobile high -performance computing has now reduced both the size and 
cost of VR devices, allowing for VR use in everyday settings like the clinic and at home. As an 
alternative to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], VR has been proven to be effective in decreasin g pain during severe burn 
wound bandage changes, IV line placements, and dental interventions9. 
Unlike opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], VR has a reduced risk of the user developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a dependency or addiction to the 
pain management technique. If a patient can utilize VR for pain management, they can either 
reduce or potentially remove the need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_669814]

Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) techniques. This sparing of opi[INVESTIGATOR_669815].  
appliedVR ’s investigational EaseVRx product for chronic pain is based on principles of 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pain psychology, mindfulness -based stress reduction, 
biofeedback, and distraction therapy commonly used in interdisciplinary pain rehabilitation 
programs (IPRPs). These programs often include physical and occupational therapy; exercise 
therapy; cognitive restructuring with an emphasis on promotion of self -management, self -
efficacy, resourcefulness, and activity versus passivity, reactiv ity, dependency, and hopelessness; 
behavioral treatment (e.g. relaxation, activity pacing); and opi[INVESTIGATOR_669816]. The 
reduction of pain after treatment at IPRPs ha s been reported to be significant in several 
metanalyses12-14, with one meta -analysis12 reporting that the mean pain reduction for patients 
treated at IPRPs was 37% with a concomitant significant decrease (63%) in prescription pain 
treatment. Moreover, one early metanalysis of [ADDRESS_904467]. The VR sham user interface and functionality will be designed to mirror the user interface 
and functionality of the Ease VRx intervention.  
4 HYPOTHESIS AND SPECIFIC AIMS  
4.1 Primary  Aim 1  
Compare pain and pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_669817]. Hypothesis:  
Chronic low back pain patients randomized to the EaseVRx approach who use the device in 
accordance with the treatment protocol  will have significantly decreased pain scores  and 
improved pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]  4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting the 8-week  VR treatment.

Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) 4.2 Secondary Aim 1  
Compare physical function as measured by [CONTACT_212853] (ODI)  among the VR 
sham  and EaseVRx group. Hypothesis: Chronic pain patients randomized to the EaseVRx 
approach who use the device in accordance with the treatment protocol  will have significantly 
better physical function (i.e. lower  ODI scores ) 4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting the 8 -week VR 
treatment . 
4.3 Secondary Aim 2  
Compare analgesic medication use among the VR sham  and EaseVRx group . Hypothesis: 
Chronic pain patients randomized to the EaseVRx approach who use the device in accordance 
with the treatment protocol  will have  decreased utilization of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_75765] 4, 8, and 12 weeks after starting the 8 -week VR treatment . 
4.4 Secondary Aim 3  
To assess the feasibility of EaseVRx as a self -administered, home -based approach to chronic 
pain management, in terms of patient compliance, program retention, patient satisfaction , and 
safety . Hypothesis: EaseVRx  will be a feasible approach to chronic pain management, with high 
rates of patient compliance, retention, and satisfaction  among chronic pain patients after 
completing an 8-week  course of treatment with EaseVRx .  
4.[ADDRESS_904468] and utilization  among the VR sham and  EaseVRx group  among  patients 
with Geisinger Health Plan as their primary insurance . Hypothesis: Chronic pain patients 
randomized to the EaseVRx approach who use the device in accordance with the treatment 
protocol  will have significantly lower costs and utilization (i.e. office visits, therapy sessions, 
inpatient/ED admissions) [ADDRESS_904469] pi[INVESTIGATOR_669818] 45 chronic pain users of various diagnoses. Surveys were 
administered for 8 days prior to the intervention to establish a baseline measure of pain and quality 
of life using the PROMIS Global -10. Pa in intensity and interference were also measured daily 
using the Numerical Rating Scale and Department of Defense/Veterans Administration Pain 
Supplemental Questions. Findings from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_669819] n levels over the 8 -day-course of use, particularly in the interference of pain 
with their mood. On average, participants showed a 22% improvement in pain, 24% improvement 
in stress, 29% improvement in mood, and 25% improvement in sleep quality (over basel ine).

Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) A second, targeted quantitative and qualitative study was conducted to assess pain relief and 
durability, quality of life impact, and engagement of the 8 -session VR program among 30 chronic 
pain patients with a musculoskeletal pain diagnosis (back, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], neck or joint pain) or rheumatoid 
arthritis. Outcomes collected included pain intensity via the Numerical Rating Scale, PROMIS 
Pain Interference Short Form 6b, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Short Form 4a, and Stanford 
Expectations of Treatment Survey. Subjects were also given a brief semi -structured interview after 
completion of the program to understand their satisfaction and challenges with the VR 
intervention. Subjects who completed six or more modules improved, on average, across every 
measured Quality of Li fe metric. On average, users showed 22% reduction in pain intensity over 
the course of the program .  
6 STUDY DESIGN  
6.1 Description  
This is a single -center, prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  study of the 
appliedVR Ease VRx headset in subjects with chronic lower back pain . A cohort of 126 patients 
will be recruited from patients currently seeking  care for low back pain at Geisinger . We are 
assuming a 20% dropout or noncompletion rate, so recruiting [ADDRESS_904470] largely exhausted 
non-pharmacological approaches to improving pain and who are currently relying primarily on 
pharmacotherapy for symptom relief will be recruited for the s tudy. These patients are an ideal 
study population to include as few treatment options remain for these patients due to insufficient 
understanding of pain origin, failure of conventional pain management approaches, or 
unsuitability of surgical intervention s. Patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_22123] 1:[ADDRESS_904471] to whether the 
patient will receive EaseVRx or the VR sham .

6.3 Recruitment  
The primary and collaborating investigator(s) will identify potential subjects in the Geisinger 
system who are scheduled for a clinic visit to address their chronic low back pain . These patients 
will be pre -screened via manual chart review of their electronic health record (EHR) by [CONTACT_5055].  Patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be called  by [CONTACT_2717] -
approved study team member ( e.g. primary and collaborating physicians, research project 
coordinator , research assistant ) approximately one week prior to their scheduled clinic visit . 
After hearing a description of the study  and completing a short screening assessment , eligible

PI [CONTACT_5627] : [CONTACT_669843]  
IRB # 2019 -1017  
Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) patients will be asked to report their average lower back pain over the last 24 hours via a  
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) score  for [ADDRESS_904474] will choose how they want to 
report their daily NPRS scores and will be giving the following options: phone calls, texts, or 
web-based entry via REDCap. They will be instructed to record their scores at the same time 
each day (± 2 hours).  
 
At the end of the 7-day s creening period, the study team  will assess daily NPRS scores to 
determine if the subject meets the pain eligibility requirements: (1) subjects must complete at 
least 5 of 7 daily NPRS scores in the previous 7 -day screening period and (2) the overall average 
NPRS score must remain between 4 and 10 (inclusive) during the screening period. Subjects who 
are deemed eligible will be approached by a member of the study team during their clinic visit to 
provide more information about the study and administer informed consent for interested 
patients.

6.5 Procedures  
After informed consent, patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_22123] 1: [ADDRESS_904476] of care (S OC) for pain control in 
addition to the device . SOC pain management will follow pre -established clinical guideli nes, and 
the additional VR -based or sham device  will be made available but with no restriction on the use 
of other pain management methods as desired by [CONTACT_669829]/her provider.  
All research activities will be conducted remotely after the initial baseline study visit. Each 
subject will be asked to complete an 8-week  program with assigned modules each week. Each 
week, subjects will be asked to complete 5 modules, averaging 6 minutes in duration and ranging 
from 2 to 16 minutes in duration . At the end of the 8 -week program period, participants will be 
asked to mail their device back to appliedVR using a provided, postage -paid mailer.

PI [CONTACT_5627] : [CONTACT_669843]  
IRB # 2019 -1017  
Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) All outcomes will be assessed at the initial baseline visit  and then every 4 weeks for 12 weeks  
via phone or online questionnaires . A core subset of these outcome measures, mainly pain and 
use of analgesic medications , will be collected daily during the 8-week  program . Patients will be 
asked to complete a paper or online REDCap diary to track their pain levels , opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_75765] , and device use  from home. The daily log will capture the NPRS at the same 
time each evening (± 2 hours) . Participants will be asked to record their NPRS at least [ADDRESS_904477], a software system for patient -reported outcomes already in use at the study 
clinics. To assess opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], the investigators will query Pennsylvania's Prescription Drug 
Monitoring Program (PDMP) database. To maintain compliance with ABC -MAP Act [ADDRESS_904478] information related to device usage (i.e. frequency and 
duration of use, features utilized, completion rates). Patients may be contact[CONTACT_669830].  
Outcome measures include:  
• Program Feasibility :  
o Patient compliance  will be assessed in two ways:  
▪ Treatment  dose (actual minutes of VR or sham  use per day); and  
▪ Treatment  duration (actual number of days VR or sham  used).  
o Program retention  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_669831].  
o Patient satisfaction  will be assessed once at the end of the program by [CONTACT_669832] : 
▪ Please tell me if you agree or disagree with the following statements:  
[strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree]  
▪ The VR headset was easy to use.   
▪ I enjoyed using the VR headset.  
▪ The content in the VR headset helped me cope with my chronic pain.  
▪ Today, on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means you would definitely NOT 
recommend VR treatment and 10 means you WOULD definitely 
recommend VR treatment, how likely are you to recommend VR 
treatment to someone else?  
o Patient safety  will be assessed by [CONTACT_669833]  (AE).

PI [CONTACT_5627] : [CONTACT_669843]  
IRB # 2019 -1017  
Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) o Pain will be assessed via the standard Geisinger Numerical Pain Rating Scale 
(NPRS)  ranging 0 -10 (0 = least amount of pain, 10 = worst amount of pain).   
o Pain Copi[INVESTIGATOR_669821]:  
▪ Pain Self -Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ -2)114, 115, which measures the 
confidence people with ongoing pain have in performing activities while 
in pain;  
▪ Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS -4)116, which measures the impact of 
catastrophizing on the pain experience; and  
▪ Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ -8)117, 118, which measures 
the ability to accept and cope with chronic pain.  
o Physical function  will be assessed using by [CONTACT_212853] (ODI) .  
o Analgesic medication use  will be assessed in two ways:  
▪ Extrapolating total milligrams of morphine equivalent doses filled from 
PDMP database as an indicator of chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]; and  
▪ Patient self -reported consumption .  
o Quality of life  will be assessed using the 12 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF -
12). 
 
• Healthcare Cost and Utilization (Geisinger Health Plan patients only):  
o Utilization  will be assessed by [CONTACT_669834], admissions, 
emergency room visits, and therapy sessions related to the patient’s lower back 
pain for [ADDRESS_904479] will be  assessed by [CONTACT_669835] ( GHP ) and paid to the health system, by [CONTACT_669836] , for 
utilization , medication , and other  costs related to the patient’s lower back pain.

6.8 Statistics  
A Geisinger statistician  will complete the statistics. All statistical analyses will be performed 
with SAS (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC), Stata (SE 14.2, StataCorp, LLC, College Station, 
TX), or R (R 3.5.2, The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) statistical software, with p -values of 
<0.[ADDRESS_904482] deviations for 
continuous variables. Bivariate comparisons will be explored using Chi -square or Fisher’s exact 
test for categorical variables and two -sample t -tests or Mann -Whitney tests for continuous 
variables.  
Because pain is expected to decrease over time, and because pain scores may vary by [CONTACT_669837], we will plan to plot NPRS  score vs. time for every patient over the 8-
week  treatment period, using straight -line interpolation between measurements, which will allow 
us to use all available measurements (even if some patients recorded more NPRS  scores than 
others) and will avoid placing too much emphasis on a measurement at a single time point (e.g. 
the 21 -day measurement). We will compute a  percent -area-under -the-curve ( NPRS -%AUC) 
  16 
PI [CONTACT_5627] : [CONTACT_669843]  
IRB # 2019 -1017  
Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) measurement where 100% would indicate pain scores of [ADDRESS_904483] a different NPRS -%AUC, forming a distribution of measures in each of the two 
groups, and we will use an unpaired t -test to compare the mean NPRS -%AUC for patients before 
and after the intervention.  
Percent change in PSEQ -2, PCS -4, CPAQ -8, ODI, SF -12 and t otal opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444] (measured in 
MME) will be compared between groups using ANOVA, or, if more appropriate, a

6.8.[ADDRESS_904484] sufficient intake of patients fitting the inclusion 
criteria. Our initial recruitment of 126 patients allows for a 20% dropout rate, which should be 
sufficient to insure a final n = [ADDRESS_904485] data collection, retrospective EMR review, 
and/or the Pennsylvania Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) database:  
• Medical Record Numbers (MRN) (Will not be included in final data set)  
• Name (Will not be included in final data set)  
• Patient contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g. phone, email) (Will not be included in final data set)  
• Date of birth  
• Patient demographics such as gender, race/ethnicity, and BMI  
• Medical history relevant to inclusion/exclusion  
• Date(s) of clinic visits  
• Outcome measures  (see section 6.[ADDRESS_904486])  
The study coordinator(s) will randomly assign study ID numbers in place of MRNs. All study 
data will be stored on a secure Geisinger Health System server, and hard copy data will be 
double locked and accessible only to the study investigators. Only group -level information 
without personal identifiers will be included when presenting results or submitting manuscripts 
for publication. An IRB approved study team member will share the dataset with appliedVR via 
a secured e -mail.

7 SAFETY MONITORING  
7.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. All AEs will be reported 
to the institutional review board (IRB) regardless of whether they are considered study related.  
The date and time of onset and outcome, course, intensity, action taken, and causality to study 
treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_9154].  In the event of a se rious AE (SAE), this will be 
reported to the Geisinger IRB (GIRB) according to the GIRB guidelines . All other AEs will be 
summarized and submitted to GIRB dur ing continuing review.  
7.2 Definitions  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or in a clinical study. The event does not need to be causally related to the  test article or 
clinical study.  
No technical difficulties are anticipated in the performance of these studies; the methods in place 
are similar to other appliedVR product proof -of-concept studies previously conducted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226480], which revealed no adverse events.  
The potential risks posed by [CONTACT_669838], as the EaseVRx does not control 
any diagnosis or medical decisions and the patient is free to suspend or halt use at any time by 
[CONTACT_669839]. The primary risk is that the patient does not respond to EaseVRx and 
continues to feel pain. Other risks include minor adverse events such as motion sickness, vertigo, 
nausea, vomiting, or panic attacks. Again, these rare adverse events can be remedied by 
[CONTACT_669839]. EaseVRx incl udes a wide range of experiences to allow for patients 
with phobias or triggers for panic attacks to choose other experiences which do not incorporate 
those factors.   
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is an AE that:  
 
• Results in death.  
  18 
PI [CONTACT_5627] : [CONTACT_669843]  
IRB # 2019 -1017  
Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) • Is life-threatening  (see below).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  (see below).  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability  or incapacity (see below).  
• Results in cancer.  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37347], based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical int ervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Life-threatening  refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred per the reporter. A 
life-threatening experience does not include an experience, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediat e risk of 
death. For example, hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be 
considered life -threatening, even though hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal. Similarly, 
an allergic reaction resulting in angioedema of the f ace would not be life -threatening, even 
though angioedema of the larynx, allergic bronchospasm, or anaphylaxis can be fatal.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243969] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138822]; however, it is not in itself considered 
an SAE. In absence of an AE, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243970]. This is the case in the following situations:  
 
• The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required by 
[CONTACT_760].  
• The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112042] a routine procedure followed 
by [CONTACT_16018] (eg, stent removal after surgery).  This should be recorded in the study file.  
 
In addition, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition that has not worsened does not constitute 
an SAE.  
 
Disability  is defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.  
 
If there is any doubt about whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information is treated 
as an SAE.  
 
  19 
PI [CONTACT_5627] : [CONTACT_669843]  
IRB # 2019 -1017  
Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) A protocol -related adverse event  is an AE occurring during a clinical study that is not related 
to the test article, but is considered by [CONTACT_55886] (or designee) to be 
related to the research conditions, ie, related to the fact that a subject is participatin g in the study. 
For example, a protocol -related AE may be an untoward event occurring during a washout 
period or an event related to a medical procedure required by [CONTACT_760].  
 
Other Reportable Information.   Certain information, although not considered an SAE, must be 
recorded, reported, and followed up as indicated for an SAE.   This includes:  
 
• Pregnancy exposure to a test article, except for exposure to prenatal vitamins. If a pregnancy 
is confirmed, use of the test article must be discontinued immediately. Information about 
pregnancy exposure includes the entire course of pregnancy and delivery , and perinatal and 
neonatal outcomes, even if there are no abnormal findings.  Both maternal and paternal 
exposure are considered other reportable information. For exposure involving the female 
partner of a male subject, the necessary information must be collected from the subject, while 
respecting the confidentiality of the partner.  
• Lactation exposure to a test article with or without an AE.    
• Overdose of a test article as specified in this protocol with or without an AE. Baby [CONTACT_243982].  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a test article with or without an AE . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_904488]’s AEs and SAEs will be recorded and reported from the signing of the informed 
consent form t o the completion of post -treatment outcome measures collection at [ADDRESS_904489]. Chulhyun Ahn  will notify GIRB of all study SAEs in accordance with policy guidelines. If 
an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report, a follow -up report including all relevant 
new or reassessed information (e .g. concomitant medication, medical history) will be submitted 
to GIRB. An SAE will be followed until either resolved or stabilized.   
[ADDRESS_904490]:  
• Be informed of all pertinent aspects of the study and all elements of informed consent.  
• Be given time to ask questions and time to consider the decision to participate.  
• Be allowed to visually and manually inspect the device.  
• Voluntarily agree to participate in the study.  
• Sign and date an IRB -approved informed consent form.

IRB # 2019 -1017  
Version 1.2 ( 5/22/20) 8.[ADDRESS_904491], the assignment of a study ID number to each  
individual participant and the protocol of providing only the necessary associated clinical  
information to the remainder of the research team will mitigate this risk. All data will be coded 
and encrypted while being transferred.

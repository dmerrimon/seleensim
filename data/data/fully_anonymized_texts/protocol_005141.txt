Document template: F-167 Clinical Investigat ion Plan Rev: 091.INTRODUCTION
Total joint arthroplasty is a safe and effective procedure improving the quality of  life an d 
restoring function to patients w ith arthritis of the hip and knee. Although its general succ ess is 
beyond dispute, postoperative complications such as periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) still 
occur1.
Most surgical w ounds heal rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] w ithout complications; how ever some can become infected. 
Such infe ctions occur when microorganisms are introduced through the surgical incision as a 
result of  bacteria or fungi migration from the patient´s skin or gastrointestinal tract ,direct 
transfer from surgical instruments, equipment or hands of healthcare w orkers or via airb orne 
route.2
Every time the dressing needs to be changed, there is an increased risk of the w ound becoming 
exposed to contamination. The evidence for optimal choice of  dressing is based on chronic 
wounds and not surgical w ounds ,2However,in 2014 ,an International Consensus Meeting on 
Periprosthetic Joint Infection w as held at which delegates from various dis ciplines worldw ide 
participated and came to a consensus that an occlusive dressing after total joint arthroplasty 
(TJA) should be used.3Occlusive dressings protect the w ound from both pathogenic invasion 
and further trauma. They act as barriers and prevent t he entry of outside pathogens that m ight 
infect the w ound and delay healing. Since they conf orm to the body's contours, they are more 
likely to remain in place and offer protection from further trauma as w ell. They move as the body 
moves, making them less susceptible to shear ingand tearing during the daily activities .4
NICE (2008) guidelines on the prevention and treatment of surgical site infection and the DH 
(2007) High Impact Intervention care bundle recomm endthatdressings applied in operating 
theatre should remain in situ for at least [ADDRESS_865605] dried into their wound. Dressings that do not cause skin damage upon 
removal are now  available. The World Union of Wound Healing Societies initiative, ‘‘Principles 
of Best Practice: M inimising Pain at Dressing -Related Procedures: Implementati on of Pain 
Relieving Strategies ’’,recommends that clinicians use dres sings that minimize trauma/pain
during application and removal .5
Even blister s lead to increased pain, delayed healing andincreased susceptibility to w ound 
infection as the integrity of the skin has been breach ed. Blistering occurs w hen the dermis 
becomes s eparated f rom the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], w hich is invariably the result of continued abrasion. The 
deep, finger -like projections of epi[INVESTIGATOR_646519], allow ing the tw oskin layers to separate . The incidence of w ound blister shas been 
reported in the literature of between 6 -24%.6
When developi[INVESTIGATOR_646520] w ound complications and surgical site infections this can 
increase r ecovery times, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646521] y rates .7

Document template: F-167 Clinical Investigat ion Plan Rev: 09In a prospective randomized controlled study, three types of dressings (Mepore Pro, Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646522]) w ere compared in [ADDRESS_865606] to prevalence of tape blisters. The blister prevalence w as 
significantly low er for the Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646523] (4%), than for the Mepore Pro group (51%, 
p<0.01) and Hypafix group (61%, p<0.01). The total number of dressings used during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] w ere also significantly low er for the Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646524] (p<0.01). The conclusion was that the dressing w ith a silicone adhesive 
(Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646525]) signi ficantly reduced the prevalence of blisters follow ing hip s urgery .[ADDRESS_865607] Market Clinical Follow -Up Study (MxB Po 01), Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646516]-Op was used in [ADDRESS_865608] -Op with the high absorption capacity, flexible 
wound pad, broader border and the skin friendly Safetac®Technology le d to good stay on abilit y
(7 days ), no blisters, no skin strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], al most no pain at dressing removal, no dressing related 
infections and no hypersensitive reaction.[ADDRESS_865609] been conducted show ing that Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646526] w ound bed and surrounding skin upon dressing removal, has good 
exudate management,9,10reduce the number of  microorganisms,10,11,12minimizes pain to the 
patient during dressing removal, minimizes the risk of maceration and is easy to handle.9,10,11,12
The adhesive is Safetac®Technology (silicon), a unique and patented adhesive technology that 
minimiz es pain to patients and trauma to w ounds and the surrounding skin. Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646516]-Op Ag is an upgraded version of the Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646527].
The overall rationale for this investigation is to evaluate the clinical performance potential for 
Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_447666] -Op Agin the ability to minimiz e the risk of skin related post -operative 
wound complications such as blistering , maceration and redness at the incision and surrounding 
skin.
1.1Risk/benefit Assessment
Incorrect dressing selection may leads to increased rates of blistering and w ound discharge. 
This, in turn, may translate into additional costs caused by [CONTACT_646538] a prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].[ADDRESS_865610] show n that M epi[INVESTIGATOR_646518] w ith the adhesive Safetac®
Technology is effective and skin friendly.9,10Since the Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_447666] -Op Ag is an 
upgraded version of Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_646528] w ill be further looked at in this 
investigation. It is believed that these upgrades w ill give both the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646529] w hen it comes to application, conformation to the 
body contours and ability to stay on.
Site staff w ill be trained on how  to use the investigational device and subjects w ill be closely 
monitored during the investigation. Adverse events (AEs), Adverse Device Effects (ADEs) 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE),  and Device Deficiencies (DD) w ill be registered throughout the 
investigation. The investigation w ill also be subjected to IRB review  and approval before any 
subjects are included.

This definition includes events related to the investigational medical dev ice or the 
comparator.
This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.
For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical devices.
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) 
Adverse Event related to the use of an investigational medical device

PRO CEDURES FOR SAE AND/OR SADE REPORTING OR REPORTING OF DD THAT 
COULD HAVE LED TO A SADE
The investigator must inform Mölnlycke Health Care (MHC), w ithin 1 calender day of aw areness 
of the event. When a SAE/SADE has been entered into the eCRF by [CONTACT_093]

Device Deficiencies that might have led to SADE if either a) suitable action had not been taken, 
b) if interven tion had not been made, or c) if circumstances had been less fortunate must be 
reported as a SADE.
The investigator is responsible for informing the EC/IRB and/or the Competent Authority of the 
SAE/SADE as per local requirements.
PRO CEDURES FOR DD REPORT ING 
All DD shall be reported to MHC as soon as possible, w ithout unjustified delay . If the DD m ight 
have led to a SADE the reporting requirements for SADE described above must be follow ed.

2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Lung Cancer: A Major Public Health and Clin ical Challenge  
The incidence and prevalence of lung cancer has risen dramatically. In 1953, primary 
lung cancer became the most common cause of cancer death in men, while the same 
occurred for women in [ADDRESS_902754] common site for 
metastatic disease (secondary lung cancers), which are identified in 30 -55% of 
metastatic cancer patients.2  
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of primary lung cancer 
(~ 85%). Stage I disease (small lesion, no spread in lymph nodes) and stage II disease 
(larger lesion, no spread in lymph nodes and involvement of structures such as the chest 
wall or diaphragm, or involvement of hilar lymph nodes) make up about a third of 
patients with NSCLC.[ADDRESS_902755] established surgical 
resection of a single lobe of the lung, or lobectomy, as the treatment of choice for 
operable lung cancer patients in stage I and II,1 improving survival to up t o 75%.1,2 For 
those patients with stage IIIa disease (involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal lymph 
nodes), surgical resection plays a role a fter chemoradiation therapy, provided no further 
spread of disease has occurred, and patients remain medically operable. The lung is 
also a common site for metastatic spread from other primary cancers (most common: 
breast, colon, sarcoma and melanoma). Exp erience with surgical resection of secondary 
lung cancers (pulmonary metastasectomy), once the primary cancer has been 
controlled, has confirmed that resection can substantially prolong survival and 
potentially cure some patients.3-8 In 2015, lung cancer accounted for $13.4 billion in 
costs out of a total expense of  cancer care of $147.5 billion.9 Lung cancer patients often 
experience multidimensional impairments affecting quality -of-life ( QoL) duri ng their 
course of disease.[ADDRESS_902756] on public and population he alth. 
Protocol name: [CONTACT_668466]: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_668420], MS, PhD  
Page [ADDRESS_902757] chance for cure. The goal of surgical resection 
for lung cancer patients is excis ion of one or more lobes of the lung that are affected 
by [CONTACT_67380]. For secondary lung cancers, this goal is complete removal of the lesion with 
adequate margins. Lung cancer patients suffer substantial functional decline and 
reduced activity levels followin g surgical lung resection.11-13 There is a significant 
deterioration in six minute walk (6MW) distance at five days post -operatively 
compared with pre -operatively (average of 337m vs. 467m).11 Lung resection is 
associated with an immediate 12% reduction in exercise tolerance and 18% reduction 
in pulmonary function.[ADDRESS_902758] on pos t-surgery health -
related QoL14-16 and causes persistent pain following surgical tr eatment for up to 33% 
of patients.17 The postsurgical period is associated with a 20 -40% reduction in 
physiological and f unctional capacity, particularly in the elderly with comorbidities, 
who may never return to pre -surgery levels of function.18-[ADDRESS_902759] -operative complication s and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].60 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_668431] g evidence, implementation of exercise programs in clinical 
practice for patients with lung cancer is still low, perhaps due to unacceptable financial 
and resource demands on the patient and the health care system (e.g., center -based 
exercise). There are f urther gaps in the evidence base: Although the majority of  
exercise studies have demonstrated positive impact, only a small Turkish trial has 
covered the continuum from pre -surge ry to the survivorship period,[ADDRESS_902760] been developed outside of the [LOCATION_002], and there are 
currently only two American trials recruiting patients, both of which differ substantially

year following t he completion of therapy and requires participants to attend three 
supervised sessions  per week (NCT 01068210). The other trial provides mindfulness -
based pulmonary rehabilitation prior to surgery for both lung cancer and COPD patients 
(NCT 01682850). There is clearly a need for testing innovative exercise interventions 
in lung cancer patients that can be translated into clinical practice across the entire 
continuum of care.  
2.4 Physical Functioning (AM -PAC Scores ) Among Lung Cancer Patients at 
HCI  
The AM -PAC mobility score61 was implemented as the inpatient mobility assessment 
tool in June of 2014 within the U niversity  of Utah Health Care system (UUHS) and has 
become a standard mobility measure collected by [CONTACT_149440][INVESTIGATOR_668432]’s 
acute hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] ( see Appendi ces 1-3). The PEP Study team plans to extend assessments 
to pre-surgery visits for the standardized precision exercise program. As part of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], n  = [ADDRESS_902762]. Varghese’s clinic from lung cancer 
patients during their pre -operative outpatient clinic visit. The average score was 5 4 ± 
13. Patients were 54% female, with mean age of 61  ± 15 years. Overall 44% of patients 
were categorized as AM -PAC stage 3, indicating that they had difficulty with 
community mobility. Eighteen % had stage 2, indicating that they had difficulty with 
mobility within the home. Patients ranging across mobility stages [ADDRESS_902763] likelihood in  resulting in 
positive outcomes.  The level of physical function of patients in the clinic can vary 
widely, reinforcing the PEP concept of an exercise intervention that is tailored for the 
mobility stage of each patient. No correlations between the AM -PAC score and age, 
sex or cancer stage (all p  > 0.05; ǀrǀ  < 0.30); some [ADDRESS_902764], one randomized controlled trial (RCT)[ADDRESS_902765] been “one size fits all,” lacking a personalized 
approach to optim ize adherence and efficacy.65-[ADDRESS_902766] a pragmatic and personalized exercise 
intervention (i.e., face to face visits at clinical contacts, telephone counseling in the 
home, and personalized exercise prescriptions) before and following surgery for

Page 15 of 44 patients with lung cancer. Unfortunately, the application of per sonalized principles of 
exercise in randomized controlled trials with cancer survivors (specifically non -breast 
cancer survivors) i s incomplete and inconsistent.69 To establish consistency in the 
exercise prescription while accommodating the exercise to match the patient’s level of 
mobility, a validated basic mobility assessment tool to create modes and dosages of 
exercise that can be imple mented across the continuum of the pre - and post -operative 
surgical experience in lung cancer patients. The Activity Measure -Post Acute Care™ 
(AM -PAC) (described in Figure 2) will be used as the basic mobility assessment tool 
that prompts the prescribed exercise mode and dose for the patient. The AM -PAC has 
been developed as a pragmatic measurement system that can be used across care 
settings and a very broad range of impairmen ts, limitations and diagnoses.70 The PEP 
Study’s approach with the use of AM -PAC will address a gap in the care of lung cancer 
patients, i.e., the underutilization of exercise because it is clinically not pragmatic and 
it is not known how a nd when to implement exercise.[ADDRESS_902767]. Ulric h’s previous work with the empi[INVESTIGATOR_668433], which will be adapted for lung 
cancer patients. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA ) describes a general 
framework for sel f-regulation and behavior change among individuals with chronic 
illness.72-78 The overarching conceptual basis i s the social cognitive model 74-76 which 
posits that high levels of both motivation and self -efficacy are necessary for behavior 
change.29 Thus, in the HAPA model, a key element for lasting behavior change is a 
motivational shift that instigates a decision and commitment to change. In the absence 
of such a shift, skill training is viewed as premature.74,79,80 As such, the PEP 
intervention focuses on both enhancing the motivation to achieve and maintain change, 
as well as developi[INVESTIGATOR_183696] -efficacy and skills necessary to do so. Many interventions 
focus largely on either motivation or problem -solving/skills t raining despi[INVESTIGATOR_668434]. When motivation is addressed, the focus 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_668435] a change attempt, with little attention given to the motivation 
to maintain change. Specific components of the PEP  intervention include: 
individualized tailoring of the exercise prescription; individualized tailoring of the 
counseling based on motivation and self -efficacy to engage in exercise including the 
use of simple motivational interviewing (MI) 79 techniques (e.g., reflective listening, 
avoiding argumentation; developi[INVESTIGATOR_668436]); identifying barriers to exercising 
and problem -solving solutions; use of goal setting and self -monitoring (including via 
the activity tracker); and, implementing specific strategies for improving self -efficacy 
(e.g., building a series of small achie vable goals; practicing specific exercises during 
the face to face visits to increase mastery ( see Figure 1).  
In sum, the PEP intervention is a directive but patient -centered approach designed to 
enhance motivation for change, and increase self -efficacy i n a non -confrontational 
manner. Several meta -analyses  and systematic reviews have supported the efficacy of 
both social cognitive and MI -based interventions for behavior change in general and 
with respect to cancer patients specifically.81-85

resistance) and dosages (low, moderate, high) tailored to the patient’s AM -PAC 
mobility stage.  
The baseline observed 6MW distance varied from 209 -679m with a mean distance of 
467±119m. Normal 6MW distance for h ealthy [ADDRESS_902770] -operative 6MW distances were obtained prior 
to 10/15 (max. follow -up time [ADDRESS_902771] -operative days within the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]). Compared to 
comparable control patients (for whom 6MW dist ances at comparable pre - and post -
time points were available) PEP patients maintained their physical function and 
experienced a lesser reduction in 6MW distance (median 6.8% decline in PEP and 
18.7% in controls, see Figure 1). Although this comparison is n ot based on a 
randomized study, it is notable that the decrease (47m) in 6MW distance in the controls 
exceeded the minimal clinically important distance, despi[INVESTIGATOR_668438]. To date, only one patient has 
dropped out (5.5% drop -out rate).  
A follow -up phone evaluation of the PEP intervention showed that patients planned to 
exercise an average of 4.7 days per week and 93% agreed (86% strongly) that exercise 
should be part of their cancer  treatment; 86% also strongly agreed with the statement 
that they believe that the exercise program will have a positive effect on their cancer 
treatment. Several patients noted that they loved being in the program and the effort of 
our team. They emphasiz ed that the exercise intervention helped them immensely with 
recovery from surgery.

Page 17 of 44 In conclusion, these preliminary results demonstrate that: (1) our team has successfully 
worked together on the PEP study intervention, generated pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], and two scien tific 
abstracts ;90,91 (2) lung cancer patients differ dramatically in their functional status, 
independent of age, sex and stage, requiring individualized interventions; (3) the PEP 
intervention was feasible within the existing workflow of a high -volume su rgical clinic, 
with only the addition of a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_668439]; (4) the PEP 
intervention is welcomed by [CONTACT_668461]; and (5) our 
assumptions for anticipated patient recruitment (65%) and drop -out ra tes (15%) are 
conservative. Overall, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_668440] a successful clinical trial . 
[ADDRESS_902772] s of a personalized exercise 
program (PEP) in NSCLC patients (stage I, II,  IIIa) and secondary lung cancer patients 
undergoing surgical treatment at the University of Utah  and comparing the intervention 
to the current standard of care (no exercise program) .  
Eligible p atients will be randomized between two arms  (1:1 ratio) prior to the surgery 
and will be followed for [ADDRESS_902773] -surgery : 
 An Intervention Arm (referred to in materials as Group 1) which features pre - 
and post -surgery PEP interventions.  
 A Control Arm (referred to in materials as Group 2)  which doe s not include a 
personalized exercise program (the standard of care).  Patients randomized to 
the Control Arm will be given the opportunity to participate in a PEP -
intervention session providing exercise counseling after the 6 month assessment 
and will rece ive a free activity tracker for their participation.  
3.2 Number of Patient s 
The target enrollment for the randomized clinical trial is 200 patients ( approximately  
106 men and 94 women).  It is estimated that 300 patients will be approached about the 
study which will achieve a conservative recruitment rate of 65% .

5.1 Control Group  
Patient s randomized to the Control Group (Group 2) will not experience any changes 
in the standard of care for lung cancer patients according to their cancer stage.  Although 
patients are encouraged to increase walking both in the pre -surgery and post -surgery 
period, there is no formalized pre -surgery exercise program. Upon study completion 
(at the [ADDRESS_902781] -surgery follow -up visit), participants in the Control Group will be 
offered a PEP -intervention session with precision exercise counseling and receive a 
free activity tracker.  
5.2 Intervention Group  
The PEP intervention involves a combination of home -based exer cise as well as in -
patient exercise. The exercise modes will include basic transfer and calisthenics 
mobility, aerobic and resistance exercises and will be performed in various postures 
(supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], sitting, standing and walking) with variable challenges (leve l walking, 
bending, inclines, steps and squatting).  
For patients randomized to the Intervention Group (Group 1) , the PEP intervention will 
be personalized, implemented, and modified (based on the patients AM -PAC mobility 
stage) by a licensed physical thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_668441] -to-face meetings (~30 -40 minutes) . An 
exercise education manual, specifically developed for this study, will be used by [CONTACT_242246][INVESTIGATOR_668442].  
5.2.[ADDRESS_902782] in accordance with the exercise education manual and the 
patient’s AM -PAC mobility stage.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_902783] will go over (verbally and in writing) the individual 
exercise modes and dosages to be performed at home. Although individually -
prescribed, the exercise mode and dosage will be standardized with respect to the 
patient’s AM -PAC mobility stage  (as shown in Figure 2) . For example, a patient in 
AM-PAC mobility stage 3 will progress  from walking on level surfaces for 10 minutes 
per day at a “somewhat hard” perceived exertion with the ability to talk but not sing 
during walking. The rate of steps/minute will be ~100. Additionally, this patient will 
also perform squatting exercise at t he same perceived exertion for short bouts that add 
up to 5 minutes per day. These aerobic and resistance exercises will be progressed to 
20 minutes and 10 minutes per day respectively as they progress to AM -PAC mobility 
stage 4.

Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_668420], MS, PhD  
Page 20 of 44 Patients will be given acc ess to instruction  sheets  demonstrating exercise modes  along 
with exercise tools (e.g., light weights and external resistance bands), tracking 
diary/calendar and activity tracker  (see note below)  for the home -based exercise 
program.  
Telephone calls or Tel eHealth interactions between the participant and the physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_668443] , optimize patient engagement, and 
adjust exercise prescriptions remotely as needed.  
Ongoing monitoring of attitudes and barriers to exercise  will occur and strategies for 
encouraging uptake of the exercise intervention will be individually tailored. U of Utah 
TeleHealth capabilities, including video chat, will be used to augment telephone 
communications.  
Note : the activity tracker, a  consumer  wearable device (e.g., Fitbit Zip Wireless 
Activity Tracker) , will be used as a pragmatic motivational and self -monitoring tool to 
improve participant exercise efficacy and home exercise program adherence.86 
 
Figure 2: AM -PAC stages (according to Arbane) and corresponding exercise modes 
and dosages.  
5.2.3 Interruption and Discontinuation  
The PEP intervention is already personalized, implemented, and modified based on an 
individual’s patient characteristics. However, if, at any time during the study a 
participant develops an illness that contraindicates exercise in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_668444]  (includ ing but not limited to those described in exclusion criterion 
4.2.1) , the patient’s primary care physician will be consult ed regarding whether and 
when it would be safe to re -start the exercise program.  
Should any participant develop any condition that would limit their ability to fully 
participate in the prescribed protocol, the participant would be temporarily, or if 
necessary permanently, withdrawn from the study .

An analogous approach will be used for endpoints coded as binary variables 
(complications, readmission) using logistic regression models instead of an alysis of 
covariance models. If diagnostics plots show significant deviation from model 
assumptions, th en a separate sensitivity analysis will be performed using appropriate

and adverse e vent are used interchangeably. Medical conditions/diseases present before 
starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the 
PEP regimen. Abnormal test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical sig ns or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
For this low -risk study, information about a subset of adverse events of interest will be 
collected, recorded and followed as appropriate. This subset includes all injuries, 
events, and conditions which could be related to the PEP intervention and require 
medical attention.  
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105] -directive questioning of the 
patient at each visit or phone contact [CONTACT_61641] . Adverse events also may be 
detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_11581] t during or between visits or through 
physical examination  or other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event 
should be evaluated to determine:  
1. Its severity grade based on CTCAE v.4 (grade 1 -5). 
2. Its relationship to the PEP intervention (definite, probable, possible, unlikely, 
not related).  
3. Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) . 
4. Action taken (no action taken; PEP intervention adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant 
medication taken; non -drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
5. Whether it constitutes an SAE.  
All adverse events will be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes 
in the intervention (as described in Figure 2 ). Once an adverse event is detected, it 
should be followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or 
more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to 
the PEP regimen , the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
14.[ADDRESS_902809] be reported to the DSMC as well as the IRB and the FDA (when applicable) 
according to the requirements  described below:  
The Investigator (or a properly delegated study team member) must complete a  
MedWatch 3500A form and submit it to the Research Compliance Office  
([EMAIL_6715] ) as soon as possible,  but no later than [ADDRESS_902810] knowledge or notification of the event (5 business days for fatal or life threatening 
event).  
Protocol name: [CONTACT_668466]: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_668420], MS, PhD  
Page 32 of 44 14.5.1  DSMC Notifications  
Upon receipt of the MedWatch 3500A, an HCI Re ssearch Compliance Officer will 
process and submit th e form to the proper DSMC member as necessary for this study.  
The RCO will summarize and present all reported SAEs according to the Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan at the quarterly DSMC meeting.  
14.5.2  IRB Notifications  
Events meeting the University of Utah IRB reporting requirements (described at 
(https://irb.utah.edu ) will be submitted by [CONTACT_737] (or a properly delegated 
study team member) through the IRB’s electronic reporting system (ERICA) within 10 
working days . 
14.5.3  FDA Notifications  
Adverse events occurring during the course of a clinical study that meet the following 
criteria will be promptly reported to the FDA:  
 Serious  
 Unexpected  
 Definitely, probably, or possibly related to the intervention  
Fatal or life -threate ning events which meet the criteria above will be reported within [ADDRESS_902811] knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_093]; followed by [CONTACT_58691] a report as possible within [ADDRESS_902812] s of preserving the safety of all patients 
included in the trial.  
14.7 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation (or violation) is any departure from the defined procedures and 
treatment plans as outlined in the protocol version submitted and previously approved  
by [CONTACT_1201]. Protocol deviations have the potential to place participants at risk and can 
also undermine the scientific integrity of the study thus jeopardizing the justification 
for the research.  Protocol deviations are unplanned and unintentional events .  
Protocol name: [CONTACT_668466]: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_668420], MS, PhD  
Page 33 of 44 Because some protocol deviations pose no conceivable threat to participant safety or 
scientific integrity, reporting is left to the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215442]. The IRB requires the prompt reporting  of protocol deviat ions 
which are:  
 Exceptions to eligibility criteria.  
 Intended to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant, 
or  
 Harmful (caused harm to participants or others, or place them at increased 
risk of harm - including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm), or  
 Possible serious or continued noncompliance  
14.8 FDA Annual Reporting  
This study is IND exempt therefore there are no annual reporting requirements to the 
FDA.   
14.9 Clinical Trials Data Bank  
The study will be registered on http://clinicaltrials.gov  and the NCI CTRP (Clinical 
Trials Reporting Program) by [CONTACT_154464].

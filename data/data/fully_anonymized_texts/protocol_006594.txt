IRB- [ZIP_CODE]  Page 7 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol version 2 ;  15 November  2021  1. OBJECTIVE  
Specific Aim  
To evaluate 68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/MRI and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for biopsy guidance in patients 
with suspected prostate cancer.  
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Preliminary information  
Prostate cancer  (PRCA) kills ~29 ,000 American men each yea r (1).  However, most of the 
~180,000 new cases  diagnosed each year are not deadly .  While the 50% drop in PRCA 
specific mortality in the US occurred concurrently with systematic PSA screening starting in the 
1980s, the PLCO randomized trial of PSA screening showed no survival benefit, and ERSPC in Europe showed a small but positive benefit to PSA screening (2, 3).  Two significant limitations 
of PSA testing c ontribute to the poor results of these trials and form the basis of this proposal:  
 The 1
st limitation is that PSA has poor sensitivity and specificity with ~15% of men with PRCA 
having a normal PSA (4) while 60 -80% of men who are biopsied are found to have no cancer, 
either because there is none and the PSA test was falsely positive or the cancer is missed by 
[CONTACT_81826]  (5).  Until recently, tr ansrectal ultrasound ( TRUS) has been the only widely available 
used imaging modality .  Because of the major limitations of TRUS for PRCA detection, 
diagnosis is most commonly accomplished by [CONTACT_152408] 
12 needles passed through the rectum under TRUS guidance, rather than directing biopsy to any particular target seen in the gland on TRUS images .  This biopsy procedure can be painful 
and is associated with significant and increasing rates of infectious complications  (6, 7).  Since 
autopsy studies show that many men have small, indolent cancers that are not likely to be life threatening ( 8), PSA driven biopsy leads to overdiagnosis of indolent cancers  (9) that are not 
clinically significant .  The ideal approach would be to eliminate unnecessary biopsies in men 
with no cancer or indolent cancer, and selectively biopsy men with aggressive cancers who are 
more likely to benefit from therapy.  
 
The 2
nd limitation is that PSA screening and biopsies miss a significant number of aggressive 
cancers, either by [INVESTIGATOR_25818] -sampling high grade cancers, or by [CONTACT_152409]  
(10-12).  The ideal approach would be to direct biopsies towards the areas of most aggressive 
tumor, so that biopsy accurately reflects the severity of their disease.  
 In response to these shortcomings of PSA screening as well as the significant treatment associated side effects  (13), the management of localized PRCA has changed dramatically in 
the past 5 years to directly address the problem of over -treatment  (5).  One of the greatest 
changes has been the increased use of Active Surveillance ( AS) in men with low grade, low risk 
PRCA  (14).  In the US, rates of AS have increased from 5- 9% in 1990 -2010 to 40%, while in 
Europe, rates are 80  to 90% (15-17).  Gleason scoring is an established marker of outcome and 
is the most important factor used in selecting patients for AS  (5).  Low grade cancers (Grade 
group 1 or Gleason score 3 + 3 + 6) are recommended for AS, while cases > 3 + 4 (or in some 
cases > 4 + 3) are recommend for definitive therapy  (18).  Therefore, accurate identification of 
cases with grade > 3 + [ADDRESS_175515] PCA3 (a lncRNA over -expressed in PRCA), as well as the 
IRB- [ZIP_CODE]  Page 8 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol version 2 ;  [ADDRESS_175516] emerged (both assessing molecular forms of PSA)  
(19-21).  These tests have been calibrated to identify men who do not need biopsy, and can 
decrease biopsy rates by 10- 20%.  However, many unnecessary biopsies continue to occur, 
and none of these tests effectively identifies aggressive PRCA .  For example, neither the PCA3 
or 4K  score provide clinically meaningful prediction of outcomes in men on AS and cannot be 
used in clinical decision- making in this large and growing cohort of men  (22, 23).  New 
technologies are critically needed to eliminate unnecessary biopsies in men with no cancer or 
indolent cancer, and to better identify men with aggressive forms ( ≥ 3 + 4) of PRCA.  
 
Recently, novel PET tracers that target PRCA cells have emerged as promising methods to improve PRCA imaging.  PET tracers such as 
18F- or 11C-labeled choline and 11C-acetate are 
used at selected institutions in the [LOCATION_003] ( 24, 25) but uptake in benign prostatic 
hyperplasia ( BPH) or inflammatory lymph nodes  (26, 27) limits their clinical utility .  A new 
synthetic amino acid 18F-FACBC suffers from limited specificity as its uptake in PRCA is 
reported to be similar to that in BPH  (28).  Prostate- specific membrane antigen ( PSMA) is a cell 
surface protein significantly over -expressed in PRCA cells, and anti -PSMA antibodies labeled 
with 68Ga and 18F-labeled radiotracers can detect PRCA relapses and metastases by [CONTACT_152410] .  While PSMA appears to be a very promising molecular 
imaging target  (29, 30), it does  not detect all recurrences (31, 32) and is not specific to PRCA 
only (33, 34).  False positives have also been reported ( 35-37).  Gastrin releasing peptide 
receptor  (GRPR) has emerged as a novel imaging target which is also highly expressed in 
PRCA and has much lower expression in benign prostate tissue including BPH and inflammation  (38).  This high specificity provides an advantage over current choline- and 
acetate -based radiotracers .  GRPR can be targeted by [CONTACT_152411]- like peptides .  Compared to antibodies, peptides are usually cleared faster, penetrate 
tissue more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], show lower antigenicity, and can be synthesized in large quantities 
relatively easily, making GRPR an attractive target  (39).  Also, a clear difference of RM2 
expression level between Gleason patterns 3 and ≥  4 has been shown with higher expression of 
RM2 antigen significantly associated with primary Gleason pattern ≥ 4, high Gleason 
score (≥ 8), larger tumor volume, and advanced tumor stage  (40).  Furthermore, 5 -year PSA 
failure -free survival was significantly lower in the higher expression groups  (40).   
 
The sponsor -investigator [CONTACT_152421] holds Investigational New Drug applications  (INDs) for both
 
68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA -11 (IND  and IND , respectively ) and the  group has  
significant experience using both tracers in currently ongoing clinical  studies  at our institution.  
To improve the performance of MRI imaging in the prostate, one possible solution could be to 
combine molecular imaging strategies .  MRI provides excellent soft tissue contrast and mpMRI 
has significantly improved PRCA detection in the prostate.  PET/MRI can increase the specificity of MRI alone when using PRCA specific PET tracers  (41).  We propose testing this 
multimodal imaging platform in patients with early stage PRCA to understand its performance 
characteristics for detection, particularly for aggressive disease (defined as high grade > 3 + 4 ). 
2.2 Clinicaltrials.gov  
This protocol will be registered on Clinicaltrials. Gov.  ClinicalTria ls.gov outcomes are described 
in Section 2.4.3.  

IRB- [ZIP_CODE] Page 9of 22 CONFIDENTIAL Protocol version 2 ;  15 November [ZIP_CODE].3Rationale
In this study, we propose to use a well -established PET isotope, Gallium -68(68Ga), bound to a 
PSMA ligand (ie,68Ga-PSMA -11)and a GRPR ligand (ie,68Ga-RM2) that have high affinity for 
prostate specific membrane antigen and gastrin releasing peptide receptors, respectively .  
Therefore, we propose the following aim: to evaluate 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET/MRI and 68Ga-RM2 
PET/MRI for biopsy guidance in patients with suspected prostate cancer.
We have an ongoing protocol at Stanford University evaluating 68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/MRI for 
evaluation of extent of disease in patients with intermediate or high- riskprostate cancer 
scheduled to undergo prostatectomy and nodal dissection.  Our initial analysis of the fir st 
33 participants showed that prostate cancer was seen using 68Ga-PSMA -11 PET in all patients, 
whereas multiparametric MR imaging depi[INVESTIGATOR_152404] ( PI-RADS) 4 or 5 lesions in 26 patients and PI -RADS 3 lesions in four patients .  Focal 
uptake was seen in the pelvic lymph nodes in five patients .  Pathologic examination confirmed 
prostate cancer in all patients, as well as nodal metastasis in three .  All patients with normal 
pelvic nodes in PET/MR imaging had no metastases at pathologic examination (42).  
Figure 1 :  74 year -old man (participant #4) with recently diagnosed intermediate risk, T1c, Gleason 
4+4 prostate cancer presenting with PSA of 4.12 ng/mL.  Maximum intensity projection (MIP) PSMA 
11 PET image (A), early transaxial PET (B) and delayed transaxial PET (C) showed focal uptake in histopathological proven prostate cancer (F).  The milder focal uptake in the left lobe was likewise proven to be prostate cancer.  Transaxial T2- weighted MRI (D) and DWI (B =800) MRI (E) are also 
shown.  Only the right -side tumor was mpMRI positive (PI -RADS 5).
In addition, we now have pi[INVESTIGATOR_26923] 12 participants with intermediate or high-risk 
prostate cancer scheduled to undergo prostatectomy and nodal dissection who had 
68Ga-RM2 PET/CT prior to surgery. Prostate cancer was identified in all 12 patients.

Figure 2 :  68 year -old man (participant #2) with recently diagnosed intermediate risk, T1c, Gleason 
3+4 prostate cancer presenting with PSA of 4.53 ng/mL.  Maximum intensity projection (MIP) RM2

3.4 Study Timeline  
3.4.1 Primary Completion:  
The study  will reach primary completion 24  months from the time the study opens to accrual.  
3.4.2 .  Study Completion:  
The study will reach study completion [ADDRESS_175524],and is described 
within IND , the IND to which this protocol is submitted.  The structure of 68Ga-RM2 is 
represented in Figure 3.

Figure  3:  Chemical structure of 68Ga-RM2  
 
The administered dosage of 68Ga-RM2 will be 140  mBq ± 20%, administered IV.  Measured 
human dosimetry data are available from published data ( 47).  68Ga-RM2 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_152405].  Maximum peak uptake of the total injected radioactivity was seen in the urinary bladder 
contents and the liver, with approximately 36% and 14%, respectively.  
 
The organ with the highest absorbed dose was the urinary bladder wall at 0.61 mSv/MBq, followed by [CONTACT_152412] 0.51  mSv/MBq.  The mean effective dose (14) was 
0.051 mSv/MBq.  Thus, the effective dose from a 140- MBq injected radioactivity is 7.7  mSv, 
which could be reduced to roughly 4.76  mSv with frequent bladder voiding (1- hr voids).  
To summarize the results of the published human dosimetry study, there were no observed adverse events to the radiopharmaceutical.  The measured dosimetry showed that the critical organ with 
68Ga-RM2 is the urinary bladder, followed by [CONTACT_152413].  The effective dose of 
68Ga-RM2 reported (0.051 mSv/MBq) is approximately twice as much as those of 
68Ga-DOTA -TOC  (0.023  mSv/MBq), 68Ga-DOTA -NOC (0.025 mSv/MBq), 68Ga-DOTA -TATE 
(0.021  mSv/MBq) and 68Ga-NOTA -RGD  (0.022 mSv/MBq) (43-46). 
 
4.1.2 68Ga-PSMA11  
The PET radiopharmaceutical 68Ga-PSMA11 will also be utilized, and has previously been 
identified as DFKZ- 11;  HBED -CC PSMA;  or the “Heidelberg compound.”  This is not an 
FDA-approved product, and is described within IND  , which is c ross-referenced to 
IND .  The structure of 68Ga-PSMA11 is represented in Figure  4. 
 
Figure  4:  Chemical structure of 68Ga-PSMA11.  
 

IRB- [ZIP_CODE]  Page 14 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol version 2 ;  15 November  2021  The administered dosage of 68Ga-PSMA -11 will be 111 to 259 mBq (3 to 7 mCi) , administed IV.  
There are 2 publications on dosimetry for 68Ga-PSMA- 11 (PMID :  27260521;  28012435).  The 
first lists 0.0236  mSv/MBq for the mean effective dose, while the other indicates 
0.0258 mSv/MBq.  We used the maximum potential administered activity of 7  mCi and the 
higher of the reported  dosimetry values.  Therefore, 259  mBq x 0.0258  mSv/MBq  + 6.68 mSv.  
 
To summarize the results of the published human studies, there were no observed adverse 
events to the radiopharmaceutical.  The measured dosimetry showed that the critical organ with 
68Ga-PSMA- 11 is the spleen, followed by [CONTACT_152414] ;  pancreas ;  and bladder wall.  The 
effective dose of 68Ga-PSMA -11 reported (0.0258  mSv/MBq) is similar to 
those of 68Ga-DOTA -TOC  (0.023  mSv/MBq), 68Ga-DOTA -NOC  (0.025  mSv/MBq), 
68Ga-DOTA -TATE  (0.021  mSv/MBq) and 68Ga-NOTA -RGD (0.022  mSv/MBq) (43-46).

5.1 Modality or Modalities to be used  
PET/MRI  
 
5.2 Details of Imaging  (ie, dynamic, static, number of scans, etc ) 
A localizer MRI scan will be performed at 45 minutes after injection of 140 mBq of 68Ga-RM2 (or 
3 to 7 mCi of 68Ga-PSMA11, depending on randomization) to define the table positions .  After 
correct positioning of the spatial acquisition windows is ensured, the combined PET/MRI acquisition will be initiated with 3  to 5 table positions at a 2  to 4 minute acquisition time per table 
position.  A volumetric T1 acquis ition with fat- water separation and motion correction to enable 
free-breathing will be obtained at each table position and used for the generation of attenuation 
maps and for anatomic allocation of the PET results .  Simultaneously with the start of the 
T1 MRI sequence, the PET acquisition will start at the same table position, thus ensuring 
optimal temporal and regional correspondence between MRI and PET data.  The PET 
acquisition time will be 4  minutes per table position, taking delayed acquisition times and 
radioactive decay into account .  As the T1 will take less than 4  minutes, a rapid diffusion 
weighted MRI will also be performed.  After completion of the PET acquisition, the table will be moved to the next table position and the procedure will be repeated.  Upon completion of the 
IRB- [ZIP_CODE]  Page 15 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol version 2 ;  [ADDRESS_175528] T1 - and T2- weighted MR images may 
be obtained at multiple stations as needed.  
 
A localizer M RI scan will be performed at 45  minutes after injection of 3-7 mCi of 
68Ga-PSMA11  (or 68Ga-RM2, depending on randomization)  to define the table positions .  After 
correct positioning of the spatial acquisition windows is ensured, the combined PET/MRI 
acquisition will be initiated with [ADDRESS_175529] followed by 68Ga-RM2 within 2 weeks (50/50 chance for each 
schedule).  
 
5.3 Image interpretation  
The PET/MRI scans will be interpreted by [CONTACT_152415]-certified radiologists .  Drs Iagaru, Daniel, Davidzon, and Ghanouni  have significant clinical 
experience and will be blinded to the participants’ medical  history and the results of other 
imaging modalities .  Consensus read will be obtained for each scan .  Each lesion will be 
tabulated and a comparison of lesion detection by [CONTACT_152416] b e conducted.

6.1 Pre-Study  
Potential subjects will be referred by [CONTACT_152417] .  
The following procedures will occur pre- study:  
• Review of eligibility criteria  
• Obtain informed consent  
• Collect demographics  
• Review medical history, including any concomitant medication.   
 
6.2 Imaging Days  
Subjects will undergo 2 separate clinic visits for imaging.  On each imaging day, subjects will 
receive an intravenous  (IV) injection of investigational imaging agent (
68Ga-RM2 or 
68Ga-PMSA11) and undergo PET/MRI image collection as described above .

 This research study involves exposure to radiation from one 
68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/MRI .  There is 
no radiation exposure from MRI .  The effective dose from one typi[INVESTIGATOR_152406] 
259 mBq (range:  3 to 7 mCi) administration of 68Ga-PSMA -11 is 6.68  mSv.  Therefore, the 
effective dose from one 68Ga-PSMA- 11 PET/MRI is 6.68  mSv, approximately equal to 13%  of 
the limit that radiation workers ( eg, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] X-ray technician) are allowed to receive in 1 year.   
IRB- [ZIP_CODE]  Page 17 of 22 CONFIDENTIAL  Protocol version 2 ;  15 November  2021  This research study also involves exposure to radiation from one 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI .  There is 
no radiation exposure from MRI .  The amount of radiation from one administration of 140  mBq 
of 68Ga-RM2 is 4.76  mSv.  Therefore, the effective dose from one 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI is 
4.76 mSv, approximately equal to 10% of the limit that radiation workers ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] x -ray 
technician) are allowed to receive in one year.

and route of administration.  The study Principal Investigator  (PI) or his designee will report all 
serious adverse events (per  21CFR§312.32)  to the Stanford CCTO Safety Coordinator within 
10 working  days of becoming aware of the event (5 days if the event is life -threatening or 
resulted in death) using the Adverse Events Communication Form .  If the principal i nvestigator 
determines the unanticipated adverse effect presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the study will be terminated as soon as possible, but no later than [ADDRESS_175535] .   
9. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the study (eg , advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_152419] .  Any changes made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be 
approved by [CONTACT_14226].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the 
protocol amendment information to all participating investigators .   
 
9.[ADDRESS_175536] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC) will audit study 
related activities to determine whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the 
protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice ( GCP) . This may include review of regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility 
checklists, and source documents .  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse 
events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects .  Results of DSMC audits will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate 
regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.

10.1 Study Endpoints  
Primary endpoint :   
• Number of participants with successful PET- based biopsy guidance  
Exploratory endpoints :   
• Observation of SUV max from 68Ga-PSMA -11 uptake and Gleason score at biopsy  
• Observation of SUV max from 68Ga-RM2 uptake and Gleason score at biopsy  
10.2.  Accrual estimates  
 
We anticipate enrolling [ADDRESS_175537] the accrual of 10 patients each year for 2  years .  This is achievable given our 
experience with other protocols and the support from the referring physicians, Drs  Chung, Sonn, 
Brooks, and Gill .

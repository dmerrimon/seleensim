Efficacy 
Endpoints  Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
1. The proportion of patients in each treatment group who are considered a 
Clinical Success at Day 28 ± 2 (i.e., at least a 2-grade improvement from 
the patient’s baseline IGA score)  
2. The proportion of patients in each treatment group who are considered a 
Treatment Success for the Target Lesion at Day 28 ± 2 (i.e., a TLSS 
value of 0 or 1 at Day 28 ± 2 for each of the three signs and symptoms 
(i.e., erythema, scaling and plaque elevation ) depending on the patient’s 
baseline TLSS)  
Definitions:  
1. Treatment Success: To be considered a Treatment Success the patient’s 
TLSS value at Day 28 ± [ADDRESS_858960] be 0 or 1 if their baseline TLSS value is > 2 for e ach of the 
individual signs and symptoms 
2. Treatment Failure: A patient will be considered a Treatment Failure if:  
a. the patient’s TLSS value is > 0 if their baseline TLSS value is 2 or > 
1 if their baseline IGA score is > [ADDRESS_858961] an insufficient therapeutic 
response 
3. Clinical Success: To be considered a Clinical Success the patient must 
have at least a 2 -grade improvement from their baseline IGA score. That 
is, an IGA score of 0 at Day 28 ± 2 if their baseline IGA score is 2 or an 
IGA score of 0 or 1 at Day 28 ± 2 if their baseline IGA score is 3  
4. Clinical Failure: A patient will be considered a Clinical Failure if:

 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are: 
1. The proportion of patients with a baseline IGA score of 3 who are 
considered a Clinical Success.  
2. The proportion of patients with a baseline IGA score of 3 who are considered a Treatment Success.  
3. The proportion of patients with a baseline IGA score of 2 who are considered a Clinical Success.  
4. The proportion of patients with a baseline IGA score of 2 who are 
considered a Treatment Success.  
5. The change from baseline in %BSA affected at Day 28 ± [ADDRESS_858963] treatment will be compared with  Placebo for each primary endpoint 
at the 5% significance level (p < 0.05; two-sided, Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
exact test ) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population using last observation 
carried forward (LOCF).  As this is a multiple -site study, the interaction of 
treatment -by-site may be evaluated by [CONTACT_117889]-Day test for homogeneity 
of the odds ratio at the 5% significance level ( p < 0.05) for the primary 
efficacy variable in the ITT population for superiority testing. Superiority of 
Test over Placebo will be demonstrated if both dichotomous endpoints show 
statistical significance at the 5% significance level . For sensitivity testing, the 
primary analysis will also be performed using the per protocol (PP) 
population. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
The Test treatment will be compared with Placebo for each dichotomous 
secondary endpoint at the 5% significance level ( p < 0.05; two-sided, 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel exact test) in the ITT population using LOCF.  
The Test treatment will be compared with  Placebo for the continuous 
secondary endpoint at the 5% significance level  in the ITT population using 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) . Analysis of Covariance 
(ANCOVA) will be used for the evaluation of the continuous secondary 
endpoint using baseline %BSA as a covariate. 
For the secondary efficacy analyses, superiority of Test over Placebo will be 
considered supported for each endpoint if the difference is statistically 
significantly greater than 0 at the 5% significance level. There will be no 
multiplicity adjustment for the evaluation of the five secondary endpoints.  
Descriptive statistical analysis will be generated to compare the efficacy 
results in each treatment group at each visit.

 Safety Analysis  Adverse events (AEs)  will be classified using standard MedDRA terminology 
Version 17.[ADDRESS_858964] and 
Vehicle treatment groups who are considered to be a Clinical Success and 
Treatment Success on Day 28.  
In-house data from two Phase III studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy 
of desoximetasone spray 0.25% (twice daily for 28 days) in patients with 
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were used for sample size determination. 
These studies were conducted in support of Taro’s NDA #204141, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]® 
(desoximetasone) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117290], 0.25% . In those studies  the Clinical Success 
rates were 31% and 53% for the active product (42% average) and 5% and 
18% for the vehicle treatment (12% average), and the Treatment Success rates 
were 39% and 53% for the active product ( 46% average) and 7% and 17% for 
the vehicle treatment  (12% average) . 
Based on the average results from these two studies on the 0.25% spray , the 
proportion of subjects  in the Test group considered a Clinical Success and 
Treatment Success is expected be 40% or higher and the proportion of subjects 
in the Vehicle group considered a Clinical Success and Treatment Success is 
expected to be 12 % or less  for desoximetasone spr ay 0.15% in patients with 
mild to moderate  plaque psoriasis. With these assumptions , [ADDRESS_858965] to the Vehicle group with 89% power at the 5% level of significance (p < 
0.05, using two -sided Z-test), assuming 100% correlation between Clinical and 
Treatment Success rates. 
To allow for patients who may drop out from the study or are otherwise non-evaluable, up to 120 patients may be enrolled ([ADDRESS_858966] group and 60 in 
the Vehicle group).

 7.0 INTRODUCTION  
7.1 Disease Being Treated  
Psoriasis is an immune (T-cell)-mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects 
approximately 2% of the western population.[ADDRESS_858968] commonly seen on 
the knees and/or elbows. Although there are reports implicating a genetic association 
with the disease, there are also studies that have established a set of psoriasis triggers including stress, medications (such as lithium, antimalarials, indomethacin, quinidine, 
beta blockers), in jury or infection. The condition is considered chronic although the 
frequency and severity of outbreak in an individual can fluctuate without apparent 
cause.
1-[ADDRESS_858969] extensively studied index  
being the Psoriasis Area and  Severity Index (PASI) , which is a measure of the average 
redness, thickness, and scaliness of the lesions (each graded  on a 0–4 scale), weighted by 
[CONTACT_941] % body surface area of involvement .4,5 Investigator’s Global Assessment ( IGA) is 
also one of the preferred methods of clinical evaluation of the severity and extent of 
psoriasis. 2,4,5  
7.2 Availability and Efficacy of Already Approved Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_641721],  previous treatment regimens and personal preference of the patient . Psoriasis treatments 
historically include topi[INVESTIGATOR_142739], sprays, lotions, foams. Examples of marketed 
products include cor ticosteroids (Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]
®, Clobex™), Vitamin A & D derivatives 
(Tzorac®, Dovonex®), NSAIDs (salicylic acid), etc.  For more severe cases, systemic 
therapy (methotrexate, oral retinoids, UV light, biologics etc) may be warranted; 
however, the side effect profile of these products limits their use.  2,6,7  
Desoximetasone is a high potency synthetic corticosteroid marketed in a number of formulations:  gel (0.05%), cream (0.05% and 0.25%), and ointment (0.05% and 0.25%).  
All these formulations are encompassed under the Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]
® brand, acquired by [CONTACT_641736] U.S.A., Inc. (Taro) in 2004.  Most recently, Taro received approval on April 11, 2013 for a new dosage form (spray) under NDA #204141, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]
® 
(desoximetasone) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117290], 0.25%, a super high potency formulation that is 
indicated for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in patients 18 years of age or older.  
A new formulation; desoximetasone topi[INVESTIGATOR_117295] , 0.15% has been developed by [CONTACT_641736] U.S.A., Inc., and is the Test product used in this study.  
7.3 Scientific and Statistical Considerations  
Taro Pharmaceuticals [LOCATION_003], Inc. has developed and marketed Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800] ® (desoximetasone  
0.25%) topi[INVESTIGATOR_117295], and Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800] ® (desoximetasone 0.25% & 0.05% ) topi[INVESTIGATOR_142739],

 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis .8 Topi[INVESTIGATOR_641722], with less 
than 2% of patients reporting adverse reactions (7% in the pediatric population). The most commonly reported adverse events are burning, stinging, pruritus, and skin thinning/atrophy.
1,2,6,7,9 
The design for this study is based on results from Phase II dose -ranging and Phase III 
efficacy studies (NDA # 204141) conducted for Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]® (desoximetasone) 0.25% 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_117295]  (Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc. ).10,11 The primary efficacy  endpoints 
(Clinical Success and Treatment Success) are based on these studies as well as those 
reported in the NDA  (# 021835) for the marketed product, Clobex® (clobetasol) 0.05% 
spray.12A sample size estimation of 120 enrolled patients (60 patients per treatment 
group, 1:1 ratio) is based on the assumption that ≥ 40 % of patients receiving Test (active) 
treatment, and ≤ 12 % of patients receiving Placebo (vehicle) treatment will have Clinical 
Success and Treatment Success.  
Statistical analyses of the clinical data will be based on FDA guidances and any 
communications with FDA on how they would like such data analyzed.  
7.4 Justification for use of Placebo  
Based on recommendations from FDA, ICH and the guidebook to Institutional Review 
Boards (IRBs)  issued by [CONTACT_641737] (OHRP), a Division of 
the [LOCATION_002] Federal Government’s Department of Health and Human Services, a  
Placebo group will be included to confirm the sensitivity of the clinical endpoint and to  
demonstrate that the Test product is therapeutically superior to a vehicle formulation containing no active ingredient to treat plaque psorias is.
13,[ADDRESS_858970] be carefully considered based on three main criteria, namely: the disease 
being treated, the availability, efficacy and safety of approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_641723]. Qualifi ed 
patients entering the active treatment period  have a 50% chance of receiving Placebo. 
Although the potential for any drug- related side effects of significance occurring during 
the study are low, the risk is higher in the active treatment group than in the Placebo group.  
All patients enrolled in this study will receive the benefit of free specialized medical care 
beyond stand ard medical treatment that would be expected through most health insurance 
plans. In addition, the patient will receive a stipend for participation to cover costs and expenses associated with trips to the medical facility.

plaque psoriasis in patients [ADDRESS_858971] does not pose a 
safety concern in patients 18 years and older because the concentration of 
desoximetasone in the new formulation of desoximetasone spray 0.15% does not exceed concentrations of the marketed products. The study enrollment will be initiated for patients 18 years of age and older. The enrollment for younger patients will be open after 
completion of the corresponding age cohort in the safety study to assess the potential for

 9.6.12 Dermatological Assessment  
At Visit 1 a visual inspection to confirm a diagnosis of chronic plaque psoriasis will be 
performed. At each visit psoriasis will be assessed according to the following measures:  
a) % BSA Assessment: Appendix A 
b) IGA Score: Appendix C 
c) TLSS: Appendix B 
d) PASI Score:  Appendix D 
e) Application Site Reactions: Appendix E 
Wherever possible, the same Investigator should attempt to perform all IGA exams at all 
visits for an individual patient.  
During the overall dermatological assessment at Visit 1, the Investigator will determine which lesion in his opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] (considering a combination of size and severity of lesional signs and symptoms) is the most severe. This lesion must have an area of at least [ADDRESS_858995] 2 (mild).  
This lesion will be designated the T arget Lesion. If possible, the Target Lesion  should 
exclude the elbows and knees. The location of the Target Lesion will be identified using 
an anatomical chart in the source documentation. The size of this lesion (cm²) will be calculated, and the TLSS will be evaluated from this lesion.  
To calculate the area of the Target Lesion  the Investigator should measure once across its 
widest point and again at a point midway and perpendicular to the widest point. This should be done using the cm ruler provided.  Measurements should be done to the nearest 
mm and reported in units of cm (i.e., reported as cm out to the first decim al place, not 
reported nor calculated in mm). These two values should be multiplied to give the total 
area of the Target Lesion  (cm
2).  
The Target Lesion should be used for all fu ture evaluations and severity for  individual 
signs and symptoms (scaling, ery thema and plaque elevation).  
To be eligible for inclusion at Visit 1, the patient must have all of the following:  
• An affected BSA of 5 - 10% (Appendix A) 
• A IGA score of 2 (mild) or 3 (moderate) (Appendix C) 
• Target Lesion area of at least 5 cm²  
• Plaque Elevation Score ≥ 2 for the Target Lesion (based on TLSS score,

 9.6.13 Health Status/Adverse Events  
At Visits 2, 3 and 4 patients will be questioned regarding any changes in their medical 
status since their previous visit. Any significant changes observed after randomization 
will be reported as adverse events.  
9.7 Adverse Events  
The patients will be monitored throughout the study for any Adverse Events . AEs will be collected 
through both solicited and unsolicited means and subsequently coded in tabular for m using the 
MedDRA (Version 17 or higher) Adverse Event D ictionary.   The patients will be encouraged to 
report signs, symptoms, and any changes in health to the clinic staff.  Severity of each AE will be 
determined by [CONTACT_641747].  The Investigator will 
judge the relationship of the event to the study treatments. Adverse events should be followed up 
until they have resolved or stabilized. 
9.7.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event: Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to this product. This includes events not 
seen at baseline, or worsened even if present at baseline.  
Unexpected A dverse Event: An adverse event where the nature or severity of is not 
consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an 
unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  
Adverse Drug Reaction: All noxious and unintended responses to a medical product 
related to any dose should be considered adverse drug reactions. The response to a ‘medical product’ means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
9.7.2 Severity of Adverse Event  
The severity of the adverse event will be graded by [CONTACT_63031]:  
• MILD: Awareness of symptom but does not interfere with routine activities .  
• MODERATE: Discomfort sufficient to interfere with routine activities .  
• SEVERE: Impossible to perform routine activities . 
9.7.[ADDRESS_858996]  
• NOT RELATED: Any AE that is clearly not related to use of the study drug.

 • POSSIBLE: The association of the AE with the study  drug is unknown; however, 
a relationship between the drug and event cannot be ruled out.  
• PROBABLE: There is reasonable temporal relati onship between the use of the 
study drug and the AE. Based upon the Investigator’s clinical experience, the 
association of the event with the study drug seems likely.  
• DEFINITE: The AE occurs following the application of the study drug and it 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_641748]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of treatment administered to the patient. It disappears or decreases upon discontinuation of the study medication and reapp ears on a re- challenge of the 
study drug. 
9.7.4 Patient’s Participation Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_641728], if the patient suffers an AE that warrants discontinuation of the study drug because of  interference with age -appropriate instrume ntal ADL 
(Activities of Daily Living), for example preparing for meal, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_611534], using the telephone, etc. the patient will be followed until the AE resolves or is 
considered stable. Any subject that discontinues the study because of  an adverse event will 
be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.   
 
9.8 Serious Adverse Events  
9.8.1 Definition  of a Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose suggests a medically significant hazard, including any event that: 
• Results in death – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely 
unrelated to study treatment (e.g., car accident where patient is a passenger).  
• Is life–threatening – in the view of the Investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life). 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Causes congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical  or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the serious outcomes listed above (e.g., 
intensive treatment in an emergency room, convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). Emergency Room visits that require medical or surgical

 10.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 Statistical Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), detailing the intended statistical analysis of the study 
data, will be prepared as a separate document and finalized before database lock. Any 
deviation from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the final 
report, as appropriate. The procedure for accounting for missing, unused and spurious 
data will be included in the Statistical Analysis Plan . 
All statistical analysis will be conducted using SAS®, Version 9.[ADDRESS_858998] and Vehicle 
treatment groups who are considered to be a  Clinical S uccess and Treatment Success on 
Day 28.  
In-house data from two Phase III studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 
desoximetasone spray 0.25% (twice daily for 28 days) in patients with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis were used for sample size determination. These studies were conducted in 
support of Taro’s NDA #204141, Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]® (desoximetasone) Topi[INVESTIGATOR_117290], 0.25% . In 
those studies the Clinical Success rates were 31% and 53% for the active product (42% average) and 5% and 18% for the vehicle treatment (12% average), and the Treatment Success rates were 39% and 53% for the active product (46% average) and 7% and 17% for 
the vehicle treatment (12% average).   
Based on the average results from these two studies on the 0.25% spray, the proportion of 
subjects in the Test group considered a Clinical Success  and Treatment Success is expected 
be 40% or higher and the proportion of subjects in the Vehicle group considered a Clinical 
Success and Treatment Success is expected to be  12% or less for desoximetasone spray 
0.15% in patients with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. With these assumptions, [ADDRESS_858999] to the Vehicle group with 89 % power at the 5% level of significance (p < 0.05, using 
two-sided  Z-test), assuming 100% correlation between Clinical and Treatment Success 
rates. 
To allow for patients who may drop out from the study or are otherwise non -evaluable, up 
to 120 patients may be enrolled ([ADDRESS_859000] group and 60 in the Vehicle group). 
10.3 Study Populations  
10.3.1 Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population will include: 
• All randomized subjects.  
Patients discontinued early for any reason will be included in the ITT with their

evaluation . 
• Patients who were compliant with the dosage regimens following randomization. 
• Patients who had no major protocol deviations. 
10.3.3 Safety Population  
• All patients who were randomized and applied at least one dose of the  study 
product. 
10.4 Baseline Comparability 
Baseline comparability of all treatment groups will be evaluated separately in the ITT , PP 
and Safety populations. Comparative analyses will use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., 
one-way analysis of variance, Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel Test).  
The following baseline demographics (determined from their initial study visit) will be evaluated:  
• Age (years) 
• Gender (male/female)  
• Ethnicity (Hispanic/non Hispanic) 
• Race (White, Black/African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific

Total Body Surface Area Calculation  
To calculate the Total BSA the following procedure (Mosteller Formula )21 should be followed.  
 
Total Body Surface Area (BSA) in meters squared  
     
m2   = ((height (cm) x weight (kg)) /3600)½ 
 
Patient’s height and weight should preferably be measured in cm and kg however if 
needed: 
To convert inches (in) to centimeters (cm) the following conversion should be used  
1 inch = 2.54 cm  
 
To convert pounds (lbs) to kilograms (kg) the following conversion should be used. 
1 lb = 0.45 kg 
 
The patient’s height and weight should be reported to the nearest cm and nearest 0.[ADDRESS_859018] a reported BSA of:  
68 in x 2.54 = 173 cm  
180 lb x 0.45 = 81.0 kg  BSA =  SQRT ((173 x 81.0)/3600)  
 = 1.97 m²  
 
%BSA Affected  
 To calculate the %Body Surface Area Affected the “Rule of Nine” will be used.  
 
Body Surface Area affected will be calculated using the standard medical procedure of the “Rule of Nines”.
 (5) The patient’s palm surface of the hand represents approximately one 
percent of his/her body surface area. (5) Calculate to the nearest whole percentage.

PSORIASIS AREA SEVERITY INDEX (PASI)  
The PASI is a composite score based on the severity of three different clinical signs of 
psoriasis in four different areas of the body multiplied by [CONTACT_641751] a weighting factor.   
 
Erythema , Induration, Scaling will be evaluated using the severity scale below:  
0 = Clear     
1 = Mild     
2 = Moderate      
3 = Severe 
4 = Very Severe   
 
PASI Score  
The PASI score is calculated as follows:  
Head/neck  (E + I + S) x Area x 0.1  
Upper Limbs  (E + I + S) x Area x 0.2  
Trunk  (E + I + S) x Area x 0.3  
Lower Limbs  (E + I + S) x Area x 0.4  
PASI SCORE = SUM OF ABOVE 4 REGIONS  
 
E: Erythema,  
I:  Induration 
S: Scaling 
 Severity is based on the Investigator’s assessment of individual signs and symptoms 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe , 4 = very severe  using the definitions above  
 The % of each body region affected is scored as the variable Area above in the PASI 
formula.  For the 4 body regions (head/neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs) if the:  
 
Area = 0  if % affected is 0%  
Area = 1  if % affected is 1 to 9%  
Area = 2 if % affected is 10 to 29%  
Area = 3 if % affected is 30 to 49%  
Area = 4 if % affected is 50 to 69%  
Area = 5 if % affected is 70 to 89%  
Area = 6 if % affected is 90 to 100%  
 
PASI Score can be presented to the nearest whole number (no decimals and all numbers should be rounded, 
0.[ADDRESS_859020] whole number) . The minimum score would be 0 and the Maximum 
Score would be 72.

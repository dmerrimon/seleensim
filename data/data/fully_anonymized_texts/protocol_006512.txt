Study Design: This is a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to 
evaluate the durability of response and safety of nemolizumab in adult subjects who participated 
in the nemolizumab PN LTE study (RD.06.SPR.202699) and achieved a clinical response (i.e., 
IGA score of 0 or 1 and ≥4-point improvement in weekly average of PP N RS score from baseline 
of the lead -in study) at Week [ADDRESS_709939] enroll in this study at the time of completion of the Week 52 visit in the LTE stud y 
(RD.06.SPR.202699) to prevent any lapse in study treatment. After the Week 52 visi t of the LTE 
study is complete, approximately 40 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 1 or 2 
injections of nemolizumab or placebo, stratified by [CONTACT_228674]. Subjects will continue to 
receive the same dosing regimen received in the LTE study (i.e., 1 or 2 SC injections of study 
drug administered every 4 weeks [Q4W]). Subjects with a body weight <90 kg in the LTE study 
will receive a 30 -mg dose. Subjects weighing ≥90 kg in the LTE study will receive a 60 -mg dose.
Subjects’ participation in th e study will be up to approximately 32 weeks. The study consists of a 
24-week treatment period and an 8-week follow -up period ([ADDRESS_709940] study drug 
injection at Week 20). Refer to Figure 1for an overview of the study design.

curve will be presented. If the assumption of proportionality for Cox proporti onal hazards model 
is not met, then another appropriate method will be used.
If a subject withdraws from the study, takes prohibited medication, or completes the study without 
any relapse, time to relapse response will be censored respectively at the time of the last efficacy 
assessment (PP NRS and IGA) prior to study withdraw al, use of prohibited medication, or 
completion of the study. If a subject has no efficacy assessment after randomization, then time to 
relapse w ill be censored at Day 1.
Secondary Eff icacy Endpoints:
Binary secondary endpoints will be analy zed using a Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel test adjusted for 
randomized stratification variable. The estimate of the treatment difference (nemolizumab minus 
placebo), p-value and 2-sided 95% CI will be presented. These analyses will be based on observed 
case (OC) or imputation with the missing response considered as a non-responder for efficac y 
endpoints (i.e., IGA success) or as a relapse for relapse endpoints (i.e., increase in IGA or PP NRS 
score). 
Continuous secondary endpoints will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) based 
on OC with treatment group and dose regimen as factors, and baseline value as the covariate where 
applicable. They will also be analyzed using mixed effect model for repeated measure (MM RM) 
approach, including treatment group and dose regimen as factors, visit, interaction term between 
treatment and visit, and the corresponding baseline value as an independent covariate wher e 
applicable. The estimated treatment difference for each endpoin t at each visit will be displayed in 
the summary of statistical analysis together with the 95% CI and associated p-value. As sensitivity 
analyses, multiple imputation methods may be used to handle the missing data for some selected 
secondary endpoints. All secondary endpoints will be presented descriptively using OC.
Further details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Safety Analyses:
The incidence of TEAEs, AESIs, SAEs, treatment -related AEs, and AEs leading to study drug 
discontinuation will be included in incidence tables, summarized by [CONTACT_39812]. Additionally, the incidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_543762]. 
Clinical laboratory data and vital signs will be summarized, including observed values and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subjects with values outside limits of the norm al 
range, including shifts from baseline at each time point. Summary tables will be provided for 12 -
Lead ECG, Physica l Examination (Full and Symptom -oriented), Asthma Control Test (ACT),

5.1 Background on Prurigo N odularis
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is characterized by  [CONTACT_543763] (up to hundreds), symmetrically 
distributed, highl y pruritic, hyperkeratotic, erosive or crusted nodules and papules.1Chronic itching 
is believed to induce and maintain the characteristic PN skin lesions through an itch-scratch cycle.2
This leads to an impaired quality  of life (QoL) and high burden, due not only to the severe itch, but 
also the chronic skin lesions and lack of treatment options.[ADDRESS_709983] for the incidence and prevalence of PN in the general population, but it seems 
to be more frequent and intense in females and the elderl y.4,5
The physiopathology  of PN is still not fully  understood; however, the interactions between cutaneous 
nerve fibers, neuropeptides and immune cells seem to play  an important role in the onset of PN.6
A large spectrum of underly ing conditions that induce chronic pruritus can be associated with PN, 
including dermatological (e.g., atopic dermatitis [AD]), systemic (e.g., chronic kidney  failure), 
neurological (e.g., brachioradial pruritus), psychiatric, or mixed origin disorders.7An atopic 
predisposition seemed to be most common, occurring in nearly half of subjects with PN.4
The goal of PN treatment is to break the itch-scratch cycle and allow the skin to heal. There is no 
standardized or approved therap y for PN to date and evidence from controlled studies is limited.8
The current treatment recommendations for PN include identification and treatment of any underl ying 
disease, moisturizers and antipruritics, topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491] (corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors), and 
oral antihistamines as first-line agents.9Phototherapy , oral or intra-lesional steroids, topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] 
D3 (calcipotrio l), capsaicin, cryotherap y, and antidepressants (amitriptyline, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors) are used as second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_543720]. I n the third -line setting, 
systemic treatments such as cyclosporine,10antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (gabapentin, pregabalin)11and 
thalidomide12showed moderate -to-good response in pruritus reduction after several months of 
administration, but their use is limited by [CONTACT_543764]. Other off -label therapeutic 
options proposed for pruritus based on limited evidence include opi[INVESTIGATOR_543721] (naltrexone),13NKR1 -antagonists (aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]),14and antibiotics (roxithromy cin, 
erythromy cin).15
The T cell-derived cytokine interleukin -31 (IL-31) has been suggested to be a key player in the 
development of pruritus in PN. Skin biopsies from PN patients with an atopic background showed a 
50-fold upregulation of IL-31 mRNA compared to skin from healthy  individuals and a 4.5-fold 
upregulation compared to skin from AD patients.16

5.2 Background on Nemolizumab
Nemo lizumab (CD14152) is a humanized anti-human IL-31 receptor A monoclonal modified 
immunoglobulin G 2 antibody  comprising a structure of 2 H -chains (445 amino acid residues) and 2 
L
-chains (214 amino acid residues) connected by 16disulfide bonds. Nemolizuma b inhibits the 
binding of IL -31 to IL -31 receptor A and subsequent transduction of the IL -31 signal into the cell.
Nonclinical Studies
The Investigator’s Brochure (IB) contains detailed information on nonclinical studies.17
Pharmacokinetic Profile
Nemolizumab PK profile was assessed in health y volunteers and in subjects with AD after single and 
repeated doses with weight -based (0.1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg) and flat (10 mg to 90 mg) doses. The PK 
profile of nemolizumab was also assessed in the Phase 2a study  SPR.115828 with PN subjects, where 
a nemolizumab dose of 0.5 mg/kg was administered.
Overall PK assessments showed a dose proportional increase of nemoli zumab serum concentrations 
after a single (mg/kg) injection and a less-than-proportional increase after repeated administrations 
of flat doses between 30 mg and 90 mg. Subcutaneous administration of nemolizumab results in slow 
absorption with peak serum concentrations achieved after 4 to 9 days. The terminal elimination half -
life of nemolizumab was approximately  2weeks after single and repeated administrations. No 
significant systemic accumulation was observed, and stead y state concentrations were achieved from 
16 weeks of treatment without a loading dose and from 4 weeks of treatment when a loading (flat 2×) 
dose was administered. The sy stemic exposure to nemolizumab appeared to be slightly  lower in AD 
subjects compared to healthy  volunteers. 
Similar nemo lizumab PK profiles were observed in subjects with AD and in subjects with PN. The 
similarity  in nemolizumab exposure between the 2 populations was also confirmed using population 
PK modeling. The IB contains additional detailed information on the nemolizumab PK profile.17
A low immunogenicit y potential was observed in subjects with PN and in subjects with AD. No 
subjects had positive anti-drug antibodi es (ADA) that included immunoglobulin E (IgE), and no 
subjects developed neutralizing antibodies. In both subject populations, concentration -time profiles 
and PK parameters of ADA -positive subjects were not different from the ADA -negative subjects.

(including the Phase 2a study  RD.03.SPR.[ADDRESS_709987].06.SPR.203065).
Three additional Phase 3 studies in PN subjects are ongoing: 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]  (RD.06.SPR.202685), 1 
long-term extension (LTE) study  (RD.06.SPR.202699), and 1 dose optimization/long -term study 
(M525101- 11) to assess the safet y and efficacy  of nemolizumab in subjects with a clinical diagnosis 
of PN. 
There are also Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in AD subjects , a Phase 3 study  in subjects with pruritus 
associated with Chronic Kidney  Disease and a Pharmacokinetic study  for an Auto -Injector device
ongoing. 
5.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment
Pruritus is the cardinal symptom in PN and is often difficult to treat with current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Chronic 
itching is believed to induce and maintain the characteristic PN skin lesions through an itch-scratch 
cycle. Therefore, the goal of PN treatments target pruritus remission to allow skin healing and 
improvement in patients’ QoL .
Results of a previous clinica l study  with nemolizumab demonstrated a marked effect on both PN 
lesions and pruritus. The decrease in itching sensation was rapid, within the first week following the 
first injection and improved with subsequent administrations. This improvement in the signs and 
symptoms of PN was consistent with the observed improvement in QoL (evaluated using the 
Dermatology  Life Quality  Index [DLQI]). Continuous treatment with nemolizumab also led to an 
improvement in the overall severity  of PN, which was evaluated with various scales (i.e., Investigator 
Global Assessment [IGA], Peak Pruritus [PP] Numeric Rating Scale [NRS], and Prurigo Activity  
Score). Based on the results of the Phase 2a study  (RD.03.SPR.115828) nemolizumab was clinically 
and statistically significantl y superior to placebo in reducing the weekl y average of PP NRS scores at 
Week 4 (difference between treatment groups -38.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -51.0, - 25.0; 
p<0.001). The statistically  significant improvements in IGA success and Prurigo Activity Score 
observed in the nemolizumab group were greater than those observed in the placebo group.
Based on the currentl y available information on nemolizumab and the risks associated with biologic 
agents in general, the important potential risks of nemolizumab treatment include local and s ystemic 
injection -related reactions, newly -diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma, exacerbation of AD, 
and skin and non -skin infections. 
The following specific risk-minimization and safety  follow -up measures have been planned in this 
clinical study :

Page 25of 100a.The protocol will exclude subjects who experienced an adverse event (AE) in the prior lead-in 
study  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], could indicate continued treatment with 
nemolizumab would present an unreasonable ris k for the subject. 
b.In the Phase 2b dose-ranging study  (RD.03.SPR.114322) in AD, a dose-dependent increase of 
asthma flares (1 [1.8%], 2 [3.6%], 7 [12.3%], and 10 [17.5%] in placebo, 10 -mg, 30 -mg, and 90 -
mg treatment arms, respectively) in subjects with pre -existing asthma wa s observed. Events were 
mostly  mild or moderate ([ADDRESS_709989] dose), manageable, and reversible under 
treatment with study  drug. At all visits, subjects with a history  of asthma will complete a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_543722], the Asthma Control Test (ACT) , and peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PEF) testing. 
Subjects diagnosed with de novo asthma will complete respi[INVESTIGATOR_543723]. Subjects without a medical history  of asthma 
will undergo per iodic respi[INVESTIGATOR_543724]. Subjects with a medical history  of asthma will be 
referred to the physician managing their asthma if ACT ≤19, PEF <80% of the predicted value, 
and/or unexpected worsening of asthma is observed or reported. Subjects without a medical 
history  of asthma will be referred to a respi[INVESTIGATOR_543725]/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_543726] a decline in subject’s 
health. An independent adjudication committee (IAC) will review all asthma AEs reported during 
the course of the study . 
c.As no data are available in pregnant or breastfeeding women, these patients are not eligible for 
this study . 
d.Patients who have recently  received live or non-live vaccines may be considered for enrollment 
after an appropriate time has elapsed before baseline/Day  1 (Section 9.6.3 ). Administration of live 
vaccines is prohibited during thestudy . Administration of non-live vaccines is prohibited with the 
exception of seasonal, emergency , and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccinations 
(Section 9.6.1 ).See Appendix 1for additional guidance for management of subjects and study 
conduct during the COVID -19 pandemic.
e.A slight trend of dose-dependent increase of peripheral edema was reported in t he nemolizumab 
Phase 2a stud y (CIM003JG) for AD. Most events were mild (11 of 21), no case was serious, and 
none resulted in premature treatment discontinuation; no case was associated with renal or cardiac 
AEs. Peripheral edema will be followed as an AE o f special interest (AESI) in this study .
f.An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will monitor the safet y data regularl y 
throughout the study, including AESIs listed in Section 12.7.2 , which were defined based on the 
currentl y available safety  information on nemolizumab and the risks associated with biologic 
agents in general.
In conclusion, when taking into consideration the currentl y available data of nemolizumab and the 
risk-minimization approaches to be implemented, the benefit/risk ratio of nemolizumab is considered 
to be favorable in this study .

Page 26of 1005.4 Dose Selection Rationale
In the Phase 2 study  (RD.03. SPR.115828), nemolizumab was tested as a 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous 
(SC) injection administered Q4W in subjects with PN. The 0.5 mg/kg dose demonstrated efficacy  in 
the treatment of PN with an acceptable safet y profile and a very good immunogenicity  profile.
The Phase 3 studies are conducted with a flat, fixed dose. The dose was selected with the aim of 
improving dosing convenience and avoiding potential errors that could be made while calculating, 
preparing, and/or administering a weight -based dose. The switch from weight -based dosing to a flat 
dose wa s based on an assessment of observed clinical data, and modeling & simulation tools. 
Overall, subjects will continue to receive the same dose received in the LTE study  (i.e.,1or 2 SC 
injections of study  drug administered Q4W). The dose was determined atbaseline of the relevant 
lead-in study . Subjects with a body  weight <90 kg were administered a 30 mg dose Q4W with a 
loading dose of 60 mg at baseline. Subjects weighing ≥90 kg were administered a 60 mg dose of 
nemolizumab Q4W (without loading dose). This dose adjustment was proposed to account for the 
impact of body  weight on nemolizumab systemic exposure and subsequently  to provide consistent 
efficacy  response to nemolizumab across the body weight spectrum.

score from baseline of the lead -in study ) at Week [ADDRESS_709995] do so at the time of completion of the Week 52 visit 
in the LTE study  (RD.06.SPR.202699) to prevent any lapse in study  treatment. After the Week 52
visit of the LTE study  is complete, approximately  40 subjects who choose to enter this study will be 
randomized 1:1 to either continue the same dosing regimen received in the LTE stud y (i.e., 1 or 2 SC 
injections of study  drug administered Q4W), or to discontinue nemolizumab and receive placebo. 
Subjects’ participation in the study will be up to approximately 32 weeks. The study consists of a 24 -
week treatment period and an 8 -week follow -up period ([ADDRESS_709996] study  drug injection 
at Week 20 ).

Page 33of 1007.2 Discussion of Study Design
This study  will evaluate the durability  of response and safet y of nemolizumab in adult subjects with 
PN. The general study  design is based upon the prior Phase 3 and LTE study  (RD.06.SPR.202699) 
designs conducted in adult subjects with PN. The rationale for the nemolizumab dose and dose 
regimen is provided in Section 5.4.
Eligible subjects for this clinical study  will be adults who participated in the prior nemolizumab PN 
LTE study  (RD.06.SPR.202699) with uninterrupted dosing for 3months before the Week 52 visit 
and achieved a clinical response (i.e., IGA score of 0 or 1 and ≥4-point improvement in weekl y 
average of PP NRS score from baseline of the lead-in study )at Week 52. By [CONTACT_543765] a current clinical response to nemolizumab to either 
nemolizumab or placebo treatment arms, the durability  of the response to nemolizumab following 
discontinuation of active treatment (i.e., in the placebo treatment arm) can be measured. This will be 
done to understand how long the effects of nemolizumab treatment are expected to last in controlling 
signs and s ymptoms of PN when treatment is removed. Subjects who experienced an AE during their 
participation in the prior lead-in study  that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_543727]. Furthermore, subjects must not use restricted topi[INVESTIGATOR_543728], including 
rescue therap y, within 6 months of the Week 52 visit in the PN L TE study . 
A 24-week treatment period is considered adequate to evaluate the long-term durability  of response 
and safet y of nemolizumab based on the results of the prior Phase 2a stud y.
The efficacy  endpoints selected for the Phase 3b trial are relevant to the underl ying long-term 
manifestations associated with the disease under study  (i.e., skin lesions, chronic itch, sleep 
disturbance, and QoL impairment), and are designed to measure the maintenance or loss of clinical 
response. 
The study  includes an 8-week follow -up period and/or 12 weeks (±7 days) after the last study  drug 
injection for subjects who will not continue in the LTE study . The duration of the follow -up period 
from the final nemolizumab dose (12 weeks [±7 day s]) correspon ds to approximately  [ADDRESS_710009] safet y. 
Blinding subjects and the designated stud y team to the dosing assignment(s) helps ensure objectivity 
and minimize bias. Randomization through the IRT guards against selection bias. To avoid bias 
further and to ensure the integrit y of the blind, personnel directl y involved with the ongoing conduct 
of the study  from the Sponsor, contract research organization (CRO), or other investigational study  
centers will not have access to any information that may  lead to unblinding.

Preparation
A pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) will prepare study  drug for injection according to 
instructions provided in the current version of the pharmacy  manual and the “Instructions for Use” 
(IFU). Study  medication preparation should be conducted in a secured and clean area with limited 
access to only  designated personnel at the time of the preparation. Good hygiene practices and clean 
techniques must apply  at all times. 
Differences may be detectable during the study  drug reconstitution process between active study  drug 
and placebo, but active study  drug and placebo appear similar after reconstitution is complete 
(approximately  10minutes). Throughout the study , a pharmaci st (or other qualified personnel) will 
prepare study  drug for injection, including confirmation of complete reconstitution, prior to delivery 
of study  drug for injection. The pharmacist (or other qualified personnel) preparing study  drug should 
not be involved with any study assessments and should not discuss any aspects of study  drug 
reconstitution with the subject/caregiver or stud y staff involved in study  assessments. 
The stud y drug does not contain preservatives. From a microbiological point of view, t he preparation 
of the study  drug has to be done as close to subject administration as possible, and the study  drug 
should be used immediately (less than 1 hour) after reconstitution. I f not used immediately, the study 
drug has to be used within 4 hours max imum after reconstitution stored at room temperature (below 
30°C) and only  if the preparation has taken place apply ing strictly  good hygiene practices and clean 
techniques to ensure controlled aseptic conditions.

study  assessments and should not discuss any aspects of study  drug reconstitution with the 
subject/caregiver or study staff involved in subject interviews or study  assessments.
Local unblinding will occur for bioanaly tical POE and ADA testing. POE and ADA sample assay s 
will only  be performed on samples from subjects treated with nemolizumab. Prior to sample assay s, 
local unblinding at the bioanal ytical CRO will be restricted to the bioanal ytical manager and his/her 
direct reports only , in order to select the appropriate samples for the assay .
To maintain the integrit y of the study  blinding, the bioanalytical laboratory  staff who process/anal yze 
the proof of exposure (POE)/ADA samples will not provide any information to Sponsor, CRO, or 
investigational study  center personnel directl y involved with the ongoing conduct of the study  that 
may lead to unblinding during the ongoing study . The POE and ADA results will be released by  [CONTACT_543767].
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in case of a medical emergency  
or in the event of a serious medical condition that necessitates identification of the stud y drug for the 
welfare of that subject, as judged b y the Investigator. The emergency unblinding process utilizes I RT 
to allow the Investigator to have unrestricted, immediate, and direct access to the subject’s individual 
study  treatment. When possible (i.e., when the healt h of the subject is not immediately  at risk), the 
Investigator or Sub-investigator is encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor and the Sponsor 
before breaking the blind.
If emergency  unblinding is required:
Only  the Investigator will make the decisio n to unblind the treatment assignment.
Only  the affected subject will be unblinded.
The I RT sy stem will provide the treatment assignment to the I nvestigator.
Refer to the Randomization and Trial Supply  Management (RTSM) User Guide for information on 
the st eps for breaking the blind in the I RT s ystem.
When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully  documented. If the code is broken b y the 
Investigator, the subject must be withdrawn from the study  and must also be appropriately  followed 
for 12 weeks (±7 day s) after the last dose of study drug.
The reporting requirements for unblinding are the same as the requirements for reporting an SAE (see 
Section 12.7.4 ).
The randomization code will remain blinded to all study  centers and study  team members until 
completion of the study  and until the study  database has been locked.

9.4 Dosage Modification
Dose modification of the study  drug will not be perm itted during the clinical study . 
Any inadvertent dose modification(s) should be reported to the Sponsor/CRO. 
In the event of a missed dose (i.e., temporary  discontinuation of the study  drug), it will be documented 
in the eCRF that the drug has not been administered at the study  visit, with the reason (e.g., for safety). 
Subjects will be asked to return to the study  centers for all remaining visits and complete all study 
assessments and procedures as described in Section 10.
Dosing frequency  of study  drug (nemolizumab or placebo) is scheduled for Q4W, based on the 
baseline/Day [ADDRESS_710042] 
injection. If 5 weeks or more, the next study  drug injection should then occur at the next planned visit. 
Future visits should be scheduled as soon as possible and w ithin the required windows based on the 
baseline/Day [ADDRESS_710043] during the 
COVID -19 pandemic.
9.5 Accountability and Compliance
Study  drug (nemolizumab and placebo) will be provided to the investigational study  center. Study  
center personnel will acknowledge receipt of the study  drug using IRT to confirm the shipment 
condition and content. If a damaged shipment is received and/or a temperature excursion has been 
experienced, the site personnel will notify  the Sponsor/CRO and follow the guidelines according to 
the current version of the pharmacy  manual. 
The designated personnel will maintain accurate records of the study  drug throughout the clinical 
study , including the inventory  delivered to the study  center, the use by [CONTACT_6992], the reconciliation 
of all delivered and received DCS units, and the return/destruction of unuse d study  drug as specified 
in the current version of the pharmacy  manual. No unauthorized use is permitted. Used DCS units 
will be properl y documented in drug accountability  records. Unless a product technical complaint 
(PTC) is detected or an event occurs before, during, or just after the injection, the used DCS units can 
be disposed of in an appropriate sharps container and according to waste regulation(s) in the country. 
A DCS involved in a malfunction or an Investigator or subject complaint must be retained on site and

10.1 Informed Consent
Before performing any study -related procedures, the Investigator (ordesignee) will obtain written 
informed consent from the subject . 
Upon ICF signature, each subject will be assigned, via electronic data capture (EDC), a unique subject 
identification number which will be used for the entire duration of the study . 
10.2 Study Procedures
Assessments and their timing are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7). 
At each visit, assessments/procedures should be performed in the following order: 
1. Patient- reported efficacy  and safet y measurements
2.Investigator assessments (including efficacy  and safet y)
Electrocardiogram (ECG) should be done before vital signs measurements and blood draws 
(see Section 12.4).
3.Sample collections for laboratory  assess ments
4.Sample collections for correlative assessments (POE and ADA)
5.Administration of study  drug injections
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study  drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatment unless other wise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 7).
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11and include IGA, PP NRS, SD NRS, DL QI. 
Safety  assessments are described in Section 12and include AEs, including TEAEs, AESIs, and SAEs, 
physical examination and vital signs, clinical laboratory  tests, ECG, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_543724]. 
Section 12.5 specifies laboratory  assessment samples to be obtained. 
The Investigator may , at his/her discretion, arrange for a subject to have an unscheduled assessment, 
especiall y in the case of AEs that require follow -up or are considered by [CONTACT_543772] y 
related to the use of study drug. The unscheduled visit page in the eCRF must be completed.

l)For postmenopausal subjects (i.e., no menses for 12 consecutive months), confirm status with a high FSH level in the postmeno pausal range unless 
previously confirmed as part of a lead-in study. The blood chemistry sample at the basel ine visit (V1) will also be used for an FSH test for the confirmation 
of postmenopausal status, if applicable.
m)At scheduled visits with laboratory, POE, and/or ADA assessments, the samples are to be collected before study drug injection (s). As a guideline, POE 
and ADA samples should be collected at approximately the same time of day throughout the study, to the extent possible.

Early Termination Visit
If a subject meets the criteria for relapse at any point during the treatment period, the subject will 
be eligibl e to re-enter the LTE study  (see Figure 2). Subjects who exit the study  before Week 24 
should complete an ET visit. For subjects re-entering the LTE study , a minimum of 3 weeks is 
required between doses of study  drug. Subjects who prematurel y discontinue study  drug for 
reasons other than relapse will be encouraged to complete the scheduled study  visits. These 
subjects will only  be eligible for re -enrollment in the LTE study  if they  continue with study  visits 
through Week 24.
A follow-u p visit will be conducted 8 weeks after completing the treatment period and/or 12weeks 
(±7 days) after the last study  drug injection for all subjects who will notcontinue nemolizumab 
treatment in the LTE study . Twelve weeks corresponds to approximately  5half-lives of

Unscheduled Visit
The subject should be reminded to adhere to the study schedule. Unscheduled visits are defined as 
visits to repeat testing for abnormal laboratory  results, for follow -up of AEs, or to conduct efficacy 
assessments for subjects requiring rescue medication between regularl y scheduled study  visits. 
Visits occurring outside of the visit window are not considered unscheduled visits.
Assessments to be conducted at the unscheduled visit will depend on the reason for the visit: any 
of the procedures/assessments listed in Table 7may be conducted, but not all are required. Blood 
sample collection for POE and ADA analy ses are required during unscheduled visits that are 
conducted for safet y reasons when safet y labs are collected for the management/monitoring of an

Vital signs will be evaluated at all visits as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). 
Vital signs will include pulse rate, s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure (after the subject has been 
sitting for at least 5 minutes), and body  temperature. All abnormal values at the baseline visit 
identified as clinically signif icant by [CONTACT_543776]. 
Any clinicall y significant changes from the baseline visit (and onwards) will be recorded as an 
AE.
Height and weight will be measured according to the Schedule of As sessments ( Table 7).
A complete ph ysical examination should be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7) at designated visits. A complete physical examination will include assessments of the 
head, ears, e yes, nose, throat, neck (including th yroid), skin/integumentary  system, cardiovascular 
system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517] (for additional respi[INVESTIGATOR_543724], see Section 12.6), 
gastrointestinal s ystem, musculoskeletal sy stem, ly mph nodes, nervous system, and extremities. 
A symptom -directed ph ysical examination should be performed at all other visits according to the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 7).
The Investigator should assess all abnormal findings for clinical significance. All clinically 
significant abnormal findings at the baseline visit will be recorded in the medical history  form. 
Any clinically  significant changes from the baseline visit will be recorded as an AE.
A 12-lead, resting ECG will be performed and read centrally  according to visits indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 7). The [ADDRESS_710065] should be obtained using 
the electrocardiograph machine provided for the study . The 12-lead ECGs will be performed in 
the supi[INVESTIGATOR_543741]. Subjects 
should be monitored for potentially  clinically  significant ECG results (refer to the current version 
of the central laboratory manual). Tests with abnormal results at the baseline visit should be 
recorded in the medical history  form. Results that are deemed clinicall y significant should be 
repeated to ensure reproducibility  of the abnormality . Any abnormalities considered by [CONTACT_543777], as needed.

Laboratory  assessment samples are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 7).
The hematology  laboratory  analyses, clinical chemistry  laboratory  analyses, and urinal yses will be 
performed at a central laboratory . Reference ranges will be supplied b y the central laboratory  and 
used by [CONTACT_543778].
The Investigator or medically  qualified Sub-investigator must review and evaluate laboratory 
values for each subject in a timely  manner. Study centers should refer to the current version of the 
laboratory  manual for laboratory  values outside of normal limits.  For each out-of-range laboratory  
result, the Investigator or designee will evaluate whethe r he/she considers it to be clinicall y 
significant, defined as meeting at least 1 of the following conditions:
The abnormalit y suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity , or 
The abnormality  is of a degree that requires additional active management, 
e.g., discontinuation of the drug, close observation, more frequent follow -up assessments, 
or further diagnostic investigation.
If the Investigator observes a clinicall y significant laboratory  result, the test will be repeated as 
soon as possible, and the subject will be monitored until the value returns to normal and/or an 
adequate explanation for the abnormality  is found.
Investigators will also be allowed to repeat specific laboratory  test(s) or procedure(s) where the 
Investigator suspects an inaccuracy  or false result and that which may impact the safet y of the 
subject or the interpretation of the trial results. This should occur only after discussion with 
Medical Monitor.
All clinically  significant out-of-range laboratory  values at the baseline visit will be recorded (report 
a diagnosis rather than the laboratory  value whenever possible) in the medical history  form. All 
clinically  significant out -of-range laboratory values after the baseline visit are to be reported as an 
AE if this abnormality  was not present at the baseline visit, or is assessed as having worsened since 
the baseline visit (i.e., changed significantl y from the baseline visit). Whenever possible, the 
Investigator should provide a diagnosis of an AE when reporting the abnormal laboratory  value. 
See Section 12.[ADDRESS_710067] 8 hours before the visits when blood chemistry testing is planned. 
Laboratory  testing conducted in a non -fasting state will not be a protocol deviation.
Total blood volumes to be drawn at each visit are provided in the clinical laboratory  manual and 
in  Appendix 8. Additional samples may be required if medicall y indicated (e.g., at unscheduled 
visits for safet y reasons, when an abnormal laboratory value is observed and requires a re -test).

Hematology
The hematology  tests include: hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count (with differential 
including eosinophils), red blood cell count, platelet count, and mean cell volume.
Clinical Chemistry
The clinical chemistry  tests include: creatinine, aspartate amin otransferase (AST), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutam yl transferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate 
dehy drogenase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin, total protein, uric acid, sodium, 
potassium, calcium, chloride, glucose, urea, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-densit y 
lipoprotein, high- density  lipoprotein, creatine phosphokinase (CPK). CPK isoenzy me test will be 
performed only if CPK is elevated to >2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN). The Investigator should 
also contact [CONTACT_543779].
For postmenopausal subjects (i.e., no menses for 1 year), the blood chemistry  sample at the 
baseline visit will also be used to confirm postmenopausal status bya high FSH level in the 
postmenopausal range ,unless previously  confirmed as part of the lead-in study .
Urinalysis
The urinal ysis tests include: pH, glucose, ketones, blood, protein, leukocytes, nitrites, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, and specific gravit y.
Pregnancy Testing
Urine pregnancy  tests (UPTs) will be conducted for all women of childbearing potential beginning 
at baseline and continuing at subsequent visits according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7). 
Pregn ancy  test results must be available prior to the administration of the study  drug.
UPTs with a sensitivity  <25 IU/L  will be provided to the study  centers for use in the trial.
UPTs will be performed at the study  centers, and all other samples will be sent to central laboratory 
for anal ysis.
If the result of a UPT is positive, it must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy  test, and no study 
drug should be administered pending the serum pregnancy  test result. Subjects with a positive 
serum pregnancy  test result during the trial must discontinue treatment and be withdrawn from the 
trial.
Follicle -stimulating Hormone
The postmenopausal status (defined as no menses for 1 year) of a subject will be confirmed at the 
baseline visit, unless previously  confirmed as part of the lead-in study . For these subjects, 
postmenopausal status will be confirmed with a FSH level in the postmenopausal range.
Blood chemistry sample at the baseline visit will also be used for an FSH test for the confirmation 
of postmenopausal status, i f applicable.

Tuberculosis Testing
Subjects may be assessed for active or latent tuberculosis (TB) at unscheduled visits for safety 
purposes based on Investigator judgment. A subject who tests positive for latent TB (with a 
positive QuantiFERON -TB Gold test) should be referred to the subject’s treating physician for 
appropriate follow -up.
At baseline, the Investigator should specifically question all subjects about any medical history or 
changes in their asthma and respi[INVESTIGATOR_77551] (e.g., wheezing, coughing, allergies, and infections). 
Subjects with a history  of asthma will be questioned about the seasonality  of their asthma and 
known triggers, such as allergens. Newly -diagnosed asthma or worsening of asthma during the 
study  will be reported as an AESI.
Asthma Control Test
Subjects with a medical history of asthma will take the ACT at all visits according to the Schedule 
of Assessments (Table 7) before questioning and physical examination by [CONTACT_737]. 
Subjects with a new (de novo) diagnosis of asthma will take the ACT at the visit the diagnosis was

AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not it is related to the medicinal (investigational) product. This includes an 
exacerbation of pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the 
significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the 
eCRF under specific efficacy  assessments. 
Note(s): 
Any new sign or symptom reported by [CONTACT_543780].
Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be reported on the AEform, instead of signs, 
symptoms, or abnormal laboratory  values. 
Pregnancy  is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be monitored and reported as 
described in Section 12.7.7 .
Each worsening of a chronic disease from the baseline visit should be reported as a new 
AE.
The Investigator or designee will report all AEs that occur from the time the ICF is signed until 
the end of the study . The Spon sor/CRO should be informed if the Investigator becomes aware of 
any safety information that appears to be drug related, even after the subject has completed the 
clinical study .
At each post enrollment visit, the Investigator (or Sub-investigator) will question the subject about 
AEs using an open non-persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs (for example, “Have you 
noticed any change in your health since the last visit?”). Directed questioning and examination 
will then be performed as appropriate. 
Any AE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether it is related to the study  drug or not, 
will be recorded immediately  in the source document and described on the Adverse Event Form 
(“AE Form”) along with the date of onset, severit y, relationship to the study  drug(s), and outcome, 
without omitting any  requested and known information. Additional information will be requested 
under certain circumstances.

Assessment of Severity
Each AE will be assigned a category  by [CONTACT_73951]:
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with every day activ ities.
Moderate: An AE that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with normal every day 
activities; intervention may  be needed.
Severe: An AE that prevents normal every day activities; treatment or other intervention 
usually  needed.
If there is a change in severity  of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.
Assessment of Causality
The Investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal relationship between the 
occurrence of the AE, and exposure to the study  drug (i.e., nemoliz umab or placebo) and/or study 
procedure (e.g., injection, blood sample collection). Medical judgment should be used to determine 
the relationship, considering all relevant factors including the pattern of the reaction, temporal 
relationships, relevant medi cal history , and confounding factors such as co-medication or 
concurrent diseases.
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey  in general that there are facts 
or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Council for Harmonisation [ICH] E2A, 
Section IIIA 1).
The relationship assessment for an AE is to be completed using the following definitions as a 
guideline for all AEs occurring during this clinical study :
Reasonable Possibility:
According to the reporting Investigat or, there is a reasonable possibility  (i.e., suggestive evidence 
or arguments) that there is a causal relationship irrespective of the dose administered:
Between the stud y drug (nemolizumab) and the AE, and/or
Between the clinical study  protocol procedure (e.g., injection, blood sample collection) and 
the AE

13.1 Proof of Exposure
Blood Samples
Blood samples for proof of nemolizumab systemic exposure (POE) will be collected at the time 
points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 7)and the clinical laboratory  manual. At 
each sampling time point for POE assessments, the collected blood will be placed to clot at room 
temperature (no more than 60 minutes after collection) and then centrifuged. The serum will be 
collected into storage tubes. 
As a guideline, POE samples should be collected at approximately  the same time of day throughout 
the study , to the extent possible, before study  drug injection (pre -dose samples). The date and the 
time of each sample collection will be recorded in the eCRF, with the time of study drug injection 
at the same visit (or missed injection if applicable).
CD14152 Quantification in Biological Sampling
Concentration of nemolizumab (CD14152) in the serum will be determined by [CONTACT_543787] a validat ed enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay  method (lower limit of quantification 
[LLOQ]: 100ng/mL). Details related to the processing of serum samples and the assessments of 
nemolizumab will be described in the bioanal ytical plan, which will be finalized before the 
beginning of sample analy sis. Results will be described in the bioanaly tical report, which will be 
included as an appendix in the final clinical study report.
13.2 Immunogenicity Analysis
Blood samples will be collected at the time points indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 7)and the clinical laboratory  manual to assess anti -nemolizumab ADA.
The ADA will be determined by [CONTACT_543788]- tiered testing approach. A 
sensitive screening assay  will first be used to assess clinical samples. Positive samples in the initial 
screening assay will be subjected to a confirmatory  assay  to demonstrate that ADA are specific for 
nemolizumab and not a result of non-specific interactions. Samples identified as positive in the 
confirmatory  assay will be further characterized in 2 other assay s, titering and neutralization 
antibody  (Nab) assay s. 
Details related to the processing of serum samples and the assessments of ADA will be described 
in the bioanal ytical plan, which will be finalized before the beginning of sample anal ysis. Results 
will be described in the bioanaly tical report, which will be included as an appendix in the final 
clinical stu dy report.

A statistical analy sis plan (SAP) will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This document 
will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology  
to address all study  objectives. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes 
it in case of differences.
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS®software version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS Institute, Cary , NC). All data will be listed. All primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints, 
and safet y endpoints will be summarized.  Summary  statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_543789]. For continuous variables, data will be summarized with the number of subjects
(N), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum by [CONTACT_543790]. For categorical variables, data will be tabulated with the number and proportion of 
subjects for each category b y treatment group and dosing regimen. For time -to-event, data will be 
summariz ed using Kaplan- Meier method. 
14.1 Determination of Sample Size
No formal sample size calculations were performed for this study . The sample size will be based 
on the sample size and the actual response rate of the LTE study . Based on the current assumption, 
it is expected that approximately  40 subjects will be randomized.
14.2 Analysis Populations
Intent -to-Treat Population
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects. All primary  and 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints will be analy zed based on the ITT population. All analy ses on the 
ITT population will be analy zed under the treatment group “as randomized”. 
Safety Population
The safet y population will comprise all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of stud y 
drug. All safet y data will be summarized based on the safet y population under the treatment group 
“as treated”.
Proof of Exposure Analysis Population
The POE analysis population will include all subjects in the safet y population who provide at least 
[ADDRESS_710095] on the efficacy  of the study  treatment. Only

Galderma S.A./Galderma R&D, LLC RD.06.SPR.[ADDRESS_710122] Safety during the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID 19) Pandemic
This guidance applies during the COVID -19 pandemic, as defined by [CONTACT_99439]/or local 
authorities. The updates summarized below are relevant to the referenced sectio ns of the protocol.
Section 5.3Risk/Benefit Assessment
During the COVID -[ADDRESS_710123], including general 
environmental risks (e.g., being outside of the home, possible contact [CONTACT_99440]) 
and study -related activities (e.g., interaction with study  staff). Potential new subjects with known 
or suspected COVID -19 infection are ineligible for study  enrollment until the infection has 
resolved. Furthermore, potential new subjects in a high-risk population for COVID -19 (e.g., 
60years and older or with comorbidities), should be temporarily  deferred until the COVID -[ADDRESS_710124] COVID -19 
Pandemic below. Subje cts with a known or suspected COVID -19 infection will immediately  
discontinue study  drug; instructions for resuming treatment are described in Section 8.3.2 . Known 
or suspected COVID -19 infection will also be followed as an AESI.
New Subsection to Section 7.1, Description of Overall Study Design and Plan:
Additional Measures for Subjects Amidst COVID- [ADDRESS_710125] practices for conducting clinical research 
during the COVID -19 pandemic. 
Guidance for New Subjects:
Best practices currently in place must be followed when evaluating eligibility  of subjects to 
participate in the stud y during the C OVID-19 pandemic.
For potential subjects in a high-risk population for COVID -19 as defined by [CONTACT_543793]  (AAD)1(e.g., 60years and older or with comorbidities) or local 
guidelines, deferring participation in the study  should be considered. Deferment of enrollment is 
based on the potential risk posed by  [CONTACT_99441] (e.g., being outside of the home, 
possible contact [CONTACT_99440]) and study -related activities (e.g., interaction with study  
staff).
For potential subjects in the low-risk population for COVID -19 (e.g., less than 60 years of age and 
without comorbidities), the risks and benefits of participation in the stud y should be assessed on a 
case-by-case basis.

Galderma S.A./Galderma R&D, LLC RD.06.SPR.[ADDRESS_710127] should not be considered for enrollment. 
Pre-baseline phone calls should be conducted to exclude potential candidates/subjects who display
possible sy mptoms of COVID- 19 or are at high risk of having bee n exposed to COVID-19.
Guidance for Enrolled Subjects:
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the clinical investigational site and complete all
study  procedures, the following measures should be taken:
-Implement and document in the subject records regular communication with 
the subject between visits to attempt to ensure early detection of potential 
signs/sy mptoms of COVID -19 infection, and provide adequate advice, as per 
local medical practice and public health guidelines for suspected COVID -19 
infection. Please refer to the 
•Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/s ymptoms-
testing/sy mptoms.html
•European CDC
https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid- 19/questions- answers
•Local disease prevention agency  and applicable local guidelines for 
assessment of subjects’ COVID -[ADDRESS_710128] before the scheduled visit. 
-Discontinue study  drug administration in case of confirmed or suspected 
COVID -19 infection until the infection is resolved. See Section 8.3.2 .
-Report an y COVID -19 infec tion (confirmed or suspected) as an AE: 
•if any seriousness criterion is met, also report as an SAE (see 
Section 12.7.4 ). 
•if it occurs during the clinical study  following the first dose of study  drug 
administration, also report as an AESI (see Section 12.7.5 ).
-Implement preventive infection con trol measures against COVID -19 infection 
following local guidelines (e.g., good hygiene practice, clean techniques, and 
use of personal protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, and masks). 
-Implement preventive measures in handling all subject -facing study -mandated 
assessment devices and parts: 
•PEF meter device bod y is to be cleaned after each use, with recommended 
wipes, as per user manual 
•PEF meter flow sensor is to be disposed of after each set of measurements 
is taken

disposed of after each set of measurements is taken
•Offer protective gloves to subjects for use while filling out assessments on 
a tablet and provide training on h ygienic removal and disposal of gloves
If the local situation allows for subjects to reach the investigational site and complete only some
study procedures where visit duration needs to be limited, the above measures also apply. All 
assessments should be conducted if possible. Subject- reported assessments that would usually  be 
collected on the site tablet (e.g., ACT) may be collected remotely  (e.g., completed over the phone), 
as available.
Subjects can be dosed only if, taking into account the local situation and risk of exposure to 
COVID -19, the site conside rs that:
-The study drug subcutaneous injection can be performed at the investigational 
site according to the instructions in the protocol, pharmacy  manual and IFU, 
including preparation of study  drug by [CONTACT_543794] l.
- ACT (for subjects with a medical history  of asthma or newly -diagnosed 
asthma) and PEF (for all subjects at specified visits and more frequently  for 
subjects with a history  of asthma or newl y-diagnosed asthma) should be 
performed according to the protoco l. 
Exceptionally , if sites cannot perform PEF safel y on site, the subjects 
should perform it at home prior to the on-site visit, on the same day. 
See section below for remote PEF testing instructions.
-All other safet y assessments are to be performed as per-protocol: physical 
examination, vital signs, ECG, laboratory  assessments, pregnancy  test, 
monitoring of AEs and concomitant medications. 
-All missing assessments should be appropriately documented with COVID -19 
recorded as the reason, where applicable.
If the local situation does not allow for subjects to reach the investigational site:
-See New Subsection to Section 9.4, Dosage Modification: Management of 
Subjects with Missed Doses of Study Drug due to COVID -19 Pandemic
(below) for guidance on further dosing of subjects.
-Remote collection of data by [CONTACT_543795] y scheduled visit time, by  [CONTACT_543796]:
AE collection 
ACT (for subjects with history  of asthma or newl y-diagnosed asthma) 
Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_99399]
Urine pregnancy  test results (for women of childbearing potential)
PEF results
Note: For remote PEF measurements the following should be done:

Page 90of 100To prepare subjects to do remote PEF measurement at home in case 
it is needed during the course of the study , all subjects should be 
trained on site at baseline visits. 
During the remote visits, subjects can receive additional support (if 
needed) over the phone or video call b y site staff when performing
PEF. 
If a subject has a PEF <80% of the predicted value:
Site staff can try to evaluate whether this is due to poor 
technique and ask the subject to repeat the set of 
measurements
-If the subject’s best PEF measurement is still <80% of the 
predicted value or if there are other concerns regarding the 
subject’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_77551], refer to appropriate physician 
and report an AESI depending on the judgment of the 
investigator (see Section 12.7.5 )
-All laboratory samples should be collected at the site and analyzed at the 
central lab. Only in exceptional situations when subject safety  cannot be 
assured otherwise and subject cannot reach the site, a local laboratory  test (i.e., 
hematology , blood chemistry , urinaly sis) can be performed and reported, based 
on Investigator judgment. 
Subject -reported assessments that would usually  be collected on 
the site tablet (e.g., ACT) may be completed over the phone, as 
available.
All missing assessments should be appropriatel y documented with COVID -19 recorded as the 
reason, where applicable.

Management of Subjects with Missed Doses of Study Drug due to COVID -[ADDRESS_710131] study  drug injection.
15.5 Monitoring
On-site interim monitoring visits may not be feasible during COVID -19 restrictions; therefore, 
remote monitoring will be completed until on-site monitori ng can be conducted again. Site 
monitoring activity  will comply  with the processes documented within the COVI D-19 Site 
Management Risk Assessment Form.

Page 92of 100Appendix 2Contraception Guidelines
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use at least [ADDRESS_710134] dose of stud y treatment. 
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently  sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectom y, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , and bilateral oophorectomy . A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contrac eption or hormonal replacement 
therap y. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient. 
A man is considered fertile after pubert y unless permanently sterile by [CONTACT_10879] y.
Adequate methods of contr aception include:
combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (administration may  be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal)
progestogen-onl y hormonal contraception associated with inhibition ofovulation 
(administration may  be oral, injectable, or implantable)
intrauterine device
intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem
combination of male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double 
barrier methods) 
bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion
bilateral vasectom y (provided that the male partner has a medical assessment of 
surgical success) at least 12 weeks (3 months) before the study
sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk in relation to the duration of the clinical trial, in line with the preferred 
and usual lifesty le of the subject)
All subjects will be strongl y advised that they should not become pregnant while on study  
treatment or for 12 weeks (3 months) after the last dose. A female subject will be advised that she 
must report immediately  to the study  site for pregnancy  testing and appropriate management in the 
event that she may  be pregnant.

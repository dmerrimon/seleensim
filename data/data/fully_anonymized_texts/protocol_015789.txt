Protocol Number: VP -[ADDRESS_486786] as scoring elements 
external to the balloon when the balloon is inflated.  The presence of the external scoring 
elements outside the angioplasty balloon create a focal stress pattern which allows for 
opening of lesions at lower pressures using a concept of Focused Force Angioplasty [FFA].   
 
In the early 1990’s, the FFA concept evolved out of the clinical practice of the “buddy wire” 
technique for enhanced angiopla sty effectiveness by [CONTACT_388277].  This practice was developed as the use of fixed -
wire angioplasty balloon catheters  was common, therefore a practice was developed of 
placing guide wires across lesions prior to dilation to “protect” the distal vasculature by 
[CONTACT_388278] -angioplasty1.Using this technique it was observed that having a guide wire 
across a steno sis when an angioplasty balloon was inflated was useful in dilating calci fied2 
and resistant lesions3 in what has become known as the “buddy wire” technique.  Based upon 
this practice, Solar and Ischinge r4 introduced the concept of FFA with a balloon angio plasty 
system designed specifically with the guide wire and an external wire on the outside of the 
balloon to introduce high focal stresses along the luminal surface of the balloon.  There are 
several cutting and scoring design concepts based upon FFA that  have been introduced to 
the US market, including  devices using a parallel external wire similar to the commercially 
available FX miniRAIL . 
 
2.1. Description of Investigational Device  
The S coreflex NC Scoring PTCA Catheter is a catheter designed for easy guidewire 
exchange and available with balloon diameters in 1.75, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 2.[ADDRESS_486787] pressure of 20 ATM . The proximal shaft of the catheter is composed of a 
female luer connector bonded to a PTFE coated stainless steel hypotube  and the 
scoring wire is laser welded to the distal end of the stainless steel hypotube . The 
proximal shaft joins with a smooth tran sition to the distal shaft (composed of an 
outer nylon tube with the balloon/tip tube and scoring wire welded at the distal tip). 
The cutting section of the scoring wire is outside of the balloon. Two radiopaque 
platinum/iridium marker bands are located on  the scoring wire and aligned with the 
balloon shoulders to ensure accurate positioning of the balloon. The tip lumen is 
compatible with a standard  0.014 inch (0.36mm) guidewire. The guidewire enters 
the catheter tip and advances coaxially out the Rx port,  thereby [CONTACT_388279] a single standard length guidewire. 
Two marked sections, 5mm in length, are located on the proximal shaft indicating 
the catheter position relative to the tip of either a brachial or femoral guiding catheter.

2.6.1 FX miniRAIL™ Catheter Clinical Experience  
The FX miniRAIL catheter, a dedicated FFA balloon angioplasty catheter, was 
introduced in [ADDRESS_486789] a lower restenosis rate than that seen with Plain Ol d 
Balloon Angioplasty [POBA]7.  
The FFA mechanism of action of the FX miniRAIL catheter was demonstrated in a 
porcine angioplasty model where with histology post -angioplasty a controlled 
dissection along a focal “nick” was observed with the FX catheter com pared to a 
relatively uncontrolled mural disruption was observed with conventional 
angioplasty balloon catheters; an observation supported with clinical case examples 
showing a localized scoring with the FX cat heter as shown by [CONTACT_388281]8. 
The first -in-man clinical experience with the FX miniRAIL catheter to support CE -
marking was a single -center registry in [LOCATION_013] where 30 subjects presenting with 
37 lesions, de novo  (68%) and in -stent restenosis (32%), treated with the FX catheter 
followed by [CONTACT_388282] (51%), beta -radiation (11%), and no further treatment (38%) 
which resulted in a 8 -month major adverse coronary event [MACE] rate of 8.1%, 
where all events were target l esion revascularization [TLR]9.  
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_388261] a multicenter registry at 12 
sites where 263 subjects presenting with single or multiple vessel coronary artery 
disease [CAD] treated with the FX catheter, which resulte d in a n in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
Procedural Success rate of 94.8%, defined as <50% diameter stenosis in at least one 
FX-attempted lesions without death, Q wave or non -Q wave MI, or emergency 
CABG during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and a Clinical Success rate of 97.1%, defined  as 
freedom from MACE – death, Q wave or non -Q wave MI, or TLR at the 14 -day 
follow -up9. The clinical success included seven (7) subjects with at least one MACE 
event. Six (6) of the patients experienced MACE event(s) while in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], one (1) 
experienced  a MACE event, a  non-Q wave MI  related to a subsequent non -target 
lesion revascularization, not due to the FX miniRAIL procedure.

2.6.2 Scoreflex™ Clinical Experience  
The first FFA catheter developed by [CONTACT_388283]™ catheter.  Two 
case reports for this first generation product were published in [ADDRESS_486790] -PCI11. 
The second generation of FFA catheters developed by [CONTACT_388284].   Pre -clinical bench top and finite element analysis [FEA] 
modeling work with the Scoreflex has demonstrated th e mechanistic action of the 
FFA design with demonstration of superior expansion in a calcium tube model at 
lower pressures than with POBA. FEA modeling revealed concentration of the stress 
observed in the outside of the calcified plaque just opposite the s coring element is 
the underlying mechanism, and validation of the scoring mechanism of crack 
propagation indeed being associated with the scoring elements using ultra -high 
speed videography12. 
The clinical experience with the Scoreflex catheter found in th e literature includes 
several single center studies investigating the safety and effectiveness of FFA 
treatment to prepare lesions for optimal stent deployment and an interesting case 
report.

OrbusNeich Medical Trading, Inc.              Confidential   Page 18 Kato et al.13 reported on a series of 21 consecutive patients presenting with heavily 
calcified lesions treated with rotational atherectomy [RA] followed by [CONTACT_388285]/no angioplasty prior to DES 
implantation . Quantitative IVUS imaging was then performed and followed up with 
QCA.  The use of the Scoreflex balloon was associated with a significantly higher 
number of cracks in the calcific plaque as visualized by [CONTACT_388286]/no angioplasty, 1.8±0.4 versus 1.0±0.8; p=0.02.  Also, the DES 
deployment after Scoreflex dilation showed a significantly improved rate of 
symmetrical deployment, defined as quotient of the minimum and maximum stent 
diameters measured at the point of minimal cross -sectional area [CSA] over balloon 
angioplasty/no angioplasty, 0.83±0.05  versus 0.76±0.07.  No acute stent thrombosis 
and no major complications (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, emergent by[CONTACT_13786]) were observed at in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274376] -up.  12 -month angiographic follow up 
found no restenosis with Scoreflex compared to  the balloon angioplasty/no 
angioplasty cohort, which experienced a restenosis rate of 29%.  
Sadamatusu et al14 reported on their single center randomized comparison in 46 
consecutive patients of the effectiveness of Scoreflex predilation versus the use of a 
non-compliant balloon prior to IVUS -guided DES implantation on stent deployment 
and clinical outcomes.  The use of the NC balloons resulted in significantly larger 
balloon sizing (3.33±0.28 vs. 3.09±0.33mm, p=0.01) and significantly higher 
dilation press ures (11.6±3.2 vs. 8.6±2.7 atm., p<0.01) compared with the use of 
Scoreflex.  However, QCA at 8 -month follow -up revealed a significantly smaller in -
stent late lumen loss (0.71±0.63 vs. 0.23±0.52mm, p=0.03) with the Scoreflex group, 
while there were no sign ificant differences observed in the MACE rates between the 
groups.  
Okuya et al15 presented a case report in which a long dissection developed in a 
patient after balloon angioplasty resulting in a flow -compromising intramural 
hematoma. This persisted after a DES was placed over the original balloon dilation 
site.  It was decided to attempt to use the Scoreflex balloon to create a fenestration 
between the true lumen and the hematoma to relieve the flow obstruction.  The 
Scoreflex balloon was able be inserted and deployed distal to the DES which resulted 
to restoration of TIMI -3 flow and the patient’s symptoms subsided with a good 
angiographic result.   Follow -up coronary angiograms at [ADDRESS_486791] 
imaging was used to shown that stent expansion was shown to be significantly 
higher after pre -dilation with Scoreflex as compared to conventional balloon 
angioplasty with a semi -compliant balloon (68.0% vs. 62.1%, p=0.017) and intim al 
disruption was more prevalent in the scoring group (68.0% vs. 38.4%, p=0.035) and 
more extensive (102° vs. 65°, p=0.038).  Only one case of restenosis necessitating 
TLR was observed in the conventional angioplasty group, otherwise no adverse

The clinical literature on the Scoreflex balloon has shown this FFA technology to 
be safe and effective in improving stent deployment after predilation in de n ovo and 
in heavily calcified lesions as compared to conventional balloon angioplasty 
predilation.

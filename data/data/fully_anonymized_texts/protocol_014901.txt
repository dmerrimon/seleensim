Study Design
This will be a single -center, part -randomized, open -label, single -dose, [ADDRESS_464580] of food and of esomeprazole on the PK of balovaptan in healthy 
volunteers.
Screening will be conducted between Day -28 and Day -2. 
In Period 1, eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU ) on Day -1 (the 
day prior to balovaptan dosing on Day 1) and will remain confined in the CRU until discharge on 
the morning of Day 5.
In Period 2, subjects will be re- admitted to the CRU on Day -1 (the day prior to balovaptan 
dosing on Day 1) and will rem ain confined in the CRU until discharge on the morning of Day 5. 
In Period 3, subjects will return to the CRU for re -admission 5 day s prior to administration of 
balovaptan (Day 9 of Period 2) to begin esomeprazole dosing. Esomeprazole will be dosed for 6 
days: for [ADDRESS_464581] 12 days and up to 21 days between administration sof 
balovaptan . Thus, re -admission for Period 2 may be between 3 to 12 days after Day 9 of 
Period 1, and readmission for Period 3 will be on Day  9 of Period 2.
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (ABC or BAC) on Day 1 of Period 1 , 
with the treatments being as follows:
Treatment A: 20mg balovaptan administered as a single oral dose following consumption 
of high- fat, high -calorie meal 
Treatment B: 20mg balovaptan administered as a single oral dose after a ≥10-hourfast
Treatment C: 40 mg esomeprazole administered once daily for 6 day s and with a single 
dose of balovaptan 20mg 1 hour after the fifthesomeprazole dose in thefasted state
Subjects will return for a follow -up visit on Day 16 ± [ADDRESS_464582] 50% male and 50% female participants, 
and at least 30% of each sex .

Protocol WP41047 v1.0 13Statistical Methods
Primary Analysis
Analysis of variance models will be applied to the logarithmically transformed PK parameters of 
balovaptan AUC 0-inf and C max, to investigate 1) the relative bioavailability of balovaptan 20 -mg
dispersible tablets administered following a high -fat, high -calorie meal vs in the fasted state, and 
2) the relative bioavailability of balovaptan 20 -mgdispersible tablets administered in the fasted 
state either alone or in combination with esomeprazole.
Determination of Sample Size :
Sixteen subjects will be enrolled with the target of at least 12 subjects available for the final PK 
analysis. Considering the observed residual CV% for AUC 0-inf from Study WP40038 of 
approximately 14%, with 12 subjects the 90% CI would be obtained by [CONTACT_60875]/multiplying the 
ratio estimate by a factor of 1.11.

1.1 AUTISM SPECTRUM DISO RDER
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder
characterized by [CONTACT_371424]: impairments in social interaction and communication
and the presence of repetitive or restricted behaviors, interests, or activities ( American
Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2013 ). 
The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network recently reported, based 
on pediatric records, that the estimated prevalence of ASD in the U Sfor the year 2010 
was 14.7 per 1000 ( 1in 68) children aged 8 years ( Autism and Developmental 
Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2010 Principal Investigators, 2014 ). 
Core symptoms of ASD affecting domains of socialization, communication, and repetitive 
behavior are usually observ ed by [ADDRESS_464597] approach to treat the 
deficits at the core of these disorders.
Balovaptan (RO5285119) is a potent and selective human V1a receptor antagonist that 
blocks the activation of the V1a G protein -coupled receptor . More detailed information 
regarding ASD and balovaptan are presented in the Investigator ’s Brochure.

1.2.1 Previous and On going Clinical Studies
The clinical development program of balovaptan started with the entry -into-human Study 
BP25694, which assessed the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of 
escalating single and multiple doses of balovaptan. Subsequently, the excretion balance, 
PK, and metabolism of balovaptan were investigated in a mass balance study (Study 
BP29279). Four drug -drug interaction studies assessed the interaction of balovapt an as 
a P-gp inhibitor with the P -gp substrate risperidone (Study BP28318), the effect of the 
CYP3A4 inhibitors itraconazole and fluoxetine on the PK of a single dose of balovaptan 
(Study BP28977), and the effect of itraconazole and rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_371402] (Studies W P40609 and W P40608, respectively). A study comparing 
the Phase 3tablet formulation with formulations used in Phase 1and 2studies has been 
completed (Study WP40038). A proof -of-mechanism study (Study BP29412) to 
investigate the effect of balovaptan on vasopressin pathway activation in healthy male 
volunteers has also been completed. Additionally, a thorough QT (TQT) study 
(WP40734) and an absolute bioavailability study (W P40607) are clinically complete, with 
reporti ng ongoing at the time of protocol writing.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 19A Phase 2study investigating the efficacy and safety of balovaptan in male adults with 
ASD (Study BP28420) has been completed. In total 223 patients were enrolled into this 
study at 26 sites in the U S. The patie nts were randomized 2:1 to balovaptan or placebo. 
In total, 192 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment ; of these 192 patients, 25, 69, 
and 30 patients received 1.5mg, 4mg, and 10mg balovaptan, respectively, and 67 
patients received placebo .
Balovaptan is currently being investigated in a Phase 2pediatric study to assess the
efficacy, safety, and PK of balovaptan in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age ) and 
children (5 to 12years of age) with ASD (Study BP30153). Recruitment into this study 
started in November 2016 and wascompleted in September 2019 (339 enrolled) . A 
Phase 3study investigating the efficacy and safety of balovaptan in adults with ASD 
(Study W N39434) is underway. Recruitment into this study started in August 2018 and 
wasongoing at the time of protocol writing .A Phase 1b study investigating the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in children (2 -4 years of age) with ASD 
(WP40877) is also ongoing.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacology
Exposure of balovaptan increased in a greater than dose -proporti onal manner following 
single doses of 0.5 to 76 mg, whereas an approximately linear increase in exposure was 
observed after repeated dosing with 12 to 52 mg once daily (qd) for 14 days . Balovaptan 
was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a median time to maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Tmax ) between 1 and 4.5 hours after administration of single doses in fasted state and 
between 3 and 4 hours in the fed state following multiple dosing . Steady state was 
achieved after approximately 7 days; the mean apparent eliminat ion half -life after the 
last dose (Day 14) was approximately [ADDRESS_464599] on the 
overall exposure of balovaptan. The terminal half -livesafter 14 once daily dosing of 
balovaptan 10 mg for balovaptan, , respectively 
In the human mass balance study (Study BP29279), an almost complete absorption of

balovaptan in healthy volunteers.
Screening will be conducted between Day -28 and Day -2. 
In Period 1, eli gible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on 
Day -1 (the day prior to balovaptan dosing on Day 1 ) and will remain confined in the 
CRU until discharge on the morning of Day 5. 
In Period 2, subjects will be re -admitted to the CRU on Day -1 (the day prior to 
balovaptan dosing on Day 1 ) and will remain confined in the CRU until discharge on the 
morning of Day 5.
In Period 3 , subjects will return to the CRU for re-admission 5 days prior to 
administration of balovaptan (Day 9 of Period 2)to begin esomeprazole dosing . 
Esomeprazole will be dosed for 6 days :for [ADDRESS_464604] 12 days and up to 21 days between administration s
of balovaptan. Thus, re-admission for Period 2 may be between 3 to 12 days after Day 9 
of Period 1, and re- admission for Period 3 will be on Day 9 of Period 2 .

label study was considered appropriate because of the objective nature of the PK 
measures.
3.3.1 Rationale for Balova ptan and Esom eprazole Dose 
[IP_ADDRESS] Balovaptan
A dose of 20mg balovaptan is the highest daily dose that is currently foreseen to be 
used in further clinical development .
Based on previous clinical experience ,single dose sof balovaptan 20mg are expected 
to be well tolerated . The effect of food on the plasma exposure of balovaptan has 
previously been shown to be small ,within particular ,a reduction in C max;esomeprazole 
is expected to have either no effect on or to reduce the exposure of balova ptan.
[IP_ADDRESS] Esomeprazole
The study will examine the effect of esomeprazole 40mgon the PK of a single dose of 
20mg balovaptan. Esomeprazole is an approved medication ,and the dose planned for 
this study ,40mgqd,is approved for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers and 
has an acceptable safety profile. During repeated once- daily dosing with an 
enteric- coated granule capsule omeprazole formulation, inhibition of acid secretion 
increases initially, and stabilizes within about 4 days ( Olbe, 1989 ). The mean percentage 
of time with intragastric pH > 4 increases significantly after 5 days of dosing compared to 
after a single dose with esomeprazole 40 mg (Röhss, 2002 ). Intragastric pH rises to 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 26above 4 about 1 hour to 2 hours after the morning of Day 5 ( Lind, 2000). In the current 
study, esomeprazole 40 mg will be dosed for 4consecutive days prior to 
coadministration with a single dose of balovaptan on the fifthday of esomeprazole 
dosing (Day 1), followe d by a further single dose of esomeprazole on Day [ADDRESS_464608] been chosen as 
the study population due to the low risk of this study . Moreover, use of healthy subjects, 
as opposed to patients, will allow a clearer interpretation of the study results, as there 
will be no confounding factors that result from changes in disease state and/or 
concomitant medication use.

assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital signs, and conducting other protocol -
specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the stu dy.The 
schedule for conducting these activities is provided in Appendix 1 .
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4.
5.2.1 Adverse Events
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , an AEis any untoward 
medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of causal attribution. An AEcan therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or n ot considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition )(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms o r leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invas ive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
AnSAE is any AEthat meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the AEactually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the Investigator or designee , places the 
subject at immediate risk of death)
oThis does not include any AEthat,had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue ,might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1916] (Section [IP_ADDRESS] )

5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs are recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF and source form and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with 
instructions provided in this Section and in Sections 5.4-5.6.
For each AErecorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form, the Investi gator or 
designee will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 ), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 
5.3.[ADDRESS_464645] ’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form .
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug ,only SAEs
caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., discontinuation of medications) should 
be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting SAEs).
After initiation of study drug, all AEs will be reported until up to 14 days after the final
dose of study drug.
Instructions for reporting AEs that occur after the AEreporting period are provided in 
Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting AE
information. Examples of non- directive questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
Table 3provides guidance for assessing AE severity.

Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity
Note : Regardless of severity, some events may  also meet seriousness criteria. Refer 
to definition of a nSAE (see Section 5.2.2 ).
5.3.[ADDRESS_464647] , the circumstances 
surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to 
determine whether an AEis considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes"
or "no"accordingly . The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 4 )
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug ( asapplicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the subject or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Table 4Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the AEsuspected to be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AEand 
administration of the study drug, and the AEcannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560] 'sclinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE
follows a kno wn pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the AEabates or resolves 
upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears 
upon re -challenge.
NO An AEwill be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . 
Evidence exists that the AEhas an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., preexisting 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); 
and/or the AEhas no plausible temporal relationship to administr ation of the study drug 
(e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_464648] dose of study drug).
For subjects receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy .
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.[ADDRESS_464649] medical terminology/concepts when 
recording AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form . Avoid colloquialisms and 
abbreviations.
Only one AEterm should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
source form .
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form
rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis 
rather than jaundice, asterixi s, and elevated transaminases) . However, if a constellation 
of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or 
syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and source form. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all 
previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by [CONTACT_371429], with a starting date that corresponds to 
the starting date of the fi rst symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, AEs that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of sever e or 
serious secondary events . A medically significant secondary AEthat is separated in time 
from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse 
Event eCRF and source form . For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydrati on with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all 3events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separatel y on the eCRF.
All AEs should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form if it 
is unclear as to whether the events are associated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent AEis one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject
evaluation timepoints . Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event 
eCRF and source form . The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.[ADDRESS_464650] extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
source form . If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; 
see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions) . The Adverse Event eCRF and source form
should be updated by [CONTACT_25748] "nonserious " to "serious," providing the 
date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to SAEs.
A recurrent AEis one that resolves between subject evaluation timepoints and 
subsequently recurs . Each recurrence of an AEshould be recorded as a separate event 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form .
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an AE. A laboratory test result must be 
reported as an AEif it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium suppl ementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the Investigator or designee ’s judgment 
It is the Investigator or designee’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings . Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an AE.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source 
form.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form , 
along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal 
range (e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium "). If the 
laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard 
definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE. For example, an elevated
serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details on recording persistent AEs).
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 [IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE. A vital sign result must be reported 
as an AEif it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervent ion or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the Investigator or designee ’s judgment 
It is the Investigator or designee’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings . Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercised in deci ding whether an isolated vital sign 
abnormality should be classified as an AE.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF and source form .
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details on recording persistent AEs).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law ). Therefore, Investigator or designees must report as an AEthe 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event), either as a SAE or an AESI (see Section 5.4.2).
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AEreporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and source form and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event . The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 49concept on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form . Generally, only one such eve nt 
should be reported . If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the 
time of reporting, "unexplained death "should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF 
and source form . If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy ), 
"unexplained death "should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749] . The term 
"sudden death" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death 
(e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
Deaths that occur after the AEreporting period should be reported as described in 
Section 5.6.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study . 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AEonly if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study . When recording such 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form , it is i mportant to convey the 
concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").

should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). For balovaptan, adverse events associated 
with special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:
Accidental over dose: Enter the AEterm. Check the "Accidental overdose" and 
"Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose : Enter the AEterm. Check the 
"Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose : Enter the AEterm. Check the 
"Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
In addition, all special situations associated with balovaptan, regardless of whether they 
result in an AE, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described below:
Accidental ove rdose : Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose : Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the er ror (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expi[INVESTIGATOR_26669]) as the event term . Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose : Enter the drug name [CONTACT_1629] d "accidental 
overdose" as the event term . Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes . Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.

prematurely withdrawn from the study or not .
Safety will be assessed through summaries of exposure to study treatment, adverse 
events, changes in laboratory test results, and changes in vital signs and ECGs.
Study tre atment exposure (such as treatment , duration [as applicable] ,and total dose 
received) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.
All verbatim AEterms will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
thesaurus terms, and AEseverity will be graded according to Table 3. All AEs, SAEs , 
AEs leading to death, AESIs , and AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation that 
occur on or after the first dose of study treatment (i.e., treatment -emergent adverse 
events) will be summarized by [CONTACT_27940], appropriate thesaurus level, and severity 
grade . For events of varying severity, the highest grade will be used in the summaries .
Deaths and cause of death will be summarized.

for exclusion. All decisions on exclusions from the analysis will be made prior to 
database lock.
The following balovaptan, metabolites M2(as appropriate) and M3, and esomeprazole 
PK parameters will be estimated:
Cmax:maximum plasma concentration
AUC( 0-inf):area under the concentration -time curve from time extrapolated to infinity 
AUC( 0-24h):area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours 
AUC last:area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_464662] 
quantifiable concentration 
Tmax:time to reach Cmaxin plasma 
Clast:last quantifiable concentration 
Tlast:time to the last quantif iable concentration 
 Tlag: time between dosing and time of first balovaptan plasma concentration.
Cl/F: apparent clearance
Vd/F: apparent volume of distribution
T1/2:terminal elimination phase half -life
Individual and mean concentration versus time data will be plotted on linear and 
semi logarithmic scales. Plasma concentrations and derived plasma PK parameters will 
be listed for balovaptan and its metabolites. Summary statistics of PK parameters, 
includin g means, geometric means, medians, ranges, SD, CV% will be presented for 
each treatment. Analysis of variance models will be applied to the logarithmically 
transformed PK parameters of balovaptan AUC 0-infand C max, to investigate 1) the relative 
bioavailab ility of balovaptan 20 -mgdispersible tablets administered following a high -fat, 
high-calorie meal vs in the fasted state, and 2) the relative bioavailability of balovaptan 
20-mgdispersible tablets administered in the fasted state either alone or in combi nation 
with esomeprazole.
The effect of food on the PK of balovaptan will be assessed using the ratio and 90% CIs 
of the geometric least squares (LS) means of the plasma PK parameters Cmaxand 
AUC 0-inffor balovaptan. A linear mixed model with fixed effect s for treatment, period, 
sequence, and a random effect for subject nested in sequence will be used on the 
natural log -transformed parameters. Point estimates on the natural log scale will be 
exponentiated to obtain point estimates on the original scale of measurement. Geometric 
LS means will be provided for each treatment. Food had no relevant effect on the overall 
exposure of the capsule formulation of balovaptan but T maxwas shifted from 1 hour after 
dosing under fasted condition sto approximately 3 hours in fed conditions.

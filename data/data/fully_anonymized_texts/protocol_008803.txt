Indication:   
Metastatic colorectal  cancer  third line therapy  
CryoVaxTM:  
CryoVaxTM is the name [CONTACT_167367] [CONTACT_167274] -situ 
vaccination step.  This protocol includes an  in-situ cancer vaccine step, which combines  a 
percutan eous ablation of a sing le metastatic tumor lesion with intralesional immunotherapy  
serving as an adjuvant . In this protocol, t he ablation step is conducted using a percutaneous 
cryoablation  procedure (CA). The ablation of the selected tumor lesion causes release of 
tumor -specific antigens int o the microenvironment (antigen source) and the intralesional 
immunotherapy serves as an adjuvant to promote maturation of dendritic cells  (DC)  that 
engulf and process released tumor antigens . The mature DC  migrate to the draining lymph 
nodes to elicit a Th1-type tumor -specific immune response. The combination of ablation and 
intralesional immunotherapy thus create s an in -situ, patient -specific , anti-tumor vaccine .  
Some subjects enrolled in this study are scheduled to undergo cryoablation, while other 
subjects are scheduled to receive IV doses to try to create an in -vivo, patient -specific, anti -
tumor in-situ vaccine.  
T-StimTM:  
T-StimTM cells are an intermediate product  in the process of making the study drug called 
AlloStim®. T-StimTM is ex-vivo di fferentiated  and expanded memory CD4 T -cells that 
uniquely function as both Th1 cells (produce IFN -gamma and not IL -4) and natural killer 
cells (contain granzyme B and perforin and lyse tumor cells and not normal cells  in-vitro ). T-
StimTM cells are derived  from  the blood of normal donors (allogeneic)  and are intentionally 
mismatched to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] . The T-StimTM production process involves first purifying CD4+ 
T-cells from buffy coat material collected from known normal screened blood  donors.  The 
CD4+ cel ls are cultured in the presence of Dynabeads® ClinExVivo™  CD3/CD28 beads for 9 
days. After the 9-day culture process, the CD4+ cells expand approximately [ADDRESS_194420] 18 months. T-StimTM cells are pr oduced in 
Jerusalem , Israel  under cGMP  and are certified USP sterile and low endotoxin (validated gel 
clot method) before release . All blood donors are screened pursuant to 21 CFR 1271 and 
tested to be free from blood -borne infectious diseases pursuant to  US regulations  (HIV1,

batch is  also tested to meet pre -determined identity and functional requirements prior to 
release.   
AlloStim®:  
AlloStim® is formulated T -StimTM cells that have been activated by [CONTACT_167275]3/CD28 -
conjugated microbeads and packaged in a syringe.  AlloStim® is prepared by [CONTACT_167276] , 
QC released T -StimTM cells and incubating the cells for 4  hours with Dynabeads® 
ClinExVivo™  CD3/CD28 . The beads are mixed wi th the cells at a 2:1 bead to cell ratio. After 
4 hours, the cells with the beads attached are harvested, washed and suspended in formulation 
buffer containing PlasmaLyteA® supplemented with 1% human serum albumin. The 
formulated cells with the beads still attached are then loaded in a syringe  for infusion or 
injection . A sample from the syringe lot is tested for bacterial contamination with a Rapid 
Microbiological M ethod (RMM) with results at 24  -48 hours. AlloStim® syringes are 
packaged in validated tempe rature -controlled containers and shipped by [CONTACT_167277] [ADDRESS_194421] 72 hours in this final formulation.  AlloStim® is 
available in the following dosage forms:   
• 1 ml formulation buffer containing 1 x 107 cells with 2 x 107 beads attached  in a 3  ml 
syringe  for intradermal injections  (ID) and intratumoral (IT) injection ,  
• 3 ml formulation buffer containing 3 x 107 cells with 6 x 107 beads attached in a 10  ml 
syringe  for intravenous  injection  (IV) and intratumoral (IT) injection , 
• 5 ml of formulation buffer containing  5 x 107 cells attached to  1 x 108 beads in a 10 ml 
syringe  for intravenous infusion  (IV).  
Note: some cohorts call for a 0.[ADDRESS_194422] the remai ning

Study Purpose :  
This is a Phase IIa open label , study  designed to compare AlloStim+cryoablation vs AlloStim 
alone  
Brief Description of the Protocol:  
This is a  single center,  open label  study comparing  CryoVaxTM personalized anti -tumor 
vaccin e protocol combining the cryoablation  of a selected metastatic lesion with intra -lesional 
immunotherapy  with AlloStim® alone . The treatment schedules both have the following steps: 
(1) priming with intradermal AlloStim®; (2) vaccination combining cryoablat ion with 
intratumoral AlloStim® or intravenous AlloStim® dosing in the place of cryoablation ; (3) 
activation with intravenous AlloStim®; and (4) booster with intravenous AlloStim®. All 
subjects are followed for safety during the dosing period and until [ADDRESS_194423] 
dose (Safety Evaluation Period”) .  All subjects are continued to be followed for survival after 
the Safety Evaluation Period . 
Dosing Schedule A -1: Treatment With Cryoablation   
The priming step:  Subjects will receive an ID injection of AlloStim® (0.5 ml ) on Days 0, 7, 
and 14  all in different locations . 
The vaccination step:  Subjects will receive cryoablation  and intratumor (IT) injection of 
AlloStim® (1 ml) on Day 21.  
The activation step : Subjects will receive an IV infusion of AlloStim® (3ml) on Day 28.

Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, 2017    Page 8 of 94 
 The booster  step:  Subjects will receive two (optional)  IV booster infusions of AlloStim® 
(3ml), one on Day 56, a second on Day 84.  
 
Dosing Schedule A -2: AlloStim® without cryoablation  
The priming step:  Subjects will receive an ID injection of AlloStim® (1 ml) on Days  0, 3, 7, 
10 and 14 . 
The vaccination step:  Subjects will receive an IV injection of AlloStim® (3 ml) of on Day 21 . 
The activation step : Subjects will receive an IV infusion of AlloStim® (3ml) on Day 28.  
The booster step:  Subjects will receive three (optional)  IV booster infusions of AlloStim® 
(3ml), one on Day 49, a second on Day 77. 
 
Two types of toxicity are assessed for determination of whether a Dose Limiting Toxicity 
(DLT) has occurred. An acute dose limiting  toxicity (ADLT) is assessed within 48h of a dose 
administration during the priming, vaccination and activation steps of each protocol.   
Cumulative dose limiting toxicity (CDLT) is assessed during the complete Safety Evaluation 
Period including any ADLT th at occurs in the booster dosing.  
An ADLT is defined as  the occurrence of any of the following within 48h of dosing : 
• Any ≥ Grade 3 local injection site reaction;  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 infusion related symptoms of duration > 2 days;  
• Any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_194424] will occur after an ADLT 
event.  
A CDLT event is defined as  the occurrence of any of the following within the Safety 
Evaluation Period : 
• Any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_194425] disease  
• Any toxicity ≥ Grade 3 that is probably or definitely related to the study drug ; 
• Any toxicity not present at baseline t hat occurs at  ≥ Grade 4  
• Any autoimmune toxicity ≥ Grade 3 not present at baseline  
All adverse events (AE s) and serious adverse events (SAE s), regardless of attribution to the 
study drug , will be coded, graded and become part of the final safety report for each cohort.  
The Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will review the safety data on each cohort and 
recommend whether to advance enrollment to the next cohort.  
The development of any Grade [ADDRESS_194426] at any time will prompt a 
review of safety data by [CONTACT_1034], PI [INVESTIGATOR_167215]. It is re cognized that Grade 4 events and death can occur in this population due to 
disease progression. Therefore, dosing will continue for currently enrolled subjects at the 
occurrence of a grade 4 event according to protocol unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167216] 4 or 
greater event is definitely or probably related to the study d rug. If attribution is assigned to 
the study drug dosing will be suspended pending review by [CONTACT_4318] .   
In accordance with the 3+[ADDRESS_194427] dosin g 
schedule. If during the priming, vaccination and activation steps no ADLT are observed in 
any of the three subjects, accrual into the next cohort is allowed. If an ADLT occurs in two of 
the three subjects, no further dose frequency escalation is allowed.  If ADLT occurs in one of

Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, 2017    Page 9 of 94 
 the three subjects, three additional subjects will be accrued into the same cohort. If no ADLT 
occurs within the additional three subjects, accrual into the next cohort can begin. If an ADLT 
is observed in any of the additional th ree subjects, no further dose escalation is permitted.  
The development of  any DLT toxicity in ≥ 33% of the accumulated number of subjects in any 
and all dosing schedules during the Safety Evaluation Period will result in protocol 
discontinuation.  
At the completion of the Safety Evaluation Period for all cohorts, the safety evaluation of Part

Safety Assessments:  
The following evaluations will be used to  assess the safety of the investigational product:  
• Physical examination, vital signs and laboratory evaluations (including a CBC with 
differential and comprehensive metabolic panel  (CMP) , coagulation factors, C-
reactive protein (CRP) , total IgG and IgM, e rythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum 
lipase , and autoimmune blood screens ). 
• Adverse Events (AEs) recording according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 4.03.  
• Interrogation  of subject , caregivers and family regarding any changes in health 
condition , in person or by [CONTACT_756].

 Radiology  Assessment :  
All subjects will undergo a CT scan of the head, chest, abdomen and pelvis with and without 
contrast (contrast can be withheld if medically indicated) at baseline and at Day [ADDRESS_194436] scans is 
conducted as an experimen tal end -point. It is known that after immunotherapy that subjects 
can develop new lesions, experience lymphadenopathy and interval size increases in tumors. 
These changes would normally be documented as progression. However, in immunotherapy, 
the changes c ould represent “pseudo -progression”. In some cases, the changes could indicate 
actual progression, but a response can still occur months after immunotherapy. Other times, 
immunotherapy can cause a stable disease condition that results in increased survival . 
 
The changes in the images will be analyzed by [CONTACT_167280] a method that best correlates with 
survival outcomes. The CT scans are scheduled on the same day as biopsy proce dures in 
order to correlate the radiological images with pathological response. It is believed that 
patterns of necrosis, fibrosis and immune cell infiltration patterns with HU numb ers on the 
radiographic images may provide correlates that could distinguis h immune response from 
progression or be predictive of a survival response.  Radiographic images can be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_167281]. At the discretion of the PI, select 
subjects may be further evaluated by [CONTACT_167282] i n order to attempt to distinguish between 
radiological “pseudo -progression ” due to an immune response and actual progression.  
Histop athology  Assessment :  
Subjects will undergo mandatory tumor biopsies of a target lesion at baseline, during 
intratumoral in jections (Schedule A -1) and at Day [ADDRESS_194437] images. The amount 
and type of immune cell infiltration  (immunohistochemical analysis) , existence of coagulative 
necrosis, necrotic tumor and fibrosis will also be documented and correlated to the 
radiological images.   
 
Immunological Monitoring  Assessments :  
Research blood draws for monitoring of immunological response will be drawn at day 0 prior  
to study drug injection (baseline) . A research blood draw is scheduled prior to study drug 
administration on Day 0, Day 28, Day 56 and Day 84 in Schedule A -1 and Day 0,21, 49 and 
77 in Schedule A -2.  
Immunological tests include: engraftment study  (HLA) , serum cytokines  and polyclonal

laboratory approved by [CONTACT_1034]. The laboratory will isolate and store PBMC, serum and 
plasma for subsequent immunological testing. These samples will be transported in bulk 
using a dry shipper to the Sponsor’s laboratory in Jerusalem for analysi s. The  research  blood 
collection days are designed to obtain information on the mechanism of action of the drug. It 
is important that the minimum required amount of blood is collected and processed in 
accordance with the SOPs. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_167218].    
Clinical Laboratory Tests:  
Changes in laboratory levels are evaluated in order to determine if the study drug is related to , 
or might cause , any changes in serum chemistry, he matological function, liver or kidney 
function , or maintenance of immune self -tolerance  (autoimmune tests) . All subjects will be 
monitored for changes in laboratory values in CBC, CMP (including liver function test, 
kidney function tests) lipase,  total IgG  and IgM, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,  and CRP  at 
baseline and weekly during the Safety Evaluation P eriod . Coagulation studies (PT, PTT, and 
INR) are conducted at baseline and prior to interventional procedures (biopsy, cryoablation 
and intratumoral inj ections). An autoimmune panel will be assessed on day 0 (baseline, prior 
to drug administration) and on the last day of the Safety Evaluation Period.   
The laboratory reports should be de -identified and provided to the Sponsor. The Sponsor will 
provide gra phs indicating the changing values of select markers. The graphs will be provided 
to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167219].  
Statistical Analysis:  
Safety analyses will be performed on the safety population, defined as all subjects in the 
Intent to Treat (ITT) population that receive d any dose of study medication. The number of 
AEs reported will be summarized. Subjects will be censored is still alive at data cut -off or if 
they withdraw consent. The incidence and perce ntage of subjects with at least one occurrence 
of a preferred term will be included, according to the most severe NCI -CTCAE Version 4. 03 
grade.  
Causality (relationship to study drug) will be summarized separately. Duration of AE will be 
determined and inc luded in the listings along with action taken and outcome.  
Laboratory results will be classified according to NCI -CTCAE Version 4. 03. Incidence of 
laboratory abnormalities will be summarized; laboratory results not corresponding to an NCI -
CTCAE Version 4. [ADDRESS_194439] 12 months and quarterly thereafter .

6. INTRODUCTION  
6.1. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS  
6.1.1.  AlloStim®  
The active ingredient in AlloStim® is viable polyclonal CD4+ memory Th1 -like T -cells 
with both cytolytic (granzyme B+, perforin+) and Th1 helper (IFN -+, IL -4-) properties. 
In its final formulation, AlloStim® is a combination biological drug (somatic cell therapy) 
and medical device (microbeads). Source cells are CD4+ T -cells positively selected from 
buffy coat material prepared from normal, screened, v olunteer blood donors.  These CD4+ 
T-cells are differentiated and expanded ex -vivo in a 9 -day culture process in a bioreactor 
to become Th1 -like memory cells (“T -StimTM”). The final formulation includes the T -
StimTM cells attached to non -biodegradable micro beads;  the formulated combination is 
called AlloStim®. The microbeads have covalently bound mouse anti -human CD3 and 
CD28 mAbs (Dynabeads® ClinExVivo™ CD3/CD28, Dynal/Invitrogen, Oslo, Norway) 
which activate the somatic cells and serve to maintain this act ivated state upon infusion 
or injection.  
 
AlloStim® is produced under GMP in clean rooms in Jerusalem , Israel . The source blood 
is tested to be free from contamination with HIV1, HIV2, HTLV1, HTLV2, HBV, HCV, 
RPR, mycoplasma  and CMV.  Each batch is teste d to assure it is USP sterile, low 
endotoxin and meets pre -defined functional and identity criteria.   
6.1.2.  Cryoa blation  
The cryoablation procedure is  conducted with U.S. FDA approved medical devices and 
disposable probes  as an out -patient procedure . Local and/or c onscious sedation is 
allowed. These treatments are used to kill tumor cells.  Cryoablation  is a minimally 
invasive treatment  that involve s placing a probe into a known tumor percuta neously 
under image guidance ( e.g. CT scan or Ultrasound ). The cryoablation procedure should 
be conducted by a licensed interventional radiologist approved by [CONTACT_1034].  Unlike 
normal ablation methods that seek to ablate all viable tumor and leave no tumor at the 
margins, the ablation procedure for this protocol should aim to a blate only a portion of 
the tumor and leave viable tumor margins. Effort should be made to ablate viable tumor 
and avoid necrotic areas of the tumor. Thus, the edge of the tumor, rather than the center 
is a preferred target. Intratumoral injection of study  drug is best accomplished by [CONTACT_167283] a guide device with a gauge larger than the cryoprobe. Generally, a 14g guide is 
suggested. In this manner, biopsy tools and the cryoprobe can be inserted through the 
guide  to reach the tumor . On site pathology  or radiological confirmation that the guide is 
inserted within viable tumor is preferred. The ablation should occur with at least two 
freeze -thaw cycles each of at least [ADDRESS_194449] delivered 
using a needle that has side ports to assure the drug is delivered within the ablated lesion  
and not injected through the lesion into the normal tissue . After the ablation, the guide

Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, [ADDRESS_194450] 2 hours following the procedure for any signs of bleeding or other 
adverse events. Subjects should be monitored continuously for pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], blood 
pressure and  oxygen saturation during the procedure. The type of probes used, the 
location of the tumor, the amount of tumor ablated, the cooling and warming cycle times, 
vital signs and procedure notes should be documented in source medical records.  
6.2. BACKGROUND  TO THE  DISEASE  
6.2.1.  Colorectal Cancer  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis 
is the main reason of death in CRC patients.  CRC includes cancerous growths in the 
colon, rectum and appendix. The liver and the lung are common metastatic sites of 
colorectal cancer. The most common colon cancer cell type is adenocarcinoma, which 
accounts for 95% of cases.  [1] 
 
For metastatic CRC (CRC) patients, the exposure to all active chemotherapeutic drugs, 
including 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, can increase survival.  These 
chemotherapy drugs are usually given in tw o lines of drug combinations: FOLFOX 
(leukovorin, 5 -FU and oxaliplatin ) and  FOLFIRI (leukovorin, 5 -FU and irinotecan). 
Leucovorin is a vitamin that improves the effectiveness of 5 -FU. However, chemotherapy 
options are absent after progression on 5 -FU, oxal iplatin, and irinotecan.  
 
Targeted biologic treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer are available to add to the 
chemotherapy regimens . These fall  into three groups: inhibitors of vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), including bevacizumab and afli bercept, monoclonal antibodies 
against epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) on the surface of tumor cells, i ncluding 
cetuximab and panitumum ab. However, these EGFR targets are not applicable to K RAS 
mutant disease.  The only approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167223] -refractory KRAS mutant 
disease are Regorafenib (a small molecule inhibitor of intracellular kinase involved in 
various signaling cascades) and TAS102 (oral chemotherapy, for both, non -mutated and 
mutated  KRAS ).   
 
This study targets subjects with m CRC. Untreated patients with mCRC  have a median 
survival of approximately 6 months  [2]. Chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFOX and 
FOLFIRI can extend survival for up to 20 months.  The use of anti -EGFR therapy in 
patients  that progress after two lines of chemotherapy drug mixtures is  an additional 6.4 
months  [3]. However this survival advantage occurs only in patients that express a wild 
type KRAS gene (KRAS wt). Patients with a mutated KRAS (KRAS mutant) gene do not  
respond adequately to anti -EGFR therapy (e.g., cetuximab, panitumumab).  
 
Standard t herapy fo r mCRC  is currently based on the use of four chemotherapy drugs (5 -
fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and capecitabine) and three biologic agents 
(cetuximab, bevacizumab, and panitumumab).   The common combinations of these 
drugs are shown below :

6.2.2.  First and Second Line Therapy  
Subjects in this study are recruited at third line metastatic disease after failure of two

least one line containing  bevicuzumab ).

 Combin ation regimens of infusional 5 -FU with either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 
irinotecan (FOLFIRI) form the basis of current first and second line standards of care  for 
mCRC.  The choice of first and second line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167225] y, as toxicity  is increased with the three -drug combination s.  The most common 
first and  second line combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920]: FOLFIRI, FOLFOX, CapeOx, 
FOLFOXIRI, and XELOX [22-25] [26].  
 
According to NCCN  Clinical Practice Guidelines, m CRC is treated with FOLFOX as 
first line therapy and FOLFIRI or CapOx as second  line therapy.  Patients diagnosed with 
mCRC are often treated for prolonged time periods  and experience multiple sequelae 
from chemotherapy toxicity which adversely impacts quality of life.  Neurologic and 
hematologic toxicities limit treatment with oxali platin, and irinotecan therapy is limited 
by [CONTACT_167285]  [27].   Thus failure of first and second lines of 
chemotherapy can be due to either disease progression or toxicity.  
 
6.2.3.  Biologic Agents  
In an attempt to improve first and second line chemotherapy regimens, three  biological 
agents have been recently FDA licensed for the treatment  of m CRC . These agent s target 
molecular pathways of m CRC  tumorigenesis: Bevacizumab, a human monoclonal 
antibody (MoAb) that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); cetuximab, a 
chimeric human :mouse MoAb aganst the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR); and 
panitumumab, a fully human MoAb that targ ets the extracellular domain of EGFR.  
6.2.4.  Bevacizumab  
As of 2004, bevacizumab has been FDA approv ed for first -line treatment of m CRC in 
combination with irinotecan - or oxaliplatin -based chemotherapy regimens  [28].  
Bevacizumab was initially approved after it was found to show a significant survival 
benefit when added to first -line IFL chemotherapy  [29]   [30].  Ye t in a phase III study of 
[ADDRESS_194451] -line FOLFOX4 or XELOX with or without 
bevacizumab, PFS was extended in the bevacizum ab group (9.4mo vs. 8.0mo, p=0.0023), 
but no significant difference was found in median OS (21.9mo vas 19.9mo, p=0.0769) or 
RR (47% vs. 49%, p=0.31)   [31].  What  more, the PFS benefit was limited to the XELOX 
group only (9.3mo vs. 7.4mo, p=0.003).  In terms of toxicity, more patients in the 
bevacizumab arm discontinued treatment because of adverse events, including 
thromboembolic events and bowel perforations (30%  vs. 21%).  Thus, it is unclear 
whether bevacizumab improves outcome with better chemotherapy regimens in the first -
line setting.  For patients in the refractory m CRC setting, bevacizumab plus FOLFOX has 
been found to significantly improve RR (22.6% vs. 8. 6%, p<0.001), PFS (7.3mo vs. 
4.7mo, p<0.0001), and OS (12.9mo vs 10.8mo, p=0.0011)  [32]. Maintenance 
bevacizumab after initial response to combination treatm ent is being investigated, yet this 
drug has litt le activity when used alone . Therefore, prior use of bevacizumab is optional 
in this protocol.  
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0        Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].  
 
Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, [ADDRESS_194452] that approximately 80% of colorectal tumors stain positively for EGFR has led  
to relatively rapid FDA approval for cetuximab and panitumumab.  As of 2004, 
cetuximab has been FDA approved for use as monotherapy or combination therapy for 
pretreated chemotherapy -resistant disease.   In a head to head comparison of cetuximab 
versus bev acizumab in first -line treatment of KRAS mutant mCRC , neither  strategy 
demons trated  a clearly superior outcome  [33]. However,  the association with longer 
overall survival suggests that FOLFIRI plus cetuximab could be the preferred first -line 
regimen for patients with KRAS wt mCRC [34].    In the r efractory -settin g FOLFIRI  plus 
cetuximab improves RR (23% vs. 11%, p=0.007) and TTP (4.1mo vs. 1.5mo, p<0.0001) 
over FOLFIRI alone  [35].   
 
Panitumumab was intially FDA app roved in [ADDRESS_194453] 
supportive care ( BSC ) vs. BSC alone    (Chamoto e t al. 2003 ). In this phase III trial, 231 
patients were randomized to panitumumab plus BSC, and 232 to BSC alone.  After a 
median follow -up of 35 weeks, OS was similar in both groups, but patients in the 
panitumumab arm had a significan tly greater PFS (8 w eeks, 95%CI, 7.9 -8.4wks) than the 
BSC alone arm (7.3 wks, 95% CI, 7.1 -7.7wks)  p<0.001  (Chamoto et al. 2003 ).  A 
retrospective analysis of the panitumumab phase III approval trial showed a significantly 
greater effect on PFS for patients with wild -type KRA S than with mutant KRAS (12.3 vs. 
7.4 wks; p<0.0001)  [36].  Investigators concluded that KRAS status should be 
determined when considering panitumumab monotherap y [37]. (see discussion of KRAS 
status and treatment response below) . 
 
6.2.6.  KRAS  Mutation Status  
The oncogene KRAS is the most commonly mutated gene in various h uman cancers. 
Being constitutively activated, it can by[CONTACT_167286] -driven signaling cascade and 
impair the clinical efficacy of EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab, nimotuzumab, 
panutinumab and aflibercep. KRAS  is currently considere d a clinically useful b iomarker , 
and it is common practice in the oncology community to test KRAS  mutational status 
prior to initiating therapy with either cetuximab or panitumumab.  Roughly 40% of  
patients with mCRC have somatic activating KRAS  mutations  [38].  The mutant status of 
KRAS , a gene encoding the KRAS  proto -oncogene downstream effector of EGFR, has 
been associated with poor prognosis and nonresponse to EGFR antagonists  [38, 39]. 
Therefore, these agents are indicated for KRAS wt disease only.  
 
On October 2, 2007, the FDA expanded labeling and granted regular approval for single -
agent cetuximab for the treatment of patients with EGFR -expressing mCRC  after failure 
of both irinotecan - and oxaliplatin -based chemotherapy regimens.   On July 17, 2009, the 
FDA ordered changes to t he product labels of cetuximab (Erbitux , ImClone Systems ) and 
panitumumab (Vec tibix [COMPANY_010] ) due to r etrospective subset analyses of trials in patients 
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0        Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].  
 
Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, [ADDRESS_194454] been implemented in the  ‘indications and usage’, ‘clinical 
pharmacology’ and ‘clinical studies’ sections of both cetuximab and panitumumab 
product labels.  See FDA website:   
http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm172905.htm  
However, while approved for KRAS wt mCRC, not all patients with a KRAS wt 
genotype respond to EGFR -targeted agents. Recently, activating mutations of BRAF, 
which encode for a protein acting downstream of KRAS, were also shown to be 
responsible for resistance to EGFR  inhibitors in chemorefractory m CRC. A recent 
publication confirms, as for KRAS, a high concordance of BRAF mutations in primary 
CRC and related me tastatic sites  [40]. Because the KRAS pathway is central to many 
nodes of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, the same hurdles are to be expected in 
inhibition of other RTKs.  
 
Accordingly, development of new therapeutic strategies for KRAS mutant as well as 
BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed.   
 
This study targets the population of mCRC  patients that have progressed after two line s 
of chemothe rapy and are not eligible for targeted t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_167226]  a new 
category of drug (immunotherapy) to a population of patients with unmet medical needs 
in an indication requiring more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
6.2.7.  Regorafenib  
Regorafenib  (Stivarga) is an o ral multi -kinase inhibitor developed by  [CONTACT_167287], stromal and oncogenic  receptor tyrosine kinase  (RTK). Regorafenib shows 
anti-angiogenic activity due to its dual targeted  VEGFR2 -TIE2  tyrosine kinase inhibition.  
Regorafenib demonstrated to increase  the overall survival of patients with mCRC  and 
was approved by [CONTACT_167288] 27, [ADDRESS_194455] pi[INVESTIGATOR_167227] 760 patients; 505 to Regorafenib and  255 to placebo.  Regorafenib had  a 
median benefit of 1.4 months compared to placebo (6.4 months vs 5.0 months, HR=0.77, 
p=0.0052). The su bset analysis in the CORRECT trial, in dicated that median OS in the 
KRAS mutant subset was 6.2 months compared to control of 5.1 months (1.1 month 
difference, HR=0.87 95%CI), whereas the KRAS wt subset had median OS of 7.3 
months compared to 5.0 months for  placebo control (2.3 months difference, HR=0.65, 
95%CI) .  There were no complete responses and only 1% of patients had a partial 
response.  
 
Based on the results of studies evaluating Regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer, the 
National Comprehensive  Cancer Network (NCCN) has updated their guidelines 
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0        Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].  
 
Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, [ADDRESS_194456] progression on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167228] 5 -
fluorouracil/ leucovorin, irinotec an, oxaliplatin  (e.g., FOLFOX and FOLFIRI) , 
bevacizumab, and cetuximab or panitumumab (if KRAS wt.). Patients with KRAS 
mutant disease are recommended for consideration of regorafenib therapy in the third -
line setting  after progression on FOLFOX/FOLFIRI (or other oxaliplatin and irinotecan 
combinations) with bevacizumab.   
 
However, due to the marginal survival benefit and high toxicity of Regorafenib , the 
NCCN guidelines also state that physician s can consider to enroll KRAS mutant patients 
who progress o n FOLFOX and FOLFIRI with bevacizumab and maintain adequate 
performance status and end -organ function into clinical trials, including phase I trials 
[41].  The EMA European Public Assessment Report (EPAR) for Regorafenib states  that 
the drug is indicated in adult patients with met astatic colorectal cancer who have been 
previously treated with or are not considered candidates for other available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
including patients with KRAS mutant tumors, though physicians are recommended to 
carefully evaluate benefits and risks when pres cribing Regorafenib in patients with 
KRAS mutant tumo rs.   
 
Although Regorafenib is a recommended therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer after 
failure of standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is important to note that it comes at a starting cost of 
$9,[ADDRESS_194457] likely to derive significant clinical benefit from 
Regorafenib  therapy become a high priority  [42].   
 
This protocol does not require prior Regorafenib for  eligibility. This is based on the 
subset anal ysis of the CORRECT trial demonstrating little OS benefit for the KRAS 
mutant subset of patients and is consistent with NCCN guidelines recommending 
consideration of clinical trial options for third -line KRAS mutant mCRC. Subjects in this 
protocol that are  progressing or not responding to experimental therapy can add 
Regorafenib after  the Safety Evaluation Period as salvage therapy.  
 
6.2.1.  TAS -102 
TAS-102 (Lonsurf®) is an oral drug that combines two agents, trifluridine  (FTD), a 
nucleoside metabolic inhibitor, a nd tipi[INVESTIGATOR_14965] (TPI), a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, 
developed by [CONTACT_19125], Inc.   
 
The FDA approved the use of the drug on September 22, 2015 for patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer following an international, multicenter, phase 
III RECOURSE  trial.  The study enrolled 800 patients with mCRC from Japan, the

fluoropyrimidines. To be eligible for the study, the patients had to undergo tumor testing

Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, [ADDRESS_194459] received chemotherapy with each of the following agents: a 
fluoropyrimidine,  oxaliplatin , irinotecan , bevacizumab , and —for patients with non -
mutant KRAS  tumors —cetuximab  or panitumumab . The primary endpoi nt was  overall 
survival . Secondary end points included  progression -free survival , response rate (the 
proportion of patients whose best response was a complete or partial response), and 
safety.  
 
TAS -102 showed improved survival (median overall survival was 7.1 months in the 
TAS -102 group and 5.3 months in the placebo group), including those with both non -
mutated and mutated  KRAS genes . The overall survival for KRAS -mutant patients was 
6.5 months if they received TAS -102, compared to 4.9 months if they did not. The 1 -year 
overall survival rates were 27 percent and 18 percent, respectively. Additional analyses 
showed that the survival benefit of TAS -102 was seen in esse ntially all pre -specified 
subgroups, including KRAS  status.  
 
The median progression -free survival was 2.0 months in the TAS -102 group and 1.7 
months in the placebo group. 221 patients (44 percent) in the TAS -102 group and 42 
patients (16 percent) in the pl acebo group had achieved disease control ( complete 
response , partial response , or stable disease ) measured at least 6 weeks after the patients 
were r andomly assigned to treatment groups. In addition, the time to worsening of 
performance status was significantly longer in the TAS -102 group than in the placebo 
group (5.7 versus 4.0 months). Patients in the TAS -102 group experienced few serious 
adverse ev ents. Overall, adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred more frequently in 
the TAS -102 group than in the placebo group (69 percent versus 52 percent). The most 
common adverse events associated with TAS -102 included  neutropenia , which occurred 
in 38 percent of those treated, and  leukopenia , which occurred in 21 percent. Four percent 
of the patients in the TAS -102 group developed  febrile neutropenia , and there was one 
death related to TAS -102 [43]. 
 
Based upon review of data submitted, the NCCN decided (in a Web Conference on July 
24, 2015) to add to the NCCN -Guidelines V.1.2016 the regimen of trifluridine + tipi[INVESTIGATOR_167229] a subsequent therapy option for patients wit h disease progression after oxaliplatin ‐ and 
irinotecan ‐based chemotherapy.  
 
This protocol does not require prior TAS -[ADDRESS_194460] th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_167230] -type KRAS tumors. Patients were treated with TAS -102 (534 
patients) or placebo (266 patients) and directly compared. The researchers found that 
TAS -102 prolonged overall survival experiencing a median overall survival of 7.1 
months for TAS -102 and 5.3 months for placebo, a 1.8 month increase.

6.3. CANCER VACCINES AND RATIONALE  FOR CRYOVAXTM 
The current d rugs used to treat colorectal  cancer provide important treatment options for 
patients, their limitations including drug resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects 
has focused efforts on developi[INVESTIGATOR_167231].   
The rationale for development of cancer vaccines is based on experimental work in 
animal models, in which it has been demonstrated that specific CD8+ cytotoxic T -cells 
(CTL) are able to eliminate tumors and develop memory wh ich protects against 
recurrence. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_167232], 
pooled results of published vaccine trials reveal a very weak clinical response rate of 
<1% for active specific immunization procedures  with an ob jective response rate of 
2.6% , mainly among melanoma patients [44] even  though about 50% of these vaccinated 
patients were shown to have developed specific CD8 + cytotoxic T -cells ( CTL ) able to 
specifically recognize and kill tumor cells in -vitro.  
 
The poor clinical results of immunotherapy vaccine approaches to cancer treatment have 
been attributed to tumor immunoavoidance mechanisms [45]. Tumors employ many 
escape strategies in order to evade immune attack. These strategies include 
downregulation of MHC  molecules in order to hide from immune recognition  [46], 
expression of inhibitory factors and immunosuppressive cytokines  [47] [48] [49], 
including TGF -β [50, 51], IL-10 [52], and recruitment of regulatory immune cells 
CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs [53, 54], Tr1 cells  [55], tolerogenic DCs, and myeloid 
suppressor cells, including immature macrophages, granulocytes, DCs and other myeloid 
cells at earlier stages of differentiation  [56-58] [59] 
 
These immunoavoidance mechanisms employed by [CONTACT_167289] s urveillance.  Establishment of 
this type of self -tolerance is a part of a natural immune regulatory mechanism which 
prevents autoimmune disease against organ -specific self -antigens.  However, this 
normally beneficial effect may be responsible for tumor immun e evasion , as many of the 
tolerance mechanisms that prevent autoimmunity are the same as employed by [CONTACT_167290]  [60, 61].  
 
Therefore, the mechanisms of autoimmune disease serve as a model for developi[INVESTIGATOR_167233]. A key mechanism for breaking self -
tolerance and induction of autoimmunity is related to inflammation.  Autoimmune attack 
of self -tissues requires two conditions:  activated T-cells and the "conditioning" of the 
target organ by [CONTACT_167291] [62]. These  two conditions are created in the 
CryoVaxTM protocol by [CONTACT_167292] a tumor lesion and then intratumoral injection 
of allogeneic activated immune cells. The combination creates an  inflammatory 
microenvironment around the de ad tumor cells .  
 
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0        Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].  
 
Protocol Date : December 23, 2014    Amendment Date: September 12, [ADDRESS_194461] the ability of the tumor to evade im mune destruction.  The 
experimental drug, AlloStim®, is designed to break tolerance to tumor tissues by [CONTACT_167293]-tissue  in autoimmune 
disease.  AlloStim® provides  a highly inflammatory environment . Inflammation in the 
presence of tumor tissue that has died pathologically  is a formula that has potential to 
break tolerance . 
 
Type 1 cytokines including IL -1, TNF IFN-γ, IL -12, IL -18, and GM -CSF are generally 
believed to be required component s of therapeutic cancer vaccine s. AlloStim® cells are 
differentiated in culture to produce large amounts of these Type 1 cytokines.  Because 
AlloStim® cells are allogeneic and  recognized as foreign by [CONTACT_167294], 
they will be rejected  by [CONTACT_40689] . Since these foreign cells produce large amounts of Type 
1 cytokines, they are expected to steer the immune response to the foreign antigens to  
Th1. In this manner, the rej ection process is expected to increase the number of Th1 
memory immune cells in the circulation of patients injected with AlloStim®. This is 
significant because cancer patients are known to have an excess of Th2 immune cells and 
absence of Th1 cells. This imbalance is thought to be a mechanism of tumor immune 
evasion.  
 
The design of this in-situ anti-tumor vaccine is based upon an important paradigm shift in 
the field of immunology regarding the regulation of immunity.  A new concept has 
emerged that propose s that the regulation of immunity and tolerance is not only 
determined by [CONTACT_167295] T -cells as previously thought, but also by [CONTACT_167296]  [63] [64].  
 
The antigens are presented to the immune system by a network of specialized cells that 
are known as professional antigen -presenting cells (APCs) or dendritic cells (DCs). DCs 
are responsible for inducing immunity to pathogens or tumors by [CONTACT_167297] T-cells, resulting in the differentiation of the T-cells into effector and memory T-
cells specific for the antigens. Effector T -cells, mainly CD8+ cytolytic T -cells (CTL), are 
capable of destroying cells which express the antigens.  Memory T -cells provide immune 
protection against recurrence or reinfection.  Differentiation of the DCs into potent APCs 
is triggered by [CONTACT_167298] a result of the tissue distu rbance and 
a local inflammatory response .  
 
The implications are that if a pathogenic infection occurs in the absence of appropriate 
inflammatory reactions, pathogen -specific T-cells will not be activated despi[INVESTIGATOR_167234] -specific foreign a ntigens, and, conversely, autoreactive T-cells, 
including those that are directed against tumor cells, can be readily activated provided the 
self (tumor) antigens are presented by [CONTACT_167299].  Since 
tumors produce anti -inflammatory cytokines, they are capable of influencing the immune 
response by [CONTACT_167300].  
 
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0        Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].

which is potent enough to also downregulate  tumor -mediated immunosuppressive 
cytokine production.  The magnitude and duration of the immune response will be 
dependent on the extent and quality of the local inflammatory response and wi ll be 
contained by a variety of tolerogenic mechanisms.   
 
In summary, previous attempts at developi[INVESTIGATOR_167235] -tumor antigens.  
Recent insights on how immunity  and tolerance are regulated indicate that the failure of 
these vaccines in the clinic may be related to the absence of sufficient danger signals at 
the time tumor antigens are processed by [CONTACT_167301]. AlloStim® is designed to provide the 
necessary danger signals  to elicit anti -tumor immunity  in this CryoVaxTM protocol . 
6.4. ALLOSTIM® RATIONALE IN METASTATIC COLORECTAL  CANCER  
Anti-cancer vaccines are believed to hold great promise as an anti -cancer treatment 
method.  While the promise of this approach has been demonstra ted in animal models, it 
has been difficult to translate these results to the clinic.  Several leading cancer vaccine 
candidates that achieved promising results in Phase I and/or II studies later failed to 
obtain statistical significance for critical end po ints in randomized Phase II or III studies. 
Such disappointing outcomes have led to a critical evaluation of anti -cancer vaccine 
concepts.  The failures of previous vaccines are thought to be due to differe nces in the 
mouse immune system  compared to human immune system and t he enhanced ability of 
human tumors to evade immune recognition and attack.  These problems are addressed in 
the current vaccine design concept  using the experimental AlloStim® drug. 
 
AlloStim® is based upon a novel approach [65]. Rather than being developed in animals  
as were previous vaccine concepts , AlloStim® was instead designed to elicit an immune 
mechanism already proven to be clinically effective in humans.  This mechanism is 
known as the graft vs. tumor (GVT) effect that occurs  after allogeneic stem cell/bone 
marrow transplant procedures.  
 
It is well accepted that solid tumors, including m CRC , can be effectively treated with the 
GVT effect that occurs after myeloablative allogeneic transplantation techniques  [66] 
[67] [68]. Improved  reduced -intensity allogeneic transplantation has also been shown to 
elicit an effective GVT effect in patients with breast cancer  [69].  
 
The GVT effect has been described as the most powerful and most effective anti -tumor 
mechanism ever described in humans  [70].  Unfortunately, these  beneficial GVT effects 
are accompanied by [CONTACT_167302] -versus -host-disease (GVHD) toxicity.  GVHD is associated 
with significant morbidity and is the leading cause for mortality after allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . This toxicity significantly  limits the clinical 
application of the GVT mechan ism [71].

 By [CONTACT_167303] -mediated mechanisms of the inter -related GVT and 
GVHD effects, it was  hypothesized that instead of separating the GVT/GVHD effects,  it 
might be possible to maintain the interrelationship of these immune mechanisms by 
[CONTACT_167304]. In the transplant setting , the immune effects flow 
from the graft to t he host (GVT and GVHD).  AlloStim® reverses  these interrelated effects 
so that the effects  flow from the host to the graft.  Successful reversal of the direction of 
the effects is hypothesized to result  in a beneficial host vs. tumor (HVT) effect coupled to 
a non -toxic host vs. graft (HVG) rejection effect   [64]. Pre-clinical studies validated this 
approach  LaCasse, 2011 [65, 72-75]. 
 
Accordingly, this protocol also  focuses on the replication of the proven GVT mechanism 
against metastatic colorectal  cancer while eliminating the toxic effects of GVHD. The 
approach also eliminates the need for a tissue -matche d donor.  In addition, AlloStim® has 
demonstrated the unique ability to dysregulate the suppressor circuits which tumors use 
to evade immune attack [73].   
6.5. PRE-CLINICAL STUDIES  
In vitro activity studies demonstrated that  AlloStim® is capable of eliciting anti -tumor 
effects in immunocompetent, non -conditioned tumor -bearing hosts, providing extended 
survival and curative immunity  in both low and high tumor bur den settings.  For more

Protocol Date: December 23, 2014   Amendment    Date: September  12, [ADDRESS_194464] the potential to benefit from a new approach to cancer vaccination 
that is designed to provide the same tumor debulking effects of non -myeloablative allogeneic 
bone marrow  transplantation (aBMT) without the  graft -versus -host-disease  (GVHD ) toxicity 
or need for a matched donor.  Patients with mCRC chemotherapy -refractory disease have only 
the option of Regorafenib. However, this drug has little, if any, efficacy in KRAS and BRAF 
mutant disease.  
 
The goal of this research is to  develop new tr eatment options for mCRC  KRAS mutant and 
BRAF mutant patients . This approach  has the potential to benefit patients that would 
otherwise either not be treated or would be treated with minimally effective and highly toxic 
Regorafenib that  provides a median o f only 1.1 months of survival advantage. AlloStim®, 
combined with a percutaneous ablation technique of a selected metastatic lesion, creates an 
in-situ anti -tumor vaccine customized to the patient's own tumor.  The ablation causes the 
release of the interna l contents of the tumor cells and exposes tumor -specific antigens to the 
immune system. AlloStim® is then injected into the ablated lesion as an adjuvant to create the 
necessary inflammatory environment ( “danger signals ”) to steer the immune response to 
tumor-specific Th1 immunity.  Accordingly, this study will provide patients suffering from a 
disease with an unmet medical need with access to a new class of treatment (immunotherapy) 
with a mechanism of action that has potential  to debulk tumor and extend su rvival .   
6.8. RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY  
This study is evaluating a personalize d in-situ anti-cancer vaccine  combining AlloStim® and 
tumor ablation  or AlloStim® alone . The p rotocol is designed to elicit a Th1  anti-tumor 
immun e response in patients with mCRC KRAS mutant and BRAF mutant disease. Such 
immune response may be capable  of debulking  metastatic disease.  Immune cell infiltration  at 
the margins of primary colorectal disease has been correlated with longer survival  in mCRC  
[76]. Specifically, increased infiltration of CD8+ CTL also correlated with survival [77]. In 
additio n, colorectal cancer patients present with skewed Th1/Th2 ratios [78]and high Th1 
expression has correlated with survival [79].  
6.8.1.  Rationale for the Doses and the Dosing Regimen  
In the Part 1 of the trial, the d ifferent  dosing schedules will be evaluated. Assessment of 
different schedules should allow for  better as sessments of treatment safety,  tolerability, and 
efficacy.  
 
There are 4 phases of dosing in this study:  
 
1. Priming phase :  
Since most metastatic patients will present with polarized Th2 immunity (or depleted 
Th1 immunity)  [78, 80, 81], the objective of the "priming" phase of the protocol is to 
increase th e amount of circulating Th1 cells in these patients. To accomplish this 
objective, patients will be injected with intradermal AlloStim® cells. The allogeneic 
CD4+ T -cells in AlloStim® are expected to be rejected by [CONTACT_167305]1 type 
cytokines pr oduced by [CONTACT_167306]® are expected to steer the rejection response to Th1 
immunity, thus creating an increased pool of Th1 memory cells in the circulation

Protocol Date: December 23, 2014   Amendment    Date: September  12, 201 7                Page 40 of 94 
 specific for the alloantigens contained within AlloStim®. In other words, the patients 
are expected to become immune to the investigational product with a Th1 bias.  
 
2. Vaccination phase :  
 
The objective of the "vaccination" phase of the protocol  for cohorts with cryoablation  
is to create anti -tumor specific immunity through an in -situ vaccination method. 
Tumo r vaccines generally contain a source of tumor antigen combined with an 
adjuvant which promotes immune recognition and primes for development of a 
specific immune response against the tumor antigen. In this protocol, a source of 
tumor antigen is created in -situ by [CONTACT_167307] a selected tumor lesion using the 
minimally -invasive technique of image guided cryoablation.  
 
The ablation technique is designed to cause pathological death of tumor cells, 
releasing internal contents to the microenvironment. It is thoug ht that necrotic cell 
death stimulates active cellular immunity, whereas apoptotic death stimulates immune 
tolerance.  
 
The ablation procedure results in release of large amounts of tumor debris into the 
tumor microenvironment that serves as a source of pat ient-specific tumor antigens. 
The ablation procedure causes a pathological type of tumor killing (necrosis) that 
alerts the immune system and mobilizes the cells that will respond to clean up and 
repair the debris, including immature dendritic cells (DC) w hich are responsible for 
directing an immune response to the engulfed antigens to either Th1 or Th2.  
 
In order to provide an adjuvant to drive correct DC maturation, AlloStim® will be 
injected into the necrotic center of the ablated tumor lesion within ap proximately ten 
minutes to one hour following the ablation procedure. AlloStim® cells produce large 
amounts of inflammatory cytokines and express surface molecules (e.g. CD40L) 
which are known to cause the maturation of dendritic cells and promote developm ent 
of Th1 anti -tumor immunity. Further, since the patients will be immune to the 
alloantigens in AlloStim®, intratumoral injection  (IT) is expected to elicit a potent 
memory response of Th1 cells to reject these allogeneic cells. All these factors are 
expected to serve as an adjuvant by [CONTACT_167308] -
tumor specific Th1 immunity.  
 
In the cohort without cryoablation , the IV AlloStim® infusion and subsequent 
rejection is expected to cause release of inflammatory cytokines that will activate NK 
cells and memory T -cells and cause them to traffic to metastatic tumor lesions, 
creating an in -situ vaccination step  intended to create anti -tumor specific immunity. 
Tumor vaccines generally contain a source of tumor antigen combined with an 
adjuvant which promotes immune recognition and primes for development of a 
specific immune response against the tumor antigen. In these schedules , a source of 
tumor antigen is created in -vivo by [CONTACT_167306]® leading to the release of internal 
antigens. T hese factors are expected to serve as an adjuvant by [CONTACT_167309] -tumor specific Th1 immunity.  
 
3. Activation phase :  
Intravenous infusion s of AlloStim® are designed to create a "cytokine storm" of 
inflammatory cytokines capable  of suppressing the ability of tumors to evade immune 
responsiveness . In addition, intravenous AlloStim® has been shown to activate host T -
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0                Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].  
Protocol Date: December 23, 2014   Amendment    Date: September  12, [ADDRESS_194465] widely disseminated tumors.  However, the inflammation is non -specific such 
that any inflammatory lesion such as arthritic lesions, inflammatory bowel or sites of 
previous injury can also become inflamed or the existing inflammation becomes  
exacerbated.  
 
Since tumors are known to be capable of evading Th1 immune responses, the 
"activation" phase of the protocol is designed to both activate the previously created 
immunity and to try to disable these tumor immunoavoidance mechanisms. It is 
known that a highly inflammatory environment can have the effect of suppressing 
tumor immune avoidance and breaking tolerance to the tumor antigens in much the 
same manner as inflammation can break tolerance to self-tissue  antigens and promote 
autoimmunity. In order to create this inflammatory environment, AlloStim® is infused 
intravenously.  The infusion of the foreign cells in AlloStim® is expected to cause a 
highly inflammatory environment as the primed immune system of t he patient 
activates to reject these cells. In addition, the rejection of AlloStim® is expected to 
have the secondary effect of activating components of the host innate immune system 
(such as NK cells and macrophages) and activation of both allo -specific a nd tumor -
specific Th1 cells which should initiate the cascade of immunological events 
necessary for systemic tumor elimination and suppressing the ability of the tumor to 
avoid this immune attack.  
 
4. Booster  phase :  
Intravenous infusion s of AlloStim® are designed to maintain the highly inflammatory 
environment believed to be necessary in order to maintain an active cellular immune 
response against the tumor and to suppress the tumor's ability to evade immune 
attack.   
 
The final "booster" phase of the protocol  is designed to maintain the chronic 
inflammatory environment to suppress tumor immunoavoidance and to maintain the 
activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. To meet this objective two -three  
intravenous  infusions of AlloStim®

Toxicity Monitoring  
Two types of toxicity are assessed for determination of whether a Dose Limiting Toxicity  
(DLT) has occurred. An acute dose limiting toxicity (ADLT) is assessed within 48h of a dose 
administration  during the priming, vaccination and activation steps of each protocol . 
Cumulative dose limiting toxicity (CDLT) is assessed during the complete Safety Evaluation 
Period including any ADLT that occurs in the booster dosing .  
An ADLT is defined as  the occurrence of any of the following within 48h of dosing : 
• Any ≥ Grade 3 local injection site reaction;  
• Any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_194468] disease;  
• Any ≥ Grade 3 infusion related symptoms of duration > 2 days;  
• Any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_194469]  will be followed until the toxicity is

Protocol Date: December 23, 2014   Amendment    Date: September  12, [ADDRESS_194470] will occur after an ADLT 
event.  
A CDLT event is defined as the occurrence of any of the following within the Safety 
Evaluation  Period : 
• Any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_194471] disease  
• Any toxicity ≥ Grade 3 that is probably or definitely related to the study drug;  
• Any toxicity not present at baseline that occurs at ≥ Grade 4  
• Any autoimmune toxicity ≥ Grade 3 not present at baseline  
All adverse events  (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), regardless of attribution to the 
study drug, will be coded, graded and become part of the final safety report for each cohort.  
The DSMB will review the safety data on each cohort and recommend whether to advance 
enrollment to the next cohort.  
The development of any Grade [ADDRESS_194472] at any time will prompt a 
review of safety data by [CONTACT_1034], PI [INVESTIGATOR_167215]. It is recognized that Grade 4 event s and death can occur in this population due to 
disease progression. Therefore, dosing will continue for currently enrolled subjects at the 
occurrence of a grade 4 event according to protocol unless the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167236] . If attribution is assigned to the study drug 
dosing will be suspended pending review by  [CONTACT_32622].  
In accordance with the 3+[ADDRESS_194473] s will be accrued into the same cohort. If no ADLT occurs within the 
additional three subjects, accrual into the next cohort can begin. If an ADLT is observed in 
any of the additional three subjects, no further dose escalation is permitted.  
The developmen t of any DLT toxicity in ≥ 33% of the accumulated number of subjects in any 
and all dosing schedules during the Safety Evaluati on Period  will result in protocol 
discontinuation.  
At the completion of the Safety Evaluation Period for all cohorts , the safety  evaluation of Part 
[ADDRESS_194474] until death or loss to follow -up. 
 
Part 2  
The safety and efficacy data from Part 1 will be evaluated and the f avored schedule advanced 
to Part 2 . In Part 2 of the trial, up to 25 additional subjects may be accrued . 
 
9. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
9.1. PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
Safety will be the primary endpoint of this study and will be evaluated on the basis of the 
following parameters:

 • Physical examination  and vital s igns (temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood oxygen saturation) . 
• Clinical laboratory profile (complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic 
panel ( CMP),  C-reactive protein (CRP), coagulation factors  and autoimmune 
parameters . 
• Adverse events according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  version 4.03  (refer to  section 15 for AE /SAE 
management  and reporting ): 
9.2. EXPLORATORY ENDPOINT  
• Correlation of tumor burden by [CONTACT_393], pathological response and  immune response  
to Overall Survival  (OS) . 
- Overall Survival (OS) is evaluated from time of enrollment  until death from any 
cause . Subjects are followed for survival during the trial , as long as they are aliv e, 
for [ADDRESS_194475] relied upon Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) to serve as a surrogate to predict clinical 
benefit. RECIST criteria  for clinical outcomes rely upon the assumption that agent 
activity results in shrinkage of tumor and that enlargement of disease is a result of 
tumor growth. RECIST is a composite evaluation of response based upon 
measurements of the changes in tumor size  [82]. RECIST criteria have been 
criticized for not being a reliable method to predict OS benefit for cytotoxic 
agents [83].  
In order to determine the utility of RECIST in evaluating response of patients to 
immunotherapy, RECIST 1.1 [82] guidelines will be used to determine objective 
tumor response. This endpoint will be determined and analyzed for correlation 
with OS. Malignant tumor masses (target lesions) will be selected on the basis of 
their size and their suit ability for accurate repetitive measurements. All patients 
must have at least one target lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) greater than or equal to 1.[ADDRESS_194476] diameters during treatment.  
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0                Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].  
Protocol Date: December 23, 2014   Amendment    Date: September  12, 201 7                Page 45 of 94 
 All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these 
lesions should be followed as "present" or " absent". All baseline evaluations 
should be performed as closely as possible to the treatment start and never more 
than [ADDRESS_194477] treated with 
immunotherapy.  
For this reason, this study proposes : 
1. Longitudinal serial biopsies for comparison and correlation with RECIST data 
in order assess whether RECIST can be used to predict survival when using 
this immunotherapy.  
2. Evaluation of subjects according to newly proposed immune -related response 
criteria (irRC) [85].  The irRC is thought to better address patients' treatment, 
inves tigators' patient management and sponsors' analysis needs for targeted 
immunotherapy developments in oncology.  
- Subjects  treated on this study will undergo evaluation of immune response to 
treatment. The results will be used to correlate response to vaccina tion with 
subsequent clinical outcome  and OS .

11. STUDY PLAN AND PROCE DURES  
11.1. OVERALL STUDY PLAN 
Subjects will be screened for eligibility for the study. The screening process involves 
examining medical records to determine eligibility based on the IC/EC criteria.  After 
obtaining informe d consent, subjects will undergo physical exam, provide blood for lab 
analysis (CBC, CMP, total IgG and IgM, lipase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and CRP), an 
ultrasound of the liver, and a CT scan . The results of these baseline tests will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_079] ( PI) and the Sponsor's medical monitoring team to determine if the 
subject still meets IC/EC.  In schedule A -1, the study interventional radiologist will determine

Protocol Date: December 23, 2014   Amendment    Date: September  12, [ADDRESS_194484] meets IC/EC criteria, a  
biopsy and tumor harvest procedure will be conducted . 
When the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167237]/EC criteria are met, the subject is accrued / 
enrolled in the study and assigned a protocol number . The enrollment date will be 
documented in CRF/eCRF.  Upon accrual , the study site develops a n appointment schedule 
for the subject and sends to the Sponsor for approval.  Upon approval, the subject is notified 
of the schedule.  The Sponsor will produce and ship AlloStim® in accordanc e with the 
approved schedule.  
AlloStim® will be formulated in  Israel by [CONTACT_1034] , packaged in validated temperature -
controlled container  and delivered  by [CONTACT_167313] . AlloStim® is stable in formulation for  at 
least [ADDRESS_194485] scans will be conducted at a radiology center . 
Cryoablation , intratumoral AlloStim® and voluntary  tumor biopsies will be conducted  at a 
radiology center .  
11.2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
11.2.1.  Physical Examination  
A Comprehensive Physical E xamination  will be conducted at baseline. The exam will include 
the following organ systems: Constitutional; Eyes; Ears, Nose, Mouth and Throat; Neck;  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; Cardiovascular; Gastrointestinal (a bdomen); Lymphatic; Musculoskeletal; Skin; 
Neurologic; and Psychiatric. Subjects should be carefully screened at baseline for depression 
and suicide attempts or ideations. If there are indications or a history of depression is strongly 
recommended that the se patients be closely followed together with behavioral health or 
psychiatric medical support. Subjects with an established diagnosis of depression or reported 
previous suicide attempts or suicidal ideations should not be enrolled on this protocol; the 
risks and benefits of being treated with the study drug should be weighed very carefully in 
consultation with behavioral health or psychiatry.  
 
A Basic Physical E xamination  will be performed at each subject  visit, the presence of 
lymphadenopathy, edema, rash  or pain will be recorded.  The subject’s psychological status will 
be evaluated as part of the physical examination in each study visit. Information on exam will be 
documented in the medical record and  on CRF /eCRF .  
 
Subjects will be evaluated for response  by [CONTACT_167314], radiological, pathological 
and immunological tests, as well as by [CONTACT_167315]. Subjects that have clinically deteriorated and do not show 
evidence of respo nse, in the judgment of the PI, will be discontinued on further experimental 
treatment and advised of alternative treatment options.  
11.2.2.  Monitoring Vital Signs  
After each ID injection  of study drug , the vital signs will be monitored with real -time monitoring 
equipment for heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], blood pressure, temperature, and pulse 
oximetry.  Values will be recorded every [ADDRESS_194486] should 
continue to be observed until stable.

A biopsy is useful  because su bjects on immunotherapy can present with "flared" lesions that 
appear to be larger on CT scan, but may not necessarily represent disease progression.  
Increase in size can be due to immune cell infiltration, edema, coagulative necrosis and/or 
fibrotic chang es rather than tumor growth. In addition, subjects may present with new lesions 
which may not necessarily represent progressive disease, but may instead represent immune 
reactivity to microscopic disease previously not visible. The initial appearance of pr ogressive 
disease may occur during immunologic therapy for at least two reasons. First, 
immunotherapy may induce lymphocytic tumor infiltration and inflammation of the tumor, 
and the associated increase in tumor diameter is then scored as progression on ra diographic 
imaging (i.e. ‘tumor flare’). Second, the appearance of new lesions or growth of primary 
lesions may occur after immunotherapy has been administered, since the process of immune 
activation is complex and delayed. During this period of activation , the tumor may be able to 
transiently grow even when effective therapy is priming the immune system  to eventually 
respond .  
 
Immunotherapy may induce responses with a variety of kinetic patterns. Some tumors may 
respond rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], meeting criteria for a REC IST response. Other tumors may respond late in 
the course of treatment, wherein standard [ADDRESS_194491] criteria, such patients would be classified as having 
disease progression and generally would be removed from a trial before late response might 
be documented  [84]. Because of the uniqu e patterns of clinical response that arise with 
immune -modulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], alternative clinical trial design and end points are necessary to 
properly evaluate these agents.  
 
For these reasons, irRC and longitudinal tumor biops ies are used in this study in order to 
distinguish whether changes in the radiographic appearance of tumors correlates with 
progression or tumor flare, while overall survival is used as the primary endpoint due to the 
unreliability of RECIST as a method to evaluate response to immuno therapy. The 
experimental endpoint of seroconversion to IL -12 positivity was found in an earlier Phase I/II 
clinical trial to correlate with survival.  Therefore, radiological, pathological and 
immunological endpoints will be used for assessment of tumor re sponse.  
11.2.5.    Immunological Research Assays  
11.2.6.  Cytokines  
Subject  sera will be collected for cytokines (such as  IL-12p70, IFN -γ and TNF -α) detection 
and analyses . AlloStim® is designed to activate a Th1 immune response. Measuring IL -12, 
TNF -α and IFN -γ in a subject ’s sera can provide evidence to support activation and 
sustainability of a Th1 immune response activate d by [CONTACT_167306]®. In addition, chronic 
inflammatory adverse events could be attributed to AlloStim® by [CONTACT_167316], 
especially TNF -α.

PBMC will be washed by [CONTACT_7891] 8 minutes at 402 rcf, and re -suspended in freezing 
medium to final concentration of 10×106/ml. The suspended cells will be aliquoted to 107 
PBMC/vial. All PBMC samples should be labeled with  subject  study ID , protocol number, 
protocol day, date and time of collection. PBMC samples should be frozen and stored at -
80°C or below until shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. All PBMC samples will be shipped on a dry ice or in a liquid

12.1. SCHEDULE DEVIATIONS  
Scheduled protocol activities should be conducted on the specified protocol days. In some 
cases the scheduling may not be able to be followed precisely. For example, subjects may 
miss appointments causing deviations d ue to illness, weather, transportation problems or 
miscommunication. The clinic may experience deviations in scheduling due to lack of 
available site personnel, lack of available supplies, mechanical or equipment failures. 
Deviations may also occur due to unavailability of the study drug , due to QC failures or study 
drug transport problems. In addition, holidays and weekend scheduling may cause conflicts.  
 
If a scheduled protocol appointment is missed for any reason and the study drug has already 
been ship ped, the protocol procedure can be delayed by [CONTACT_167318] , as long as the study 
drug is delivered within its 72 hours shelf life time. If the study drug cannot be delivered 
within the 72 hours shelf -life window, then the protocol procedure should be re scheduled for 
the next available protocol activity day. When rescheduling protocol treatments, the study 
drug should not be administered within 3 days of a previous study drug administration. Thus, 
up to a 7 day delay in protocol procedures is allowed for a missed appoint.  
 
For schedule C, the second intratumoral injection after cryoablation (day 17) must occur 3 
days +/ - 1 day after the ablation procedure.  
 
Schedules for laboratory and research blood tests and follow -up assessments can deviate +/ - [ADDRESS_194495] scans can deviate +/ - [ADDRESS_194496] will be censored as of the date of the violating deviation for 
survival analysis .  
12.2. SCREENING  ASSESSMENTS  FOR ALL SCHEDULES  
Any subje cts deemed possibly eligible for participation will be recruited and assigned a screening 
number. Before screening assessments are conducted , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167239], including timing; the expected and unkno wn risks and 
possible benefits; and answer all subject ’s questions and concerns. The informed consent 
procedure should be documented in the source record and include at least the following: (1) 
subject screening number; (2) date and time; (3) person perfor ming the consent procedure; 
(4) persons present during the consent procedure and their relationship to the subject or the 
study; (5) document any questions asked or concerns expressed by [CONTACT_51889]’s 
representative(s); (6) confirmation that subject  understands that participation is voluntary and 
can withdraw at any time  without penalty, that the protocol is experimental, that no particular 
outcome can be assured or is known, that there is the possibility of side -effects some of 
which may be serious,  and that the protocol requires commitment of significant time to visit 
clinic and participate in telephone interviews.  Subsequently, the subject  must sign  and date and 
receive a copy of an informed consent document that was approved by [CONTACT_167319] ( IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  before any study specific procedure is 
performed.  An additional signed copy should be retained and placed in the Study File.

transits times. Results of tests or examinations performed as standard of care prior to 
obtaining informed consent and within 14 days prior to protocol Day 0  may be used , rather 
than repeating required tests. The following evaluations and procedures will be performed 
during screening:  
• Written informed consent(s)  
- Study informed consent  
• Complete medical history , including  disease history ( date of diagnosis, prior cancer 
therapy and surgery, tumor/node/metastasis staging at the time of diagnosis and study 
entry  and pre-existing toxicities from previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ) 
• Prior (within 30 days) and current concomitant medications  
• Complete comprehensive physical exam ination , including the evaluation of any 
evidence of  major depression and suicidal  behavior (subject’s  previous suicide 
attempts and any suicidal ideations)  
• Demograp hics 
• Vital signs, including heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], blood pressure, temperature , pulse 
oximetry, and weight.  
• EKG  
• Blood draws for CBC, CMP , Total IgG and IgM, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 
lipase,  and CRP  
• Pregnancy test (if applicable)  
• Coagulation test (PTT, PT, INR)  
• HLA baseline test  
• ECOG performance score  
• Baseline CT scan of head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (w/ and w/o contrast). If brain 
involvement at baseline, subjects will be excluded. Future scans only require chest, 
abdomen and pelvis (unles s symptoms are present which suggest possible brain 
metastasis). Subjects with medical conditions which contraindicate the use of contrast 
will be scanned without contrast. The baseline scan will be reviewed by [CONTACT_167320] a target lesion for cryoablation . An 
ultrasound study will be conducted on the target lesion(s) to determine feasibility of 
using ultrasound guidance for the procedure. The interventional radiologist must 
certify that a metastatic lesion exists in a location that can be safely approached 
percutaneously for image -guided cryoablation . This certification along with a 
summary report describing the target lesion will be sent to the referring PI [INVESTIGATOR_114951].  
• Tumor biopsy (mandatory) . Place biopsy in the con tainer provided by [CONTACT_167321]  
12.3. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION (SCREENING ) FOR ALL SCHEDULES 
(STUDY SITE) 
After all the baseline data are obtained (baseline H&P, laboratory and imaging data), the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_167240] a fina l assessment  including opi[INVESTIGATOR_167241]  (subject need not be present) in

investigational product administration (on or before Day -1). Subjects failing to meet IC/EC 
criteria after baseline assessment will be dropped from the study.  A baseline assessment 
form will be filed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_167242].  
Accepted subjects will be assigned a subject number by [CONTACT_167322].  
13. DISCONTINUATION CRIT ERIA  
13.1.   EARLY DISCONTINUATION OF TH E STUDY  
The stud y may be discontinued due to clinical hold or other regulatory action.  The Sponsor 
can discontinue the study at any time for any reason with appro priate notice to the study site 
and the IRB with oversight responsibility . The Sponsor can terminate the parti cipation of the 
study site if the site is not conducting the protocol in accordance with the procedures defined 
in the approved protocol (i.e.  protocol deviations , failure to ensure the quality of the data 
collected , etc.) or due to low rate of recruiting.   
 
The DSMB can recommend termination of the study if they are of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_167243]/risk ratio has become adverse to the subject. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_167244] , information on the investiga tional product causes 
doubt as to the benefit/risk ratio for participation.    
13.2.   EARLY DISCONTINUATION OF INDIVIDUAL SUBJECTS  
Subjects may discontinue participation in the study for the following reasons:  
• Protocol violation  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• DLT event  
• Non-compliance  
• Changes in the subject 's condition render the subject  unacceptable for further 
treatment in the judgment of the Principal Investigator  (the reason(s) must be  
document ed) 
• Subject  becomes pregnant (withdrawal is required)  
• Subject  is lost to fol low-up 
After termination of study therapy, the subject  will be treated as clinically indicated by [CONTACT_1275]. All subject s will be followed until resolution or stabilization of any study -related 
toxicity. If a subjec t is discontinued from all study t herapy, the reason(s) for discontinuation 
should be documented in the subjec t’s medical record and CRF/eCRF.  A follow -up

 14.4. TREATMENT ADMINISTRATION  
14.4.1.  Intrad ermal Injection  
Each ID injection contains 1 x 107 AlloStim® cells formulated in 0.5ml of 1% human serum 
albumin in PlasmaLyteA. One pre -formulated 3  ml syringe of AlloStim® will be delivered to 
the study site per subject for the ID injection days.  
For sc hedules A -1 and A -2, 0.5 ml of AlloStim® will be administered, and the remaining 0.5 
ml will be discarded.  
ID Injections shall be administered into the forearm (abdomen and deltoid areas can also be 
used) for schedule A -[ADDRESS_194504] a different site. The site selected for each injection and the barcode sticker indicating 
the batch of the dose will be recorded on a provided form.  
For the ID injection, the needle should be at a shallow angle, approximately 15 degrees (just 
under the skin). Some resistance should be felt, if not, the needle is likely too deep and should 
be pu lled back until the bevel is barely under the skin. The plunger should be pressed slowly 
and a wheal or bubble should appear at the injection site. The longest diameter of the wheal 
will be recorded immediately following injection in the source document.  
14.4.2.  Intravenous Infusions (IV)  
Schedules A -1 and A -2: Each IV push contains 3 x 107 AlloStim® cells formulated in 3 ml of 
1% human serum albumin in PlasmaLyteA. Pre -formulated 10 ml syringes of AlloStim® will 
be delivered to the study site on or prior to the IV  administration day. AlloStim® is 
administered as an IV push over approximately 5 minutes .  
Subjects may be hydrated with 500  - 2000 ml of NS (or similar) prior to infusion and may be 
medicated with 25 -50 mg diphenhydramine PO/IV, 150 mg ranitidine (Zantac ) PO or other 
H-2 blocker, 25 -50 mg PO indomethacin (or equivalent NSAID) during or after the infusion 
if medically indicated.  
 
After each IV administration of study drug , the vital signs will be monitored  manually every 
15 minutes or  with real -time monito ring equipment for heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], blood 
pressure, temperature, and pulse oximetry. Values will be recorded prior, during and for 2 
hours following the infusion. All changes in vital signs from baseline during and after the 
infusion will be r ecorded in the treatment notes.  
 
The physician on duty has the authority to stop, delay, or cancel the infusion at any time  if 
medically indicated. Any such actions that deviate from the infusion protocol will be 
recorded in the treatment notes and approp riate CRF or eCRF .

 14.4.3.  Intratumoral Injections (IT)  
 Subjects in schedule A -1 will receive an IT injection of AlloStim® (3 ml) on Day 21 into the 
same ablated  lesion on Day 17.  
Each IT injection contains  either 1 x 107 AlloStim® cells formulated in 1  ml or  3 x 107 
AlloStim® cells formulated in 3 ml of 1% human serum albumin in PlasmaLyteA. Pre -
formulated 3 or 10 ml syringes of AlloStim® will be delivered to the study site on or prior to 
the IT administration day.  
After each IT administration of study drug the  vital signs will be monitored with real -time 
monitoring equipment for heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], blood pressure, temperature, and pulse 
oximetry. Values will be recorded every [ADDRESS_194505] 140 days for 
Schedule s A1-4 subjects and 105 days for Schedule B , C, D, E  and F subjects (“Study 
Period”) . If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167246] t hat a subject requires anti -cancer treatment during the Study 
Period, the subject data will be dropped from the protocol. The safety data will be reported 
but will be censored  as of the treatment date. An additional subject will be accrued for each 
censore d subject.  
 
Subjects with bone metastases may receive palliative radiation therapy to treat pain or 
prevent pathological fracture s during the Study Period . 
 
Subjects experiencing anemia can be transfused as medically required (e.g., if Hgb < 9.0 ) at 
discr etion of the PI. Erythropoietin may be used in continuation therapy , if indicated.    
 
Subjects will receive medically appropriate supportive care, including treatment of pain and 
infection during the Study Period.  
 
Additional  IV booster infusions are all owed at the discretion of the investigator on a monthly 
basis after the completion of the Study Period.   
 
Use of steroids is not allowed unless medically indicated. NSAIDs should be used as first 
choice  and methylprednisone or SoluMedrol as next choice  if anti-inflammatory medication

If evidence of severe immune -related adverse events (e.g., GVHD, VOD, autoimmune 
disease) at any time during the protocol, the investigator should first attempt to su ppress the 
inflammation using high dose IV SoluMedrol.  
 
If the condition is refractory to steroids, additional immunosuppressive agents should be 
considered (e.g., Imuran, cyclosporine). Specific agents for cytokine storm related events, 
such as Remicade c an be considered. T -cell inflammation can be treated with Orthoclone 
OKT3, monocyte inflammation with Etoposide and B -Cell inflammation with Rituximab.  If 
immunosuppressive treatment does not reverse a suspected immune -mediated adverse event, 
dexamethasone  should be administered to eliminate any activated immune cells. 
Dexamethasone can be administered alone or in combination with Cytoxan as a reversal 
strategy.  
 
All concurrent medical care must be documented. Any use of immunosuppressive agents will 
result  in censor of the subject for analysis, but the AE/SAE must be reported even after 
administration and documented.  
 
15. ADVERSE  EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a trial subject that has been 
administered the study drug ; the eve nt does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
with AlloStim® treatment or usage.  
 
All observed or volunteered AE s, regardless of causal relationship to the investigational 
product , will be recorded as an adverse event on a supplied case report  form (CRF)  or 
electronic CRF (eCRF). Events involving adverse drug reactions, illnesses with onset during 
the study, or exacerbations of preexisting illnesses should also be recorded as AE s. 
  
Exacerbation of pre -existing illness, including the disease un der study, is  defined as 
manifestation (sign or symptom) of the illness that indicates a significant increase in the 
severity of the illness as compared to the severity noted at the start of the trial and the known 
normal course of disease progression for stage IV colorectal  cancer. This may include 
worsening or increase in severity of signs or symptoms of the illness , increase in frequency of 
signs and symptoms of an intermittent illness, or the appearance of new 
manifestations/complications. Exacerbation of a pre -existing illness should be considered 
when a subject requires new or additional concomitant drug or non -drug therapy for the 
treatment of that illness during the trial.  
 
Lack of, or insufficient clinical response, benefit, efficacy or therapeutic effect, should not be 
recorded as an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of pre -
existing illness and lack of therapeutic efficacy. The investigator can take into consideration

Protocol Da te: December 23, 2014     Amendment Date: September  12, 201 7           Page 61 of 94 
 the results of radiology and pathology exams and  immunological monitoring data when 
making this assessment.  
In addition, abnormal objective diagnostic procedures  findings (e.g., abnormal laboratory test 
results) should be recorded as an AE if it is fulfills one or more of the following:  
• Results in subje ct’s withdrawal by [CONTACT_737];  
• Is associated with an SAE;  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms;  
• Is considered by [CONTACT_167324];  
• Requires the subject to have study therapy discontinued, modified, or interrupted;   
• Requires the subject  to receive specific corrective therapy ; and  
• Requires diagnostic evaluation to assess the risk to the subject . 
 
Laboratory adverse events  should be captured on the AE /SAE CRF/eCRF as appropriate . It 
is expected that wherever possible , the clinical, rather than the laboratory term, will be used 
by [CONTACT_9673].  
Clinically significant changes in physical examination findings should also be recorded as 
AEs.  
15.1.1.  Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events  
All laboratory test values cap tured as part of the study should be recorded on the appropriate 
laboratory test results pages of the CRF/eCRF. In addition, to collect ing additional 
information about clinically important laboratory abnormalities, at a minimum, the following 
laboratory ab normalities should be captured on the AE /SAE CRF/eCRF as appropriate:  
• Any laboratory test result that meets the criteria for an AE or SAE;  
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject  to have study therapy 
discontinued, modified, or interrupted; a nd 
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject  to receive specific corrective 
therapy.  
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory term, will be used 
by [CONTACT_9673].  
15.1.2.    Immune -Related  Adverse Even ts  
The FDA approved the drug Yervoy (Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]), a checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for 
the treatment of Melanoma. The immune mechanism of this drug is novel and resulted also in 
novel immune -related adverse events. Since the immune mechanism of Yervoy and other 
drugs of this class may be similar to the mechanism of the Study Drug, the Investigators 
should be particularly vigilant in diagnosing and reporting Immune -Related Adverse Events.  
 
The manufacturer of Yervoy has provided literature to assist phy sicians in identifying 
immune -related adverse events. This literature might  serve as a guide to investigators as to 
the types of adverse events that might occur with drugs that have an immune mechanism of 
action.

documented (in the Investigator Brochure) for the study drug.  Expected AEs should not be 
reported to the IRB/EC.  
 
The following adverse events are known to be associated with  the administ ration of 
AlloStim®: 
- Allergy, Immunology Reaction  
- Flu-like Symptoms  
- Pain-NOS  
The following adverse events have been observed but have not been attributed to the study 
drug as they may be re lated to the underlying disease:  
- Hemoglobin (Low)  
- Lymphopenia (Low Abs. Lymphs)  
- Alkaline phosphatase (High)  
- AST (High)  
- Calcium (Hypocalcemia)  
- Hypoalbunemia (Low Albumin)  
- DVT (deep vein thrombosis) or other thrombolic events  
In addition, subjects in trials enrolling patients who failed two treatment lines with no available  
treatment options (such as the subjects in the current study) are expected to die from their disease.  
 
AEs do not  include the following:  
• Medical surgical procedures are not AEs (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if the procedure was 
not planned at screening visit.  
• Overdose of concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred).  
 
AEs will be solicited from physical exam, subject and caregiver/family interview in person or 
by [CONTACT_167325]. The investigator is to report all directly obs erved 
adverse events and all adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_167326]/family member . Each  trial subject will be questioned about adverse events at each 
clinic visit following initiation of treatment and by [CONTACT_167327] a month during the 
follow -up phase. The question asked should be, "Since your last clinic visit have you had any 
health problems?", or a similar type of open -ended query.  
 
For all AE s, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine 
the outcome of the AE, and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a 
serious adverse event (SAE). For all AE s, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_167328] (i.e., inve stigational product or other 
illness). The investigator is required to assess causality and indicate that assessment on the 
CRF/eCRF. Follow -up of the AE is required if the AE persists. Follow -up is required until

medical monitor or his/her designated representative.  
 
AE severity will be recorded and graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI)

discont inuation or reduction of the dose of the investigational product, but may 
require additional therapy.  
• Moderate (Grade 2): The AE interferes with the subject ’s daily activities; it does not 
require discontinuation of the investigational product, but may req uire additional 
therapy.  
• Severe (Grade 3): The AE is intolerable and necessitates discontinuing or reducing the 
dose of the investigational product or additional therapy.

All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE CRF  page, and if relevant, the 
Concomitant Medications Record in the CRF  will be updat ed.  Particular attention should be 
made to ensure no discrepancies between the AE and the SAE form (i.e. outcome, severity, 
relationship must be consistent).    
15.2.   SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an untoward medical occurrence, rega rdless of whether or 
not it is considered related to the study medication. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a 
guide for determining if an AE qualifies as a SAE.  
The following must be reported as SAE:  
• Death (regardless of the cause) while on treatment that occurs during the safety 
evaluation period , including deaths due to disease progression.  
o Deaths occurring after the Safety Evaluation Period need not be reported as 
SAE unless they are a result of an event that started while on treatment during 
the S afety Evaluation Period .  
• A life -threatening AE (e.g., the patient was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred) should be reported as SAE. This does not include an event that, had it 
occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death .  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o Excluding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] : 
▪ administration of the investigational product or procedures required by 
[CONTACT_167330] -related diagnostic procedures  
▪ other planned hosp italization   
▪ social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_167250]’s general condition   
o Emergency room visits do not automatically qualify as SAE. Treatments in the 
emergency room for procedures such as hydration that did not r equire 
admitting the patient to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167251] a SAE, but should be 
reported as AE.  
• A Persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] m ay be considered SAE drug experiences when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
An event need not be reported as  SAE if it exclusively represents a relapse or an expected  
change or progression of the baseline malignant disease. This type of event needs only to be 
reported as AE.  
Protocol: ITL -019-CORK -CRYVAC  v.2, Amendment 8.0        Immunovative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_167214].  
 
 
Protocol Da te: December 23, 2014     Amendment Date: September  12, [ADDRESS_194509] ’s medical history at the time of study enrollment will not be 
considered SAEs.  
Any newly emergent SAEs, after treatment is discontinued or the subject has completed the 
study, and is considered to be related to the study drug or st udy participation, should be 
recorded and reported immediately to the Sponsor . The post -study period for the purpose of 
SAE reporting is up to [ADDRESS_194510] IV booster administration .   
15.2.1.  Definition of an Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected  adver se drug event is any AE, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with information in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved 
investigational product.  
Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  is a SAE  assessed as 
unexpected by [CONTACT_167331] a reasonable causal relationship to a medical product.  
15.2.2.  Handling of Serious Adverse Events  
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information as requested by 
[CONTACT_1034]'s clinical monitor or designated representative in addition to that on the 
CRF/eCRF.  In general, this will include a description of the SAE in sufficient detail s to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of  the case and independent determination of 
possible causation. Information on other possible causes of the event, including concomitant 
medications and illnesses must be provided. The investigator's assessment of causality must 
also be provided. If causali ty is unknown, it should be indicated. In the case of a subject 
death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the 
Sponsor or its designated representative. The investigator should ensure that information 
reported i mmediately by [CONTACT_167332] /eCRF  
are accurate and consistent.  
Any SAE or death must be reported immediately to the Sponsor , independent of the 
circumstance or suspected cause , if it occurs or comes to the atten tion of the investigator at 
any time during the study through the last follow -up visit required by [CONTACT_760]. Any SAE 
occurring at any other time after completion of the study must also be promptly reported if a 
causal relationship to the investigationa l product is suspected.  
 
Any AEs classified as “serious” must be recorded on the AE/SAE CRF /eCRF  and require 
expeditious handling and reporting to Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements, 
independent whether considered related or unrelated to the s tudy therapy. These SAEs will 
include the immediate cause of deaths, regardless of their causal relationship to the 
investigational product. All SAEs must be reported using the AE/SAE Form. To the extent 
possible, the descriptive terminology and other SAE attributes entered on the form should 
approximate similar information in the CRF/eCRF. The completed form must be 
faxed /emailed to the sponsor  within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s initial 
notification/awareness of the event, even if only limited i nformation is available. Preliminary 
or supplemental SAE information captured on the clinic note, concomitant  report, and 
laboratory report , may alternatively be scanned and transmitted to the S ponsor  or designee. 
The authorized study site personnel may si gn completed AE/SAE forms . The investigator 
signs each final SAE report. The original AE/SAE form must be kept on file at the study site.

Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Thus, follow -up 
information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation 
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], additional laboratory and test results, autopsy reports, 
etc.), should be collected subsequently, if not available at the time of the initial report, and 
immediately sent to the Sponsor  or designee using the same procedure as the initial SAE 
report.  
 
Follow -up of all SAEs that occur during the study will continue until their satisfactory 
resolution or stabilization. In outstanding cases, it may be defined a s “ongoing without 
further follow -up” by [CONTACT_737]'s and Sponsor’s joint decision.  
 
A follow -up SAE Report Form must be completed by [CONTACT_779] (marked as “follow -up report”) 
and emailed  within 24 hours to the sponsor  (safety @immunovative.co m).  A SAE  follow -up 
report is required whether or not there is any additional information to the initial report.   
 
As for the initial SAE report, once faxed /emailed , the follow -up SAE report and 
accompanying documentation should be placed in the SAE section of the  Investigator’s site 
file.  
 
For ease of analysis, worldwide standardization, and regulatory reporting, Sponsor or 
designee will code each reported SAE or symptom to its corresponding preferred term and 
system organ class in the Medical Dictionary for Regu latory Activities (MedDRA®). The 
NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 3 will serve as the reference document for determining/grading the 
severity or toxicity grade of all SAEs and other symptoms.  
 
For SAEs whose toxicity grading is not contained within the NCI -CTCAE Vers ion 4.0 3 
toxicity criteria, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_167252]. Investigators and study site personnel enter the SAE 
term on the CRF/eCRF and AE/SAE form as accurately a s possible, regardless of the NCI -
CTCAE Version 4.0 3 terminology for the event.  
 
15.2.1.  Exceptions in the 
Reporting of 
Serious Adverse 
Events  
According to EU Detailed guidance on the collection, verification and presentation of adverse 
reaction reports arising fr om clinical trials on medicinal products for human use, ENTR/CT3, 
5.1.9, regarding clinical trials in high morbidity or mortality diseases, it is acceptable to 
define some exceptions in the   immediate reporting of specific SAEs.  
Metastatic colorectal cance r is a recognized condition with high morbidity and/or high 
mortality.  
 
Under these circumstances, it seems appropriate that the SAEs, clearly related to the MCRC  
(i.e. disease -related) could be an exception for an immediate systematic reporting.  
These AE s will be thoroughly handled and followed up through the CRF (AE form) and will 
be reviewed monthly by [CONTACT_456]’s medical monitor  and could be re -qualified for 
reporting if necessary.

The following are treatment guidelines for AlloStim® infusion reactions:  
 
Grade 1  
• Monitor the subject  for worsening of condition . 
• For subsequent infusions  or IV push , premedicate  with 25 -50mg diphenhydramine 
PO/IV, 150mg ranitidine (Zantac) PO or other H -2 blocker, 25 -50mg PO 
indomethacin (or equivalent NSAID) . During or after the infusion if showed signs of 
infusion reactions in prior intravenous dosing (rash, itching, shortness of breath) at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
 
Grade 2  
• Monitor for worsening of condition.  
• Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV (or equivalent), acetaminophen 
650 mg orally for fever, and oxygen.  
• For subsequent infusions  or IV push , premedicate  with 25 -50mg diphenhydramine 
PO/IV, 150mg ranitidine (Zantac) PO or other H -2 blocker, 25 -50mg PO 
indomethacin (or equivalent NSAID) . During or after the infusion if showed signs of 
infusion reactions in prior intravenous dosing (rash, itching, shortness of breath) at the 
investigator’s discretion.  
• If steroid therapy is medically indicated , methylprednisone or SoluMedrol should be 
considered as first choice. Administration of dexamethasone will necessitate droppi[INVESTIGATOR_167257] a nd censoring data from the first day of administration.  
Dexamethasone therapy is contraindicated in immunotherapy protocols, as it has 
been shown to selectively cause apoptosis of activated effector immune cells.   
• If a subject  should have an infusion react ion to AlloStim®, all attempts should be 
made to obtain a cytokine blood sample as close to the onset of the event as possible,

 at the resolution of the event, and 30 days following the event. The procedure for 
sample collection and handling is described i n a separate procedural manual.  
 
Grade 3  
• Stop the infusion or IV Push  if not completed . 
• Administer methylprednisone or SoluMedrol  (or equivalent) medications/treatment as 
medically indicated . 
• Subjects  who have a Grade 3 infusion reaction will not receive f urther AlloStim® 
treatment, but will continue to be followed on the protocol.  
• If a subject  should have an infusion reaction to AlloStim®, all attempts should be 
made to obtain a cytokine blood sample as close to the onset of the event as possible, 
at the r esolution of the event, and 30 days following the event. The procedure for 
sample collection and handling is described in a separate procedural manual.  
 
Grade 4  
• Stop the infusion or IV push  if not completed . 
• Administer methylprednisone or SoluMedrol  (or eq uivalent) medications/treatment as 
medically indicated . 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_105899] . 
• Subjects  who have a Grade 4 infusion reaction will not receive further AlloStim® 
treatment, but will continue to be followed on the protocol . 
• If a subject  should have an infusion reaction to AlloStim®, all attempts should be 
made to  obtain a cytokine  blood sample as close to the onset of the event as possible,  
at the resolution of the event, and 30 days following the event. The procedure for 
sample  collection and handling is described in a separate procedural manual.  
15.5. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR /SPONSOR SAFETY REVIEW  
The investigator will ensure that the protocol and consent form are reviewed and approved by

Protocol Da te: December 23, 2014     Amendment Date: September  12, 201 7           Page 72 of 94 
 comprehensive safety data, which will be provided to the DSMB at regular intervals  
(quarterly)  as defined by [CONTACT_167338], but may meet with greater frequency at their 
discretion. DSMB members will receiv e automatic electronic notification as soon as an SAE 
is reported at the study site. The DSMB members will have access to needed subject clinical 
data for complete documentation of all SAEs. All pertinent safety data including information 
on deaths, tumor progressions, adverse events and laboratory safety data will be reviewed. 
Subsequent to each meeting of the DSMB, the members will recommend in writing to the 
Sponsor that either the study continue in its current form, undergo protocol modification to 
deal with a critical emerging issue, or be stopped because of safety concerns. DSMB 
meetings will consist of an open session, which the Sponsor's representatives can attend, and 
a confidential closed session, which the Sponsor's representatives cannot attend. Minutes will 
be kept for both , the open and closed sessions of the DSMB meetings. The minutes of the 
closed sessions will not be revealed to the Sponsor until the study has been completed and the 
database has been locked.  
15.7. STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_167259]. The investigators and representatives of the 
Sponsor and DSMB will review and discuss subject  data for all subject s enrolled by 
[CONTACT_577].  The DSMB  could recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_167260].  
 
The developmen t of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in any subject will prompt a review of 
safety data by [CONTACT_32622]. The development of any DLT toxicity in ≥ 33% of the accumulated 
number of subjects at any dosing during the assessment period ([ADDRESS_194512] booster 
infusion ) will result in protocol discontinuation. However, if DTLs only occur in the 
Activation or Booster phase, then a decision by [CONTACT_167339] s to receive only priming and in -situ vaccination phases.  
 
16. STATISTICAL METHODS

of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information rel evant to the subject ’s 
willingness to continue participation in the study.  This communication should be 
documented. During a subject ’s participation in the trial, any updates to the consent form and 
any updates to the written information will be provided t o the subject . 
17.7. CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE  
Confidentiality will be maintained within legal limits in the review of the medical records and 
consent forms, which may contain the identity of the subject. All subjects’ identities will be 
restricted to their  initials and a unique subject number.  
Regulatory agencies or ethics committees may review medical records, and other study 
documentation for auditing or inspection purposes. Investigators and their affiliated 
institutions that are considered covered entit ies (CE) under the Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA) will request that the subject sign a fully informed 
Authorization that will accompany the consent form. The Authorization will include the 
Authorization Core Elements (see Priva cy Rule, 45 CFR §164.508(c)(1)) and the 
Authorization Required Statements (see Privacy Rule, 45 CFR §164.508(c)(2)). These 
activities are intended to ensure that subjects understand how their Protected Health 
Information (PHI) arising from this research st udy is to be handled. The Privacy Rule is an 
additional but similar obligation to those that have been required under the Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS) or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Protection 
of Human Subjects Regulations (e.g ., 45 CFR part 46 or 21 CFR parts 50 and 56, 
respectively) to take measures to protect such PHI from inappropriate use or disclosure.  
The investigator and other study site personnel will keep confidential any information 
(including this protocol) related t o this study and all data and records generated in the course 
of conducting the study, and will not use the information, data, or records for any purpose 
other than conducting the study. These restrictions do not apply to (1) Information that 
becomes publi cly available through no fault of the investigator or study site personnel; (2) 
information that it is necessary to disclose in confidence to an IRB /IEC  solely for the 
evaluation of the study; (3) information that it is necessary to disclose in order to pr ovide 
appropriate medical care to a study subject; or (4) study results that may be published as 
described under the Publication Section . 
17.8. MONITORING AND AUDITING STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
The Sponsor (or designee) of this study is responsible to Health Authoriti es for taking all 
reasonable steps to ensure the proper conduct of the study in regards to ethics, protocol 
compliance, and integrity and validity of the data recorded on the CRFs.  The Sponsor is also 
responsible for monitoring data quality and subject  safety. Thus, the main duty of the Sponsor 
is to help the investigator to maintain a high level of ethical, scientific, technical and

17.10.   DATA CAPTURE   
17.10.1.    Case Report Forms  
The CRF is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports. The CRF must be kept 
current to reflect subject status during the course of the study. Only the subject n umber and 
an alpha code will be used to identify the subject.  
After obtaining written source document information from each subject at each visit, the site 
will enter the data onto a paper CRF or directly into an internet –based data collection system 
(as described under section 11.50.2; Electronic Data Capture).  
Source documents are where subject data are recorded and documented for the first time. 
They include, but are not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory 
notes, evaluat ion checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_167264], laboratories, and other departments involved in a clin ical trial.  
 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
transcribed on the CRFs must never be obliterated or destroyed.

 The investigator will maintain a Delegation of Authority Page to document all persons 
authorize d to make entries and/or corrections on CRFs.  The CRF should be reviewed, signed, 
and dated by [CONTACT_1697].  
 
In case of paper CRF, a ll CRFs should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure 
accurate interpretation of data. Black ink is required to e nsure clarity of reproduced CRF 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, original entr ies will be crossed out with a single 
line, and the changes will be initial ed and date d. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE OR USE 
CORRECTION FLUID ON THE ORIGINAL  CRF ENTRY . 
 
According to the GCP guidelines, the investigator (or designee) will check the CRF  entries 
against the source documents, except for the pre -identified source data directly recorded in 
the CRF.

The ICF will include  a statement by [CONTACT_167347], or designee, the 
Ethics Committee (IRC/IEC), and the regulatory authorities to have direct access to source 
data which supports the data on the CRF s (e.g. subjec t’s medical file, appointment books, 
original laboratory records, etc.).   
It is th e responsibility of the investigator to maintain adequate and accurate CRFs to record 
all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation.   
The Clinical Monitor (CM) is responsible for performing on -site monitoring at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; verify adherence to local 
regulations on the conduct of clinical research; and ensure completeness, accuracy, and 
consistency of the data entered in the CRF.  
Data review may generate requests for c larifications (Queries) from the Sponsor to which the 
investigator is obliged to respond by [CONTACT_19130].   
17.10.2.  Electronic Data Capture  
If Electronic Data Capture (EDC) will be used for electronic data acquisition and storage, 
electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be provided for transfer of all research data by [CONTACT_167348] a computer database . Each responsible person 
at a site will have user access with a unique username [CONTACT_2383], with permissions 
providing each person their needed access. Some personnel will have data entry, data review, 
and query resolution permissions, while others may only have data read permissions, based 
on their individual trial roles.

and/or ultrasound guidance. Visual documentation of probe placement for the cryoprobe 
probe will be provided and placed in the source documents. In addi tion, visual documentation 
of the kill zone after the ablation will also be provided for cryoablation. The tumor biopsy 
specimen will be placed in formalin in a pre -labeled specimen container. The tumor biopsy 
specimen will be sent to the Sponsor for patho logical analysis.  
Subject s will have a target tumor lesion cryoablated under local or conscious sedation 
followed by [CONTACT_167358]® injection at a dose of  1 x 107 cells formulated in 1 ml 
of Plasma -LyteA/1% HAS or  3 x 107 cells formulated in 3 ml of Plasma -LyteA/1% HSA. 
The intent of the ablation procedure is not to completely ablate the target lesion, but only to 
cause an area of necrosis within the tumor. Therefore, it is not necessary to have perfect 
margins. The intratumoral injection will o ccur after the ablation area has warmed to 370C.  
It is preferred that an interventional radiologist, CT technician, and physician trained in 
anesthesia or emergency medicine be present during the procedure. A Registered Nurse (RN) , 
medical assistant and a  cryoablation technician should also be present to support these 
procedures (same individual may function in two of these roles). The Sponsor may also have 
a medical/scientific consultant present. If the ablation target is in or near the lungs, it is 
recom mended that the procedure be conducted in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167266] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_167267].   
Cryoablation will be performed by a licensed interventional radiologist or other experienced 
physicia n using a CryoCare -28 Percutaneous Probe System (Endocare, CA, [LOCATION_003]) or the 
SeedNet™ System (Galil Medical, Israel). Generally, the Galil system is preferred for 
approach of lesions in the lungs due to the smaller 17g probe size having less of a chance of 
pneumothorax complications. These systems use the Joule -Thomson effect to cool the end of 
a cryoprobe in a closed system. In accordance with the gas coefficient and the dimension of 
the nozzle, different gaseous elements generate different thermal exchange events at the area 
close to the nozzle. Argon gas is used for cooling ( -1870C), and helium is used for heating 
(670C).  
Subjects will be observed for [ADDRESS_194541] a pre -procedure assessment which will be 
documented in the medical records including:  
• A medical evaluation (history and physical  based) by [CONTACT_167359] 
(this should include documentation of current medications and a history of any 
adverse or allergic drug reactions, including anesthesia or sedation, other allergies, 
NPO status, and an ASA assessment).

 • Assessment of the subject ’s ability to tolerate conscious  sedation  
• Review of laboratory studies including coagulation studies.  PT/PTT within normal 
range and INR must be ≤ 1.5.  Review with subjec t the previously signed informed 
consent for the procedure and plan for sedation . 
• Age appropriate assessment, includ ing baseline set of vital signs and a pre -procedure 
SPO2 . 
• Note that subjects  exhibiting hemodynamic instability, oxygen desaturation, or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]/failure are not appropriate candidates for IV conscious 
sedation . 
 
Any of the following drugs (o r combination) can be used for conscious sedation at the 
discretion of the treating physician and administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly 
(IM):  
• Diazepam (Valium) adult dose: 2 -10 mg.;  >60yo: 2 -5 mg  
• Lorazepam adult dose: 0.5 mg/kg;  >60yo: .02 -0.05 mg/kg  
• Midazolam (Versed) adult dose: .07 - 0.08 mg/kg; >60yo:  .02 -0.05 mg/kg  
• Morphine adult dose: 0.025 -0.2 mg/kg; >60yo:  0.05 -0.2 mg/kg (Max. of 15 mg)  
• Meperidine (Demerol) adult dose: 1 -1.5 mg/kg; >60yo: 1 -1.5 mg/kg  
• Fentanyl (Sublimaze) adult do se: 1-2 mcg/kg; >60yo: 1 mcg/kg  
 
Care must be taken to assure that the total dose does not obtund protective pharyngeal 
reflexes or render the subject  unresponsive to verbal stimuli.  
For some procedures , where subject  breath movements may affect the abili ty to accurately 
place the cryoprobe, DIPRIVAN® (propofol) or similar sedation medication is allowed during 
the interval of probe placement.  
The following equipment/emergency drugs shall be immediately available (Code Cart) prior 
to IV conscious sedation b eing administered:  
• Oxygen source  
• Ambu bag  
• Laryngoscope  
• Endotracheal Tubes (i.e. sizes 5.0 mm, 6.0 mm, 7.0 mm, 8.0 mm)  
• Oral and nasal airways  
• Emergency drugs (Narcan, Romazicon)  
• Cardiac monitor/defibrillator and suction equipment  
• Pulse Oximeter  
 
Immediately  Prior to Initiation of Conscious Sedation  
• Place the subject on monitoring device for heart rate, pulse oximetry and blood 
pressure.  
• Prior to the initiation of conscious sedation, the following assessments are 
determined, monitored, and documented:  
o Level of consciousness and mental status  
o Vital signs: heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature and 
oxygen saturation  
o NPO Status  
o Baseline Aldrete scale

 • Peri-procedure monitoring, subject  care, and treatment including medications 
administered wil l be documented on the Sedation Record Form and included in the 
medical record s. 
 
Intra -Procedure Monitoring and Care  
• The physician will order the sedation medication and administer the initial dose. The 
RN may administer subsequent medication s. 
• Cardiac mo nitoring and oxygen saturation are to be monitored continuously and 
documented every 5 minutes.  
• Blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_167268]/rhythm will be taken and documented 
at least every five minutes, or more frequently depending upon changes in the 
subject ’s condition.  
• The subject  will also be monitored for potential adverse reactions to the medications 
being administered. Any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions are to be reported 
immediately to the attending physician and documented.  
• Level of  consciousness will be monitored and documented.  
• Supplemental oxygen will be administered if oxygen saturation is less than 95%.  
• Administered drugs should be recorded, including route, time and dosage.  
• If subject  demonstrates persistent oxygen desaturation  (SaO 2 less than 90%) despi[INVESTIGATOR_167269], or requires airway support, the case should be 
terminated.  
 
Biopsy and Cryoablation  
• Once the percutaneous approach is determined, a sterile field will be created and local 
anesthesia administer ed to the planned probe insertion site.  
• A guide probe will be inserted percutaneously and verified by [CONTACT_167360]. A needle biopsy system will be used to obtain a sample of tumor 
to verify ablation of live tumor. Preferably, th is determination will be made "real -
time" by [CONTACT_63689] -site pathologist. If a pathologist is not available, the tumor sample will 
be placed in formalin in a pre -labeled container and sent for retrospective pathological 
analysis.   
• If the subject  is undergoing cryoablation, a cryoprobe will be inserted through the 
guide tube into the tumor. One or two freeze -thaw cycles will be performed. A single 
probe of 2 - or 5-mm will be used according to the size of the target tumor. The time 
of freezing will be approximate ly 5-20 minutes dependent on the achievement of an 
"ice-ball", visible on CT or ultrasound. In the case of a Galil probe, a thermosensor 
may also be placed in or near the tumor lesion. Thawing will be achieved by [CONTACT_167361] a period equivalent to the freezing time before the second freezing 
process will be initiated. The procedure requires ablation of a sample of the tumor 
lesion and does not require complete tumor ablation with tumor -free margins.  
• The lesion will be allowed to cool for approxi mately 10 min to 1 hour following the 
second freezing or heating cycle before injection of AlloStim®. AlloStim® is 
formulated in Plasma -LyteA in a syringe with a locked needle.  The needle will be 
inserted through the guide tube and into the ablated tumor.  AlloStim® will be 
administered intratumorally by [CONTACT_17838].  The syringe will be flushed into the tumor 
with additional Plasma -LyteA or saline after injection.   
• Following injection, the guide tube will be removed. Hemostasis of the insertion hole 
will be  obtained by [CONTACT_167362] (if necessary).

• Subjects  will go to an appropriate post -anesthesia care observation area, transported 
by a registered nurse.  
• Vital signs (which include: heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], level of 
consciousness, and oxygen saturation) will be taken every five to fifteen minutes until 
the subject  reaches the defined discharge criteria. Heart rate/rhythm will be monitored 
by a cardiac monitor. Post sedation assessment shall also include subject ’s orientation.  
• Significant variations in physiologic parameters are to be reported to the physician 
immediately. These shall include, but not be limited to:  
o A variation of plus or minus 20% in vital signs  
o Serious arrhythmia  
o Oxygen saturation greater than 5% below baseline  
o Dyspnea, apnea, or hypoventilation  
o Diaphoresis, inability to arouse subject  , or the need to maintain the subject ’s 
airway  
o Other untoward or unexpected subject responses

reaches a score of seven (7) on the Aldrete scale:  
• Subject  is able to be arous ed 
• Blood pressure, heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_167270] (q 15 
min.) and have returned to pre -procedure status  
• Oxygen saturation is back to or near baseline  
• Subject  is oriented to person, place, time and situation an d ambulates w ithout 
difficulty  (if these were skills prior to procedure)  
• Subject  is able to verbalize appropriately; stands and dresses self ( if these were skills 
prior to procedure)  
• Subject  has minimal/tolerable pain level  
• Subject  has no nausea, vomiting, or bleeding

Protocol Da te: December 23, 2014     Amendment Date: September  12, [ADDRESS_194544] to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_167271] “planned protocol deviations”.  This was a 
process whereby [CONTACT_167363] a planned change in dosing 
frequency for a small number of subjects. The protoco l was sub -divided into sections 
including intradermal dosing, intraturmoral dosing and intravenous dosing.  After intradermal 
dosing an increased in allo -specific Th1 was expected.  After intraturmoral dosing, an 
increase in tumor -specific Th1 cells was ex pected and after intravenous dosing, a cytokine 
storm was expected.  When the expected immunological response was not detected, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_167272] p rotocol.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_167273]. This resulted in some subjects receiving more 
doses than others.  During the inspection, FDA maintained that the protocol deviations were 
safety issues that required  FDA protocol amendments. The IRB disagreed and argued that 
they had the authority to authorize this change in a few subjects to determine if a protocol 
amendment should be submitted.  
 
Numerous other issues were raised and were finally resolved as follows : 
 
1. Sponsor agreed that no protocol deviations would be made without an approved 
protocol amendment  
2. Sponsor agreed to form a DSMB to monitor the safety using an FDA -approved 
charter  
3. Sponsor agreed to have an independent clinical monitor conduct inspections of 
clinical sites under a FDA -approved charter. The independent monitor will report to 
FDA monthly on compliance with GCP.  
The major issue with the Sponsor was related to the QC release testing of the final formulated 
lots of study drug.  The in termediate of the drug was stored frozen and underwent USP 
sterility and rapid test for endotoxin.  When needed in the clinic, released intermediate was 
thawed and formulated in a clean room located in the clinic. Since the study drug at the time 
had only a 4-6h shelf life and USP sterility testing required [ADDRESS_194545] was 
changed to a validated gel clot method conducted in a licensed lab.  Lastly, a rapid

Protocol Da te: December 23, 2014     Amendment Date: September  12, [ADDRESS_194546] 
within 48h was validated and incorporated in the release criteria.  
 
The GMP issues were finally resolved by:  
 
1. Donors for the source blood will be screened and tested in accordance with 21 CFR  
1271 tissue regulations which are more stringent than the blood regulations.  
2. Sponsor agreed to an independent GMP monitor that will report monthly to FDA.  
The monitoring will be conducted in accordance with an FDA -approved charter.

Title of Study:  A Phase I/II study of an experimental therapeutic cancer 
vaccine created in -situ in subjects with progressive metastatic 
cancer refractory to standard therapy.  
Protocol Number:  ITL-002-CRYO  
Study D esign:  This is a single -arm, open label, single institution Phase I/II 
study to determine the safety and feasibility of creating an 
individualized in -situ anti -tumor vaccine. The study protocol 
has three separate steps: (1) priming step; (2) in -situ 
vaccin ation step; and (3) immune stimulation step. Subjects 
meeting eligibility criteria were primed with at least three and 
up to nine intradermal AlloStim® injections at a frequency of 
every 2 -8 days at doses between 1 x 107 to 4 x 107 cells.  
After priming, a  selected tumor lesion was cryoablated using a 
percutaneous, image -guided technique followed by [CONTACT_167365] 1 -6 x 107 AlloStim®. Subjects with 
palpable tumors also were eligible to receive at least one and 
up to three alcohol ablation proc edures to palpable lesions

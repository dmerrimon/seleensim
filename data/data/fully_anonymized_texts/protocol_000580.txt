Many Marines and Sailors return from deployment with mental health 
problems related to their experiences. One such problem is 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which involves symptoms such as persistent unwanted memories of traumatic events, avoidance of 
reminders of the events, excessive watchfulness, jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_483317]. Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483318]-threat and were developed chiefly on civilians.  We developed 
and pi[INVESTIGATOR_483319] a psychological treatment for PTSD specifically for 
service members who suffer not only life -threat, but also traumatic 
loss and inner conflicts from morally challenging experiences.  This 
intervention,  Adaptive Disclosure (AD) is an eight- session PTSD 
treatment that helps Marines to identify unhelpful beliefs about a 
traumatic event and find ways to move forward. Preliminary clinical 
data suggests that AD is acceptable to Marines, feasible to implement, 
and safe and that it reduces PTSD and depression. The primary 
objective of this randomized controlled non- inferiority trial is to 
determine whether or not AD is as least as effective as Cognitive Processing Therapy, cognitive only version (CPT- C), which is an 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_483320]. 
We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_621234]. They will be randomly assigned 
to AD or CPT- C and followed during and after treatment. The groups will be 
compared on measures of mental health (p articularly PTSD and depression), work-
related functioning, trauma -related beliefs, copi[INVESTIGATOR_483321].

II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
 
     A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
 
        As of spring 2009, more than 1.[ADDRESS_621238] 
served in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with 37% having deployed at 
least twice. Findings from epi[INVESTIGATOR_483330] 10- 18% of combat troops 
experience deployment- related psychological health problems, such as 
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; e.g., Hoge et al., 2004; see Litz 
& Schlenger, 2009; Smith, et al., 2008). Rates of PTSD continue to 
increase as the wars continue (e.g., Milliken, Achterlonie, & Hoge, 
2007). The negative public health impact of PTSD related to combat and 
operational trauma is heightened by [CONTACT_483363]- occurrence with 
substance abuse (Jacobson et al., 2008), physical health problems 
(Hoge, Terhakopi[CONTACT_1629], Castro, Messer, & Engel, 2007), and functional 
disability (Hoge, Auchterlonie, & Milliken, 2006). Thus, effective treatment of PTSD is an important priority for our military personnel 
and veterans. Further, the reach of effective PTSD treatment extends 
well beyond the individual to family members and friends, to the 
employer and colleagues at work, and to the society.  
     The primary evidence -based treatments for PTSD have limitations in 
the military population. Strategies such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Cognitive -Processing Therapy (CPT) have been shown to be effective, but 
they were developed and tested primarily  on civilian women with sexual 
assault and are not specifically tailored to address the unique challenges of service members exposed to sustained combat and 
operational stress, trauma, loss, and other war- related adversities and 
conflicts. Consistent with this, effect sizes in PTSD treatment trials 
with Veterans are consistently smaller than those generated in civilian 
trials (e.g., Monson et al., 2006; Rauch et al., 2009; Ready et al., 
2008; Schnurr et al., 2007). PE and CPT also are lengthy and require 
extensive homework, which may not fit the high operation and training tempo of the active- duty garrison- life.

Updated February 2016March 2018

      AD was developed to address this need. It is an eight -session 
fully manualized intervention designed specifically for active duty 
Marines and S ailors with PTSD stemming from a variety of traumatic 
deployment experiences (fear- based trauma, traumatic loss, and moral 
injury). The first session is devoted to assessment, psychoeducation, using motivational interviewing strategies to help the service member 
clarify what they would like to see happen, and providing a road- map 
about how AD can be used in service of those goals. The middle six sessions are devoted to (1) processing the most difficult, pressing, or 
emblematic combat and operational experience, (2) unearthing the 
service member’s evolved understanding of the experience as they move 
forward in their military careers and beyond, and (3) providing experiential opportunities for the service member to consider 
alternative, more helpful ways of th inking about the experience, and 
(4) identifying a path towards healing and recovery. The last session 
is devoted to articulating lessons learned, getting and giving 
feedback, wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_158002], and planning for future challenges. AD is based 
on the idea that trauma- related symptoms are sustained because of 
avoidance and maladaptive beliefs about traumatic experience and the 
post-traumatic experience (e.g., Ehlers & Clark, 2000; Resick & 
Schnicke, 1992). Having service members disclose and form a narrative 
of a traumatic event (such as is used in PE) serves two purposes. 
First, the narrative provides an experience to disconfirm the common 
fears that fully remembering and disclosing the event may lead to “going crazy,” losing control, or being judged or rejected. B y 
providing a positive and/or useful experience with disclosure, patients 
may be more likely to disclose difficult deployment experiences with natural support networks (family, friends, fellow service members) or, 
if need be, with formal support services in the military and VA, thus 
avoiding the negative repercussions of avoidance and withdrawal. 
Second, the trauma narrative is used to elicit emotions and beliefs 
that are linked to combat and operational trauma in order to unearth 
tacit or previously unacknowledged maladaptive interpretations. Once 
such beliefs are recognized, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483331], more useful and adaptive 
appraisals moving forward. This may be accomplished through cognitive therapy strategies or through experiential techniques. AD also includes 
behavioral strategies, often assigned as homework, which may include 
exposure to avoided stimuli to address hypervigilance, activities to honor the departed to address grief, and ways of “making amends” for 
guilt/shame.  
     Finally, because of its brevity, the goal of AD is to plant 
restorative and healing seeds. We assume that for service members who 
have been exposed to multiple deployments with multiple injurious war-
zone experiences, AD is the start of a healing and recovery process 
that the service member will need to embrace, own, and carry- forward to 
be truly effective. In other words, our goal is to provide an 
opportunity for a course- correction, to help service members get clear 
about where they are and how they would like to be moving forward. AD 
provides a sober but hopeful, evocative and emotion- focused opportunity 
for service members to realize how they have changed as a result of 
combat and operational experiences and to think about who they want to

burden and improve functioning because the service member: (a) becomes more accepting and less self- condemning; (b) begins to make choices in 
service of wellness and self- care; (c) shares and discloses with 
trusted others; (d) reclaims competence and confidence in military and social roles; and (e) is better prepared to seek support and care if they need it over time.  
 
     B. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:  
 
     The primary objective of this randomized controlled non -
inferiority trial is to determine whether or not Adaptive Disclosure (AD), a new combat -specific psychotherapy for PTSD, is as least as 
effective as Cognitive Processing Therapy, cognitive only version (CPT -
C), in terms of its impact on deployment -related psychological health 
problems (specifically PTSD and depression) and functioning.  
 
Primary Specific Aim 1: To determine whether or not AD is as least as 
effective as CPT -C in terms of change in psychological health problems 
over the treatment period.  
Primary Specific Aim 2: To determine whether or not AD is at least as 
effective as CPT -C in terms of change in military -relevant functioning 
over the treatment period.  
 
The project has several secondary objectives. First, because AD was 
developed to be consonant with the Marine Corps culture, we aim to test 
whether AD will be better accepted by [CONTACT_483364] -C. Second, we 
will examine whether A D will be superior to CPT- C in terms of changing 
constructs that are uniquely targeted by [CONTACT_22802], namely traumatic grief and 
moral injury. Third, we examine whether AD will be superior to CPT- C in 
terms of increasing resilience and posttraumatic growth. Finall y, we 
will examine trauma- related cognition as a mediator of symptom and 
functioning changes.  
 
Secondary Specific Aim 1:  To compare the acceptability of AD and CPT- C. 
Secondary Specific Aim 2:  To compare the degree of change in grief and 
moral injury in th e two treatments.  
Secondary Specific Aim 3:  To compare the degree of change in resilience 
and posttraumatic growth in the two treatments.  
Secondary Specific Aim 4: To examine posttraumatic cognition as a 
mediator of treatment- related changes.  
Secondary Specific Aim 5:  To complete a qualitative analysis of 
reactions to Adaptive Disclosure at the end of treatment  
 
     C. PREVIOUS WORK BY [CONTACT_483365]:

them feel more in control (4 felt neutral), and 16 agreed or strongly agreed that the intervention helped resolve emotional difficulties they 
had been experiencing (2 felt neutral, 2 disagreed). Nine agreed or 
strongly agreed that the intervention was long enough to make a 
significant improvement on their life (5 felt neutral), but [ADDRESS_621241] – Military Version 
(PCL-M) dropped from 62.3 at pre- treatment to 50.2 after six sessions 
[effect size (Cohen’s d) = 0.80, 90% CI 0.53- 1.07]. The average score 
on the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9 (PHQ-9), our measure of 
depression severity, dropped from 14.[ADDRESS_621242]-treatment [effect size (Cohen’s d) = 0.6, 90% CI 0.35 -0.85]. The 
total score on the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI) reduced from 11.2 to 9.3 [effect size (Cohen’s d) = 0.45, 90% CI 0.19 -0.71], 
with the most pronounced differences on the scales assessing negative 
cognitions about the self and world. Finally, the total score on the Response to Stressful Experiences Scale (RSES), a measure of resiliency 
after stressful events, increased from 9.[ADDRESS_621243].  
 
 D. RESEARCH DESIGN 
 
1. General Approach: 
   This project is a randomized noninferiority trial comparing AD to 
CPT-C. 
 
2. Methods: 
Potential participants will be referred by [CONTACT_483366][INVESTIGATOR_483332] 
(refer to Recruitment of Subjects). A partial HIPAA waiver is being 
requested so that providers can give names and contact [CONTACT_483367]. Individuals who are referred 
will be contact[CONTACT_483368], who will explain the 
project and offer an initial appointment. If the individual is willing 
to be evaluated for the study, the staff member will set a time for the initial evaluation, in which consent will be obtained and inclusionary and exclusionary criteria will be assessed. For eligible individuals 
who choose to participate, the baseline self- report measures will be 
completed in this visit as well. During the visit (or within the next 
week if necessary), the individual will be introduced by [CONTACT_756] 
([LOCATION_011] VA),  or in person  (San Diego VA) , to an assessor who will 
complete a clinician- rated assessment of their PTSD symptoms [using the

health professional who can remain blind to treatment condition; the 
CAPS retains good psychometric properties when administered in this way 
(Aziz & Kenford, 2004).  
Once eligibility is established, participants will be randomly 
assigned to one of two treatment conditions: AD or CPT -C. The [LOCATION_011] 
site will provide randomization materials ahead of time so that staff biases cannot influence group assignment. The participant will begin 
treatment with a study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_174190]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483333], email or text message to arrange 
appointments, but no clinical information will be sent by [CONTACT_483370]. He/she will receive 720 minutes of individual psychotherapy 
delivered as 8 weekly 90- minute sessions of AD or 12 60- minute sessions 
of CPT-C over 8 weeks (ideally scheduled twice a week for the first 4 
weeks and once a week for the second 4 weeks nut some variation is 
permitted); sessions may extend over an additional 2 weeks if needed. A 
brief symptom assessment will be used weekly during treatment. The full 
assessment battery will be repeated at the end of treatment and 3 and 6 
months after treatment (see Assessment). We will contact [CONTACT_483371], email or text to arrange these appointments.  
An effort will be made to retain subjects in the study. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483334]. In the event that a patient does discontinue the treatment (either by [CONTACT_59274][INVESTIGATOR_483335]), we will attempt to perform a full 
assessment within one week of exit from the trial. Following the protocol recommended by [CONTACT_483372] (Moher, et al., 2001), we 
will keep track of: how many people are referred to the study; how many 
of those participate in screening for the study; how many of those 
screened meet inclusion criteria and how many are excluded by [CONTACT_483373]; how many are invited to participate in the study; and of 
those who we invite to participate, how many actually enroll. This 
information will provide an empi[INVESTIGATOR_483336] -inclusion 
attrition rates and identifying any potenti al enrollment bias. In 
addition to assessing possible differential refusal and the impact it 
might have on generalizability of findings, we will record the reasons patients are excluded from or refuse to participate in the study. This 
will permit us to examine potential differences in rates and reasons 
for study refusal or exclusion.  
 
Assessment 
Initial eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_483374]- M (total 
score > 34; Weathers, Litz, Huska, &  Keane, 1991) immediately 
after consent. In addition, sections A, B, C, K and I of the Mini 
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al 
1998) and a brief neuropsychological battery will be administered 
to assess for exclusionary criteria,  and the potential 
participant will be queried about homicidality and current mental health utilization. The [LOCATION_011] or San Diego site then will 
determine final eligibility by [CONTACT_420600]-person, using the 
Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1990).

designated NMC staff members phone numbers to intervene in case 
of emergency, will be in possession by [CONTACT_483375]. Once determined to be eligible, participants will complete the 
full assessment battery, which will be repeated at the end of the 
initial treatment period, [ADDRESS_621245] of the following measures. All 
instruments are well- established and frequent ly used.  
 
Descriptives and Covariates  
Demographic information will be collected, including age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, marital status, education, branch of service, rank, military occupational specialty (MOS), length of service,  deployment 
history and items which are in standard use in the NHCP Mental Health 
Clinic to help us to characterize the individual’s baseline level of impairment. (Administered at baseline)  
The INTRuST TBI Screening Instrument  is a 3-item tool to identify 
probable exposure to head i njury, modified to include age at which 
endorsed events occurred.  
The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders, 
Aasland, Babor, de la Fuente, & Grant, 1988) is a brief self- report 
measure of problematic alcohol use.  
A short neuropsycholog ical battery will be administered to assess 
cognitive processes that may have been impacted by [CONTACT_483376]. These measures include: WAIS -IV Digit Span (~5-10 
minutes), [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test -  2 (CVLT- 2; 15 minutes 
total), DKEFS Trails (~6 minutes), WAIS-IV Letter -Number Span (~5 
minutes). (Administered at screening) 
The mental health service history – Interview supplement will be 
used to detail mental health treatment received prior to study entry (at baseline) and since the las t assessment.  
 
Primary Aims  
Psychological Health  
The CAPS is the primary outcome measure. This 45– 60 minute 
interview yields PTSD diagnostic status as well as a continuous total 
severity score. The scale also assesses social and occupational functioning, guilt, and the validity of symptom reports. A question 
will be added in the format of the interview to ask about shame. It 
will be administered by [CONTACT_66270] a trained clinician 
in [LOCATION_011] or San Diego, who is blind to treatment status at the beginning and end of the intervention. (Administered before and after 
treatment) 
The PTSD Checklist, Military Version  (PCL-M; Weathers, Litz, Huska, 
& Keane, 1994) is a 17 -item self- report measure of DSM -IV PTSD 
symptoms.  
The nine depression items from the Patient Health Questionnaire  
(PHQ-9; Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Kroenke & Williams, 1999) make up a brief self -report 
measure of the severity of depressive symptoms.

 The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (Buss & Perry, 1992) is a 
27-item questionnaire assessing physical and verbal aggression, anger 
and hostility. 
Military- Relevant Functioning  
The brief version of the Inventory of Functional Impairment (IFI; 
Marx) is 14- item self- report measure of multiple dimensions of 
functional impairment in active duty service members and veterans. The 
measure will be supplemented with additional questions about military-
specific work functioning.  
The SF-12 is an abbreviated version of the Short Form 36 Health 
Survey (SF- 36), which is a measure of health- related quality of life. 
The Physical and Mental Component Summary scales (PCS and MCS) from the SF-12 are virtually identical to those derived from the SF -36, and the 
SF-12 has good validity for detecting ill health (Jenkinson et al., 
1997). 
 
Secondary Aims  
Acceptability  
Credibility measure adapted from Borkovec & Nau, 1972. 
(Administered after session 1.)  
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Attkisson & Greenfield, 
1994), an 8- item measure of satisfaction with services received. 
(Administered after the final therapy session) 
The Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; Busseri & Tyler, 2003), a 12-
item measure of rapport/alliance with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  (Administered at 
the treatment mid- point). 
AD-Specific Constructs  
The Inventory of Prolonged Grief (IPG -13; Prigerson et al., in 
press) is a 13- item measure of bereavement- related distress.  
The Moral Injury Events Scale (MIES; Nash et al., in submission) 
is a 9-item measure of perceived transgressions by [CONTACT_483377]. 
The short form of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory  (PTGI-SF; Cann 
et al., 2010) is a 10- item measure of five domains of posttraumatic 
growth. 
Mechanism  
The Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI; Foa, Ehlers, Clark, 
Tolin, Orsillo, 1999) will be used to assess changes in trauma related cognitions. The PTCI assesses [ADDRESS_621246] categories of posttraumatic 
beliefs known to be associated with poor er posttraumatic adjustment –  
negative beliefs about self, negative beliefs about the world, and 
self-blame. 
 
Before treatment sessions 2 -8, both conditions will also complete 
an abbreviated assessment battery [PCL- M, PHQ-9 and AUDIT- C (consisting 
of the first 3 items of the AUDIT)] to monitor weekly symptom changes.  
Assessor Training and Adherence : [CONTACT_36058] will train the assessors 
prior to beginning enrollment unless they can demonstrate prior 
appropriate training. Training will include reading and viewi ng 
training materials, observation of CAPS administration, and supervised 
administration of at least three CAPS. Each assessor will be considered 
trained on CAPS when he or she “matches” [CONTACT_36058] on three interviews. 
To establish matching, [CONTACT_36058] will co- rate an interview conducted by 
[CONTACT_483378]: A Combat- Specific PTSD Treatment  NHCP  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483315], Nancy; NMCSD PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483316], Shiva   CIP# NHCP.2010.[ADDRESS_621247]. Gray agree on 
the diagnosis and are within 2 points of severity (frequency + intensity) on all of the symptom clusters (PTSD criteria B, C, and D). 
If the assessor does not match on three interviews after five attempts, 
[CONTACT_36058] will determine whether additional training is necessary or if the assessor needs to be replaced.  
[CONTACT_483395] will train the personnel who will be administering the 
neuropsychological battery. Training will include didactics about the administration and scoring of the instruments, observation of 
administration and scoring, observed administration and scoring, and 
periodic monitoring.  
 
Intervention  
  
Both AD and CPT- C are manualized interventions. Weekly feedback 
about progress in treatment will be provided to the patient’s mental health clinic provider, but details of the approach being used will be 
excluded so that providers remain blind to the randomization. The blind can be broken if necessary for crisis management. Providers will 
receive a summary of progress after the post- treatment assessment has 
been completed. AD is outlined in the table below.

and Rodgers. Training will involve review of the AD or CPT manual and 
supporting materials, intensive supervision of the first two cases and 
weekly group supervision.  
All sessions will be audiotaped and reviewed to ensure sustained 
fidelity to the treatment approach (provided that the participant consents). [CONTACT_127089]  will review AD cases and [CONTACT_20712] will review 
CPT-C cases for adherence. They will review audio recordings of 100% of 
the first 2 cases, 50% of the subsequent 3 cases, and 25% of the next 5 and 10% t hereafter. Drs. Litz and Rodgers can at their discretion 
increase the proportion reviewed for difficult patients or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483341]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483342]. All recordings will be t ransported to

Federal Express or another carrier that allows for tracking. All 
recordings will be destroyed when the participant completes or drops 
out of treatment.

5. Statistical Analysis: 
 
Statistical Plan 
Data analysis will be completed by [CONTACT_483379]: Given the assumptions underlying some 
of the analyses described below, tests of normality will be conducted 
and transformation applied where appropriate. In addition, outliers 
will be identified, and corrective action (deletion, adjustment, or 
retention) will be taken depending on the source of the deviation, as per Tabachnick and Fidell (1996). Missing data will not be imputed; 
instead, the maximum likelihood estimation in Mplus will be used to 
estimate the models. This method derives the parameter estimates from the data that is available. 
 
Pre-treatment equivalence: In order to determine pretreatment 
equivalence, a one- way ANOVA (with treatment condition as the between 
subjects factor) will be conducted on the primary outcome measure, the CAPS (indexed as symptom severity, defined as the mean of the sum of 
Adaptive Disclosure: A Combat- Specific PTSD Treatment  NHCP  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483315], Nancy; NMCSD PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483316], Shiva   CIP# NHCP.2010.0177        
Updated February 2016March 2018  
                                                        
 
 17 
 the 17 Frequency and Intensity Ratings). For descriptive purposes, 
this analysis will also be conducted on the other outcome and moderator variables. In addition, t- tests and chi- square analyses will 
be conducted on demographic variables to determine equivalence across groups. Similar analyses will be conducted to compare dropouts and completers on pre- treatment and demographic variables in order to 
determine if these groups differ on relevant variables. 
 
Primary Outcome Analysis: We will calculate the mean difference in 
CAPS scores by [CONTACT_483380]. Then, we will create a 95% 
confidence interval around that difference. If the interval is above a 
non-inferiority margin of - [ADDRESS_621248] the null 
hypothesis (that CPT is superior) and accept the research hypothesis (that AD is non- inferior). The non- inferiority margin is based on a 
calculation of a reliable difference in CAPS scores (Monson et al., 
2006).  We will follow a similar procedure for the other primary 
outcome measures (i.e., the PCL- M, the PHQ- 9, the IFI, and the SF- 12). 
 
Analyses of Clinical Significance: Clinically significant change will 
be calculated by [CONTACT_127068]- Truax (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) method, 
as recommended in recent reviews of clinical change indices (e.g., 
Bauer, Lambert, & Neilson, 2004). This method suggests a two- step 
criterion. First, a reasonable cutoff between the 
patient/dysfunctional and non- patient/functional populations is 
established. Jacobson and Traux’s suggested cutoff A, defined as the 
point 2 SDs beyond the range of the pre- therapy mean for the CAPS 
(i.e., cutoff A = Mclinical -  2 SDclinical), will be used. Second, a 
reliable change index (RC) for each participant will be calculated to 
ensure that changes are not due to an artifact of measurement error. 
The RC is computed according to the following formula: RC = (x2 –  
x1)/Sdiff where x1 represents the participant’s pretreatment CAPS 
total score, x2 represents the participant’s posttreatment or follow-
up CAPS total score, and Sdiff is the standard error of difference between the two test scores. Sdiff will be calculated from the 
internal consistency of the CAPS at each time point, as suggested by 
[CONTACT_483381], Saunders, and Howard (1996). An RC larger than 1.96 reflects real change (Jacobson & Truax, 1991). Based on the two- step 
criterion, individuals will be classified as recovered (passed both cutoff A and RC criteria), improved (pass RC criterion but not cutoff 
A), unchanged (did not pass RC criteria), or deteriorated (passed RC 
criterion but symptom scores increased). 
We will also calculate three other indices of change based on the 
percentage of PTSD cases in each group, the number of treatment 
responders, and the number of participants who exhibit high- end state 
functioning (see Ehlers et al., 2003). Participants will be considered 
responders on a measure if they demonstrate at least a 20% improvement 
from pre- therapy levels (e.g., Ladouceur et al., 2000), and 
participants exhibiting high end- stage functioning will be defined as 
those with total CAPS scores at or below 30 and PHQ- 9 scores at or 
below 5. Chi- square analyses between treatment conditions will be 
conducted to compare the proportion within each condition meeting PTSD 
Adaptive Disclosure: A Combat- Specific PTSD Treatment  NHCP  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483315], Nancy; NMCSD PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483316], Shiva   CIP# NHCP.2010.[ADDRESS_621249]-
treatment and follow- up assessment. 
 
Secondary inferential analyses: The longitudinal nature of the design 
will produce a multilevel or nested data structure (Raudenbush & Bryk, 
2001; Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger, 1998). The lower level, or level- [ADDRESS_621250] of the repeated measures that will be collected for each 
individual at multiple time points (e.g., pre, post, follow- up, and 
session- by-session outcome data). The level- 1 data is nested within 
upper level, level- 2, or person- level variables (e.g., individual 
difference variables including treatment group membership, minority 
status, posttraumatic cognitions, etc.). This data structure is appropriate for contemporary growth curve modeling techniques (see 
Collins & Sayer, 2001; Singer & Willett, 2003). With these techniques 
(e.g., growth- curve analysis), we will be able to estimate initial 
status and change over time in the outcome variables (i.e., level- 1 or 
within-subjects component of the analyses), and examine how these 
coefficients vary as a function of individual difference variables (the level- 2 or between- participants component of the analyses; e.g., 
gender). In terms of measurement of specific aims: 
 
Primary Specific Aim 1: To determine whether or not AD is as least as 
effective as CPT- C in terms of change in psychological health problems 
over the treatment period. 
As mentioned above, we will chiefly be interested in the results of 
the non- inferiority tests. These results will show whether or not AD 
is as least as effective as CPT- C, in terms of its impact on 
deployment- related psychological health problems (specifically PTSD 
and depression).  
 
Primary Specific Aim 2: To determine whether or not AD is as least as 
effective as CPT- C in terms of change in military- relevant functioning 
over the treatment period. 
 The results will also show whether or not AD is as least as effective 
as CPT-C, in terms of its impact on functioning. 
  
Secondary Specific Aim 1: To compare the acceptability of AD and CPT-
C. 
    We will use an independent sample t test to compare the 
acceptability of the two treatments. 
 
Secondary Specific Aim 2: To compare the degree of change in grief and 
moral injury in the two treatments. 
    We will use a mixed model repeated measures ANOVA to determine 
whether the groups differ in terms of change in grief and moral injury 
over time. A mixed model analysis is advantageous because it uses all of the available data; no adjustment is needed for missing data. Also, 
a mixed model analysis does not require sphericity or compound 
symmetry.  
Secondary Specific Aim 3: To compare the degree of change in 
resilience and posttraumatic growth in the two treatments. 
Adaptive Disclosure: A Combat- Specific PTSD Treatment  NHCP  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483315], Nancy; NMCSD PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483316], Shiva   CIP# NHCP.2010.0177

 19 
     Analyses for this aim are similar to those described in Secondary 
Specific Aim 2.  
Secondary Specific Aim 4: To examine posttraumatic cognition as a 
mediator of treatment- related changes. 
We will use two methods to evaluate whether PTCI mediates the 
relationship between treatment and PTSD symptom severity.  The first 
method is the casual step approach (Baron & Kenny, 1986).  With this 
method, we hope to show that treatment predicts PTCI scores and PTCI 
scores predict PTSD symptom severity.  Also, we hope to show that the 
relationship between treatment and PTSD symptom severity score is 
reduced with the introduction of PTCI scores.  Because this method infers an indirect effect but does not test for it specifically, we 
will also employ a bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_124502]. Mplus will be used to 
generate [ADDRESS_621251]. Thus, there is no need to make an assumption 
about the shape of the sampling distribution (and the standard error 
of the indirect effect; Hayes, 2009), unlike the Sobel test (Sobel, 1982, 1986). 
 
Secondary Specific Aim 5: To complete a qualitative analysis of 
reactions to Adaptive Disclosure at the end of treatment  
 As part of the treatment protocol, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483343], if any, they attribute to it. We will use qualitative methodology to code these responses so that we may 
describe subjective reactions. 
 
6. Military Relevance / Operational Use, if any: 
 
As of spring 2009, more than 1.[ADDRESS_621252] served 
in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, with 37% having deployed at least 
twice. Findings from epi[INVESTIGATOR_483344] 10- 18% of combat troops experience deployment-
related psychological health problems, such as posttraumatic stress 
disorder, and rates of PTSD continue to increase as the wars continue. 
PTSD itself is impairing, but the burden of the disorder is heightened 
by [CONTACT_483363]- occurrence with other mental and physical health 
problems.  
The impact of PTSD does not stop with the affected service 
member.  Forty four percent of active duty military in the [LOCATION_003] have 
children under the age of eighteen. PTSD symptoms have a substantial 
impact on spousal well- being and the overall functioning of the 
family, leading to problems such as poor parenting, family violence, 
divorce, sexual problems, aggression, caregiver burden and child 
behavioral problems. PTSD also impacts the communities in which the 
service member lives. PTSD is associated with work impairment, including increased unemployment, missed work and work inefficiencies, 
homelessness, increased medical costs for treatment of PTSD and 
secondary problems. Thus, advancing research and clinical care for 
Adaptive Disclosure: A Combat- Specific PTSD Treatment  NHCP  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483315], Nancy; NMCSD PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483316], Shiva   CIP# NHCP.2010.[ADDRESS_621253] not 
been tested specifically on active- duty service members (or new 
veterans), their acceptance and feasibility with patients and care 
providers, and their efficacy all remain empi[INVESTIGATOR_483345]. In 
contrast, AD was developed from clinical experience and observations 
about the psychological, biological, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312], and social challenges that stem a wide variety of combat and operational experiences (such 
as grief, guilt and moral injury).  In our experience thus far, 
clinicians in our early demonstration project setting (Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton) have requested training in AD and greatly appreciate our manual, which has extensive information not only about 
the how- to’s but also the justification for the approach in terms of 
the phenomenology and unique clinical presentations of service members 
with combat and operational trauma.  Thus, AD holds the promise of not 
only helpi[INVESTIGATOR_483346] a model of care that can build 
confidence and self- efficacy among caregivers.  Because it is brief 
and culturally sensitive, AD may also be more attractive to service members, their leaders, and care- providers.  
 
E. APPLICATION TO USE HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
  1. Subject Population: 
 
Participants will be 266 active duty Marine Corps or Navy 
personnel. They will be referred to the study by [CONTACT_483382] (see Recruitment). Participating individuals must: (1) have experienced at least one traumatic event as defined by [CONTACT_2681]- IV during 
deployment during OIF, Operation New Dawn (OND), and/or OEF; (2) have 
current PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD with clinically significant 
distress/impairment and be able to recount the event that led to the 
PTSD symptoms; and (3) have received an initial mental evaluation from 
a military provider. 
 
The sample size of 266 was established based on the following sample 
size calculation. We used the Study Size program, Version 2.0.4 
(Olofsson, 2001- 2007) and a standard deviation of 25, based on Monson 
et al. (2008). If the true difference between AD and CPT is 0 points, 
Adaptive Disclosure: A Combat- Specific PTSD Treatment  NHCP  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483315], Nancy; NMCSD PI: [INVESTIGATOR_483316], Shiva   CIP# NHCP.2010.0177

 21 
 then we need 99.1 participants per group, or roughly 200 participants, 
to ensure that power=.80. Estimating an attrition rate of 
approximately 25%, we anticipate a need to recruit 266 (200/.75) 
participants to achieve an adequate sample. 
 
     Subject Inclusion Criteria: 
1. Age 18 or older 
2. Current PTSD as diagnosed by [CONTACT_483383] (at least meeting criteria A and B) with distress and/or functional 
impairment as determined by [CONTACT_483384]. Co- occurring disorders such as depression, anxiety, 
or treated substance abuse or dependence problems are permitted. 
3. Individuals expected to deploy two or more months from the time of referral and/or assessment are eligible. Anyone deploying 
sooner than that would be unable to complete the entire 
intervention and thus are ineligible. Potential enrollees need 
not be presently deployable. 
4. Prospective enrollees must be willing to commit to all treatment 
sessions and to complete assessment materials. 
 
      Subject Exclusion Criteria: 
1. Serious suicidality or homicidality that has required urgent or 
emergent evaluation or treatment within the past three months. 
2. A known, untreated substance abuse or dependence problem. 
Inclusion is possible if there is evidence that the individual 
has been afforded and is complying with treatment for the substance problem.
 Inclusion is possible if the treating 
clinician and study supervisor concur that participation is not 
contraindicated. 
3. Serious Axis I mental disorders (those that are normally 
incompatible with active military service), such as psychotic 
disorders or bipolar type I, are not eligible. 
4. Cognitive impairment that would interfere with one’s ability to 
complete the intervention. If a potential participant performs below the mildly impaired range on the neuropsychological battery, the study neuropsychologist ([CONTACT_483395]) will review 
the case and make a clinical judgment based on review of testing 
and, in some cases, additional evaluation as to ability to 
participate. 
5. Concurrent enrollment in any cognitive- behavioral treatment, 
group therapy, or any other treatment that involves systematic 
disclosure of troubling deployment- related memories. Participants 
can continue current pharmacological treatment, marital 
counseling, or any supportive therapy. 
6. People will be excluded if they received CPT in the past, unless a clinician believes that additional CPT could be clinically 
useful because of the amount of time that has passed, the number 
of sessions received or another circumstance. 
 
We expect sample demographics to approximately represent the 
demographic composition of the Marines at Camp Pendleton, which is 94% male, mostly Caucasian (66% white, 15% Hispanic, 8% black) and

   2. Protected Population (i.e., children, women of childbearing   
 age, and 3rd party subjects): 
 
 Women of childbearing age are eligible for participation as 
there is no risk based on this psychotherapeutic intervention to 
potential offspring. 
 Prisoners are eligible for participation provided that (a) consent was 
provided prior to incarceration, (b) continued participation is in the best 
interest of the participant based on the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_483347], 
(c) privacy can be provided for study activities, and (d) the participant 
demonstrates continued understanding of the voluntary nature of his/her 
participation and his/her rights as a research subject.  
    3. Method of Subject Indentification and Recruitment: 
This project will rely on referrals from Naval Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483332].  
We will meet regularly with clinic leadership to maintain support for the project. Mental health providers educated about the study in the 
following ways: (a)provide materials describing the nature of the 
intervention and the target population, (b) attend weekly staff 
meetings, (c) give talks to describe the interventions in staff grand 
rounds, and (d) provide feedback to staff about referred patients. If 
a mental health provider identifies a patient who may be eligible, 
he/she will briefly explain the nature of the study and ask for oral permission (based on the requested partial HIPAA waiver)to give the 
patient’s name [CONTACT_483393], who will then call the 
patient to explain the study in more detail and, if the patient is willing, to schedule a screening visit. 
 
       a.  Consent Process:  
This study will be conducted in compliance with Title [ADDRESS_621254] visit, prior 
to initiation of any study procedures, subjects will give their 
written consent to participate in the study after having been informed 
about the nature and purpose of the study, participation/termination 
conditions, risks, and potential benefits. 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the 
individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continuing 
throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the 
participants. Consent forms describing in detail the intervention, 
study procedures and risks are given to the participant and written 
documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting the 
intervention. Upon reviewing the document, the investigator will 
explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. The participants will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the 
study. The participants will have sufficient opportunity to discuss 
the study and process the information in the consent process prior to agreeing to participate. The participants may withdraw consent at any

portion of the assessment interview. 
 
   4. Experimental Procedure(s): 
 
AD is an experimental psychotherapy. CPT is a well established 
psychotherapy for PTSD, but its use in active duty Marines and Sailors 
remains experimental. 
 
   5. Research Material Collected: 
 
Research materials consist of assessments, questionnaires and 
audio recordings of therapy sessions. 
 
   6. Protection of Patient Privacy: 
 
Patient confidentiality will be maintained through the assignment 
of patient identification numbers. These numbers will be used in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_418795]. The key linking identification numbers to identifying information will be kept in a locked cabinet 
separate from other study data. All hard copy research materials will 
be securely transported by [CONTACT_483385][INVESTIGATOR_483348]. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_483349] a locked office with keys available only to research personnel participating directly in this protocol. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_483350], or 
transported using Federal Express oranother service that adequately 
tracks shipments to the [LOCATION_011] site for data entry and analysis. Electronic data will be managed with all current security provisions. 
Patients will be informed during the consent process about the limits of confidentiality. 
 
  7. Risks: 
 
The risks or discomforts which are possibly related to 
participation in this study are as follows: the interview questions, questionnaires, and discussions during psychotherapy may produce discomfort or anxiety from the discussion of personal or emotional 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].  
Individuals who are part of a vulnerable population may feel 
additional pressure to comply with study procedures based on their 
status.

 9. Justification of Risks:  
 
Preliminary evidence suggests that AD may be useful for reducing 
distress in this sample, and CPT- C is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_483351]. Some patients may also feel that they are making a useful 
contribution by [CONTACT_483386]- related symptoms. 
There is benefit to the Marine Corps and to society in evaluating 
the efficacy of this intervention, which has the potential to be a better PTSD intervention for military trauma. 
We believe that the benefits from this study outweigh its risks. 
 
  10. Minimization of Risks:  
 
The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253729] 24- hour access (via cell phone or pager) 
to [CONTACT_483396] and [CONTACT_241877] or a designated clinical supervisor in case of any clinical emergencies. Any potential serious adverse events will 
be immediately reported to the principal investigators. All serious 
(i.e., severe and undesirable event with significant symptoms or more 
serious), unexpected (i.e., not anticipated based on the literature 
and as discussed in the MSP and/or consent forms) adverse events 
(AEs), regardless of their relationship to study treatment or 
procedure (causality), and those SAEs judged to be associated with the 
study treatment or procedure must be reported to the DSMB, IRBs and 
the Army’s Human Research Protections Office (HRPO). All life-
threatening SAEs or lethal reactions must be reported regardless of 
attribution. 
Subjects will be informed about all potential study risks during 
the informed consent process. They will be informed that they can refuse to answer any question or terminate their assessments at any 
time if they so desire. The assessors and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483352]/or other distress during assessments or treatment and will 
be under the supervision of senior clinicians. 
The risk associated with treatment- related discomfort is 
mitigated because patients can titrate the way in which they talk about the trauma and the activities in which they engage. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483353]. Subjects 
can contact [CONTACT_32932][INVESTIGATOR_483354]. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s contact [CONTACT_483387]. Subjects will also 
have 24- hour access to mental health services at Naval Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_483355].  
There may be a concern that study participation would delay 
subjects from seeking other forms of treatment for their symptoms. 
First, pros and cons of available treatment options will be reviewed during the initial evaluation, so potential participants will have 
chosen to participate will full knowledge of their other options. 
Second, there is reason to believe that AD will be a potent 
intervention for these conditions based on preliminary data and the 
efficacy of CPT- C has been established for PTSD. Third, if at any time

appropriate. 
Consistent with consent being a process, individuals who are part 
of a vulnerable population will be reminded that the terms of the 
consent form are unchanged based on their new status and that 
participation/non- participation has no bearing on legal proceedings.  
For prisoners, an individual will be identified in the detention 
facility in the event that safety monitoring becomes indicated. 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be created as an 
independent body charged with ensuring that the safety of study 
subjects is protected and that the scientific goals of the study are 
being met. To support those purposes, the DSMB will review the initial 
protocol and any proposed amendments, perform expedited monitoring of all serious adverse events, perform ongoing monitoring of drop- outs 
and non- serious adverse events, determine whether study procedures 
should be changed or the study should be halted for reasons related to 
the safety of study subjects, and perform periodic review of the 
completeness and validity of data to be used for analysis of safety 
and efficacy. The DSMB will also ensure subject privacy and research data confidentiality. A statistical penalty will not be assessed for 
the ongoing unblinded review of safety by [CONTACT_4318]. Unblinded data 
will not be released to the investigators unless necessary for safety 
reasons.

SUPPLEMENT: Power Calculation and Data Analysis Plan  
 Sample s ize. Our initial sample size was planned for 266. Due to unanticipated and 
uncontrollable delays, we established an interim analysis plan with our DSMB to determine 
whether additional accrual would likely change the results. On this basis, the study was halted prior to achieving the intended sample size .  
Data analysis plan: Non -inferiority . To assess NI, we examined the predicted difference 
in mean change between AD and CPT -C. If the 95% confi dence interval (CI) around the estimate 
does not contain the NI margin, we can reject the null hypothesis (that AD is inferior to CPT) and accept the research hypothesis (that AD is non -inferior to CPT -C). The NI margin for CAPS -
IV scores was established a priori , based on a calculation of a reliable difference from baseline 
to posttreatment  CAPS -IV scores from a previous trial ( 10 points ). The margins for other 
outcomes were generated using the Reliable Change Index (RCI). Although the RCI threshold for CA PS-IV in this trial was 22 points; we adhere d to the pre -specified 10- point differential as a 
more conservative NI test.   
We conducted linear regression analyses ( SAS Software version 9.4) to predict the 
effects of treatment on mean change score (at a one- tailed 0.05 alpha) , controll ing for the 
influences of baseline scores. W e also controlled for time (days) since the start of the trial. 
Although the study was powered for pre - to posttreatment  change, we conducted exploratory 
analyses of the available fol low-up data.  
Because a significant proportion of participants did not complete the posttreatment 
evaluation, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results. The sensitivity analyses varied slightly for each outcome. For  the CAPS -IV, the first analysis 
multiply imputed CAPS -IV scores based on the last recorded PCL -M score of each participant 
that attended at least half of the therapy sessions. The second analysis also used PCL -M scores, 
employing a series of preemptive im putations of all missing within treatment PCL -M scores. In 
the third analysis, multiple imputation was used to simulate posttreatment CAPS -IV scores based 
on a rational set of baseline covariates (age, race, CEQ scores, highest level of education, and 
baseline CAPS -IV scores). The above analyses were contingent upon the Missing -At-Random 
assumption. Because there is no definitive way to determine the cause of missing data, we 
interrogated potential differences between completers and non- completers and found that 
completers in the CPT -C arm had lower mean baseline CAPS -IV scores than non- completers (72 
vs. 81, Cohen’s d = .49). This led us to perform a fourth imputation analysis under the Missing -
Not-At-Random assumption; we  imputed conditional posttreatment CAPS -IV scores for the 
CPT-C arm to reflect the higher propensity for dropout given higher baseline scores by 
[CONTACT_483390].  
Data analysis plan: Describing the clinical significance of the results . To benchmark the 
clinical significance of the primary endpoint, consistent with recent PTSD trials of service members, we categorized the clinical significance of change scores and end -point state for each 
participant  in each arm. P articipants that exceeded the RCI threshold (>  22-point  change ) were 
categorized as “improved.” Participants who exceeded the RCI and whose posttreatment  
endpoint score was two SD below the mean baseline score for the trial were categorized as 
“recovered ”. If individuals’ change di d not exceed the RCI, they were categorized as “no -

VERSION HISTORY
Version 4.0, 17 January 2017
Changes to the protocol are summarised below:
Protocol Synopsis (Study site(s) and number of patients planned) and Section 9.3 
(Study timetable and end of study): The estimated date of last patient completed has been 
updated considering the extension of recruitment timelines.
List of abbreviations and definition of terms: Updated to include the acronym DKA 
(Diabetic ketoacidosis)
Section 3.2 (Exclusion criteria): Exclusion criteria number 39 has been updated to include 
rapid or short acting insulin. 
Although the inclusion criteria number 05 has clearly been stating that ‘Long acting or 
intermediate acting insulin and mixed insulins are permitted’ which means that rapid or short acting insulin were not allowed - this change to the exclusion criteria was made to 
provide more clarity about the exclusion of these types of insulin.
Section [IP_ADDRESS]: This new section has been added to include information about the reporting 
and adjudication of diabetic ketoacidosis events in the study.

Date 17 January 2017
Sections 3.1 and 3.2 (Inclusion/Exclusion criteria): 
!HbA1c has been removed from V3 and the eGFR criterion modified, to facilitate 
randomization into the study 
!Exclusion criteria no. 24 has been introduced in order to exclude patients with rapid 
worsening of renal function (as part of the modified eGFR criterion).
!Exclusion criteria no. 47 (48, in the current version), has been modified to allow re-enrolment (one single time), provided that the patient had previously not been 
randomized in the study.
Sections 3.8 (Restrictions) and 5.11 (Volume of blood): Blood volume has been updated 
(reduced by 2 mL to 61 mL) due to removal of HbA1c testing at Visit 3.
8.5.1 (Analysis of the primary variable (s)): This section is updated, to include a 
sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of baseline (continuous) eGFR on the results 
obtained in primary analysis.  This will be assessed by [CONTACT_1121] a single term for baseline eGFR to the primary analysis model.
Section 9.2 (Monitoring of the study): Deleted the text related to withdrawal of informed 
consent for biological samples, as it is not applicable in the study .

Changes to the protocol are summarised below:
Protocol Synopsis (Study site(s) and number of patients planned), Sections 1.2 
(Rationale for study design, doses and control groups) and 1.4 (Study design): 
Additional sites and country/ies are considered to be included in the study, in order to meet 
the recruitment targets.  Hence, the number of sites is updated and the regions are mentioned in place of country names to avoid multiple updates to protocol due to addition of countries in future. 
Protocol Synopsis, Sections 2.3 and 2.4 (Safety and Exploratory Objectives): These 
sections of the protocol have been updated to clarify the objectives and definitions of 
outcomes, and to correct the typographical error of the term ‘albuminuria’.
Protocol Synopsis (Statistical Methods): Eliminated unnecessary wording.
Table of contents : 
!The heading of section 6.3.7 (Hy’s Law) has been deleted, hence the numbers of 
subsequent sections are modified accordingly, and the table of contents is updated.

new clinical study protocol template that has been used for authoring this document. 
Appendix A (Signatures) of the previous edition of protocol is no longer part of the 
appendices.
List of abbreviations and definition of terms: Updated to reflect the addition or deletion 
of terminologies and to rearrange the list alphabetically.
Section 1.3 (Benefit/risk and ethical assessment): Updated the section to include the 
potential risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and the action required to be taken from the investigator if any patients present with signs and symptoms consistent with diabetic 
ketoacidosis.
Section 3.1 (Inclusion criteria): The upper limit of BMI range has been increased to 45 
kg/m
2, to enhance recruitment into the study.  The medical team cannot see any risk by 
[CONTACT_813262] 45 kg/m2.
Sections 3.2 (Exclusion criteria) and 7.7 (Concomitant and other treatments): 
!The investigator’s judgement may differ from the local guidelines on the metformin 
dose range for moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 – 59 mL/minute/1.73m2, 
MDRD formula), hence the criterion (#37) and text related to restrictions on 
metformin in section 7.7 are modified by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] ‘or’ to allow this difference.
!Criterion #[ADDRESS_1126102] is an exclusion criterion.
Section 3.3 (Patient enrolment and randomization): In #3, section numbers are updated 
(Section 3.1 and 3.2) to provide reference to the specific sections (3.1 and 3.2).
Sections 3.10 (Criteria for withdrawal) and 9.2 (Monitoring of the study): Lost to 
follow-up, has been added as one of the withdrawal criteria  
An additional point is included under Section 9.[ADDRESS_1126103] to follow up.  
Section 4 (Table 1: Study plan and timing of procedures): 
!Day [ADDRESS_1126104].  This change (day numbers) is cascaded to the 
subsequent visits.
!The section numbers are updated in the table, due to the deletion of heading of 
section 6.3.7 (Hy’s Law)
!In the footnote ‘c’, ‘must’ has been changed to ‘should’ – to emphasise on the 
timing of visit.CCI

Sections 4.2.1 (Visit 2, Start of lead-in), 5.1 (Efficacy assessments) and [IP_ADDRESS] (Self-
monitored FPG and hypoglycemic events): The sample specimen has been corrected to 
state ‘blood glucose’ instead of ‘fasting plasma glucose’ – as the patients are instructed to 
measure the blood glucose whenever they have symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia –hypolgycemia symptoms need not always occur at fasting state.
Section 4.4 (Follow-up period, Visit 9):   The typographical error related to study period 
has been corrected from ‘treatment’ to ‘follow up’.
Section 5.2.1 (Laboratory safety assessments), Table 3: Deleted ‘U-Hb/Erythrocytes’ –
as dipstick for blood would be sufficient to confirm haematuria.
Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Hepatic events (Hepatic Adjudication Committee)): Corrected the 
inconsistency in limits of AST, ALT and TB, with other sections and deleted the reference to Appendix D (Algorithm on Management of Sustained Elevated Liver Safety 
Abnormalities.)
Section 6.3.7 (Hy’s Law): Deleted the text referring to Hy’s law, as it is not applicable for 
the study.
Section 7.7 (Concomitant and other treatments): The trade name ‘Victoza’ for liraglutide 
has been removed as it was non-relevant. The procedure for dose reduction of oral antidiabetics and insulin, and continued participation in the study following the dose 
reduction has been clarified.

14 (101)ratio to receive dapagliflozin [ADDRESS_1126107], dosage and mode of administration
! Dapagliflozin 10 mg will be administered orally once daily during the 24-week
double-blind treatment period
Comparator, dosage and mode of administration
! Matching placebo for dapagliflozin 10 mg will be administered orally once daily 
during the 4-week single-blind placebo lead-in period and the 24-week double-blind 
treatment period 
Other treatments
! Oral Anti-diabetic Drugs (OADs) except SGLT2 inhibitors, insulin, anti-
hypertensive drugs, lipid lowering drugs and anti-platelet drugs are allowed during 
the study and the dose should be kept constant throughout the entire 24-week
double-blind treatment period
! Patients may receive open-label rescue medication added on to, but not as a 
replacement for their current study drug regimen. Rescue medication in this protocol refers to any approved, appropriate anti-diabetic agent, except SGLT2 
inhibitors, for which there is either initiation or upward titration, in accordance with the approved label and conventional standards of care
Statistical methods
The sample size for this study was selected to be consistent with the research hypotheses.  The 
study has a single primary endpoint for which the overall probability of a Type 1 error (Family-wise error rate) will be strictly controlled at no more than 0.05.  The sample size for 
this study is governed by [CONTACT_813263]; namely, for the change from baseline in HbA1c.  Significance levels are expressed in terms of two-sided alternatives; however, all tests in practice will be 
performed against one-sided alternatives using one-half the significance levels reported here. 
From post-hoc results of similar clinical studies (Study MB102029, Study D1690C00018, and 
Study D1690C00019) when patients meeting eGFR entry criteria like those in this current 
study were selected, the mean placebo-corrected change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 
weeks of treatment for the current study is estimated to be -0.3% for dapagliflozin [ADDRESS_1126108] a treatment difference over placebo in change from baseline 
HbA1c at Week 24 of -0.3% with high statistical power (80%).  Given patients will be 
randomized with equal probability to dapagliflozin or placebo, it follows that 286 patients (143 per group) will provide 80% power to detect a difference in average placebo-corrected 
change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 of  -0.3% ( T = -0.3%) at a (two-sided) 
significance level =0.05.  If 5% of randomized patients fail to qualify for inclusion in the full

15 (101)analysis set due to missing baseline and/or all post-randomization values for this primary 
endpoint, then a total of [ADDRESS_1126109] deviation (SD) of 0.9% in change from baseline HbA1c this 
sample size provides 80% power to detect a placebo-corrected difference in average change from baseline in HbA1c between dapagliflozin and placebo at a (two-sided) significance level 
of 0.05.  If the primary comparison in mean change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24 does 
not achieve statistical significance at an unadjusted alpha level of 0.05, then secondary comparisons will not be performed.  Otherwise, secondary endpoint comparisons between 
dapagliflozin and placebo will be performed at an unadjusted alpha (Type I error) level of 
0.05, with a sequential testing procedure of secondary endpoints used to control the alpha level for multiplicity.
A sample size of 143 evaluable patients per treatment group (dapagliflozin and placebo) 
provides 75 percent assurance that a statistically significant difference between dapagliflozin and placebo in mean change from baseline to Week 24 in HbA1c will be observed for the 
primary study endpoint.
The primary endpoint of changes from baseline to Week 24 will be evaluated using a mixed 
effects model with repeated measures (MMRM). 
Changes from baseline to Week 24 in the secondary study endpoints (total body weight, FPG, 
and seated SBP) will be separately evaluated using MMRM.  
A sequential testing procedure will be employed in comparisons of primary and secondary 
efficacy parameters.  The ratio of the difference in LSM estimates (dapagliflozin versus 
placebo) to the corresponding standard error (e.g., the test statistic) will be tested first for the primary endpoint (HbA1c) at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.  If statistical significance is 
achieved and the difference indicates the dapagliflozin group experienced greater 
improvement in the primary endpoint at Week [ADDRESS_1126110].

24 (101)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Dapagliflozin (Forxiga®) is a stable, reversible, highly selective, and orally active inhibitor of 
human renal sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), the major transporter responsible for 
renal glucose reabsorption in the kidney ( Maranghi et al 2015 ).  Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of 
action results in the direct and insulin-independent elimination of glucose by [CONTACT_8212].  Traditionally, the presence of glucose in the urine has been seen as a sign of poor glycemic 
control and, thus, something to be avoided. Familial renal glucosuria in humans, however, due 
to genetic mutations that reduce the function of SGLT2, is associated with life-long glucosuria that is generally asymptomatic ( Santer et al 2010 ).  Results from nonclinical- and clinical 
studies have shown that dapagliflozin can be used to promote urinary excretion of glucose as a 
safe and effective method of reducing blood glucose levels ( Plosker et al 2014 ). 
Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action reduces plasma glucose regardless of the patient’s 
insulin sensitivity and W-cell secretory function.  Because this mechanism is independent of 
insulin secretion or insulin action, this approach to anti-diabetic therapy provides an opportunity to achieve clinically important glycemic efficacy with a comparatively low risk of 
hypoglycemia.  This insulin-independent mechanism is also potentially applicable to a broad 
spectrum of patients.  In addition, the excretion of glucose may promote weight loss or prevent weight gain, as a consequence of calorie loss, a potential benefit for many patients 
with T2DM ( Maranghi et al 2015 ).
The dapagliflozin clinical development program was designed to demonstrate the safety and 
efficacy of dapagliflozin in a wide range of patients with T2DM.  The program included both 
placebo-controlled and active comparator studies in drug-naïve patients at an early stage of 
disease and patients who require additional therapy after failure to reach adequate glycemic control with their current regimen.  Dapagliflozin’s pharmacodynamic effect of glucosuria is 
detected almost immediately (within [ADDRESS_1126119]-dose), is maintained through 2 years of 
treatment, and results in reductions in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Post-prandial Glucose (PPG), and HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin).  Treatment with dapagliflozin, with its unique 
mechanism of action, results in a persistent loss of glucose with associated calories in the 
urine, resulting in a consistent and maintained reduction of the total body weight, in addition to the improved glycemic control ( Bolinder et al 2014 ).  The weight loss is predominantly a 
result of a reduction in fat mass, visceral adipose tissue, and subcutaneous adipose tissue in 
T2DM.  Dapagliflozin also has a mild diuretic effect, which in combination with weight loss, has the potential to reduce blood pressure (BP). 
Diabetic patients with moderate renal impairment are of interest because diabetic nephropathy 
affects approximately 30% of patients with diabetes ( Sheen et al 2014 ).  In the Unites States, 
for instance, about 20% of individuals with diabetes have an eGFR lower than 60 
ml/min/1.73m
2(chronic kidney disease, CKD stage M3).  As diabetic patients progress from 
normal to diminished renal function over the natural history of their disease, there is a medical need for safe and effective oral anti-diabetic therapy.  Several existing anti-diabetic agents are

25 (101)contraindicated in this population, are associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia, or have 
not been adequately studied in these patients ( SDCD 2014 ).  Safety and efficacy data in 
patients with normal, mildly, and moderately impaired renal function have been collected in previous studies in the dapagliflozin development program.
Notably, dapagliflozin’s ability to inhibit renal glucose reabsorption declines with decreasing 
eGFR.  Urinary glucose excretion is about 50% lower in patients with T2DM treated with dapagliflozin having CKD stage 3, as compared with patients with normal or mildly impaired 
renal function.  Such eGFR dependence is expected given the fall in filtered glucose load with 
worsening CKD stage.  In a previous study, dapagliflozin did not have a significant impact on glycemic control in patients with more advanced CKD, although there was a modest decrease 
in HbA1c and FPG in patients with a GFR of 45–59 ml/min ( Kohan et al 2014 ). However, that 
study suffered from several limitations.  The use of insulin-based regimens in almost two-thirds of patients, often with sliding scale administration, made accurate capture of insulin 
dosing difficult.  Unmeasured differential behaviour with respect to sliding scale and other 
adjustments of insulin between placebo and dapagliflozin could have blunted the apparent efficacy of dapagliflozin.  A second limitation was the relatively small size of the study, which 
was powered for a 0.6% change in HbA1c, and therefore limited in its ability to demonstrate 
smaller glycemic effects and thus, the study may be considered underpowered and subject to type [ADDRESS_1126120] been shown to be safe and effective in T2DM patients with 
moderate renal impairment lending support to further studies in this specific patient segment 
(Yale et al 2013 , Barnett et al 2014 ).

defined as HbA1c M7.0% and S11%, and moderate renal impairment (eGFR 45 to 59 
ml/min/1.73 m2).  SGLT2-inhibition has been shown to improve glycaeimic control in T2DM 
patients with renal impairment.  Based on these results, it is anticipated that after [ADDRESS_1126122] dapagliflozin dose for treatment of T2DM (10 mg dapagliflozin once daily) has been selected for this study and is expected to provide 
efficacy in reducing hyperglycemia while mitigating the potential for AEs, based on previous 
clinical experience. In addition to improved glycemic control in patient treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg, it is anticipated that a decrease in body weight and BP will provide 
additional benefit to the patients. 
This is a confirmatory, phase III, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-
controlled, multi-national, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of

26 (101)dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage 3A (eGFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73 
m2). Patients will be randomized to 24 weeks’ treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching 
placebo. The study will be an international multi-centre study at approximately 100 centres from countries across North America and European regions.  It is planned to randomize a total 
of 302 patients (151 patients per treatment arm).  The study is powered to detect a change of 
0.3% in HbA1c between active treatment and placebo following [ADDRESS_1126123] inadequate glycemic control on their existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  This double-blind 
randomized phase III study requires a placebo group to determine efficacy of dapagliflozin in a specific patient segment in order to discriminate effects caused by [CONTACT_813264].  All patients in the study are protected from harm by [CONTACT_813265], which call for withdrawal from the study if the patient shows evidence of inadequately controlled disease. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_094]-enrolment anti-hyperglycemic therapy 
(long/intermediate-acting and mixed insulin regimen, metformin-based regimen, sulfonylurea (SU)-based regimen, thiazolidinedione (TZD)-based regimen, and other regimen). Any 
patients on metformin treatment need to have a dose suitable according to local guidelines or 
investigator’s judgement for the full CKD 3 segment (i.e., eGFR 30 - 60 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_1126124] formula).
The study consists of 2-week screening period, a 4-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, a 
24-week double-blind placebo-controlled treatment period, and a 3-week follow-up (FU) period.  The study drug is taken once daily in the morning.
The main efficacy assessments will be performed at regular intervals and will include HbA1c, 
weight, FPG, seated BP and heart rate. During the double-blind treatment period, HbA1c and urinary glucose values will be blinded to the Investigator and to 
the Sponsor.  These values will be provided to the Investigator after the study has been 
completed.  FPG value will be reported as an un-blinded value throughout the study.
The main safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals and will include physical 
examination, vital signs, renal function (change in eGFR), safety laboratory test, and AE 
monitoring.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
Risk category
Dapagliflozin has global market approval and has been administered to thousands of T2DM 
patients globally.  Details regarding potential risks associated with administration of 
dapagliflozin once daily are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.
Considering dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action, the previous clinical experience with 
dapagliflozin, the study’s design features (including the inclusion, exclusion, and CCI

27 (101)discontinuation criteria), and the planned safety procedures, participation in this study presents 
a minimal, and thus acceptable, risk to the individual patients that will be included.
Potential risks
Inhibition of SGLT2 results in increased urinary glucose excretions, which is commonly 
believed to increase the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs).  In some of the global Phase III 
studies, events of UTI were reported in a slightly higher proportion of dapagliflozin-treated 
patients than the placebo group.  Increased urinary glucose excretion may also lead to an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_377566].  In global Phase III studies, the proportions of 
patients treated with dapagliflozin who reported AEs that matched a predefined list of Medical 
dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) preferred terms that were indicative of genital infection were higher than those seen for placebo.
Based on the mechanism of action of dapagliflozin and results of animal and clinical studies, 
there may be a potential risk for this compound to cause hypovolaemia or electrolyte imbalance.  As a precaution, patients who, in the judgment of the Investigator, may be at risk 
for dehydration or volume depletion due to co-existing conditions or concomitant 
medications, such as loop diuretics, should have careful monitoring of their volume status.  In patients already receiving dapagliflozin who develop conditions that may cause hypovolaemia 
or electrolyte imbalance, decisions to interrupt or discontinue dapagliflozin therapy and 
management of patients should be based on clinical judgment.
Higher proportions of patients with marked laboratory abnormalities of hyperphosphatemia 
were reported in dapagliflozin vs. placebo but the clinical meaning of this is unclear.
Hepatic laboratory markers were assessed in all the clinical studies with dapagliflozin.  In the 
pooled analyses, the proportion of patients with elevated liver function tests was similar in the 
dapagliflozin and comparator groups and no clinically meaningful or consistent mean changes 
from baseline in liver function tests were observed in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups across the Phase IIb and III clinical studies.  One patient had a SAE reported as drug-induced 
acute hepatitis that was later diagnosed as most comparable with autoimmune hepatitis.
There have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis 
(DKA), in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus taking dapagliflozin and other 
SGLT2 inhibitors, although a causal relationship has not been established. Dapagliflozin is not 
indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Patients treated with dapagliflozin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with 
ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and shortness of breath, 
should be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinuation or temporary interruption of 
dapagliflozin should be considered and the patient should be promptly evaluated.
Predisposing factors to ketoacidosis include a low beta-cell function reserve resulting from 
pancreatic disorders (eg, type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), insulin

28 (101)dose reduction, reduced caloric intake, or increased insulin requirements due to infections, 
illness or surgery and alcohol abuse. Dapagliflozin should be used with caution in these 
patients.
No study procedure will put patients at a risk beyond those ordinarily encountered during the 
performance of routine medical examinations or routine tests.
Protection against risks
This study has been designed with appropriate measures in place so as to monitor and 
minimize any of the potential health risks to participating patients.  In order to ensure the 
safety of all patients participating in this study, [COMPANY_008] will conduct a real-time review of 
all safety information from all ongoing clinical dapagliflozin studies as they become available.  Safety signal detection will include the integration of all available sources of safety 
information, including clinical study data, AE reports, pre-clinical data, epi[INVESTIGATOR_377569], to identify and characterize unrecognized safety risks or changes in those which are currently expected Adverse Drug Reactions.  Any information that may 
affect the benefit-risk profile of dapagliflozin will be immediately communicated to relevant 
Health Authorities and appropriate actions will be taken regarding the clinical program as needed.  Thus real-time, active safety surveillance will be conducted during the entire duration 
of this study.  In addition, all dapagliflozin studies are subject to a carefully designed patient 
risk management plan that includes the temporary and if necessary permanent discontinuation of investigational product (IP) in individual patients in whom a potential health risk or a 
laboratory abnormality of clinical concern has been identified.
Potential benefits to patients
All patients will receive counselling on dietary and life-style modifications.  Global phase II 
and phase III studies have established the effect of dapagliflozin therapy.  This phase III study 
will evaluate these effects of dapagliflozin in T2DM patients with moderate renal impairment 
(CKD3A).  In this study, the dose of dapagliflozin (10 mg) was chosen to provide efficacy in 
reducing hyperglycemia while mitigating the risk for AEs, based on previous clinical 
experience.  In addition, dapagliflozin is expected to help decrease body weight (or prevent 
weight gain) as well as help lower BP especially in patients with elevated baseline BP.  Patients are also expected to receive some benefit in the form of increased medical 
care/attention when participating in study procedures, which includes at least [ADDRESS_1126125].

29 (101)Conclusion
Considering the pre-clinical and clinical experience with dapagliflozin and the precautions 
included in the study protocol, participation in this study presents a minimal and thus 
acceptable risk to patients who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and consent to take part in the study. 
1.4 Study Design 
This is a confirmatory, phase III, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-
controlled, multi-national, multi-centre study to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of 
dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD stage 3A.  The study consists of 2-week screening period, a 4-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, a 24-week double-blind 
placebo-controlled treatment period, and a 3-week follow-up period.  Patients will be 
randomized to 24 weeks treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo after the placebo lead-in period.  The study will be an international multi-centre study at approximately 
100 centres from countries across North America and European regions.
The study comprises of 9 visits: enrolment visit (Visit 1), Start of lead-in (Visit 2), Lead-in 
(Visit 3), randomization visit (Visit 4), Treatment period (Visit 5-7), end of treatment visit 
(Visit 8), and a follow-up visit (Visit 9). For details on timing of visits, see Figure 1 below.

At Visit 1, all potentially eligible patients will provide informed consent, undergo screening 
for HbA1c, eGFR level and other applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria. Visit 1, can be 
completed over multiple visits, provided all procedures have been completed, with the results 
reviewed, prior to Visit 2.  Patients at risk for volume depletion due to co-existing conditions or concomitant medications, such as loop diuretics should have careful monitoring of their 
volume status.  At Visit 2 (start of lead-in), patients will be examined for HbA1c, and eGFR

eGFR value is within the range of 40-65 mL/min/1.73 m2(MDRD-formula), patients will 
enter a 4-week single-blind placebo lead-in period. Blood samples will be collected for standard lab values (and eGFR level).  At Visit 2 and Visit 3, eGFR will be measured.  At 
Visit 4, patients who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, including the 
eGFR value within the range of 45-59mL/min/1.[ADDRESS_1126126] lab values (from Visit 2) will be randomized to the 24 weeks double-blind 
treatment period.  The dose of Oral Anti-diabetic Drugs (OADs), insulin, anti-hypertensive 
drugs, lipid lowering drugs and anti-platelet drugs should be kept constant throughout the entire 24-week treatment period.  At randomization, patients will be stratified according to 
pre-enrolment anti-hyperglycemic therapy.
After either completion of the treatment period or discontinuation from treatment, patients will 
enter a 3 weeks safety follow-up period without study drug.  At the follow-up visit (Visit 9 
(FU)) any changes in physical signs, renal function (i.e., changes in eGFR), symptoms or 
laboratory parameters that may be related to dapagliflozin will be evaluated.  The total planned study duration from Visit 1 to the safety follow-up (Visit 9) will be 33 weeks.

Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled patients see Section 3.4.
3.3 Patient enrolment and randomization
Investigator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patient who entered pre-
study screening.
The Investigator(s) will:1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient before any study specific 
procedures are performed.  Patient is considered enrolled in the study after she/he 
has signed the informed consent form (ICF).
3. Determine patient eligibility. See Section 3.1and 3.[ADDRESS_1126133] the 
IVRS/IWRS in order that lead-in medication can be assigned and dispensed.CCI

40 (101)Patient who does not meet the eligibility criteria is considered as screen failure in the study.  
These patients will be terminated from the study and registered as Screen Failure by [CONTACT_813266]/IWRS. See section 3.10.1 .
Patients entering the double-blind treatment period
Following completion of the single-blind lead-in period, patients eligible for double-blind 
treatment will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms by [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS in a 
1:1 ratio (dapagliflozin 10 mg: matching placebo) using a randomization schedule.
If a patient discontinues/withdraws from the study, then his/her enrolment/randomization code 
cannot be reused.
3.[ADDRESS_1126134] be withdrawn from the study.
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomized in error, or 
incorrectly started on treatment, the following steps to be taken: 
(a) The Investigator or monitor should inform the [COMPANY_008] study physician
immediately, ensuring patient safety must always be the number one priority.
(b) Study Treatment must be discontinued in all cases where continued treatment is 
deemed to pose a safety risk to the patient.  A discussion should occur between the 
[COMPANY_008] study physician and the investigator, a decision may be reached whether to continue or discontinue the patient from study treatment.  The 
[COMPANY_008] study physician must ensure all decisions are appropriately 
documented.  
(c) In those cases where continuation of study therapy is judged not to present a 
concern related to safety and disease management, the rationale for continuing 
study therapy must be clearly documented.  The patient should continue follow up in accordance with defined study procedures.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization codes will be generated to ensure approximate balance (1:1) between the two treatment arms (dapagliflozin 10 mg or matching placebo, once daily).CCI
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin
Study Code D1690C00024Version 4.0
Date 17 January 2017
41 (101)Randomization will be done via IVRS/IWRS at Visit 4.  The IVRS/IWRS will allocate 
randomization codes sequentially through central randomization as patients become eligible 
for randomization. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_094]-enrolment anti-hyperglycemic therapy.  The following 
5 strata will be defined:
1. Insulin-based regimen: Patients receiving insulin alone or in combination with any 
other anti-hyperglycemic medication
2. Metformin-based regimen: Patients receiving metformin alone or in combination 
with any other anti-hyperglycemic medication except insulin
3. SU-based regimen: Patients receiving a SU alone or in combination with any other 
anti-hyperglycemic medication except insulin and metformin
4. TZD-based regimen: Patients receiving a TZD alone or in combination with any 
other anti-hyperglycemic medication except insulin, metformin, or a SU
5. Other regimen: Patients receiving either any anti-hyperglycemic medication(s) not 
described by [CONTACT_1534] 1-4, or no background anti-hyperglycemic medication.
For each patient randomized the IVRS/IWRS will provide the investigator with a unique Kit 
ID number matching the treatment arm assigned to the patient.  Following randomization, the 
first dose of study drug will be administered to the patient after completion of study visit procedures.  At randomization and subsequent dispensing visit the patient should always be 
provided medication with the Kit ID(s) allocated by [CONTACT_21926]/IWRS.  If a patient receives the 
incorrect randomized treatment at any time during the study, the centre must immediately notify the [COMPANY_008] representative and IVRS/IWRS contact [CONTACT_813267].
3.[ADDRESS_1126135] Research Organization (CRO) handling data will be aware of the placebo treatment 
during this period.
The study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion.  The dapagliflozin [ADDRESS_1126136] access to the randomization scheme, with the exception of [COMPANY_008] personnel generating the

will remain blinded past the 24-week randomized treatment period.
The treatment codes and results will be kept strictly within [COMPANY_008] to safeguard the 
integrity of the blind of the investigators and patients, and hence to minimize any possible bias 
in data handling.
3.7 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized
patient, will be available to the Investigator(s) or pharmacists from the IVRS/IWRS. Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be provided to each centre.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomization.  The Investigator documents and reports the action to [COMPANY_008], without revealing the treatment 
given to patient to the [COMPANY_008] staff.
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to 
regulatory authorities.  Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data 
until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual patient have been made and documented.
3.8 Restrictions
! All patients will visit the clinic fasting in the morning (except for Visits 1 and 5),
between 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.
! Patients will be instructed to abstain from all food and beverages for 8 hours prior 
to each clinic visit (except for Visits 1 and 5). Drinking water is allowed
! Patients should not drink alcohol within 24 hours prior to each visit and should not 
use tobacco/nicotine within 12 hours prior to each visit
! Patients should bring all their medications and IP to the site
! Anti-hypertensive medication can be taken with a glass of water after completion of 
BP and body weight measurements
! Medications including IP should be taken after visit samples and examinations have

If a patient arrives for a visit without having followed the above instructions, the entire visit 
should be rescheduled (within the allowed time-window, if possible).
As up to approximately 61 mL of blood will be drawn from each patient during the entire 
duration of the clinical study (excluding extra blood samples taken at unscheduled, specialized 
liver/liver discontinuation visits, serum pregnancy test), patients should be instructed to 
abstain from donating any blood during the clinical study and for [ADDRESS_1126137]
Patients may be discontinued from IP in the following situations:
! Patient decision. The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment. Patients who choose to discontinue study treatment 
are expected to continue in the study until the end of the study
! AEs, ie, any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness which, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued participation in the study is not 
in the best interest of the patient
! Severe non-compliance with the study protocol as judged by [CONTACT_1755]/or 
[COMPANY_008]
! Pregnancy
! Incorrectly enrolled patients (see Section 3.4)
! Lost to FU, patient fails to return for study visits and cannot be reached with 
reasonable, repeated attempts.
! Termination of the study by [CONTACT_38227].

Discontinuation guidelines for protocol-defined major hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_149764].  The assessment of a 
single finger stick or laboratory glucose value should not be the sole assessment used to 
determine patient discontinuation for hypoglycemia.
Clinical indications for discontinuation because of hypoglycemia may include the following:
! Multiple occasions of epi[INVESTIGATOR_149765], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], indicate that continued treatment with study therapy is not in the best 
interest of the patient.  This includes, but is not limited to:
 Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia (e.g., sweating, shakiness, 
increased heart rate, confusion, dizziness, light-headedness, or hunger) in 
the absence of environmental factors known to contribute to 
hypoglycemia (i.e., excess physical activity, concurrent illness, or missed 
or delayed meal) and/or
 Documented finger stick glucose values <54 mg/dL (<3.0 mmol/L). 
! A patient may also be discontinued from the study because of severe hypoglycemia, 
as determined by [CONTACT_737].
Discontinuation Guidelines for Acute Renal Insufficiency or Worsened Chronic Renal 
Insufficiency
For patients with signs of deteriorating renal function, additional monitoring needs to be 
conducted.  Any patients with a calculated eGFR<30 mL/minute/1.73m2will be scheduled for 
a re-test within 4 days whenever possible.  The eGFR is calculated based on the re-expressed abbreviated (four-variable) MDRD Study equation, using central laboratory measurements of sCr. [eGFR (mL/min/1.73m
2) = 175 x (standardized sCr)-1.154x (Age)-0.203x (0.742 if female) 
x (1.212 if Black)] [Note: sCr reported in mg/dL]
If, at the re-test, the eGFR M30 mL/minute/1.73m2, the patient can resume normal visit 
schedule.

45 (101)If, at the re-test, the eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73m2, the patient should be discontinued from IP 
and the patient’s renal function should continue to be monitored according to the judgment of the Investigator.
3.9.2 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from IP
A patient that decides to discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the 
presence of any AEs.  Diaries and all study drugs should be returned by [CONTACT_102].
All patients who discontinue study drug will be asked to remain in the study for FU and 
complete all scheduled study visits through Week 27.  At the time of discontinuation the 
Week 24 procedures will be performed.  Patients will not receive double-blind study drug 
during this follow-up period (and use of SGLT2-inhibitors should be restricted), but will complete all scheduled study visits and procedures.  Patients unable or unwilling to return for 
scheduled visits as part of follow-up will have the opportunity to receive follow-up via 
telephone calls placed by [CONTACT_813268].  The only exception to this procedure is when a patient withdraws consent for all study procedures 
or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the 
treatment of either a psychiatric or physical illness).
If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10.
3.[ADDRESS_1126141] the reason for study 
withdrawal recorded as ‘Eligibility criteria not fulfilled’ (i.e., patient does not meet the required inclusion/exclusion criteria).  This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for 
screen failures (not randomized patients).  Patients can be re-enrolled one single time, but they 
cannot be re-randomized.
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment.
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AE the reason for withdrawal must be entered on the appropriate electronic case report 
form (eCRF) page.  If possible, they will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_39595](s).  The 
Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study.  The patient will return diaries and all study drugs. 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomization 
code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.

throughout the study.  Every effort will be made to ensure that the patient continues to return to the clinic for study visits and to avoid “lost to follow-up” during the conduct of the study. 
The study staff should make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_813269], patient’s health professionals, and any other means that comply with country and local laws and regulations.  After the first missed visit, patients who 
are considered temporarily lost to follow-up will have [ADDRESS_1126143] patients
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], study patients are placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that:
! meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414] 
! are assessed as causally related to study drug 
! are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRF.  All reasons for discontinuation of treatment 
must be documented.
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests.

[IP_ADDRESS] Rescue Medication Due to Lack of Glycemic Control in the Treatment Period
Patients with lack of glycemic control during the 24-week treatment period may be eligible to 
receive open-label rescue medication in addition to their blinded treatment in order to treat 
ongoing hyperglycemia. Patients may receive open-label rescue medication added on to, but 
not as a replacement for, their current study drug regimen. Rescue medication in this protocol refers to any approved, appropriate anti-diabetic agent, except SGLT2-inhibitors, for which 
there is either initiation or upward titration, in accordance with the approved label and CCI

56 (101)conventional standards of care. Open-label rescue medication is to be titrated as needed to 
obtain adequate glycemic control. Patients who received a first rescue medication, who 
subsequently fulfil lack of glycemic control criteria, may have other rescue medications added or substituted, according to Investigator judgment.
During the 24-week double-blind treatment period, all rescue decisions will be based on 
central laboratory FPG and confirmatory FPG results.  If patients meet the protocol-specified glycemic criteria based on FPG, they will be recommended for open-label rescue medication.
Between scheduled visits, the patients will be asked to check their blood glucose if they 
develop symptoms suggestive of hyperglycemia.  The sections and tables listed below define the lack of glycemic control criteria.  Glucometers will be provided by [CONTACT_38227].  The 
patients will receive instructions for the use of the glucometer according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_483608] a hyperglycemic event in order to schedule an extra visit for central laboratory FPG and if 
needed, a confirmatory, repeat FPG.
Patients in the follow-up phase will not need to adhere to the protocol defined rescue criteria, 
and may have their anti-diabetic regimen adjusted at the Investigator’s discretion.
The sections and tables listed below define the lack of glycemic control criteria for initiation 
of open-label rescue medication.
Protocol-Defined Lack of Glycemic Control Criteria for Initiation of Open-Label Rescue 
Medication
Pre-specified glycemic criteria (see Table 2 below), based upon central laboratory FPG and 
confirmatory, repeat FPG, have been established during the 24-week double-blind treatment period, from Week 4 and up to Week 24 visits, to determine eligibility for open-label rescue medication initiation/titration.
Table 2 Lack of Glycemic Control Criteria for Initiation of Open-Label Rescue 
Medication
Visit Label Central Laboratory FPG
From Week 4 (Visit 6) to Week 12 (Visit 7) 
(excluding Week 12)FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L)
From Week 12 (Visit 7) to Week 24 (Visit 8) 
(excluding Week 24)FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)
Patients with a central laboratory FPG value meeting the lack of glycemic control criterion at 
a pre-specified visit will be scheduled for a follow-up visit (within 3 - 5 days) to obtain a 
second central laboratory FPG value and review the patient’s glucose meter readings.  If the repeat central laboratory FPG value still meets the criterion, the patient will receive rescue 
medication.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin
Study Code D1690C00024Version 4.0
Date 17 January 2017
57 (101)Irrespective of study visit number, patients who meet rescue criteria in the treatment period 
must first complete the Week 24 visit procedures before receipt of open-label anti-diabetic 
rescue medication to ensure that important study endpoint measurements are collected.
Following completion of the Week 24 “Rescue” visit, rescued patients will be administered 
open-label rescue medication in addition to their blinded study drug.  Rescued patients will 
then continue in the treatment period according to their original visit schedule.  Patients who received a first open-label anti-diabetic rescue medication, who subsequently fulfill lack of 
glycemic control criteria described in the Table [ADDRESS_1126150] other rescue medications 
added or substituted, according to Investigator judgment, without repetition of rescue visits.
Patients with a central laboratory FPG value >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) at Week 24 (Visit 8), 
will not be considered as rescued for efficacy analysis.
Guidelines with regard to changes in insulin dose
Each patient’s baseline insulin therapy should remain unchanged wherever possible 
throughout the double-blind treatment period.  The stable insulin regimen aims to continue 
insulin as it was being used by [CONTACT_813272]-in, with no changes to 
insulin type and with as few changes in insulin dosage as possible.  A stable insulin regimen is pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], because it makes it possible for the study to measure any differences in glycemic 
control between the dapagliflozin treatment arm and the matching placebo arm.  Down-
titration of insulin will be allowed only as necessary to prevent low blood glucose or hypoglycemia. During the double-blind treatment period, a few patients will experience poor 
glycemic control, as measured by [CONTACT_813273]. When glucose measurements exceed certain limits (as specified in Table 2
above), the patient will be ‘‘rescued’’. 
During the double-blind treatment period, if up-titration of insulin dose is >10% (lasting more 
than 7 consecutive days) in comparison to the mean daily insulin dose at baseline, the patient shall be handled as administration of anti-diabetic rescue medication (i.e., the patient must 
complete the Week 24 visit procedures, as outlined in section 4.3.5 ) and the patient will 
continue in the treatment period according to their original visit schedule.  Patients must record the daily dose of insulin in the diary provided (minimum of 80% of days with a value) 
and review any changes in insulin doses with their investigator, either at regularly scheduled 
visits, or via telephone calls between visits.  Patients required to be rescued, shall be called for an unscheduled visit within 5 days, to complete the Week 24 procedures.
Any insulin dose changes (even if more than ±10% of the mean daily insulin dose at baseline) 
is not considered as an up or down titration as long the insulin dose change is not for a period of more than 7 consecutive days.  For example, dose changes due to known changes in 
physical activity or food intake will not be registered as up or down titration as long as the 
insulin dose is back to the previous dose after the change.  Similarly, if insulin requirement has increased temporarily, e.g., due to an infection, it will not be considered an up-titration 
even if the insulin dose increase is more than 10% of the baseline mean daily insulin dose, as

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is prevalent among diabetic women, and is associated with pyuria in 70% of cases.  Neither guidelines from the US ( Nicolle et al 2005 , USPSTF 2008 ) nor 
Europe ( EAU 2014 ) recommend screening for, or treatment of, asymptomatic bacteriuria in 
non-pregnant diabetic patients.  In this study, the central laboratory will report urinary dipstick test results for hemoglobin but will not routinely report the results of urinary dipstick tests for 
leukocyte esterase as a screening test for pyuria in surveillance urine examinations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Microscopic Hematuria
In the event that hematuria is observed during a patient’s participation, the sponsors 
recommend standard of care in diagnosing the cause of the hematuria.  This section presents 
references and an example of standard of care evaluation of microscopic hematuria.  Local 
standards of care should be followed.
Patients with repeated reports of microscopic hematuria in [ADDRESS_1126156] of care.  The American 
Urological Association defines microscopic hematuria as three or more red blood cells per high-power microscopic field in urinary sediment from two or more properly collected 
urinalysis specimens ( AUA , Grossfeld et al 2001 ).  These Best Practice guidelines have been 
evaluated by [CONTACT_377628] a study of 772000 patients ( Jung et al 2011 ).
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Dapagliflozin
Study Code D1690C00024Version 4.0
Date 17 January 2017
67 (101)Patients who show microscopic hematuria that is accompanied by [CONTACT_377629], red 
blood cell casts, or dysmorphic red blood cells in the sediment should be evaluated for the 
presence of primary renal disease and need to be referred to a nephrologist ( AUA , Grossfeld 
et al 2001 ).
Patients who lack other explanation for their hematuria, or who have risk factors for 
significant urologic disease, will need a urological evaluation and should be referred to an urologist.  Risk factors for significant urological disease include unexplained microscopic 
hematuria as well as smoking history, occupational exposure to dyes or chemicals (such as 
benzenes or aromatic amines), visible hematuria, age >40 years, previous urologic history, history of irritative voiding symptoms, history of UTI, analgesics or phenacetin abuse, history 
of pelvic irradiation, or cyclophosphamide use ( AUA , Greenwood M 1926 ).  Results from any 
procedure or investigations should be reported on the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Volume Depletion
The risk of electrolyte abnormalities, volume depletion, and impaired renal function is 
enhanced when two diuretics are used in combination.  For this reason, caution should be 
exercised when administering dapagliflozin, which has a modest diuretic effect, to patients who are taking loop diuretics.  These patients should have careful monitoring of electrolytes, 
volume status, and renal function.  Loop diuretic dose adjustments should be made if 
clinically indicated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Potential events of Diabetic Ketoacidosis
All potential events of DKA will be recorded in the eCRF and submitted to an independent 
DKA Adjudication Committee. The DKA Committee T2DM will assess available 
information on each potential DKA event and will classify the event in accordance with the definitions in the DKA Adjudication Charter T2DM. 
The DKA Adjudication Committee will be kept blinded to the study drug treatment received 
by [CONTACT_377631] a potential DKA event in the clinical study. A separate DKA Adjudication Manual will define and describe the procedures for the collection of DKA 
information, handling, adjudication criteria and reporting of these events/cases.

The Principal Investigator (PI) ensures that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance 
with the Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (materials 
containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), 
see Appendix B ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials are not shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the patient unless agreed with [COMPANY_008] and appropriate 
labelling, shipment and containment provisions are approved.
5.10 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_813257] (where appropriate) and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
[COMPANY_008] keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of 
study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers.
5.11 Volume of blood
The total volume of blood that will be drawn for each patient in this study is listed in the Table

Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) [ADDRESS_1126157].  An undesirable medical condition can be 
symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal 
results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or 
washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., lead-in, treatment, washout, FU), that 
fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
!Results in death
!Is immediately life-threatening
!Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574] 
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions
!Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
!Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study 
Protocol (CSP).

6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
AEs will be collected from the start of the placebo lead-in period throughout the treatment 
period (Visit 2 to 8) and including the follow-up period (Visit 9).
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent is obtained until the end of the study 
(Visit 9).
6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last AE assessment visit in the study are followed 
up by [CONTACT_96770], but without further recording in the 
CRF.  [COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.

71 (101)! Date of death
! Autopsy performed
! Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)
! Description of AE.
Maximum intensity will be graded according to the following rating scale:
! Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
! Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
! Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the CSP.
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_377630]: “Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked?”, or revealed by [CONTACT_692990].  When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other 
signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.

If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low Hb value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
Pre-defined liver enzyme elevations will undergo adjudication.  The definitions of the events 
to be adjudicated are provided in the Hepatic Adjudication Manual.  For all events identified for adjudication, the Investigator will complete the appropriate eCRF pages and provide 
source documentation as detailed in the Hepatic Adjudication Manual. See also Section

the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within 1 
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar 
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel inform [COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_377632]-up

6.5 Overdose
Overdose is defined as more than 100 mg of dapagliflozin per day.  Dapagliflozin has been well tolerated at doses of up to 500 mg per day in single dose testing in healthy volunteers and 
up to 100 mg per day in repeat dose testing for 14 days in healthy volunteers and patients with 
T2DM.  If an overdose is suspected, monitoring of vital functions as well as treatment as appropriate should be performed
! An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on 
the relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.
! An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF 
module.
If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the 
Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives 
immediately, or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.

of study drug ( M70% and S130%) during the lead-in period. For patients with compliance 
between M70% and < 80% or > 120% and S130%, the Investigator should ensure that there are 
no systematic factors which may result in unacceptable compliance with study drug during the 
treatment period of the study.  Such cases should be discussed with the study physician prior to randomization.  During double-blind treatment period, patients judged to be non compliant 
(defined as taking less than 80% or more than 120% of the prescribed dose of study drug) may 
continue in the study, but should be counselled on the importance of taking their study medication and applicable concomitant medications as prescribed.

The study drug provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol.
The study personnel will account for all study drugs dispensed to and returned from the 
patient.
The investigator is responsible for making sure:
! That the IP is handled and stored safely and properly (see Section 7.4).
! That the IP is only dispensed to study patients in accordance with this protocol.
Patients should return all unused IP and empty containers to the investigator.
At the termination of the Clinical Study or at the request of [COMPANY_008], the investigator will 
either return any unused IP to [COMPANY_008] or its designate, or destroy IP at the site depending 
on local regulations.  If the IP is destroyed at site, the site personnel will account for all unused IP and for appropriate destruction.  If the IP is returned to [COMPANY_008] or its 
designate, the study site personnel or the [COMPANY_008] monitor will account for all received IP 
received at the site, unused IP and for appropriate destruction.  Certificates of delivery, destruction and return should be signed and archived.
7.7 Concomitant and other treatments 
Changes in concomitant medication should be avoided during study participation, with the exception of situations defined in this protocol, but medication, which is considered necessary for the patient’s safety and well-being, may be given at the discretion of the investigators, who
must decide if the patient should remain in study or need to be dismissed from study due to 
patient’s safety or interference with study objectives.
The administration of all medication must be recorded in the appropriate sections of the 
electronic CRF.  The specific type of medication (trade or generic name), the indication for 
use, dosages, and the dates of usage should be reported.
After having completed or discontinued the study, patients will receive usual care and anti-
diabetic agents according to the investigator's judgment and according to local medical 
practice.

Guidelines with regard to standard of care and other therapy
During the duration of the study period, standard of care for each patient should be kept 
unchanged to the largest extent as possible, according to the judgment of the Investigator.  
Specifically, the dose of OADs, insulin, anti-hypertensive drugs, lipid lowering drugs and 
anti-platelet drugs should be kept constant throughout the entire 24-week treatment period.
If dose of OADs and insulin is reduced according to the investigator discretion, patient should 
still continue in the study with double blind treatment and the dose changes must be recorded 
in the appropriate sections of the electronic CRF.
7.7.1 Other concomitant treatment
Other medication other than that described above, which is considered necessary for the 
patient’s safety and well being, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded

83 (101)8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
Unless otherwise specified, analyses of efficacy endpoints will only include measurements 
prior to the administration of rescue medication.
8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s)
The primary endpoint is the changes from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24. The primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint will be based on a mixed effects model with repeated 
measures (MMRM) using ‘direct likelihood’, including patients in the Full Analysis Set who have a baseline measurement and at least one post-baseline measurement. The primary 
analysis will only include measurements prior to the administration of rescue medication. 
Measurements made following rescue administration will not be included in analysis. 
The SAS procedure PROC MIXED will be used for the primary analysis. The primary 
analysis model will include the fixed categorical effects of treatment, week, randomization 
stratification factor (i.e. anti-diabetic treatment strata) and treatment-by-week interaction as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline measurement and baseline measurement-
by-week interaction. An unstructured matrix for the within-patient error variance-covariance 
will be used. The denominator degrees of freedom will be calculated according to the Kenward-Roger method. A number of back-up models will be defined in the statistical 
analysis plan in case of non-convergence of the preferred model or other issues. Point 
estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the mean change within each treatment group as well as the difference in mean change between the dapagliflozin and placebo will be 
calculated. P-value of the differences in week [ADDRESS_1126173] the treatmentCCI

84 (101)groups, additional sensitivity analyses, including those based on alternative missing data 
assumptions, may be performed.
8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)
A sequential testing procedure will be employed among the primary endpoint and secondary 
endpoints in order to control the type I error rate at the 0.[ADDRESS_1126174] for the primary endpoint is significant, in 
which case the secondary endpoints will be tested in the order that they appear in the objectives section of the protocol synopsis. Statistical tests will be only performed for a given 
secondary endpoint if all previous sequential tests for that comparison between dapagliflozin 
and placebo are also significant. Otherwise, the testing procedure will stop at the secondary endpoint that does not reach statistical significance. 
The secondary endpoints, i.e, percent change from baseline in total body weight (using 
logarithmic transformation) at Week 24, change from baseline in FPG at Week 24, change from baseline in seated SBP at Week 24, and percent change from baseline in total body 
weight (using logarithmic transformation) at Week 24, will be analyzed using a MMRM, 
similar to the one used for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. 
 
MRM analysis will performed on the difference between natural 
logarithmically transformed values at end of treatment and at baseline, and will include terms for treatment, week, and the interaction between treatment and week, as well as the log-
transformed baseline value and the interaction between week and log-baseline value. 
8.5.3 Subgroup analysis 
As part of the exploratory objectives, subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint and key 
secondary endpoints (percent change from baseline in body weight at Week 24 and change 
from baseline in seated SBP) will be performed for the following subgroups:
! Baseline HbA1c #8.5%, #7.5% and <8.5%, and <7.5%,
! Baseline BMI <25 kg/m
2, and #65 yrs
Additionally, subgroup analyses of the primary endpoints may be performed for the following 
subgroups. Further details will be provided in the SAP.   
! Race of Black or African American, White, Asian, Other
! Age of <65, and #65 yrs
! Gender of Male, Female
! Anti-diabetic therapy of long/intermediate-acting and mixed insulin regimen, SU-
based regimen, TZD-based regimen, metformin-based regimen and other regimenCCI

8.5.6 Exploratory analysis 
Exploratory analysis on continuous exploratory endpoints will be evaluated using a MMRM, 
similar to the one used for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.  Exploratory 
subgroup analysis will include additional covariates and interaction terms for the subgroup variables.
Exploratory analyses of variables that represent proportions of patients will be performed 
using the logistic regression with adjustment for randomization strata and baseline 
measurement.
Exploratory analyses of time-to-event variables will be performed using Kaplan-Meier plots 
accompanied by a tabular summary.
8.5.7 Analysis of safety variables
Safety analyses will be performed using descriptive statistics. Dichotomous safety variables 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_813277]. Categorical safety variables will be separately summarized by [CONTACT_813278]. Continuous 
safety variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_53846].  Comparisons 
between dapagliflozin 10 mg and matching placebo will not be made for safety variables, and inferential testing will not be performed.CCI

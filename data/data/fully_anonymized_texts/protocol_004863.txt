INTRODUCTION
Background
There are two pathways by [CONTACT_448339]:  air conduction and bone conduction. In air conduction ,an acoustic 
signal travels through the outer and middle ear and arrives at the cochlea. In bone conduction, an acoustic 
signal by[CONTACT_448340]/middle ear and vibrates the bones of the skull to stimulate the cochlea. Both air 
and bone conduction support the same conversion mechanism in the cochlea where mecha nical vibrations 
are converted into neural impulses to produce the perception of hearing.
Thus, for patients who are unable to reliably transmit acoustic signals through air conduction, 
e.g., those with 
conductive hearing losses (CHL) or mixed hearing losses (MHL), hearing loss following a middle ear disease 
(e.g., chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis or other ossicular diseases) ,or malformations such as 
aural atresia and/or microtia, bone conduction hearing systems can be sued to by[CONTACT_448341], and stimulating the cochlea directly via skull bone vibrations . For 
single -sided deafness (SSD), one utilizes the vibrations that are transmitted in the same manner via the skull 
bone to the (functioning) c ochlea on the contralateral side .
Bone Anchored Hearing Systems (BAHS) have been used since the late 1970s and can bedivided into two 
types: 1) direct drive and 2) skin drive. Direct drive denotes systems where the vibrations are transmitted 
directly to the bone (e.g. ,through an abutment connected to an osseo -integrated implant), while in a skin 
drive solution there is a layer of soft tissue between the transducer and the bone (e.g. ,when utilizing a 
softband ). 
A softband solution, in this investigation, the Ponto Softband solution is suitable for children with 
conductive/mixed hearing loss and single -sided deafness. It can also be used by [CONTACT_448342]’t benefit 
from conventional hearing aids, or those who have temporary ear problems such as blockages or infections. 
Worn around the head, with an attachment for Ponto Sound Processor, the softband comes in assorted
colors , is adjustable for a snug and tailored fit . 
IDENTIFICA TION AND DE SCRIPTION OF THE DEV ICE
Device description
The Ponto Softband device is part of a skin-drive bone conduction, wherein a Ponto sound processor is 
attached to the band which allows for circumlocution of the function of the outer and middle ear. Acoustic 
sound pressure waves are pi[INVESTIGATOR_448336] (vibrations) by [CONTACT_448343] . This signal is 
then transmitted through the skin to the temporal bone of the 
skull The mechanical energy vibrates the 
temporal bones of the skull which are pi[INVESTIGATOR_448337]. 
The survey will focus on Softband 5 but will also allow for feedback from parents whose children previously 
or currently use any of the Softband generation models:

Ponto Softband bilateral (initial CE 2017)
Softband 5 (initial CE 2022)
Parents whose children have been fitted with a Ponto sound processor on a Ponto Softband will be surveyed . 
The study will focus on devices from the followin g Ponto families:
Ponto 3, Ponto 3 Power, Ponto 3 SuperPower
Ponto 4
Ponto [ADDRESS_570578] is children below the age of 18 who are currently wearing a softband coupled 
to a Ponto sound processor. Parents or primary caregivers will be the surveyed population. 
The softband solution is intended for children with conductive/mixed hearing loss and single -sided deafness
who cannot be fitted or are waiting to be fitted with a surgically placed bone anchored hearing implant . It 
can often be recommended for individuals who do not benefit from conventional hearing aids who have ear 
problems such as blockages or infections , who present with a high likelihood of implant extrusions or skin 
care related burdens or who have thin or irregular skull bone (i.e. syndromic children).
JUSTIFICA TION FOR THE INVESTIGA TION
The study is a non-interventional, observational, study on users of Ponto sound processors who use their 
sound processors on a softband solution. The purpose of this study is to assess subjective benefit by 
[CONTACT_448344] a Ponto Softband in pediatric users . 
This study will utilize responses from survey questions of parents or primary caregivers of children fitted with 
a softband solution. The survey will collect responses relating to reported hearing improvements and quality 
of life. 
The study will use the PEACH questionnaire1to evaluate performance . The PEACH is a measure used by 
[CONTACT_448345] a child’s use of hearing in real-world  
environments. PEACH is validated with norms scale (English). This study will also use the GCBI questionnaire2, 
modified to specifically query a child’s quality of life after receiving their Ponto sound processor on softband.  
Additionally, a specialized questionnaire is constructed to gather feedback on wear and general comfort of 
Oticon Medical Softband. 
RISKS A ND BENEFITS OF THE INVESTIGA TIONAL DEVICE A ND CLINICAL INVESTIGA TION
Participants will be asked to complete a survey. No additional treatments or procedures will be utilized for 
this study. Therefore, only risks associated to data capture and data privacy have been identified and these

Although participants included in this study might not receive any benefit from the study itself , the research 
project will promote a better understanding of satisfaction of the Ponto Softband solution which will be 
shared within the field of BAHS and may lead to improvements in future iterations of the oftband design . 
Prior to enrollment into the study the participants will receive information about potential benefits and risks. 
Electronically signed consent based on this information will be required from all participants prior to 
collecting any study specific data.

Ponto sound processors on softband who have expressed interest in assisting recruitment efforts may also 
be included in reach out efforts. Interested clinics will be provided with a one-page informational flyer to 
provide to parents of children who meet the inclusion criteria. The flyer will have the same information as 
the social media postings as well as emails sent to the u sers in the Salesforce database. 
9.2.1 Survey s
PEACH
The Parent’s Evaluation of Aural/Oral Performance of Children (PEACH) was developed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of amplification for infants and children with hearing impairment by a systematic use of 
parents’ observations. The PEACH questionnaire is com posed of 13 questions that examines a child’s auditory 
performance in quiet and noisy listening conditions and has been shown to have good internal consistency 
and high test- retest reliability. The PEACH can be used with infants as young as one month old a nd with 
school -aged children who have hearing loss ranging from mild to profound degree .

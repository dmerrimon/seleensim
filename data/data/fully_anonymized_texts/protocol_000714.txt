 Study title:  
A long-term safety and efficacy study of CD5789 50 µg/g cream in subjects with acne vulgaris 
 
Short Title:  
CD5789 Long Term Study (LTS) on acne vulgaris 
 
Study Phase: 
Phase [ADDRESS_1179788] Number:  
2014-001755-23 
 
IND Number: 
111091 
 
Treatment Indication: 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_848506] (IGA/PGA score 3) acn e vulgaris 
 
Study Population 
Subjects age 9+ years old, male and female 
 
Background and Rationale: 
Acne vulgaris  is the most common skin disease, affecting almost [ADDRESS_1179789] serious adverse effects on psychosocial 
development, resulting in emotional problems, withd rawal from society, and depression. 
Truncal (back and chest) acne has been estimated to  occur in over half the number of acne 
patients even if facial acne is the most common and  often the most visible form of acne. In one 
study of patients referred to a dermatology clinic revealed that more than [ADDRESS_1179790] coexistent truncal i nvolvement. 
Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory disease affec ting pi[INVESTIGATOR_154486].  
Both clinically and pathophysiologically, truncal a cne and facial acne are similar in terms of 
specific lesions (eg closed comedones, open comedon es, papules and pustules etc.). Further, the 
management of truncal acne vulgaris warrants an app roach similar to what is used for the 
treatment of facial acne.  
Several Proof of Concept studies have shown that CD 5789 formulated in gel and creams at 
various concentrations (25, 50 and 100 µg/g) was ef fective in reducing inflammatory, non-
inflammatory and thus total lesion counts within 4 to 8 weeks of topi[INVESTIGATOR_848507] R&D

 with moderate acne vulgaris of the face in comparis on to its placebo. This was confirmed by 
[CONTACT_431]’ and subjects’ assessments. 
A recent Phase 2 study evaluated three doses of CD5 789 cream (25 µg/g, 50 µg/g, and 100 µg/g) 
in subjects with moderate and severe acne. The stud y concluded that CD5789 at 25 µg/g 
represents the minimally effective dose. CD5789 50 µg/g, and 100 µg/g were both determined to 
be efficacious with only a modest efficacy advantag e in favor of the higher dose.  
For safety, a dose response trend was observed in t he overall summary of adverse events (AEs), 
with CD5789 100µg/g reporting the highest event rat e of any adverse event, related adverse 
events, related adverse events leading to study wit hdrawal. Overall and for all categories of AEs, 
CD5789 50 µg/g had an AE profile that was comparabl e to vehicle control and notably better 
than CD5789 100 µg/g. The superior safety and local  tolerability profile of CD5789 50 µg/g 
cream led to the choice of this dose for carrying f orward to Phase 3 in this indication. 
The local tolerability profile of CD5789 was also d ose dependent and followed the usual pattern 
whereby [CONTACT_848509] 1 and gradually decreased over the succeeding weeks. In 
comparative terms, CD5789 50 µg/g was generally bet ter tolerated than tazarotene 1% gel for 
most of the parameters assessed, whereas CD5789 100  µg/g was either comparable or less well 
tolerated than tazarotene 1% gel. 
Although both doses of 50 µg/g and 100 µg/g of CD57 89 provide a positive benefit risk ratio in 
the treatment of acne vulgaris, the superior safety  and local tolerability profile of CD5789 
50 µg/g cream argues in favour of carrying forwards  this dose in Phase 3. 
 
Study Objectives  
This study objectives are to determine the safety a nd efficacy of CD5789 50µg/g cream in the 
long-term treatment (up to 52 Weeks) of subjects wi th acne vulgaris. Efficacy will be evaluated 
as a secondary objective. 
 
Study Design 
Multi-center, open-label, non-comparative safety an d efficacy study with up to [ADDRESS_1179791] y the study drugs once daily in the evening to 
the Face and to the Trunk (except for children betw een [ADDRESS_1179792] 
moderate acne on the trunk at Baseline, it is up to  the investigators to decide if these 9 to 11 
years old subjects should be treated or not for tru ncal acne).

 From Week 12 to Week 52/ET visits, subject will app ly the study drug according to the IGA and 
PGA assessment as follow:  
 
IGA 
Facial acne  PGA 
Truncal acne  Study Treatment regimen 
[ADDRESS_1179793] moderate acne 
on the trunk at Baseline (i.e. who do not have PGA of 3, at least [ADDRESS_1179794] 20 non-inflammatory lesions on t he trunk): 
In this case, it is up to the investigators to deci de if these 9 to 11 years old subjects should be 
treated or not for truncal acne. In these subjects,  treatment can be started (based on investigator’s 
decision) even if e.g. PGA=1, or the subject has le ss than 20 inflammatory lesions on the trunk 
and/or less than 20 non-inflammatory lesions on the  trunk). These subjects will not be assessed 
for efficacy, but they will be assessed for safety and local tolerability. 
In any case the subject should continue in the stud y until the Week [ADDRESS_1179795] experiences an acne flare or a local 
tolerability issue that may need to reintroduce or to adapt the study treatment regimen.

Investigators will evaluate the facial acne at pred etermined visits (see table 1) according 
to the following scale. 
 
Investigator’s Global Assessment Scale (IGA)  
[ADDRESS_1179808] Clear  A few scattered comedones and a few small papules.  
2 Mild  Easily recognizable; less than half the surface is involved. Some 
comedones and some papules and pustules. 
3 Moderate  More than half of the surface is involved. Many com edones, papules and 
pustules. One nodule may be present. 
4 Severe  Entire surface is involved. Covered with comedones,  numerous papules 
and pustules.  Few nodules may be present.

pustules. One nodule may be present. 
4 Severe  
 Entire surface is involved. Covered with comedones,  numerous papules and

Other Assessments 
• Lesion counts on the face and on the trunk at Scree ning and Baseline visit  
• DLQI and C-DLQI at each time point,  
• PK data 
In selected sites only, a PK assessment will be per formed only in [ADDRESS_1179812] agreed in the parents/guardian ICF and Assent form to have a PK sample taken.  At week 4, 
the application will be done on site  at this specific day at any time. One single blood  sample will 
be collected 4 hours (± 10 min) after on-site study  drug application.  
 
Principal Statistical Methods 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed  as a separate document. The SAP will 
contain a more detailed and technical description o f specific data conventions, calculations and 
of statistical procedures for executing the analyse s that are specified in the sections of the clinica l 
trial protocol below.  
The SAP will be finalized prior to Database Lock. 
Any changes to the statistical analyses decided aft er the Database Lock should be justified and 
documented in the clinical trial report. 
 
Sample Size 
 
This study was designed to ensure that at least 300  subjects will be exposed to CD5789 50µg/g cream fo r 
6 months, and 100 subjects exposed for 1 year.

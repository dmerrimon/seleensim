Study Protocol  52 
  53 
Study Overview : This study will involve a randomized waitlist control design to in vestigate the [ADDRESS_798632] -drug-session, and magnetic resonance 59 
imaging (MRI) of the brain a t baseline and post -drug-session to assess the effects of psilocybin [ADDRESS_798633] one week. 65 
Acute physiological, subjective, and behavioral effects will be assessed during and at the end of 66 
sessions (e.g., ratings completed by s ession monitors and questionnaire measures of subjective 67 
effects completed by [CONTACT_4317]), consistent with our well -established psilocybin session [ADDRESS_798634] experimental drug session, each participant will be administered a 69 
moderate dos e of psilocybin (20 mg/70 kg), but one that we do not expect to have full [ADDRESS_798635] session. If the study team decides that the 75 
participant can safely be administered the higher dose, then the participant will be given 30 76 
mg/70 kg psilocybin during the second session. If the decision is made that the participant might 77 
clinically benefi t from another session but not the high dose, the participant will receive 20 78 
mg/70 kg psilocybin on the second session, with the dose determined by [CONTACT_603096] 79 
the study team.   80 
  81 
Depressive symptoms will be assessed during visits at our rese arch unit (the Behavioral  82 
Pharmacology Research Unit, or BPRU), at baseline and repeatedly after each session. [ADDRESS_798636] Control Condition : After screening and enrollment, participants will be randomized to an 86 
immediate treatment group or a delayed treatment group (waitlist control condition). Participants 87 
in the delayed treatment group will wait 8 weeks after enrol lment before beginning the study 88 
interventions and neuroimaging assessments. As a safety precaution, participants in the 89 
delayed treatment group will be assessed weekly via telephone calls or in -person visits during 90 
the wait period (i.e., telephone assessm ents during post -randomization weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 91 
7; in-person assessments during post -randomization weeks 5 and 8) to assess depressive 92 
symptoms and suicide risk to determine if intervention is warranted (as described in more detail 93 
in the section " Steps taken to minimize risk."  94 
MRI Assessment : MRI measures will be collected for all 24 participants at two timepoints: 1. [ADDRESS_798637] treatment intervention; and 2. one week after the 96 
second psilocybin session. Only partic ipants who successfully complete the initial MRI 97

103  We anticipate the following approximate timeline for study participation:  
104    
105 Screening and  Preparation   
106 Visits 1 -2 (BPRU): Medical and psychological screening; cognitive testing; initial 107 
 depressive symptom measures. Randomization to immediate or delayed 108 
 treatment groups will occur at the end of Visit 2.  
109    
110 Telephone and in -person safety assessments for delayed treatment group:  As a 
safety  
111 precaution, participants in the delayed treatment group will be assessed weekly  
112 via telephone calls or in -person visits during the 8 -week wait period (i.e.,  
[ADDRESS_798639] -randomization weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7; 
in114  person assessments during post -randomization weeks 5 and 8) to assess  
115 depressive symptoms and suicide risk. For clarity in describing the study  
116 procedures, none of these safety assess ments are designated as a study "visit." 
117  In addition to the safety assessments at weeks 5 and 8, primary outcome 
118  assessments (GRID -HAMD) will also be conducted.  
119    
120  Visit 3 : Immediate treatment group : Initial MRI assessment and neurocogn itive testing 121 
 (KKI; 1 hour). This visit will occur within about one week after Visit 2.  
122    
123 Delayed treatment group : Initial MRI assessment and neurocognitive testing  
124 (KKI; 1 hour). This visit will occur about 8 weeks after Visit 2. In addition t o the 
125  brain imaging and neurocognitive testing, depressive symptom measures 
will be 126  reassessed in the delayed treatment group (BPRU; 1 hour).  
127

Consistent with our previous psilocybin protocols, the partici pant’s life history and current [ADDRESS_798647] 182 
been published elsewhere.1  183 
  184 
The participant will meet with the session monitor(s) one day and one week after each session [ADDRESS_798648] hours will be scheduled if it is judged that the participant 187 
would benefit from additional meetings in order to discuss experiences from their session(s) or 188 
prepare for the next session.  189

reporting  to the laboratory for the psilocybin sessions. Before psilocybin administration, the 198 
participant will provide a urine sample, which will be tested for the presence of abused drugs 199 
(e.g., various opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], stimulants and sedatives). In addition, a urine pre gnancy test will be [ADDRESS_798651] will be required in 201

and available to respond to participants’ physical and emotional needs during the full cour se of 209 
the session (at least 7 hours). A physician on the study team will be immediately available via [ADDRESS_798653] approximately 7 to 10 hours.   222 
  223 
At about the same time of each heart rate/blood pressure measurement, monitors will complete 224 
questionnaires to rate the presence and intensity of behaviors, signs,  and reported symptoms, 225 
including sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], amount of speech, anxiety, stimulation/arousal, tearing/crying, 226 
nausea/vomiting, yawning, restlessness, feelings of unreality, visual changes, euphoria, and [ADDRESS_798654] -session meetings (Visits 7, 8, 10, and 11) : During the meetings with  the monitors 236 
after each session ([ADDRESS_798655] -session, or Visits 237 
8 and 11), participants will complete questionnaire assessment measures. During visits 7 and 238 
10, the monitors will also complete questionnaires retrospectively rating various behaviors and 239 
experiences observed on the session day and reported by [CONTACT_603097] 240 
(e.g., Next -Day Monitor Rating Form), and participants will be asked to recite and discuss the [ADDRESS_798656] recent psilocybin session.  242 
  243 
Long -term follow -up visits : [Long -term follow -up assessment is ongoing and results will be 244 
reported later.]   245 
  246 
Timing and Location of Meetings, Sessions, and Measures : Although much effort is put in to 247 
scheduling volunteers within the stated time frames, these are only estimates. Variables out of 248 
the study team’s control (e.g., volunteer availability, university cl osings, availability of study 249

  255 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  256 
    257 
Overview of Screening Procedures : Participants will be initially screened via telephone or an 258 
online questionnaire to determine whether they meet major inclusion/exclusion criteria, and thus [ADDRESS_798658] passe d telephone screening. Participants will be allowed to take as much time as 266 
necessary to decide whether or not to sign the consent form. Study staff will discuss the consent 267 
form with the participant after the participant has read the consent form. Study s taff will ask 268 
questions to assess the individual’s u nderstanding of the consent form. Participants may take 269 
the consent form home to review and return to sign consent if they wish.   270 
  271 
Participants will be physically healthy adult participants (approximate ly equal numbers of males 272 
and females) [ADDRESS_798659] of these medications.    278 
  279 
Non-English speakers and those with language or hearing impairments will not participate in the 280 
study. Participants will be recruited primarily from the Baltimore/Washington DC area. [ADDRESS_798660]. Potential participants will be 282 
carefully screened to eliminate those with significant medical or psychiatric illnesses other than 283 
major depressive disorder (see below for specific inclusion/exclusion criteria).  284 
  285 
Screening evaluation will include a history and physical examination, ECG, a 30 cc blood draw 286 
for study measures and medical screening, a personal and family medical history questionnaire, 287 
psychiatric/psychological assessments, and a urine drug test. As pe r standard BPRU screening 288 
procedures, screening physical examination and ECGs will be performed by [CONTACT_603098] 289 
(nurse, mid -level, or physician). ECGs will be interpreted by [CONTACT_603099] [ADDRESS_798661] will be conducted before each drug session (e.g., testing for various opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 293 
stimulants  and sedatives). Pregnant or nursing women are ineligible; female participants will [ADDRESS_798662] use effective 295 
methods of contraception during the study. Psychiatric screening will be condu cted by [CONTACT_3449] 296 
team members. Psychoactive drug -use history, history of antidepressant treatments, and 297 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  11  
information about employment status and current functioning (including mood and psychological 298 
and psychosomatic symptoms) will be obtained. All inclusion a nd exclusion criteria are 299 
described below.  300 
  301 
Based on testing and interviews, if a psychiatric/psychological problem of a crisis nature (e.g., 302 
acute psychosis or suicidal intent) is discovered during screening, we will refer that individual to 303 
the Emergen cy Department for treatment.   304 
  305 
Study participants will not be enrolled if they are currently taking antidepressant medication. 306 
Study physicians will assume the role of mental health provider upon participants enrolling in the 307 
study through the final primary outcome timepoint (Visit 13, [ADDRESS_798663] -psilocybin session 2).   308

Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  395 
  396 
Psilocybin dose : All participants will receive a moderate dose of 20 mg/[ADDRESS_798668] 397 
psilocybin session. The psilocybin dose for the second session will be increased to 30 mg/[ADDRESS_798669] a similar or greater 400 
reaction at a higher dose that would reduce the possible therapeutic benefits of psilocybin.   401 
  402 
Primary outcome variable.  403 
  404 
Depression Measures : The primary outcome measure for depressive symptoms is the 17 -item 405 
GRID -Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID -HAMD)4,[ADDRESS_798670] this measured at screening (Visit 2), at post -randomization weeks 5, [ADDRESS_798671] -psilocybin session 2 for the immediate treatment 409 
group; weeks 13 and 16 correspond to primary endpoints for the delayed tr eatment group. 410 
Having the same number and timepoints of primary outcome assessments will allow for 411 
between -group comparisons. This scale assesses severity of depressive symptoms with a 412 
higher score indicating more severe depression. Screening measurements for the immediate 413 
treatment group will be considered as baseline measurements for this group, and 414 
measurements at the end of the wait period for the delayed treatment group will be considered 415 
baseline measurements for this group for the purposes of assessi ng treatment outcomes.  416 
  417 
Secondary outcome variables.  418 
  419 
Depression Measures : Secondary outcome measures for depressive symptoms are the Beck  420 
Depression Inventory II (BDI -II),6 the 9 -item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9),7 and the 421 
Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology – Self Rated (QIDS -SR).8,9 These will be 422 
administered at the same timepoints as the primary depression measures.   423 
  424 
Safety Measures : The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)10 will be used to 425 
assess severity of suicide  ideation during every in -person visit. It was developed by [CONTACT_33365] 426 
at Columbia University and is widely used in clinical and research settings  427 
(www.cssrs.columbia.edu). As a safety precaution, participants in the delayed treatment group [ADDRESS_798672] wee kly assessments of depressive symptoms (using the PHQ -9) and suicide risk 429 
(using the C -SSRS) to determine if intervention is warranted.  430 
  431 
Measures taken throughout each drug session :   432 
  433 
Heart rate and blood pressure:  Vital signs will be assessed before capsule 434 
administration and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes after capsule 435 
administration.   436 
  437 
Within -session Monitor Rating Form:  At the same time points at which the heart rate and 438 
blood pressure will be taken, the two session monitors will complete the Monitor Rating 439 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  14  
Form, which involves rating or scoring several dimensions of the participant’s behavior 440 
and mood.  441 
  442 
Video and audio recordings:  Video and audio recordings may be taken throughout the 443 
drug sessions and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_431].   444 
  445 
Measures taken about 7 hours after capsule administration :   446 
  447 
Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30)11,12   448 
  449 
Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ27)[ADDRESS_798673] -session time -points, and follow -up:   452 
  453 
Anxiety and emotion regulation rating scales : Participants will complete a number of 454 
questionnaires that assess anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory, or STAI,14 and 455 
Hamilton Anxiety Inventory, or HAM -A)15 during screening and 1 week and 4 weeks after 456 
Session 2.  457 
  458 
Measures taken 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after Session 2 :   459 
  460 
Persisting Effects Questionnaire:  This questionnaire was developed to assess [ADDRESS_798674] to the psilocybin 462 
experience.2,3,16   463 
  464 
Monitor Rating of Enduring Effects:  This questionnaire will assess the monitors’ 465 
observations of persisting effects of sessions on participant attitudes and behaviors.  466 
  467 
Measures taken at baseline only :  468 
  469 
Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ) : If a participant has a [ADDRESS_798675] 471 
trials for purposes of characterizing that participant’s degree of treatment -resistance.17–20    472

[Other tertiary measures were examined in this trial that are not reported here. These measures 474 
will be included in forth coming manuscripts.]  475 
  476 
Statistical plan.  477 
  478 
Questionnaire Measures : Repeated -measures ANOVA will be used when appropriate to assess [ADDRESS_798676] for early antidepressant effects (between [ADDRESS_798677] -session ratings), and to test for sustained antidepressant effects 483 
(between baseline and [ADDRESS_798678] -session ratings) of psilocybin. Planned comparisons will [ADDRESS_798679] scores between 485 
pre-session (e.g. Visits 2, 5 and 8) and post -session (e.g. Visits 7, and 10 - 15) timep oints for 486 
eMATERIALS: STUDY PROTOCOL  [ADDRESS_798680] -randomization. We will also assess 488 
correlations between primary and secondary outcome measures.  489

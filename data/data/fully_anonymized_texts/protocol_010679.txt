Study design  This will be a confirmatory, prospective, open -label, multi -centre 
phase 3 study to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-TLX250  
PET/CT imaging to non -invasively detect clear cell renal cell cancer 
(ccRCC) in  adult patients with indeterminate renal masses (IRM), 
scheduled for partial or total nephrectomy.  
Histological confirmation will serve as standard of truth, to assess 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative 
predictive value (NPV), as well as accuracy of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT 
imaging.  
According to current clinical practice in m ost specialist centres, 
patients with an IRM of ≤  [ADDRESS_174728] diameter (stage cT1, 
encompassing the subgroups cT1a ≤  4 cm, and cT1b  > 4 cm to 
≤ 7cm), restricted to the kidneys are routinely subjected to partial or 
total nephrectomy, as this intervention has curative potential in most 
cases.  
For that reason  this study will be conducted in patients with IRM of 
stage cT1,  and histological material will be obtained as part of routine 
nephrectomy, circumventing the need for study -specific invasive 
procedures. Given a reported high rate of non -diagnostic kidney 
biopsies, patients scheduled to undergo kidney biopsy  only, rather 
than nephrectomy are not e ligible for this study.  
The proportion of patients with a stage cT1 IRM, who actually do not 
have ccRCC (non -ccRCC patients, i.e. those in whom following 
surgical removal , ccRCC can be histologically ruled out) has been 
reported to range between 20 –40%. This proportion  appears to be 
higher in smaller (cT1a), compared with larger (cT1b) lesions.  
For a total study population of cT1 patients composed of 70% of the 
cT1a subgroup (IRM  ≤ 4 cm), and  assuming 34% non-ccRCC  in the 
cT1a subgroup , a total sample size of 252 patients  provides  90% 
power  to confirm both a sensitivity and specificity of 83%, as 
previously reported for cT1a lesions for prior GTX -based imaging 
agents (124I-girentuximab, 111In-girentuximab). The total sample size 
of 252 gives 90% power to  distinguish  a 68% specificity threshold, 
assuming a non -ccRCC rate in the cT1b subset  of at least 17% . 
In order to ensure that a sufficient number of patients with cT1a 
tumo ur stage and sufficient patients with  non-ccRCC histopathology 
will be in cluded into the total study population, patient accrual and 
histological results will be centrally evaluated and monitored  by [CONTACT_140954] (IDMC) ; recruitment into 
the study will continue until  the minimum required  number of pat ients 
has been recruited . The IDMC members will not have access to 89Zr-
TLX250 PET/CT images , nor will they have access to the PET/CT 
results from the independent image reviewers.

Patients who are enrolled , but are then either not admin istered with 
study drug, or who do not undergo PET/CT imaging after 
administration  of study drug, in whom PET/CT images can not be 
analysed due to technical failure, or in whom surgical material can 
not be assessed for presen ce or absence of ccRCC, are defined as 
drop-outs. Drop -out patients will be replaced  for the primary analysis 
and study sample size . Missing data are not expected for efficacy 
outcomes involving the standard of truth (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, 
PPV, N PV, accuracy, inter -reader and intra -reader variability).   
Patients will be recruited in 35–[ADDRESS_174729] access to state -of-the-art PET/CT imaging.  
Following informed consent, a screening visit will be performed 
during which baseline examinations will be made. The study 
schedule will be planned considering a delivery timeline for 89Zr-
TLX250  of 7 – 10 days from the central study radiopharmacy,  the 
day of administration , a PET/CT s can of the kidneys  at 5 ± [ADDRESS_174730] administration , and the nephrectomy to be performed any time 
after the PET/CT imaging visit, but no later than [ADDRESS_174731] performed within 24  hours prior to 
dosing . 
Patients , in wh om unexpected evidence for diss eminated disease is 
observed, PET/CT imaging may be extended to whole body imaging 
(skull base  to mid-thigh ) at the discretion of the investigator. Patients 
will be informed as part of the consent procedure that any PET 
imaging result will not be disclosed to them until the scheduled 
nephrectomy has actually been performed or unt il surgery has been 
cancelled in case metastatic disease going beyond the kidney is 
present.  
A histological tumour sample from nephrectomy ( 15 paraffin 
embedded slides) will be prepared by [CONTACT_151756], and sent to the central  laboratory which will determine the 
histological diagnosis of the renal mass  – the standard of truth - 
(ccRCC or non -ccRCC), and determine the degree of CAIX 
expression.  For patients in whom unexpected evidence of 
disseminated disease is observed, any available tissue samples 
from biopsies of extrarenal lesions will also be analysed centrally.  
On Day 42 ± 7 days p.a., a visit will be performed  for all patients , 
during which the potential formation of anti -drug antibodies (HACA) 
and safety parameters will be investigated.  
At the final study visit,  testing for HACA will be repeated , where 
feasible, and all necessary safety assessment will be performed . For 
patien ts who were nephrectomised within 28 days p.a., the final

study visit will be conducted on Day 42 (± 7 days ). For patients with 
nephrectomy between 28 and 90 days p.a., the final study visit will 
be performed 35  days (± 7 days ) after surgery.  
Image data analyses will be performed by a central image core lab. 
Qualitative visual analysis (presence or absence of localised 
89Zr-TLX250  uptake inside or in vicinity of renal lesion, as seen on 
contrast -enhanced pre-BL MRI or equivalent standard of care 
imaging  with contrast agent ), will be used to assess test performance 
of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT imaging to detect ccRCC, using histological 
results from the central histological reference laboratory as standard 
of truth.  
Lesions  of interest will be spatially localised by [CONTACT_779] , and 
independently by [CONTACT_151757]. The readers of the central  lab 
will not have access to the spatial localisation determined by [CONTACT_779].  
Reading of the images will be conducted centrally and independently 
by [CONTACT_151758], blind ed to patient medical  history and  any 
previous  histology results.  
89Zr-TLX250  SUVs will be determined for each tumour lesion. 
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) will be analysed to identify 
a SUV cut -off value, most appropriate to discriminate between 
ccRCC or non -ccRCC  (ccRCCnegative) as evidenced by [CONTACT_151759] s. 
89Zr-TLX250  activity and antibody mass concentrations in tumour at 
the time of imaging (MBq/cm³, mg/cm³) will be determined, 
considering the absolute activity bound to the tumour, lesion volume 
as determined by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI, and the decay -corrected specific a ctivity.  
Image -derived non -primary variables will be exploratively compared 
to histological and clinical parameters, where merited.

measuring ≤  [ADDRESS_174733] diameter (stage cT1) (inclusion 
criterion) . 
Pre-BL contrast -enhanced  images will be collected for precise 
volumetric tumour delineation, si nce in the context of the study, 
no contrast -enhanced CT or MRI will be performed . 
89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT imaging  
1. PET imaging  
Abdominal  PET/CT scans including the kidneys will be acquired 
over 20 minutes in a single bed position  if possible  at a single time 
point on Day  5 ± [ADDRESS_174734] administration  (p.a.) of 89Zr-TLX250  using 
static image acquisition  and low dose CT .  
Patients found to have evidence of N1 or M1 disease may 
undergo additional whole body  PET/CT  imaging ( skull base  to 
mid-thigh ) using 6 -8 bed positions with 10 minute s acquisition 
time per bed posit ion at the discretion  of the treating clinician  to 
support comprehensive staging.  The additional scan if requested 
by [CONTACT_151760] 5 ± [ADDRESS_174735] .  
2. Qualitative 89Zr-TLX250  tumour targeting  
89Zr-TLX250  tumour uptake will qualitatively be assessed (yes /  
no), considering whether or not 89Zr-TLX250  binding inside or in 
the vicinity of the target lesion, as delineated on structural imaging 
(contrast -enhanced p re-BL imaging ), can be detected.   
3. Quantitative 89Zr-TLX250  tumour targeting  
Absolute activity concentrations of tracer in tumour (MBq/cm³) will 
be calculated using attenuation -corrected count rates, and tumour 
volumes, as determined by [CONTACT_22242] -enhanced pre -BL imaging . 
Considering specific activity (MBq/mg), protein mass dose 
conc entrations of tracer in tumour at the time point of imaging 
(mg/cm³) will be calculated.  
4. Estimation of 177Lu-girentuximab tumour targeting  
Protein mass dose concentrations of tracer in tumour (mg/cm³) at 
the single time point of imaging, and a general mode l of average 
girentuximab kinetics in tumour over time (derived from sequential 
89Zr-TLX250  biodistribution data), will be used, to estimate 
possible girentuximab protein kinetics in tumour lesions over a 
period of one week, assuming the kinetics of diagnostic 89Zr-
TLX250  and therapeutic 177Lu-girentuximab are essentially similar. 
Such protein k inetic data can be used, to generate simulated time -
activitiy curves for 177Lu-girentuximab in tumour for different 
specific activity levels, to yield estimates of achievable therapeutic 
absorbed doses to tumour (Gy).  
Determination of histological standard  of truth  
Surgical resection material, along with appropriate documentation 
of its in situ origin  (to allow identification with  lesion  localisation on 
PET images ) will be sent to local pathology for routine histological

work -up (H&E staining, histological diagnosis: ccRCC vs. non -
ccRCC).  
In addition, non -stained slides of the indeterminate mass 
removed during surgery will be sent to a central histology lab , for 
independent determination of histological diagnosis  and 
detection of CAIX . 
In addition, where available, h istological diagnosis  of ccRCC and 
the detection of  CAIX  will be conducted on available tissue 
samples from biopsies of extrarenal lesions from patients in 
whom unexpected evidence of disseminated disease has been 
observed.  
Diagnostic performance   
Test performance parameters (sensitivity, specificity, positive and 
negative predictive values, accuracy), will be determined 
considering visually determined qualitative 89Zr-TLX250  tumour 
uptake (yes/no), and histology (ccRCC+/ ccRCC -) as standard of 
truth. 
Safety  
The following safety evaluations will be made:  
1. Standard laboratory (haematology, biochemistry)  
2. Adverse event recording (NCI -CTC v 5.0) 
3. Concomitant medication recording  
4. 12-lead ECG

Number of patients  Total: approximately 252 patients scheduled for partial or total 
nephrectomy  
Sample Size : 
The total number of patients expected to be enrolled is n=252 : it is 
expected that these will include  [ADDRESS_174736]  128 and 66, respectively . Therefor e, the distribution of enrolled 
patients will be central ly monitor ed (reviewing of staging and 
histology (without imaging results) . 
Co-primary variables  Sensitivity and Specificity of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT imaging to 
detect ccRCC  
These will be determined, considering the histological diagnosis 
(ccRCC+ or ccRCC -) as determined by [CONTACT_151761], and the qualitative 89Zr-TLX250  tumour 
targeting (tracer uptake in target  lesion: yes/no), as determined by 
[CONTACT_151762], to yield a 2 x 2 table as follows:  
 ccRCC+  ccRCC - 
PET+  TP FP 
PET- FN TN 
Abbreviations: FN=false negative; FP=false positive; 
TN=true negative; TP=true positive  
a) Sensitivity will be the proportion of study patients  with a true 
positive  (TP) PET scan, out of those with positive histology for 
ccRCC  
 Sensitivity (%) = TP / (TP + FN)  
b) Specificity will be the proportion of study subjects with a true 
negative  (TN) PET scan, out of those with negative histology for 
ccRCC  
 Specificity (%) = TN / (TN + FP)  
Secondary variables  Further test performance parameters  
a) Positive predictive value (PPV)  
  PPV (%) = TP / (TP + FP)  
b) Negative predictive value (PPV)  
  NPV (%) = TN / (TN + FN)  
c) Accuracy  
  Accuracy (%) = TP + TN / (TP + FP + TN + FP)  
Standardi sed uptake value (SUV)

  SUV = C image / (injected dose / body weight)  
Inter -reader  variability  
Fleiss´ kappa statistics will be used to determine the agreement 
between the qualitative visual assessment of 89Zr-TLX250  tumour 
targeting (tracer uptake in target lesion: yes/no), as assessed by 
[CONTACT_151763].  An intra -class kappa of 0 .70 or 
higher will be considered as an acceptable value . Note that both 
sensitivity and specificity will be determined for each of three 
independent readers. The study will be successful if the lower 
bounds of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for sensiti vity (>70%) 
and specificity (>68%) in at least the same 2 out of 3 independent 
readers . 
Intra -reader  variability  
Cohen´s  kappa statistics will be used to determine the 
reproducibility of the qualitative visual assessment by [CONTACT_151764] g the same data repeatedly.  
Safety  
a) General safety parameters:  
Frequency of occurrence and severity of abnormal findings in 
safety investigations (physical examination, vital signs, 12 -lead 
ECG, clinical laboratory, AEs, concomitant medication)  
b)  HACA  
Exploratory Variable s 
a) In situ biological half -life of girentuximab; achievable 
therapeutic absorbed dose to tumour (Gy) for several specific 
activities and hypothetical activity doses of 177Lu. 
b) Sub group analysis based on tumour characteristics.  
c) Correlation between 89Zr-TLX250 SUVs and degree of 
histological CAIX  expression . 
d) Qualitative 89Zr-TLX250 tumour targeting (tracer uptake in 
extrarenal  lesion: yes/no), as determined by [CONTACT_151762] . 
Plan for statistical analysis  To take multiple testing for the two co -primary endpoints into 
account, testing will occur in a strictly sequential order. Firstly, the 
observed sensitivity will be compared  against a predefined 
minimum expected threshold  for sensitivity , using a binominal  
confidence interval . If the null hypothesis for sensitivity testing can 
be rejected, the test for specificity is performed using the same 
methodology , applying a predefined threshold for specificity . This 
strategy ensures a global level of significance of  p < 0.05.  
Reader variability , as the most important secondary o bjectives  will 
be determined using Kappa  statistics.  
All other secondary variables will be analysed desc riptively using 
exploratory statistics.

1 Introduction  
Small renal masses (SRM) of unknown origin are frequently detected due to more frequent radiologic 
evaluations of the abdomen. Conventional imaging methods  cannot reliably distinguish benign solid 
lesions from renal cell carcinoma (RCC)  (Kutikov et al. , 2006, Snyder et al. , 2006, Schachter et al. , 
2007) . This frequently leads to the difficult decision  for urologists whether to perform a (partial) 
nephrectomy on a potentially benign mass or to refrain from surgery and enter patients with a 
potentially aggres sive malignancy into a follow -up protocol until disease progression occurs. 
Specimens obtained by [CONTACT_2207] - or computed tomography (CT) –guided biopsies have a relatively 
high sensitivity and specificity, but the procedures are invasive and require close  follow -up of the 
patient (Lebret et al. , 2007, Volpe et al. , 2008) . In addition , pooled sensitivity of fluorine -18-
fluorodeoxyglucose positron -emission tomography (18F-FDG -PET) imaging for detecting primary 
RCC was found to be only 62% (Wang et al. , 2012) . Post-operative benign disease  was found  in 
15% to 30% of clinical T1a lesions in patients with a presurgical diagnosis of suspected renal cancer 
(Kutikov et al. , 2006, Snyder et al. , 2006, Schachter et al. , 2007) . In consequence, m ore advanced 
imaging me thods are needed to prevent invasive biopsies or unnecessary surgeries , and to improve 
the detection  of lesions suspect ed for metastatic and local recurrence  RCC . 
1.1 Background  
Zirconium -89 (89Zr) is coupled safely to the monoclonal antibody ( mAb) using a suc cinylated 
derivative of desferrioxamine B (DFO -TFP) as bifunctional chelate. After intracellular catabolism of 
the radio -conjugate, 89Zr stays in the target cells.  
89Zr-TLX250  is under clinical development as a tracer for renal tumour masses and metastases using 
PET imaging.  
Preclinical studies suggest that labelling girentuximab with the residualizing positron emitter 89Zr 
leads to higher tumour uptake and more sensitive dete ction of ccRCC lesions than the non -
residualizing 124I (Cheal  et al. , 2014 ) and that it is able to detect very small tumours and metastases 
down to 100 mg (Brouwers et al., 2004), or 7 mm3 (Stillebroer et al., 2013 ). 
The clinical potential of 89ZrPET and P ET/CT for tumour detection was initially demonstrated in head -
and-neck cancer patients (Börjesson et al., 200 9), and has since emerged as a promising imaging 
method for tumour targeting mAbs (Dijkers et al., 2010 ; Rizvi et al., 2012 ; Gaykema et al., 2013 ; van 
Asselt et al., 2014 ; Oosting et al., 2015).  
Also for the diagnostic work -up of patients with either newly diagnosed renal lesions of unknown 
biological dignity, or for patients with an established diagnosis of ccRCC and a suspected 
progression or recur rence, the non -invasive detection of CAIX -expressing viable tumour tissue by 
[CONTACT_151765] 89Zr-TLX250  PET, may contribute to an improved clinical decision making in 
RCC patients. The existing experience from the proof -of-principle study (No. 0812 1986, ZIRDEE ) 
suggests, that 89Zr-TLX250  has the potential to (a) avoid unnecessary surgical interventions in

benign disease, (b) support minimal invasive treatment options such a partial nephrectomy, (c) 
improve staging of metastatic disease by [CONTACT_151766], and (d) provide a functional imaging 
tool, allowing to non -invasively monitor the biological behaviour of indeterminate lesions following a 
conservative active surveillance strategy  (Hekman et al., 2018) . 
Currently, SPECT/CT imaging using 111In-labeled girentuximab is frequently used for the diagnosis 
of RCC. Girentuximab is a monoclonal antibody that recognises carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a 
cell surface antigen abundantly expressed in renal cancer (Steffens et al. , 1997). More than 95% of 
clear  cell renal cancers express CAIX and the antigen is not found in normal renal tissue or in benign 
cysts. In an extensive analysis, the binding of girentuximab to normal human tissues was found to 
be restricted to the gastric and intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], the large biliary ducts in the liver, and some 
pancreatic acini (Oosterwijk et al. , 1986). An IgG1 chimeric version of monoclonal antibody 
girentuximab (cG250) was constructed by [CONTACT_151767] (Malvern, PA). When girentuximab is labelled  
with a radionuclide it can be used as an imaging probe for SPECT or PET. After intravenous 
administration of this probe, both primary tumo ur, lymph nodes, and distant metastases can be 
assessed by [CONTACT_105] -invasive whole -body PET or SPECT imaging. Because of its specific and high level 
of expression, CAIX is an excellent target for imaging clear -cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) lesions. 
The advantag es of girentuximab imaging are that it is non -invasive and does not require the use of 
intravenous iodine contrast agents, which makes it suitable for patients with an impaired renal 
function.  
Numerous studies were performed using radiolabelled girentuxima b in ccRCC patients in the past 
[ADDRESS_174750] been performed worldwide in 
several clinical trials since its discovery (Muselaers et al. , 2013, 2014, Steffens et al ., 1997, 1998, 
1999; Brouwers et al. , 2002,  2003, 2004, 2005; Oosterwijk et al. , 2003; Stillebroer et al. , 2013; Divgi 
et al. , 1998, 2004) . No severe side effects or allergic reactions to the antibody infusions have been 
reported to date. In these studies , the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, immunogeni city, and imaging 
characteristics of radiolabel led girentuximab in ccRCC patients were determined, and the feasibility 
to detect ccRCC  lesions using radiolabel led girentuximab was demonstrated. Clear cell RCC is the 
most common s ubtype of renal cancer (80% ), and  has a higher metastatic potential th an e.g., 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_151729] e RCCs.  It is therefore  especially  important to detect  ccRCC  with high 
accuracy.  
There is extensive experience with the ability  of girentuximab  radiolabelled with 131I, 111In, 177Lu, 90Y 
and 124I to target ccRCC  lesions in animals as well as in patients  (Muselaers et al. , 2013, 2014, 
Steffens et al ., 1997, 1998, 1999; Brouwers et al. , 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005; Oosterwijk et al. , 2003; 
Stillebroer et  al., 2013; Divgi et al. , 1998, 2004) . In 2007, Divgi et al. reported the possibility of 
specifically detecting ccRCC  preoperatively with PET using 124I-labeled girentuximab in 16 patients 
with renal masses. 15 of 16 clear -cell carcinomas were identified a ccurately by [CONTACT_10052], and all nine 
non-clear -cell renal masses were negative for the tracer. The false negative PET in one patient with 
ccRCC  was probably because of extensive necrosis. The sensitivity of 124I-cG250 PET for ccRCC  in 
this trial was 94%; the neg ative predictive value was 90%, and specificity and positive predictive 
accuracy  were both 100% (Divgi et al. , 2007) . In 201 2 Divgi et al. confirmed the high accuracy of

124I-girentuximab PET/CT in the preoperative, non -invasive identification of ccRCC  in 195 patients. 
They showed that the sensitivity (86%; 95% -confidence interval [CI], 75 –97) and specificity (86%; 
95%-CI, 69 –100) of 124I-girentuximab were markedly higher than those of conventional CT (Divgi et 
al., 2012). At Radboud UMC , girentuximab la belled with the gamma -emitting radionuclide indium -
111 (111In-grientuximab ) is used to detect ccRCC  lesions. In [ADDRESS_174751]/CT (Muselaers  et al. , 2013) . Uptake of 111In-girentuximab in the lesion was seen in 15/[ADDRESS_174752] advantages of PET  and PET/CT  as compared to SPECT are the superior resolution, the 
short acquisition time for whole -body 3D images, and the potential for quantitative analysis of tumo ur 
targeting. Clinical PET trials with 89Zr‐labeled mAbs have been performed or are ongoing with at 
least [ADDRESS_174753] of the FDA approved mAbs. 89Zr‐PET has become an integrated part 
of the mAb development programs of several of the world -leading pharmaceutical and biotech 
companies. Girentuximab can be stably labelled  with the PET radionuclide  89Zr (89Zr-girentuximab)  
and in preclinical studies the in vivo distribution of 89Zr-girentuximab was shown to be identical to 
that of 111In-girentu ximab (Brouwers et al. 2004) . In addition, due to prolonged trappi[INVESTIGATOR_151730],  PET imaging with  89Zr-
girentuximab  was shown to be superior to 124I-girentuximab (Cheal et al. , 2014) . Combin ing the 
superior characteristics of PET with the use of the residualizing  89Zr radionuclide are major steps 
forward in the development of this imaging biomarker.

able to differentiate between ccRCC and tumour or metastases from other origin , as well as 
differentiating from non -malignant renal masses,  and thus avoid repeated biopsy or unnecessary 
surgery.  It is anticipated to develop 89Zr-girentuximab  (89Zr-TLX250)  as an improved imaging agent 
for ccRCC.  
In a single -centre, single -arm and open label proof -of-concept study  No. 08121986  (Phase  2b –

89Zr-TLX250  (37 MBq). Preliminary results of this study suggest that 89Zr-TLX250  PET imaging can 
have a positive impact on clinical decision -making management of ccRCC. The extent of the tumour 
disease can be evaluated, the number of metastatic sites can be identifie d, and the imaging 
distinguishes solitary and oligometastatic ccRCC from more extensive metastatic ccRCC.  The 
results of the study also demonstrated the capability of 89Zr-TLX250  to differentiate between ccRCC 
and non -malignant tumours of the kidneys based  on histology results.  
Results of a  bridging study (ZIRDOSE) , investigat ing the safety and tolerability and the impact of two 
different mass doses (5  mg and 10  mg) of the antibody on biodistribution and tracer  uptake  has been 
completed.  The study showed a safety profile similar to that of other radiolabelled monoclonal 
antibodies, and favourable imaging propert ies of the [ADDRESS_174755]  centres, patients with an IRM of ≤  [ADDRESS_174756] diameter (stage cT1, encompassing the subgroups cT1a  ≤ 4 cm, and cT1b  > 4 cm to 
≤ 7 cm), restricted to the kidneys are routinely subjected to partial or total nephrectomy, as this 
diagnostic intervention has curative potential in most cases.  
The aim of this phase 3 study (ZIRCON) is to investigate the potential of 89Zr-TLX250  to determine 
whether an IRM of ≤ 7 cm (stage cT1) has the aggressive ccRCC phenotype verified by 
[CONTACT_151769].

In preclinical studies imaging using 89Zr-girentuximab was proven to be  safe and feasible. No local 
or systemic side effects were observed. Girentuximab can  be stably labe lled with the PET 
radionuclide 89Zr the in -vivo biodistribution of 89Zr-TLX250  was shown to be identical to that of 111In-
girentuximab (Brouwers et al. , 2004) . 89Zr-TLX250  was shown to have higher diagnostic resolution 
124I-girentuximab in animal studies due to prolonged trappi[INVESTIGATOR_151731] (Cheal et al. , 2014).  
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 131I-girentuximab were studied  by [CONTACT_151770] . 
(1997) . For large kidney tumo urs overall tumo ur uptake ranges from 2.4% to 9.0%.  The mean blood 
clearance curves of  girentuximab fitted a two -compartment model: a  distribution phase and an 
elimination phase. The half -life of the distribution phase was 3.8  hours (SD 2.0 hours). The half -life 
of the elimination phase was dependent on the protein  dose level. At the 2 mg p rotein dose level, 
t1/2, was significantly lower (t 1/2 = 39.6 ± 9.6  hours) , compared with the other, higher protein dose 
levels (t 1/2 = 68.5 ± 13.5 hours).  Loh et al. showed in 1998 that there is a wide variability in 
pharmacokinetic parameters  among patie nts. This reflects the differences in individual patient 
clearance and exchange  kinetics of girentuximab (Loh et al. , 1998) .  
In a clinical phase 1 study investigating safety, tolerability , imaging characteristics, biodistribution 
and dosimetry, 89Zr-TLX250 was found to be safe, and to provide improved imaging characteristics, 
compared to 124I-girentuximab, in line with preclinical findings (Cheal et al., 2014).  
In the present phase 3 ZIRCO N trial, 89Zr-TLX250 will be administered as a single dose with 37  MBq 
of 89Zr as an imaging agent . The total girentuximab dose will be adjusted to 10 mg in 0.9% saline. 
This is a radioactivity dose which is established in mAb imaging with 89Zr.  
Radiation  dosimetry was evaluated in a bridging dosimetry study ZIRDOSE  investigating the safety 
and tolerability of 89Zr-girentuximab.  The whole body effective dose for administration of 89Zr-
girentuximab in this phase 1 study was 0.487  ± 0.014  mSv/MBq  using the FDA-approved  dose 
calculation tool OLINDA 1.[ADDRESS_174759] (Stabin et al., 2005) . The absorbed/effective 
dose was calculated accordingly and result ed in a total whole body effective dose of 18.0 ± 0.[ADDRESS_174760] (Andersson et al., 
2017) is used, the resulting effective dose will be  0.551  ± 0.030  mSv/MBq or 20.5 ± 1.1 mSv for 
37 MBq.  
Preliminary safety data in the bridging study (ZIRDOSE) with 89Zr-girentuximab  administered to 5 
patients  per 5 mg and 10  mg girentuximab mass dose , each,  did not prompt any safety concern over 
the treatment. In the course of the study , no treatment -related SAEs or S[LOCATION_003]Rs were reported  from 
any of the 10 patients . The severe SAE of postoperational bleeding was considered by [CONTACT_151771]. A total of 7 AEs were experienced by 4 patients. 
An unlikely or no relationship to treatment was assessed by [CONTACT_1732] 6  AEs. Mild nausea 
in one patient was considered by [CONTACT_151772].  
All patients within the prese nt phase 3 ZIRCON trial will undergo an abdominal PET/CT scan. The 
CT scan will be a low -dose CT for the purpose of attenuation correction of the PET data only. In

risk for incidence of radiation -induced cancer for an effective  dose of 23  mSv is 0.4% (ICRP 103,

3 Overview of Methodology and Design  
3.1 Study Design  
This will be a confirmatory, prospective, open -label, multi -centre phase 3 study (ZIRCON) in adult 
patients with pre-study imaging evidence of indeterminate renal masses (IRM)  of ≤ [ADDRESS_174766] of care . The study 
is designed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT imaging to non -invasively 
detect clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC).  
Histological confirmation will serve as standard of t ruth, to assess sensitivity, specificity, positive 
predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), as well as accuracy of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT 
imaging.  
Consequently, this study will be conducted in patients with IRM of stage cT1, in which histologi cal 
material is obtained as part of routine nephrectomy, circumventing the need for study -specific 
invasive procedures. Given a reported high rate of non -diagnostic kidney biopsies, patients 
scheduled to undergo kidney biopsy  only, rather than nephrectomy are not eligible for this study.  
Approximately 252 adult patients will be recruited in 35 – [ADDRESS_174767] centres in 
Europe  (Belgium, [LOCATION_009], Spain, the Netherlands ), [LOCATION_006], Turkey,  Australia , Canada  and [LOCATION_003], who 
have access to state -of-the-art PET/CT imaging. The number of enrolled patients may be increased 
to ensure adequate precision in measuring both sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT 
imaging . 
Study Conduct  
Following informed consent, a scr eening visit will be performed during which baseline examinations 
will be made. The study schedule will be planned, considering a delivery timeline for 89Zr-TLX250  of 
7 - 10 days from the central study radiopharmacy, an imaging interval of 5 ± [ADDRESS_174768] 
administration  (p.a.), and nephrectomy to be performed any time after the PET/CT imaging visit, but 
no later than [ADDRESS_174769] administration of 89Zr-TLX250  and after image requisition.  
On Day 0, all successfully screened patients will undergo a slow intravenous  admin istration of the 
study drug  over a minimum of 3 minutes with 89Zr-TLX250 , at the nuclear medicine service of the 
respective study site. Before and after the a dmin istration , safety evaluations will be made.  
In patients , in wh om unexpected e vidence for diss eminated disease is observed, PET/CT imaging 
may be extended to complete whole body imaging ( skull base  to mid-thigh ) using 6 -8 bed positions 
with 10 minute acquisition time per bed posit ion at the discretion of the investigator. The additional 
scan if requested by [CONTACT_151760]  5 ± [ADDRESS_174770].

Patients will be informed as part of the consent procedure, that any P ET imaging result will not be 
disclosed to them, until the scheduled nephrectomy has actually been performed or until surgery has 
been cancelled in case metastatic disease going beyond the kidney is present.  
A histological tumour sample from nephrectomy ( 15 paraffin embedded slides) will be prepared by 
[CONTACT_151773], and sent to the central histological reference laboratory , 
which will determine the histological diagnosis of the renal mass (ccRCC or non -ccRCC), and 
determine the  degree of CAIX expression . For patients in whom unexpected evidence of 
disseminated disease is observed, any available tissue samples from biopsies of extrarenal lesions 
will also be analysed centrally  for the histological diagnosis of ccRCC and CAIX expr ession . 
Patients who do not have an evaluable PET/CT imaging post study drug administration and do not 
have a confirmed histopathology diagnosis are defined as drop -outs. To ensure credibility in the 
assessment of sensitivity and specificity, drop -out pati ents will be replaced  to achieve the desired 
sample size and power for the primary analysis .  
On Day  42 ± [ADDRESS_174771]-imaging  visit will be performed  in all patients , during which the potential 
formation of anti -drug antibodies (HACA) and some safety par ameters will be investigated.  
A final study visit will be performed either on Day  42 ± 7 days p.a. for patients with nephrectomy 
within 28 days after administration  of 89Zr-TLX250 , and 35  ± 7 days after surgery for patients with 
nephrectomy between 28 and 90  days p.a. 
Image data analyses will be performed by a central image core lab. Qualitative visual analysis 
(presence or absence of localised 89Zr-TLX250  uptake insid e or in vicinity of  the target lesion, as

ccRCC or non -ccRCC as evidenced by  [CONTACT_151775].  
89Zr-TLX250  activity and antibody mass concentrations in tumour at the time of imaging (MBq/cm³,

3.2 Study Endpoints  
The co-primary endpoint s of this study are the s ensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT 
imaging to detect ccRCC  in patients with IRM of tumour stage cT1, i.e. ≤ [ADDRESS_174772] diameter 
and scheduled nephrectomy . PET/CT scans will be determined as true positive (TP) and true 
negative (TN) by [CONTACT_151762]  (among 3 independent readers ) and comparison to histopathological 
diagnosis for ccRCC.  Image data analyses will be performed by a central image core lab. Qualitative 
visual analysis (presence or absence of localised 89Zr-TLX250  uptake inside or in vicinity of lesion s, 
as seen on contrast -enhanced pre-baseline (pre -BL) imaging ), will be used to assess test 
performance of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT imaging to non -invasively detect ccRCC, using histological 
results from the central histological reference laboratory as standard of truth .  
Secondary endpoints  include  the determination of the study drug’s potential to detect ccRCC in IRMs 
≤ [ADDRESS_174773] diameter  (tumour stage cT1a) , as well as determination of predictive values  
(standard uptake values (SUVs) ) of PET signals in the kidney. Moreover, the reproducibility of the 
qualitative visual assessment of tumour targeting will be determined  and safety and tolerability will 
be assessed.  
Reading for the co -primary endpoints (sensitivity and specificity) will be conducted independently by 
[CONTACT_151776] d readers, blind to history, and histology results. Inter -reader concordance will be 
assessed using kappa statistics. Similarly, kappa statistics will be used to assess intra -reader 
variability, using a subset of 10% of randomly selected cases re ad twice b y individual readers.  
89Zr-TLX250  SUVs will be determined for each tumour lesion. Receiver operating characteristics 
(ROC) will be analysed to identify a SUV cut -off value most appropriate to discriminate between 
ccRCC or non -ccRCC as evidenced by [CONTACT_151775].  
89Zr-TLX250  activity and antibody mass concentrations in tumour at the time of imaging (MBq/cm³, 
mg/cm³) will be determined , considering the absolute activity bound to the tumour, lesion volume as 
determined by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI, and the decay -corrected specific activity , using a general model of average 
girentuximab kinetics in tumour over time (derived from sequential 89Zr-TLX250  biodistribution data 
from earlier studies) . 
A sub -group analysis will evaluate sensitivity and specificity of  89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT imaging to 
detect ccRCC in patients with IRMs ≤ 3 cm, IRMs ≤ 2 cm, and Bosniak 3 and 4 lesions.

3.3 Justification of the Study Design  
This open -label phase 3 study is designed to confirm the sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT 
imaging with 89Zr-TLX250  to non -invasively detect  ccRCC  in patients with a pre-study diagnosed 
IRM of ≤ 7 cm (stage cT1) who are  scheduled for partial or total nephrectomy . 
For the evaluation of specificity of a diagno stic imaging agent, study patients with histologically 
confirmed absence of the target disease (non -ccRCC) are required.  
An estimated total of 252 patients with an IRM of ≤ 7 cm and scheduled partial or radical 
nephrectomy will be included in the study. However, this number may be increase d depending on 
the proportion of eligible patients with stage cT1a tumo urs, and the proportion considered non -
ccRCC patients after surgery and histological verification , in orde r to maintain the planned statistical 
robustness of the study . 
In this phase 3 study, a protein mass dose of the m Ab girentuximab of 10  mg is chosen. From  a 
small clinical dose -escalation study (Steffens et al., 1997)  with five protein  dose  levels (2, 5, 10, 25 
and 50  mg) of girentuximab it can be  assumed that higher doses of girentuximab (10 mg and above) 
result in a lower hepatic uptake and a lower bowel activity, providing a lower physiological 
background signal.  Additionally, a mass dose of 10  mg of girentuximab is in current clinical use in 
the US A. 
In a clinical bridging study (ZIRDOSE) investigating safety, tolerability, imaging characteristics, 
biodistribution and dosimetry, 89Zr-TLX250 was found to be safe, and to provide improved imaging 
characteristics, compared to 124I-girentuximab, in line with preclinical findings (Cheal et al., 2014).  
In the present phase 3 trial, 89Zr-TLX250 will be administered as a single dose with 37  MBq of 89Zr 
as an imaging agent. The total girentuximab dose wi ll be adjusted to 10 mg in 0.9% saline. This is a 
radioactivity dose which is established in mAb imaging with 89Zr. Radiation dosimetry was evaluated 
in the now  completed bridging dosimetry  trial (ZIRDOSE) investigating the safety and tolerability of 
89Zr-girentuximab.  
The whole body effective dose for administration of 89Zr-girentuximab in this phase 1 study was 
0.487  ± 0.014  mSv/MBq  using the most widely established dose calculation tool OLINDA 1.[ADDRESS_174774] (Stabin et al., 2005). The absor bed/effective dose was calculated accordingly 
and resulted in a total whole body effective dose of 18.0 ± 0.[ADDRESS_174775] (Andersson et al., 2017) is used, 
the resulting effective dose will  be 0.551  ± 0.030  mSv/MBq or 20.5 ± 1.1 mSv for 37  MBq.  
All patients within the present phase 3 trial will undergo an abdominal PET/CT scan. The CT scan 
will be a low -dose CT for the purpose of attenuation correction of the PET data only. In order to keep 
the effective dose of this abdominal low -dose CT within a specified limit of 1  mSv, or less, the

Date: 01-Apr-[ADDRESS_174776] OLINDA 1.1 and ICRP 
60, or below 23  mSv based on IDAC -Dose 2.1 and ICRP 103, for all patients. The lifetim e attributable 
risk for incidence of radiation -induced cancer for an effective dose of 23  mSv is 0.4% (ICRP 103, 
2007), which is comparable to the risk from a diagnostic CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis (Smith -
Bindman, 2009).  
In the context of this phase  [ADDRESS_174777] will be performed. Patients with 
suspected metastatic disease  may undergo an optional additional whole body PET/CT scan, which 
would result in an additional radiation dose from the low -dose CT of approx imately  [ADDRESS_174778] acquisition protocol as mentioned above.  
Given the well -known safety and tolerability of radiolabelled girentuximab, confirmed for 89Zr- 
TLX250 in the context of a phase I safety study, and further considering the l ow antibody doses used 
in this study, no harmful effects exceeding the risk of established diagnostic imaging procedures are 
to be expected. The results of this study may contribute to the development of 89Zr-TLX250 as an 
improved imaging agent for ccRCC, allowing to avoid or delay the need for partial or total 
nephrectomy - a procedure associated with up to 20% overall complication, and 0.5 – 1.0% letality 
rate (Lowrance  et al.,  2010) – in patients with renal lesions of indeterminate dignity. Although, hig hly 
unlikely, 89Zr-TLX250 may cause allergic -type reactions. The study centres are well equipped to treat 
allergic/anaphylactic reactions.  
This study does not offer any treatment for patients with ccRCC; therefore, patients will be offered 
state of the art  therapeutic options after imaging with the study drug 89Zr-TLX250 . Cancer treatment 
will not be delayed by [CONTACT_28224].  
3.[ADDRESS_174779]; the investigator may not modify or alter the procedures described in this protocol. If protocol 
modifications are necessary, all alterations that are not solely of an administrative nature will require

4.3 Withdrawal  of Patients from Study Participation or Medication  
4.3.1  Withdrawal  
Patients may decide to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason without prejudice to their 
further medical care. The investigator may withdraw a patient for any of the following reasons:  
• Adverse event  (AE): if patient is unwilling to continue because of an AE or if continued 
participation of the patient would be an unnecessary risk to the patient’s health, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_151733].  
• Non-compliance  
• Protocol violation  
• Pregnancy  
• Lost to follow -up 
4.3.2  Withdrawal Procedures  
Although patients are not obliged to give their reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely from a trial, the 
investigator should make every effort to ascer tain the reason(s) for withdrawal while fully respecting 
the patient’s rights. The investigator will make every effort to contact [CONTACT_151778] (CRF) and , if possible,  the assessments outlined for ear ly 
withdrawal.  
A termination eCRF page is to be completed for every patient, whether or not the patient completed 
the study. The reason for any early discontinuation should be indicated on this form. The primary 
reason for a patient withdrawing prematurely should be selected from the following standard 
categories of early termination:  
• Safety Reason/AE: Clinical or laboratory events occurred that in the medical judgment of the 
investigator, for the best interest of the patient , are reasons  for dis continuation. This includes 
serious and non -serious AEs regardless of relation to study medication.  
• Protocol Violation: The patient’s findings or conduct failed to meet at least one protocol entry 
criteri on, met at least one exclusion criterion,  or failed to adhere to the protocol requirements 
(e.g., drug non -compliance, failure to return for defined number of visits) as judged by [CONTACT_151779]. The violation necessitated premature termination from the study.  
• Withdrawal of Consent: The patient  desired to withdraw from further participation in the study 
in the absence of an investigator -determined medical need to withdraw. If the patient gave a 
reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded in the eCRF.

for re -staging in patients after initial therapy.  The imaging methodology will be conducted according 
to the institutional routine practise.  
Pre-baseline  images w ill be collected for evidence of a  single  indeterminate renal mass  (IRM)  and 
for precise volumetric tumour delineation.  
A current contrast -enhanced abdominal MRI  or equivalent standard of care imaging  (based on 
national  standards) with contrast agent , not older than 90 days on Day 0, but conducted before any 
screening procedure, should be available, providing evidence of a newly diagnosed, single renal 
mass, confined to the kidney, and measuring ≤  [ADDRESS_174799] diameter (stage cT1) (inclusion 
criterion). Ultrasound images will not be acceptable.  
In the scope  of this clinical  study, no contrast -enhanced CT or MRI will be performed . 
Lesions of interest will be spatially localised by [CONTACT_151797]. The central image readers will not have access to the spatial localisation determined by [CONTACT_39722]. For lesions located within the kidney, spatial localisation should be conducted as follows  
- Definition of the diseased kidney (left or right)  
- Definition of the segment wi thin the kidney containing the lesion. The segments are based 
on Figure [ADDRESS_174800] should specify the segment location that 
was used to provide the tissue samples used for central analysis

8.2.1  89Zr-TLX250  PET / CT  Imaging   
[IP_ADDRESS]  PET/CT Imaging  
Abdominal  PET/CT scans including the kidneys will be acquired over 20 minutes in a single bed  
position at a single time point on Day  5 ± [ADDRESS_174805] admin istration  (p.a.) of 89Zr-TLX250  using static 
image acquisition  and low dose CT without contrast agent .  
Patients found to have evidence of N1 or M1 disease may undergo additional whole body imaging 
(skull base to mid-thigh ) using 6 -8 bed positions with 10 minute acquisition time per bed posit ion at 
the discretion of the treating clinician to support comprehensive staging. The additional scan if 
requested by [CONTACT_151760]  5 ± [ADDRESS_174806].  
8.2.2  Imaging Analysis  
Reading for the co -primary endpoints (sensitivity and specificity) will be conducted independently by 
3 trained readers, blind to history, and histology results.   
Details of th e assessments are described in the Image Review Charter that will be provided to the 
central reviewer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Qualitative 89Zr-TLX250  Tumour Targeting  
89Zr-TLX250  tumour uptake will qualitatively be assessed (yes /no), considering whether or not 89Zr-
TLX250  binding inside or in the vicinity of the target lesion, as delineated on structural imaging 
(contrast -enhanced p re-BL imaging ), can be detected.  
Local and centr al reviewers will designate the lesions as having a status of positive (ccRCC) or  
negative (other than ccRCC). The interpretation of the 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT images as positive or 
negative for ccRCC will be made on the basis of visual examination only.  
The lesion will be classified as PET -positive if:  
• Radioactivity in the lesion is clearly visible, AND  
• Radioactivity in the lesion is greater than that in normal tissue ( for example, in ipsilateral or 
contralateral kidney)  
If these two criteria are not met, the lesion will be classified as negative. A 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT scan 
is considered positive, if there is  at least one positive tumour lesion.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Quantitative 89Zr-girentuximab Tumour Targeting  
Absolute activity concentrations of tracer in tumour (MBq/cm³) will be calculated using attenuation -
corrected count rates, and tumour volumes, as determined by [CONTACT_22242] -enhanced pre -BL MRI  or 
equivalent imaging modality with contrast agent as part of the standard of care . Considering specific 
activity (MBq/m g), protein mass dose concentrations of tracer in tumour at the time point of imaging 
(mg/cm³) will be calculated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Estimation of 177Lu-girentuximab Tumour Targeting  
Protein mass dose concentrations of tracer in tumour (mg/cm³) at the single time point of i maging, 
and a general model of average girentuximab kinetics in tumour over time (derived from sequential 
89Zr-TLX250  biodistribution data), will be used, to estimate possible girentuximab protein kinetics in 
tumour lesions over a period of one week, assuming the kinetics of diagnostic 89Zr-girentuximab and 
therapeutic 177Lu-girentuximab are essentially similar. Such pro tein kinetic data can be used, to 
generate simulated time -activity curves for 177Lu-girentuximab in tumour for different specific activity 
levels, to yield estimates of achievable therapeutic absorbed doses to tumour (Gy).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local Review of PET/CT Images  
Local image review will involve qualitative assessment only and will follow the same guidelines as 
being used for the qualitative independent, blinded review. However, local reviewers will not be 
blinded with respect to patient data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Independent Central Revie w of PET/CT Images  
A blinded central review of the 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT images will be undertaken by [CONTACT_151798] (IRC) consisting of [ADDRESS_174807] to institution, histopathological diagnosis and clinical data. The central 
PET/CT reviewers will be asked to evaluate both kidneys and the link to the actually operated kidn ey 
will be done on the basis of the local pathology report retrospectively. This evaluation will be based 
on PET/CT images ( low dose CT proportion without contrast) only.  
Image sets covering extra -renal body regions will have all assessments conducted in the same way 
by [CONTACT_151799]. The readers will localise the region within the body of the lesion of interest and 
then identify it as PET positive or PET negative, based on comparative regional uptake of activity. 
The readers will be blinded  to the histology information on the tissue in question. In the event of 
multiple non -target lesions, the largest [ADDRESS_174808] diameter, in each organ , 
will be evaluated for PET response.  
Image data analyses will be performed by a cen tral image core lab. Qualitative visual analysis 
(presence or absence of localised 89Zr-TLX250  uptake inside or in vicinity of the target lesion, as 
seen on contrast -enhanced pre-BL imaging ), will be used to assess test performance of 89Zr-TLX250

8.3.1  Local Pathology Assessment  
Surgical resection material, along with appropriate documentation of its in situ origin, allowing 
identificat ion with lesion localisation on PET images will be sent to the local pathology department 
for routine histological work -up (H&E staining, histological diagnosis: ccRCC vs. non -ccRCC).  
If surgical material  is taken from extra -renal locations then samples of  this tissue should be prepared 
in the same way as renal samples and submitted for analysis in the same way.

8.8 Safety  
8.8.1  Baseline Findings  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Baseline Finding  
A baseline finding is defined as any untoward medical condition in a study patient who has signed 
the informed consent form but not yet received the first dose of the study drug. This includes 
conditions stabilised by [CONTACT_3148]. By [CONTACT_108], a baseline finding cannot be causally related to 
study drug; however, it may be c ausally related to the study (e.g.  caused by [CONTACT_3449] -conduct -related 
investigations).  
Differentiation between medical / surgical history and baseline findings:  
Conditions which started before signature [CONTACT_151847] (e.g., seasonal allergy without acute 
complaints) are recorded as medical / surgical history.  
Conditions which started before signature [CONTACT_151848] (e.g. allergic 
pollinosis) are recorded as baseline findings.  
Differentiation between baseline findings and adverse events:  
Conditions (e.g., abnormal physical exam ination findings, sym ptoms, diseases, laboratory ) present 
before the first administration of study drug will be documented as baseline findings.  
Conditions which started or deteriorated after the first administration of study drug will be 
documented as adv erse events.  
Categories, assessments and documentation of baseline findings  
The date and time of the first acute occurrence of the event is documented as the onset.  
If the baseline finding is "continuing" into the treatment phase, no AE is to be recorded i f, after start 
of study treatment, the event has the same or milder pattern and intensity. If the finding worsens in 
terms of either the pattern or intensity after study drug administration, the event must be documented 
as an AE.  
If the event is concluded,  this should be recorded in the eCRF ("resolved"). If the event vanishes but 
re-occurs during treatment, an AE with a start date of its re -occurrence should be entered.  
All baseline findings will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_151801]:

• Seriousness: for each baseline finding, the seriousness must be determined according to the 
criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . If serious, the baseline finding has to be handled in the same 
way as an SAE.  
• Intensity  
• Specific drug treatment  
• Specific non -drug treatment  
• Causal relationship to study conduct  
• Outcome  
The intensity of an event, the causal relationship to study condu ct, and the outcome of the baseline 
finding should be classified according to the same categories used for AEs, as specified in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Baseline Findings  
Definition  
Baseline findings will be regarded as serious if they meet the criteria used for defining serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and will be reported on the SAE form (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
8.8.2  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Adverse Event  
The definition s below follow International Conference on Harmoni zation (ICH) – Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) (see also ICH Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting):  
Adverse event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have  a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
By [CONTACT_108], for this study, all AEs are regarded as 'treatment emergent', i.e., not seen before 
treatment or, if already present before treatment, worsened after start of treatment.  
Pre-planned or elective surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_151741]’s source documents 
but are not to be considered AEs unless there was any change to the patient’s medical condition 
during the AE collection period.

All AEs will be assessed and d ocumented by [CONTACT_151802]  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Categories of Adverse Event Assessment  
Seriousness  
The serio usness must be determined for each AE, according to the criteria given in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Intensity  
The intensity of an AE is classified according to NCI-CTCAE version 5.0, taking into account the 
possible range of the intensity of the event:  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 (mild)  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 (moderate)  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 (severe)  
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 4 (life -threaten ing) 
• NCI-CTCAE Grade 5 (fatal ) 
Study drug action  
AEs requiring any action, i.e. medication or therapy for treatment, should be treated according to 
recognised standards of medical care to protect the health and well -being of the patient.  
Any potential stud y drug action to resolve the AEs is to be documented as follows  
• Drug withdrawn  
• Dose reduced  
• Dose not changed  
• Other action (stopped: definitely, temporarily with exact dates)  
Any potential study drug action to resolve the AEs is to be documented in free text in the eCRF, e.g. 
'dose interrupted', 'dose interrupted and re -started' . 
Causal relationship to study drug  
The possible causal relationship between the AE and the administr ation of the study drug is classified 
according to the following question : 
“Is there a reasonable likelihood that the event was caused by [CONTACT_5257]?”

Possible answers are:  
• Related (plausible time relationship to the administration of IMP/RP. No plausi ble explanation 
by [CONTACT_151803]/concurrent disease or other drugs/events) ,  
• Possible (plausible time relationship to the administration of IMP/RP , but the AE can be also 
plausibly explained by [CONTACT_151804]/concurrent disease or other medicinal products  / 
events),  
• Unlikely (unlikely temporal relationship to the administration of IMP/RP . Other medicinal 
products, events, and the underlying/concurrent disease provide a plausible explanation)  
• Not related (clear evidence that the AE is not connected to the IM P/RP administration)  
• Not assessable (no evaluation possible based on present data, additional clarification and 
follow -up necessary)  
Causal relationship to study conduct  
The possible causal relationship between the AE and any study -conduct -related procedur es and 
activities required by [CONTACT_151805] : 
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and the study conduct other than 
the relationship to study drug is based on the following question : 
“Is there a reasonable likelihood that the event was caused by [CONTACT_50467]? ” 
Possible answers are “related”, “not related”, “not assessable”.  
Outcome  
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
• Recovered  
• Recovered  with sequelae  
• Ongoing  
• Fatal  
• Unknown.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment and Documentation of Adverse Events  
At every assessment time point during the study until EOS, the patient will be asked a non -leading 
question such as “ Have you had any health problems since you were last a sked / since your last 
visit? ”. All AEs reported in response to questioning, as well as AEs reported spontaneously and

occurring at any other time, will be recorded on the ‘adverse event’ page(s) in the eCRF, regardless 
of causality.  
If an AE fulfils any o f the SAE criteria, both the AE pages of the eCRF and the Serious Adverse 
Event Form must be completed. SAEs are recorded for the entire duration of the study.  
For both serious and non -serious AEs, documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_151806]’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533]. Required information includes: the type of AE, seriousness of the event, start date, 
date of resolution, actions required, outcome and an ass essment of its relationship to study drug and 
an estimate of its severity (using National Cancer Institute -Common Toxicity Criteria [ NCI-CTCAE] 
criteria , version 5.0, see Appendix I ). NCI-CTCAE severity will be marked in the SAE Report Form 
using the numer ic grades: grade 1 (mild), grade 2 (moderate), grade 3 (severe), grade 4 (life -
threatening) and grade 5 (fatal).  
All abnormal laboratory , vital signs and [ADDRESS_174815] also be reported on a Serious 
Adverse Event Form.  
All AEs that meet one criteri on for “serious” require the completion of an SAE Rep ort Form, in 
addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the patients’ eCRF. This applies to all SAEs, whether 
or not they were considered to be related to study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Adverse Events  
Expected Conduct -related AEs  
The use of an indwelling can nula for the purpose of blood sampling and administration of study drug 
may be accompanied by [CONTACT_151807], in rare cases, by [CONTACT_151808]. After initial irritation, the presence of an indwelling cannula is usually pa inless and hardly 
noticeable. The same applies to single vein punctures for blood sampling.  
Patients may also experience discomfort from lying in the camera, e.g. back pain.  
Expected Adverse Drug Reactions  
The definition below follows ICH -GCP (see also ICH  Guideline for Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting):  
Adverse drug reaction (ADR)  
In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usages, particularly 
as the therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, all noxious and unintended responses to a 
medicinal product related to any dose should be considered as ADR. The phrase 'responses to a

 Clinical Study Protocol  
89Zr-TLX250 -003 Version: 8.0 
Date: 01-Apr-[ADDRESS_174816]' means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at 
least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  
An overview on the ADRs that were observed in clini cal studies with 89Zr-TLX250  or girentuximab 
radiolabelled with comparable radionuclides can be retrieved from the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as any adverse drug experience, the nature, 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. 
investigator’s brochure for an unapproved investigational product or  Summary of Product 
Characteristics for an approved product). “Unexpected” as used in this definition refers to an adverse 
drug experience that has not been previously observed and included in the product information, 
rather than from the perspective of su ch experience not being anticipated from the pharmacological 
properties of the investigational product. Any unexpected ADR , as of formal criteria of an SAE may 
not be met, (see above), has to be reported by [CONTACT_151809], using an SAE form.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
The following SAE definition is based on ICH guidelines and the final rule issued by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA) and effective 06  Apr 1998. It is to be appli ed to both, AEs (defined in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and baseline findings (defined in Section  8.8.1 ). 
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose  
• Results in death, or  
• Is life threatening, or  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18973], or  
• Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect . 
The term ‘life threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death 
at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to also 
report an AE as serious in other situations, such as important medi cal events  that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151742]. These 
should also usually be consi dered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an

emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Actions and Reporting Obligations in Case of Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs that meet the criteria for serious require the completion of a SAE Report Form, in addition to 
being recorded on the AE pages of the patients’ eCRF. This applies to all SAEs, whether o r not they 
were considered to be related to study treatment.  
SAEs must be reported within 24 hours , once the Investigator or other study site personnel are 
aware of the event. The reporting is delegated by [CONTACT_151810] (see page 
5). An initial written report should be prepared using the SAE Report Form and faxed to the Sponsor. 
This report should provide a detailed description of the SAE. Any other relevant documents such as 
anonymised copi[INVESTIGATOR_151743],  if available. If it is not possible to notify 
the Sponsor by [CONTACT_87109] 24 hours, an initial notification by [CONTACT_151811], to include 
the following information:  
• Identification of the Investigator and centre.  
• Patient number and initials  
• Confirmation of study medication given, with date and dose.  
• Concomitant medication and indication for using such medication.  
• Information on the event, including date and time of onset of symptoms, severity, resolution 
(if applicable), date of death or othe r outcome (as applicable).  
• Relationship with study medication in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
All reports of death, both toxic death and death as a result of progression of disease, should be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately using the SAE Report Log. A detailed description of the cause 
of death should be provided. Autopsy reports, if available, should also be sent to the Sponsor as 
soon as they become available. Any additional information which becomes known to the Investigator 
should be provided in a fol low-up report.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Relevant Safety Information  
The following other safety relevant information must be documented in the patient medical record as 
well as in the AE pages of the eCRF, even if side effects (ADRs) resulting from the event were not 
observed . 
Additionally, for all events (post -study related safety information, pregnancies, overdose, drug 
interaction, medication error ) that fulfil the criteria for seriousness, an SAE Form must be completed 
by [CONTACT_151812].

a) Post-study related safety information  
Any SAE (including deaths) which occurs until the final study  visit should be reported  by [CONTACT_151813].  
b) Pregnancies  
Every effort will be made to avoid pregnancy during the use of the IMP . Pregnancies occurring during 
the study (foetal exposure to the IMP) need to be reported.  
In case of pregnancy during the study, the investigator should complete the Pregnancy Notification 
Form and send or fax it to the project manager or designee.  
Follow -up information on the outcome of mother and foetus will be requested by a sponsor 
representative.  
Overdose, int eraction, and medication error  
The following safety relevant information  should be reported as AE or, if the reaction fulfils one of 
the criteria for seriousness, as SAE.  
c) Drug overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatmen t at a dose higher than 
specified in the protocol and higher than the known therapeutic dose that is of clinical relevance. The 
reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose  and reported accordingly using the Adverse Event 
reporting form . 
d) Drug interaction  
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance or medicinal product affects the activity of an 
IMP, i.e. increases or decreases  its effects, or produces as effect that none of the products would 
exhibit on its own. The reaction must be clearly iden tified as a drug interaction.  
e) Medication error  
A medication error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal product 
which may be caused by [CONTACT_151814], presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging, or instructions 
for use/lab elling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication error.

9 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
The study design, statistical hypotheses, s ample size calculations, and statistical methods selected 
for this study are based on previous scientific advice granted by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA) for a planned confirmatory study with girentuximab as an imaging agent.  
9.[ADDRESS_174824] of Variables and Population Characteristics  
9.1.1  Co-Primary Variables  
The primary study objective is to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy in all patients by [CONTACT_151815] 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT imaging to threshold s of 0.70  (sensitivity) and 0.68 
(specificity) , using histology as standard of truth.  
The co -primary variables  of this study will be the s ensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-TLX250  PET/CT 
imaging to detect ccRCC.  
a) Sensitivity is defined as  the proportion of study patients  with a true positi ve (TP) 89Zr-TLX250 
PET/CT scan  (detection of clear cell carcinoma) , relative to those with positive 
histo patho logical diagnosis  for ccRCC:  
  Sensitivity (%) = TP / ( TP + FN)  
b) Specificity is defined as  the proportion of study patients  with a true negative  (TN) 89Zr-TLX250 
PET/CT imaging result (no ccRCC) , relative to those with a negative histo patho logical 
diagnosis  of non-ccRCC  (histological result:= TN + FP) :  
  Specificity (%) = TN / (TN + FP)  
The sensitivity and specificity of 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT imaging will be compared separately to the ir 
respective prespecified  threshold s. The comparison of sensitivity/specificity data will be based on data 
from the following 2x2 table ( Table 5) which summari ses the results of the qualitative 89Zr-TLX250 
tumour targeting (tracer uptake in target lesion: yes/no) as determined by [CONTACT_151816] .

The point estimate of sensitivity of PET/CT is  TP/(TP+FN)  and the point estimate of specificity is  
TN/(TN+FP) . Wilson’s binomial (score) confidence intervals will be used to compare the 95% 
confidence inter val lower bound ary of each quantity to the threshold of 0.70  (sensitivity)  and 0.68  
(specificity) . 
Note that both sensitivity and specificity will be determined for each of three independent readers. 
The study will be successful if the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for sensitivity 
(>70%) and specificity (>68%) in at least the same  2 out of 3 independent readers.   
9.1.2  Secondary Variables  and Exploratory Analyses  
To investigate diagnostic performance in the subgroup of patients with small lesions ( cT1a, 
dimension ≤  [ADDRESS_174826] diameter), sensitivity and specificity with corresponding Wilson (score) 
95% CIs  will be calculated for such patients.  
In addition to the primary efficacy parameters  (sensitivity , specificity ), the positive predictive value, 
the negative predictive value and the accuracy will also be calculated as secondary effica cy 
parameters using data from patients in the subgroup of tumo urs ≤ [ADDRESS_174827] diameter.  
Sensitivity and specificity in the cT1a group will be the key secondary endpoints; while positive 
predictive value, the negative predictive value and the accuracy  in the cT1a group  will be additional  
secondary endpoints.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Predictive Values  and Accuracy  
a) Positive predictive value (PPV)  
The positive predictive value is defined as the probability that a positive histopathology diagnosis 
was obtained given that the result of the 89Zr-TLX PET/CT scan is positive (detection of ccRCC).  
  PPV (%) = TP / (TP + FP)  
b) Negative predictive value (PPV)

The negative predictive value  is defined as the probability that a negative histopathology 
diagnosis was obtained given that the result of the 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT scan is negative (no 
detection of ccRCC).  
  NPV (%) = TN / (TN + FN)  
c) Accuracy  
The accuracy or probability of a correct test result is defined as the probability that the 89Zr-
TLX250 PET/CT scan result is correct, i.e. the probability that the PET/CT scan is positive if the 
histopathological diagnosis for ccRCC is positive or that th e PET/CT scan is negative if the 
histopathological diagnosis for ccRCC is negative.  
  Accuracy (%) = TP + TN / (TP + FP + TN + FP)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Standardi zed Uptake Value (SUV)  
89Zr-TLX250  SUVs will be determined for each tumour lesion. Receiver operating characteristics 
(ROC) will be analysed, to identify a SUV cut -off value, most appropriate to discriminate between 
ccRCC or non -ccRCC as evidenced by [CONTACT_151775].  
SUV = C image  / (injected dose / body weight)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inter -reader  Variability  
Fleiss´ kappa statistics will be used to determine the agreement between the qualitative visual 
assessment of 89Zr-TLX250  tumour targeting (tracer uptake in target lesion: yes/no), as assessed 
by [CONTACT_151817]  (section [IP_ADDRESS] ). An intra -class kappa of 0.70 or higher will be 
considered as an acceptable value.  Note that both sensitivity and specificity will be determined for 
each of three independent readers. The study will be successful if the lower bounds of the 95% 
confidence i ntervals (CIs) for sensitivity (>70%) and specificity (>68%) in at least the same  2 out of 
3 independent readers.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intra -reader  Variability  
Intra-reader variability will be assessed by [CONTACT_151818] 3 independent blinded readers perform 
2 image evaluat ions on a randomly selected set of 10% cases. A washout period will be introduced 
between the two interpretations to minimize recall bias. The percent of agreement between the two 
interpretations will be computed for each reader. Cohen´s  kappa statistics w ill be used to determine 
the reproducibility of the qualitative visual assessment by [CONTACT_151819].

[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory Variables  
In situ biological half life of girentuximab protein in tumour lesions will be estimated, using a general 
model of average girentuximab kinetics in tumour tissue, derived from serial 89Zr-TLX250 imaging. 
Based on (a) protein residence times in the lesions,  (b) an assumed specific activity of therapeutic 
labelling with Lutetium -177 (177Lu), and (c) the measured tumour lesion volume (CT dimensions), an 
achievable therapeutic absorbed dose to tumour (Gy), will be determined for several specific 
activities and hypothetical activity doses of 177Lu. 
Exploratory analyses will be delineated in more detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to 
analysis  including extra-renal lesions used as a histology standard of truth (when N1 or M1 
disseminated disease is  suspected)  
Additional exploratory investigations correlating the 89Zr-TLX250 tumour lesion SUVs, semi -
quantitation of CAIX expression as determined by [CONTACT_151822], and e valuation of the 
distant masses outside the kidney identified on 89Zr-TLX250 whole body PET/CT in patients with 
unexpected evidence of disseminated disease  will be conducted.

9.2.1  General Considerations  
The aim of this study is to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, as well as accuracy of 89Zr-
TLX250  PET/CT imaging using a 37  MBq (1  mCi) activity dose to detect ccRCC in patients with IRM 
of stage cT1, and who are scheduled for partial or total nephrectomy.  
Histological confirmation from nephrectomy (or biopsies of extrarenal lesions from patients in wh om 
unexpected evidence of disseminated disease is observed) will serve as standard of truth . The 
qualitative 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT imaging assessment s of 3 independent readers will be the primary 
imaging result . 
All data will be listed and trial summary tables will be provided. Descriptive statistics will be 
presented. S econdary  variables will be summarized. The statistical evaluation will be performed by 
[CONTACT_4696]® statistical software (version 9.4, or higher ). 
9.2.2  Analysis Sets  
The Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  will consist of all enrolled patients who have evaluable PET/CT imaging 
and have a confirmed histopathology diagnosis (Table 2).  
The Safety Analysis Set  (SAF) will consist of all patients who received 89Zr-TLX250 .

For all  variables  (primary and secondary) , the statistical analyses in this study will be  descriptive ly 
using exploratory statistics . 
Descriptive analyses will include:  
• Mean, standard derivation, median and range for continuous variables,  
• Median, range and frequency distribution for discrete (ordinal) variables,  
• Frequency distribution for nom inal variables  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Primary and Key Secondary Objective s 
Within this trial, two co -primary endpoints (sensitivity and specificity) shall be analysed.  
The analysis for sensitivity uses only those patients with a positive histopathological diagnosis of 
clear cell carcinoma. These are expected to be about 70% of the included patient population.  
Sensitivity of 89Zr-TLX250 will be considered adequate if the lower boundary  of a 95% Wilson 
(score) confidence interval for sensitivity is higher than 0.[ADDRESS_174831] the same two of three 
independent readers . 
The analysis for specificity uses only those patients with a negative histopathological diagnosis of 
clear cell carcinoma. These are expected to be about 30% of the included patient population.  
Specif icity of 89Zr-TLX250 will be considered adequate if the lower bound ary of a 95% Wilson 
(score) confidence interval for specificity is higher than 0.[ADDRESS_174832] the same two of three 
independent readers.  Two-sided tests will be consistently used in the evaluation.  
To account for multiplicity and to control Type I error under the paradigm of two co -primary endpoints, 
sensiti vity and specificity will each be estimated at the 5% significance level. For the study to be 
deemed successful, the lower limit of t he 95% Wilson confidence interval for both sensitivity and 
specifity must exceed their respective pre -specified thresholds.   
Assuming the null hypothesis is rejected for both co -primary endpoints, formal statistical testing will 
proceed to the family of Ke y Secondary Endpoints (i.e., sensitivity and specificity in the cT1a group). 
Within this family, the fixed -sequence method will first assess sensitivity, followed by [CONTACT_151824]. 
Results pertaining to specificity will only be considered formal evidence if the null hypothesis 
pertaining to sensitivity is rejected.

9.3 Determination of Sample Size  
It is planned  to include approximately 252  evaluable patients in  the study .  
9.3.1  Sample Size Estimation  
The study sample size for the population of patients with indeterminate renal mass (i.e., patients with 
cT1 tumors) has 2 components: Sensitivity and Specificity. Sample size is estimated for Sensitivity 
and Specificity, respectively, and the larger of the  two estimates will represent the final study sample 
size. The basic assumptions underlying sample size estimation are the following:  
• In the population of patients with indeterminate renal mass (i.e. cT1 patient population), 
approximately 70% are cT1a and 30% are cT1b patients.  
• In the cT1a subpopulation, approximately a third (34%) are expected to show no signs of 
renal cell carcinoma following histopathology assessment (i.e. ccRCC negative).  
• It is expected from a clinical standpoint that the subpopulation of cT1b patients would show 
a much lower rate of negative histopathologies than the cT1a subpopulation. For the purpose 
of powering this trial, it is assumed that the rate of non -ccRCC histopathologies in the cT1b 
subpopulation would be at least 17%, half the rate in the cT1a subpopulation.  
Sensitivity:  to ensure the study has 90% power to show that the lower limit of the 2 -sided 9 5% 
confidence interval (Wilson) for sensitivity is above the critical limit (or non -inferiority limit) of 70%, 
the minimum sample size required for the population of cT1 patients under above assumptions is 
125, when assuming a true sensitivity of 83%.  
Spec ificity: to ensure the study has 90% power to show that the lower limit of the 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval (Wilson) for the specificity is above the critical limit (or non -inferiority limit) of 
68%, the minimum sample size required for the population o f cT1 patients under above assumptions 
is 252, when assuming a true specificity of 83%.   
An estimated total of 252 patients with an IRM of ≤ 7 cm and scheduled partial or radical 
nephrectomy will be included in the study. However, in order to maintain adeq uate study power, this 
number may be increased depending on  the proportion of non -ccRCC patients after surgery and 
histological verification.  
Table 6 provides an example of the expected sample size required with different observed non -
ccRCC rates.

9.3.2  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee  (IDMC)  will be established by [CONTACT_151825]1a and cT1b tumors , and with ccRCCpositive ccRCCnegative 
tumors  and give feedback to the sponsor on whether the planned sample size is appropriate or not.  
The IDMC will evaluate p atient accrual and histological results at 50% (126) and 75% (189) of 
evaluable cases . Counts of evaluable cas es (excluding cases where 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT imaging 
and/or tissue collection were either not performed or are pending) in 4 categories based on initial 
tumour size (cT1a, cT1b) and IRM histology ( ccRCC, non -ccRCC).  The IDMC will provide feedback 
to the sp onsor of whether the proposed sample size will be likely to be sufficient or not. Based upon 
this feedback the sponsor may consider an amendment to the protocol that could modify inclusion 
criteria to include only cT1a patients subsequently or to increase the sample size to ensure sufficient 
power.   
Enrollment will not be halted during the data review procedure . 
The IDMC members will not review 89Zr-TLX250 PET/CT images or imaging data , nor will they have 
access to the results generated by [CONTACT_151826] .

10 Data Handling a nd Quality A ssurance  
10.1 Data R ecording  
10.1.1  Source Data and Records  
Source data are defined as all information related to clinical findings, observations, or other activities 
in the study, written down in o riginal records or  certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_63062], allowing 
reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical study.  
The investigator will maintain adequate source records (e.g. case histories or patient files for each 
patient enrolled). Source records s hould be preserved for the maximum period of time required by 
[CONTACT_427].  
For each patient enrolled, the investigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the patient 
participates in this study.  
All data entered in the eCRF must be supported b y source data in the patient records.  
10.1.2  Electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF)  
For this study , patient data will be entered into a sponsor defined electronic case report form (eCRF)  
within the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system , transmitted electronically to t he sponsor or 
designee and combined with data provided from other sources in a validated data system. The case 
report form will be supplied for recording all study data from each patient. It is the responsibility of 
the investigator to ensure that the eCRFs are completed in full. All data therein must be supported 
by [CONTACT_151827].  
The investigator may authori ze site staff (e.g. sub -investigators, nurses) to enter study data into the 
validated EDC system. This must be documented in the Delegation of Authority Log signed by [CONTACT_1275].  
All site personnel will be trained on the EDC system and study specific eCRFs prior to receiving 
access to the live database for data entry.  
The site will also receive approved eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist data entry and 
data issues/questions. Once the data base is active, the site will be notified to begin data entry. 
Additional site training may be provided as refreshers throughout the study, if needed.

completed for every patient who signed an informed consent. The eCRFs must be kept up -to-date 
so that they always reflect the latest observations on the patient.  
Study monitors will perform source data verification as defined for the study.  
If any errors or discrepancies in the eCRFs are found during data entry or review, discrepanc ies will 
be generated within the EDC system, and ‘manual’ queries will be generated by [CONTACT_5640] a monitor or 
data management.  
Discrepancies and queries can only be corrected by [CONTACT_093](s) or other authorised site 
personnel. Study monitors must never  enter or correct date in the eCRF. An audit trail in the EDC 
documents all changes to the data over the entire study period.  
In all cases, patient  initials or personal data will not be collected by [CONTACT_151828].  
10.1.3  Missing Data  
If any information is not available, and it is considered by [CONTACT_151829] 
(e.g. the weight at a particular visit was not recorded), the Investigator will score out the question 
box in the eCRF and, if appropriate, explai n, on the eCRF, why the investigation was missed out 
(e.g. the patient was not well enough to undergo the procedure).  
Since patients who do not have evaluable PET/CT or do not have a confirmed histopathology 
diagnosis are considered drop -outs and replaced (Section Error ! Reference source not found. ); 
missing data are not expected for efficacy outcomes which involve the standard of truth (i.e., 
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, inter -reader and intra -reader variability).  
10.1.4  Storage of Study Records  
It will be the responsibility of the Investigator to guarantee adequate storage for all study records, 
including the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151747] a minimum of 15 years  following the en d of the 
study , or as per current national regulations . If he/she leaves the employ of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151748]/she will 
inform the sponsor and nominate a contact [CONTACT_151830].  
The investigator should take measures to prevent a ccidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.  
Essential documents shall be archived in such a way that ensures that they are readily available 
upon authorities’ request.

The investigator’s site file  (ISF) is not to be destroyed without the sponsor’s approval. The 
investigator’s contract will contain all regulations relevant for the study centre.  
Archiving is described in Section 10.6. 
10.2 Monitoring  
This study will be monitored at all stages of its development by [CONTACT_151831] / CRO. Monitoring will include personal visits and telephone communication to 
ensure that the investigation is conducted accordin g to the protocol and in order to comply with 
guidelines of GCP and applicable regulatory requirements. On -site review of eCRFs will include a 
review of data entries in the EDC for completeness and clarity, and consistency with source 
documents available f or each patient.  Additionally, remote checks of eCRF entries by [CONTACT_151832], if required.  
Each eCRF will be reviewed on site and checks will be made against source documents  to ensure 
accurate, authentic and complete data that reflects the actu al experience of the patient in the study 
(see Section  10.1.2 ). In addition, monitoring must ensure that the safety and rights of subjects are 
being protected. The Investigator must ensure that the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151749]. The Sponsor will not keep any records of patients’ full identity.  
To this end, the Investigator agrees to allow regular visits (fre quency depending on recruitment, but 
estimated at monthly) by [CONTACT_151833] a suitable area in which to work 
(e.g. a desk) and adequate access to study personnel and documents.  
Medical monitors and clinical research associates (CRAs) or assistants may request to witness 
patient evaluations occurring as part of this protocol. The investigator and appropriate personnel will 
be periodically requested to attend meetings or trainings organised by [CONTACT_151834].  
10.3 Data Processing  
The coordinating CRO (ABX -CRO) will be responsible for the processing and quality control of data. 
Data management will be carried out as described in the CRO’s standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) for clinical studies  to en sure the integrity of the data, e.g. removing errors and 
inconsistencies of the data . This includes double data entry into the electronic database, generation 
and resolution of data queries.  
Data entry into database will be carried out by [CONTACT_151835] a ccording to SOPs for clinical studies 
at ABX -CRO, Dresden, [LOCATION_013]. Data entry and correction will be tracked by a validated audit trail. 
All systems are validated and compliant to FDA’s ordinance 21 CFR part  11.

The FDA -validated medical dictionary MedDRA  will be used for data coding (e.g., AEs, baseline 
findings, medication, medical/surgical history). The processes used for coding will be specified in the 
SAP.  
10.4 Data Confidentiality  
10.4.1  Documentation of Patient´s Participation  
For all patients who give informed  consent, regardless of whether they receive any study medication, 
the Investigator must record patient identification data in the "Patient Identification List" (full name, 
initials, date of birth, patient identification code). The patient identification l ist must allow for the 
definite identification of any patient that takes part in the study. In addition, study participation must 
be documented in the patient’s regular medical records.  For details about patient identification, see 
Section  4.4. 
10.4.[ADDRESS_174835] the patient's identity, a unique patient identification code will be assigned by [CONTACT_151836]'s name [CONTACT_151849]/or other trial related data. Thus, this number, rather than the patient's name, will 
appear on all documents and will be cross -referenced by [CONTACT_102]'s date of birth. Personal 
information will be treated as confidential, but may need to be reviewed by [CONTACT_7676], the ethics 
committee and regulatory authorities.  
In order to be compliant with any country -specific laws, all relevant submissions to the respective 
author ities will be done and the corresponding approvals will be obtained before collection of any 
data considered to be sensitive, such as: ethnic origin, race, full date of birth etc.  
10.5 Auditing  
A member of the sponsor’s (or the coordinating CRO´s) quality assur ance unit may arrange to visit 
the investigator in order to audit the performance of the study at the study site and the study 
documents originating there. The auditor(s) will usually be accompanied by a CRA or the study team 
lead. The investigator will be  informed about the outcome of the audit.  
In addition, inspections by [CONTACT_151837] - including foreign authorities - and IEC(s) 
/ IRB(s) are possible at any time. The investigator is to notify the sponsor of any such inspection 
immediat ely.

13.2 Patient Information and Consent  
All relevan t information on the study will be summarized in an integrated patient information and 
consent sheet provided by [CONTACT_151839]. A sample patient information and 
informed consent form is provided as a document separate to this protocol.  
Based on this patient information sheet, the investigator will explain all relevant aspects of the study 
to each patient, before his / her entry into the study (i.e., before examinations and procedures 
associated with selection for the study are performed).  
The investigator will also mention that written approval of the IRB / IEC has been obtained.  
Each patient  will have ample time and opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the 
right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvan tage and without having to provide 
reasons for this decision.  
Following this informative discussion, the patient will be asked if he / she is willing to sign and 
personally date a statement of informed consent, which includes consenting to the processing o f his 
/ her data as explained in the patient information sheet. Only if the patient voluntarily agrees to sign 
the informed consent form and has done so, may he / she enter the study. Additionally, the 
investigator will personally sign and date the form, t oo. The patient will receive a duplicate of the 
signed and dated form.  
The signed informed consent statement is to remain in the ISF or, if locally required, in the patient’s 
file of the medical institution.  In addition, the consent process will be docume nted in the source 
documents with an independent entry.  
The investigator will document in the eCRF the time and date of obtaining informed consent. In the 
event that informed consent is obtained on the date that baseline study procedures are performed, 
the study record or patient's clinical record must clearly show that informed consent was obtained 
prior to these procedures.  
The informed consent form and any other written information provided to patients will be revised 
whenever important new information b ecomes available that may be relevant to the patient’s 
consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change to the content of the 
patient information and/or the written informed consent form. The investigator will inform the patien t 
of changes in a timely manner and will ask the patient  to confirm his/her participation in the study by 
[CONTACT_23667]. Any revised written informed consent form and written 
information must receive the IRB / IEC's approval in advance of use.

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the most common non-cutaneous cancer diagnosis in 
males, with an estimated 174,650 new cases in 2019 [2]. After lung cancer, PCa 
accounts for the second highest mortality in men. Localized PCa, often screen -
detected using prostate specifi c antigen (PSA) based blood tests , is highly variable 
in clinical course and risk of progression. Treatment is therefore matched on this 
basis, and includes Active Surveillance for Low -Risk PCa, whereas Intermediate -
and High -Risk PCa are treated by [CONTACT_361946] (external beam or 
brachytherapy) or surgery (radical prostatectomy). While durable cure can be 
achieved by [CONTACT_361947],  biochemical relapse occurs in approximately 35% of 
who have undergone treatment for localized disease [3]. 
There is significant interest in identifying individuals at highest risk of 
biochemical relapse, using a variety of approaches, including genomic -based 
biomarkers. Identification of metastatic diseas e beyond of the prostate is critical, not 
only for potentially targeted local -therapy (e.g. surgical resection of recurrence or 
targeted radiation therapy) but earlier use of aggressive adjuvant radiation or 
systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Imaging based identification  of low volume disease outside of

Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   8 the prostate has been limited by [CONTACT_361948] -sectional tomography (CT), 
which relies on nodal morphology (size). The sensitivity of CT or MRI based 
imaging for the detection lymph node metastasis is in the ran ge of 30 -80%[4]. 
Detection of bone metastasis once present as osteoblastic lesions can be identified 
by [CONTACT_4210] -scintigraphy, again with limed sensitivity, especially in asymptomatic 
patients w ith PSA levels below 20 [5]. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_238307], CT and whole 
body bone scans are wid ely accepted as the primary imaging modality for staging 
patients, particularly with localized PCa.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Molecular imaging using various targets and positron emission tomography (PET) 
tracers have been used to improve detection of recurrent prostate cancer. 18F - or 
11C labeled choline as well as 11C -acetate have been previously investigated [6,7] .  
Their clinical utility has been limited by [CONTACT_105] -specific uptake in benign tissue, 
including benign prosta tic hypertrophy [8].  18F-Fluciclovine has recently been 
approved owing to it improvement over 11C [9]. Targeting of prostate -specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA) by [CONTACT_361949]. PSMA ( glutamate carboxypeptidase II, N -acetyl -a-linked acidic dipeptidase  
I, or folate hydrolase) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the M28 
peptidase family is preferentially overexpressed in prostate cancer cells relative to 
other cells. Other tissues may also express PSMA, including kidney, small intestine 
or salivary glands. Importantly, PSMA expression is maintained and may increase 
through the full spectrum of prostate cancer, including advanced disease [10].   
Methods have focused on labeling ligands (Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx) -
[68Ga(HBED -CC)] also known as 68 -PSMA -11) to PSMA with [ADDRESS_450850] between normal and cancerous 
tissues which aids in optimal imaging characteristics [11,12] . Initial studies showed 
that labeling of PSMA -ligand with 68 -Ga allowed improved identification of PCa 
recurrence and metastasis [13].  
 
Early data has demonstrated the utility of 68Ga -PSMA with respect to improved 
accuracy of detection and in turn significant impact on  treatment decisions [14]. A 
recent meta -analysis of 68Ga -PSMA PET studies showed promising detection of 
metastasis following biochemical recurrence, even at low PSA levels [PSA >0.2 
68GA -PSMA 11  Version :5 
Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   9 ng/ml (33% detection rate) and PSA 0.2 –0.5 ng/ ml (45% detection rate)] [15]. 
Importantly, the vast majority of these studies have been reported from 
retrospective data . 
 
In our study we plan to prospectively study the accuracy and utility of 68Ga -
PSMA [ADDRESS_450851] of the treatment related decisions.  
 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
 
The investigational study may determine the presence of disease outside of the 
prostate that is resectable at the time of the surgery  and that  may improve long 
term outcomes.  
 
 
2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
• Study Imaging Drug Risk: Possible side effects such as  rash, nausea, 
headache or fatigue. In clinical studies that used 68Ga -PSMA -11 in the 
same amount being used in this study, no serious adverse events were 
reported.  
• PET/CT scan radiation risk:  the max imum amount of radiation from  this 
study is equivalent to 2.[ADDRESS_450852] 
scan performed to process the  PET data. The total radiation dose from the 
study procedure is less than 1/10th the annual exposure allowed for 
occup ational workers. Although there are no proven harmful effects from 
this amount of radiation, long -term effects, such as cancer, cannot be ruled 
out with certainty. This dose estimate takes into account only the exposure 
to research procedures in this study . 
• Other risk:  pain and infection at the site of the needle stick for the study 
drug injection or for blood drawn for the blood tests.

3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR 
ENDPOINT S 
Primary    
 
1. To evaluate the tissue 
distribution of 68GA -
PSMA -11 PET/CT 
imaging in normal 
tissues and biopsy 
proven tumor and 
non-tumorous regions 
of the prostate,  and  
also pelvis    lymph 
nodes in patients 
undergoing standard 
of care prostatectomy 
and bilateral lymp h 
node dissection  in 
high risk patients  
 
2. To determine the 
proportion of patients 
in which 68GA -
PSMA -11 PET /CT 
altered the planned 
clinical management  
  
1. Proportion of 
patients with  
cTxNoMo 
(clinically  
localized 
disease) found 
on final 
histological 
examination to 
have lymph node 
involvement as 
determined by  
68GA -PSMA -11 
PET.  
 
2. Proportion of 
patients in which 
68GA -PSMA -11 
PET/CT altered 
the planned 
clinical 
management.  
  
1. Determining the usefulness 
of PSMA PET /CT requires 
defining its’ ability to 
identify lymphatic or 
metastatic spread that 
heretofore has not been 
detectable by [CONTACT_361950].  
 
2. Understanding whether and 
why 68GA -PSMA -11 
PET/CT findings alter 
treatment plans is critical in 
defining its role in the 
diagnostic  tools urologists 
use to manage their patients 
with prostate  cancer.  
Secondary    
 
 
1. To correlate the 
intensity of 68Ga -
PSMA -11 uptake  
1. 68Ga -PSMA -11 
PET/CT 
intensity is 
variable, and we 
will evaluate  
1. To identify those 
patients in whom more 
localized or extended 
therapy might be 
indicated , it is important 
68GA -PSMA 11  Version :5 
Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021

with standard of care 
diagnostic imaging 
modalities, additional 
biopsy results, or 
clinical follow -up 
performed at the 
discretion of the 
referring physician  
 
 what intensity 
endpoint is 
predictable of 
tissue 
involvement.  
 
2. To compare and 
contrast findings 
in 68Ga -PSMA -
11 PET/CT with 
standard 
diagnostic 
modalities of  
bone scans, CTs 
and MRIs  
 
 
 
 to know in equivocal 
68Ga -PSMA PET /CT 
readings what the true 
positive results 
histopathologically  are 
in order to avoid 
possible over / under 
treatment.  
 
2.  Based on histologic 
results comparing 
standard radiographic 
modalities to 68Ga 
PSMA  11 PET/CT 
findings will add value 
as to whether they are 
complimentary or one or 
more might be deleted in 
the work up of these  men.

Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   12  Subjects will receive a single IV dose of 3-7 mCi of 68Ga -PSMA  (study drug ) 
followed by [CONTACT_10052]/CT imaging 60-90 minutes after injection.  Scan time will be 
determined based on the capacity of the PET scanner. Scanning will start from the 
mid-thighs (to minimize radiotracer artifact from accumulation in the bladder) to 
the base of the skull. There may be exceptions based on clinical relevanc e that the 
scan coverage may be extended.  
All patients will be closely monitored with vital signs, to be assessed before and 
after injection of 68Ga -PSMA -11 (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate). Patients will be 
monitored with respect to vital signs and adverse e vents during, and [ADDRESS_450854] injection:  
 Patients  will receive a phone  call 2 days following PET /CT to assess for adverse 
events that may have develop in a delayed fashion.  If there are any concerning 
study -related adverse events, this will be escalated to clinical evaluation by [CONTACT_361951].  
 
 
To minimize bias, all PET/CT images will be interpreted by a board certified 
radiologist with experience in readi ng such modalities. They will be blinded to the 
final outcome, such as the histopathology of any biopsies and the outcome of 
subsequent imaging.  
 
68-Ga-PSMA PET/CT positivity or negativity will be interpreted, stratified by 
[CONTACT_361952] c regions as p reviously defined [1].

4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is an exploratory, single arm, open label pi[INVESTIGATOR_361929]  68Ga -
PSMA Positron Emission Tomography with intraprostatic and/or pelvic lymph 
node uptake determination by [CONTACT_10052]/CT imaging, with histological confirmation of 
disease localized and st aging. Methodical evaluation of 68Ga -PSMA intraprostatic 
and or pelvic lymph node will provide important preliminary data upon which 
further clinical studies can be based.  
 
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DO SE 
 
68Ga -PSMA -11 will be used as the radiopharmaceutical agent for PET imaging at 
a dose of 3 -7 mCi given intravenously. Dosimetry data are available from 
published data and will reference the Weil Cornell IND application to the FDA.  
68GA -PSMA 11  Version :5 
Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   15 In summary, the published  literature and safety studies in humans indicates no 
observed adverse events to the radiopharmaceutical [1,7,16] .  Measured dosimetry 
showed that the critical organs affect ed are, in descending order, the spleen, 
stomach wall, pancreas and bladder. The reported effective dose of 68Ga -PSMA -
11 is 0.0129 mSv/MBq, which is the lowest of the 68Ga based tracers, including 
those used in imaging of neuro -endocrine tumours such as  D OTA -TOC, DOTA -
NOC, DOTA -TATE [17–19].  
68Ga -PSMA can only be administered via intravenous infusion.  The proposed 
dose (3 -7 mCi) is based upon  joint guidelines from the European Association of 
Nuclear Medicine and The Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, 
who recommend a dose of 0.049 -0.06 mCi/kg.  In an average 75kg adult patient, 
this would be approximately 3.7 -4.5 mCi  [20].  
The [ADDRESS_450857] scheduled procedure shown in 
the S chedule of Activities (SoA), Section 1.3 . 
Patients who do not complete surgery would be considered Early Termination (pre -
surgery).  
The investigator may withdraw a subject from the trial for any of the following 
reasons:  
1. Protocol violation,  
2. Serious or intolerable  adverse event (that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
requires the subject’s discontinuation),  
3.  The Investigat or withdraws the subject (at the Investigator’s discretion for 
reasons other than an adverse event),  
4. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_361930],  
5. The subject requests to be discontinued from the study, or  
6. The subject is lost to follow -up.

Quality control of the PET/CT scanner will be maintained throughout the study  
according to departmental SOPs.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Image Acquisition  
PET scan and Quantitation: Following administration of Ga -[ADDRESS_450880] a PET/CT scans at [ADDRESS_450881] PET/CT scanner  
by [CONTACT_2329] 10 -12 bed positions and 3 min/bed. The CT parameters used for 
attenuation  correction CT (CAREDose -4D) include a fixed 100 mA tube current 
and a peak voltage  of 120 kVp with a 5 -mm reconstruction interval. The PET scans 
will be reconstructed by  [CONTACT_2329] a Siemens time of flight reconstruction method, 
TrueX -TOF UltraHD -PET with a  Gaussian filter, scatter correction, and 5/21 
iterations/subsets.  
 
For the study, using the decay -corrected coronal anterior maximum - intensity

8.9 Surgical Pathology  
Following radical prostatectomy and/or pelvic lymph node dissection, surgical  
specimens will be brought on ice to the Department of Surgical Pathology for 
tissue  processing. Prostatectomy and lymph node specimens will be processed by 
[CONTACT_361963] 
(H&E)  staining for grading and staging. Additionally, immunohistochemistry will 
be performed  to confirm, at a microscopic level, that radiolabeled  68Ga -PSMA -11 
co-localizes  with tumor foci seen on H&E sections. Tumor foci identified on H&E 
sections will serve  as the gold standard for imaging comparison.  
 
 
8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical  
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, at any dose, which 
does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore b e any unfavorable and unintended sign  
(including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptoms or disease  
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered  related to the medicinal product.  
 
8.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS  ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose falls  into one or more of the following categories:  
• results in death  
68GA -PSMA 11  Version :5 
Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   28 • is life -threatening  
• i.e., an event which, in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at  
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred and does not include an  
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10240].  
 For the seriousness criterion of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_361935], an overnight  
stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_324873]. Admission to an ER and release without an  
overnight stay would not satisfy the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_361936] n. 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• where disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person ability to  
conduct normal life functions, either reported or defined as per clinical  
judgment  
• is a congenital anomaly/bi rth defect (if exposure to pr oduct just before 
conception or during pregnancy resulted in an adverse outcome to the child)  
• is any other important medical event  
• may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based  
upon app ropriate medical judgment the event may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
serious definitions above. An important medical event may include development of  
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the 
following guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with 
the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference 
with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Seve re events are usually 
potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” 
does not necessarily equate to “serious”.

Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   29  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention 
assessed by [CONTACT_10261]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categori es below. In a clinical trial, the study 
product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a 
temporal relationship betw een the study intervention and event. Reasonable 
possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of 
the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship 
between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has 
been established.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_361937] ( AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk

8.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT 
AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE ) may 
come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a 
study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs 
will b e captured on the appropriate  case report form  (CRF ). Information to be

NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   30 collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_12213] a  diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All 
AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of 
relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the tim e that the participant is screened 
will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study 
participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded 
as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be d ocumented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized 
as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_214477] 7 (for non -serious AEs) 
or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each study visit, 
the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs  since the last visit.  
Events will be followed for outcome information unt il resolution or stabilization.

therefore, be any unf avorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product or protocol -specifie d procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any 
clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting 
condition that is temporally associated with the study treatment is also an AE. 
Progression of the cancer under study is not conside red an AE.  
All AEs that occur after informed consent form signing must be reported by [CONTACT_361964] a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or 
discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment, or a procedure.

Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.[ADDRESS_450885], or 
other assessments. As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to dete rmine:  
 
1. Severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 –4) 
2. Duration (Start and end dates or if continuing at the Safety Follow -up Visit)  
3. Relationship to the study treatment (Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No, 
Yes)  
4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose 
adjusted, temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
unknown, not ap plicable)  
5. Whether medication or therapy was given (no concomitant medication/non -drug 
therapy, concomitant medication/non -drug therapy)  
6. Outcome (not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown)  
7. Whether it is serious, where a SAE is defined as in this protocol.  
 
All AEs should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes in 
study treatment including possible interruption or d iscontinuation, starting or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Once an AE is detected, 
it should be followed until its resolution, and assessmen t should be made at each 
visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected 
relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_450886] include an assessment of whether

Protocol : Pro00025982  07/08/2021  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0 7 Apr 2017   32 there is a  reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the event. Study 
endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be 
reported in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a 
causal relationship bet ween the study intervention and the event (e.g., death from 
anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the 
sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or 
until the site i nvestigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. 
Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_245745] ( DCC )/study sponsor and should be provided as soon as 
possible.  
 
The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_361938] ( FDA ) of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected 
adverse reaction as soon as possible , but in no case later than 7 calendar days after 
the sponsor's initial receipt of the infor mation.   In addition, the Principal 
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_361939] ( IND) safety report of potential serious risks, from 
clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no cas e later than [ADDRESS_450887] remain on site with the CRF.  
All deaths will be reported as SAEs regar dless of their relationship to disease  
progression and reported via an SAER form from the time of signed informed 
consent until completion of the follow up period.  
A new follow -up SAER form will be filled in by [CONTACT_361965] -up infor mation (i.e. diagnosis, outcome, causality assessment, results of 
specific investigations) are made available after submission of the initial form. The 
follow up SAER must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_18613]. The follow -up form 
and any additional sourc e documentation regarding the even t will be sent to the 
Principal Investigator, or designee, as described above.  
If a serious medical occurrence or death is reported to the Investigator outside the  
follow up window, which is believed to be related to the a dministration of the

The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated 
problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research  
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population 
being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly 
related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, 
or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_32015]); and

harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
 
8.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
 
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB) and t o the Data Coordinating C enter ( DCC )/lead 
principal investigator ( PI). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, an d 
the IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, 
experience, or outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that 
have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the 
following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious  adverse events ( SAE s) will be reported to the IRB and 
to the DCC /study sponsor within <insert timeline in accordance with policy>  
of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC /study sponsor 
withi n <insert timeline in accordance with policy>  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required 
by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head 
(or designee), and the Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) 
within <insert timeline in accordance with policy>  of the IRB’s receipt of

 COMIRB Protocol COLORADO MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD CAMPUS BOX F-490 TELEPHONE: [PHONE_1622] Fax: [PHONE_1623]  Protocol #: 18-[ADDRESS_822846] Title: A double-blind, randomized, parallel study to compare the efficacy of sugammadex versus neostigmine for reversal of neuromuscular blockade at the end of kidney transplantation surgery in patients with severe kidney dysfunction. Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_618989]-Bustamante M.D., Ph.D. Version # and Date: #3 – 09/18/2020  Hypotheses and Specific Aims Clinical Hypotheses Sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, reduces inadequate neuromuscular blockade reversal (NMBR) and its related hypoventilation, as measured by [CONTACT_619057][INVESTIGATOR_618990], by [CONTACT_2669] 50% during the first 3h after the end of kidney transplantation surgery (or until meeting discharge criteria from the PACU if sooner than 3h) after adjusting for quantitative train-of-four (qTOF) T4/T1 monitoring and morphine equivalents received. Hypoventilation events are defined by [CONTACT_46917] ³1 minute-long events of minute ventilation (MV) <40% of the expected MV for each patient (expMV). Sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, reduces inadequate NMBR and its related hypoventilation, as measured by [CONTACT_619057][INVESTIGATOR_618990], by [CONTACT_2669] 50% for up to 3 days after kidney transplantation surgery after adjusting for qTOF T4/T1 monitoring and morphine equivalents received. Our overall hypothesis is that sugammadex will provide improved NMBR and postoperative ventilation than neostigmine. Prevention of hypoventilation with sugammadex may contribute to reduce patient’s reported dyspnea scores (PROMIS® Dyspnea Functional Limitation questionnaire scores), decrease PPCs possibly related to inadequate NMBR after kidney transplantation surgery (i.e. respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pneumonia), improve kidney graft outcomes, reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_618991]. A study powered to test these as a hypothesis would require a substantially larger sample size and it may be pursued in the future.  Objectives  Primary objective: To test the efficacy of NMBR with sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, to reduce inadequate NMBR and its related hypoventilation during the immediate postoperative period after kidney transplantation surgery, after adjusting for qTOF recovery and morphine equivalents received. We define hypoventilation as the incidence of ³1 minute-long events of MV <40% of expMV. Minute ventilation will be measured continuously with a noninvasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_618992] 3h after the end of surgery or until meeting discharge criteria from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) (if sooner than 3h).  Secondary objective: To test the efficacy of NMBR with sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, to reduce inadequate NMBR and its related hypoventilation during the first 3 postoperative days in patients after kidney transplantation surgery, after adjusting for qTOF recovery and morphine equivalents received. We define hypoventilation as the incidence of ³1 minute-long events of MV <40% of expMV. Minute ventilation will be measured continuously with a noninvasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_618993] 3d after surgery or until meeting end of monitoring criteria (if sooner than 3d)  Additional secondary objectives: To test if NMBR with sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, reduces patient’s reported dyspnea scores (with the validated Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, PROMIS®, assessment), decreases postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) 
possibly related to inadequate NMBR after kidney transplantation surgery (i.e. respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pneumonia), improves kidney graft outcomes and reduces hospi[INVESTIGATOR_618994] (i.e. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], ICU admission) and estimated healthcare costs.  II. Background and Significance/Preliminary Studies:  Inadequate neuromuscular blockade reversal (NMBR) leads to different degrees of residual muscle weakness at extubation and during the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in up to 70% of patients[1-3]. Estimates of inadequate NMBR depends on the methods of diagnosis and definitions used (i.e. quantitative vs. qualitative TOF, T4/T1 threshold), surgery type, and patient comorbidities. Even mild incomplete NMBR (e.g. T4/T1 0.7-0.8) impairs ventilatory compensation to hypoxia and coordination of the upper airway muscles[4-6]. Therefore it increases the risk for postoperative atelectasis, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and pneumonia[7-9]. The use of any NMB agent, lack of TOF monitoring or NMBR administered, and NMBR with neostigmine, as opposed to NMBR with sugammadex, are strongly associated with PPCs. These PPCs include mild (e.g. atelectasis, lung edema, hypoxemia requiring oxygen supplementation) and major complications (e.g. pneumonia, re-intubation)[7, 10-12]. Mild PPCs (e.g. atelectasis) are often underestimated, but we have recently shown their association with worse clinical outcomes[13]. In this multicenter study in American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class 3 patients undergoing non- cardiothoracic surgery, mild PPCs (including atelectasis) were associated with increased early postoperative mortality, ICU admission and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408][13]. However, the existing data on the association between inadequate NMBR and quantitative assessment of ventilation is scarce. Only one study[14] analyzed respi[INVESTIGATOR_618995] (maximum inspi[INVESTIGATOR_393773], forced vital capacity and forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second). Pulmonary function tests are certainly quantitative but depi[INVESTIGATOR_618996][14]. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_618997] a series of factors, from residual NMB to sedation by [CONTACT_619058][INVESTIGATOR_2467], pain-induced hypoventilation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_618998], and others. In fact, patients with severe kidney dysfunction present an increased risk to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_618999][15]. The diagnosis of respi[INVESTIGATOR_619000], even though this is a well-known late sign of hypoventilation. There is increasing evidence suggesting the value of continuous noninvasive quantitative expi[INVESTIGATOR_619001][16- 20]. Investigators have reported up to 76% of patients after general anesthesia present at least one hypoventilation event, defined as a ³1 minute-long epi[INVESTIGATOR_619002] (MV) <40% of expected (expMV) for the patient’s age, gender, height and weight or body surface area[21]. The effect of sugammadex on the quantitative assessment of hypoventilation in postoperative patients adjusted for TOF monitoring or opi[INVESTIGATOR_619003].  There is insufficient information on the use of sugammadex for NMBR in patients with kidney dysfunction. The clearance of sugammadex is proportional to creatinine clearance (ClCr), and thus delayed with kidney dysfunction[22-25]. However, no safety adverse events related to inadequate NMBR or delayed recurrence of NMB have been observed in patients with kidney dysfunction receiving sugammadex[26]. Nonetheless, patients with kidney impairment often receive the cholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine for NMBR. Neostigmine provides a slower and less effective NMBR than that achieved with sugammadex in the overall population, and its overdose is itself associated with increased muscle weakness[3, 10, 27-31] and postoperative pulmonary morbidity[1, 12]. It is critical to investigate the effect of sugammadex as NMBR in patients with kidney dysfunction. Thus, we are proposing to randomize patients with severe kidney dysfunction (ClCr <30 mL/min) undergoing kidney transplantation surgery to receive either NMBR with sugammadex (intervention) or neostigmine (control) following qTOF monitoring-guided and FDA-approved doses. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_619004] a kidney transplantation surgery. The exact kidney function during the first hours after reperfusion of the graft kidney in the receiving patient is unknown. Thus the clearance and duration of effect of sugammadex in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_619005]. Their kidney function is expected to improve over the following days to months after transplant, and considered stable 6-12 months after transplant. 
III. Research Methods  A. Outcome Measure(s)  The primary outcome will be the frequency of patients with one or more ³1 minute-long epi[INVESTIGATOR_619006] 3 hours after the end of surgery or until meeting discharge criteria from the PACU (if sooner than 3h), assessed with a continuous noninvasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_619007].  Additional outcomes will include: intraoperative minutes from NMBR administration to qTOF T4/T1 >0.9, to extubation, and total in operating room time; incidence of residual NMB in PACU based on qTOF; number of events and accumulated minutes of hypoventilation in PACU; frequency of patients with ³1 events of delayed postoperative hypoventilation (daily for up to 3 postoperative days) and accumulated minutes of hypoventilation; delayed recurrence of NMB based on qTOF; presence of pre-defined postoperative pulmonary complications during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619008] 14±3; standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) dyspnea functional limitations questionnaire score compared to patient’s baseline; pre-defined kidney graft outcomes; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_618994] (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], ICU admission) and their cost estimates.  B. Description of Population to be Enrolled We will include adults (³ 18 years and ≤ 90) diagnosed with severe kidney dysfunction (defined by [CONTACT_619059] <30 mL/min) and planning on kidney transplantation surgery at the University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Exclusion criteria: patients unable to sign the informed consent, pregnant women, Body Mass Index (BMI) > 40, pre-existing oxygen or ventilatory dependency (24h use of oxygen or other noninvasive or invasive ventilatory support), or patients with any pulmonary, neuromuscular or other disease that severely limits their respi[INVESTIGATOR_619009] (e.g. unable to achieve 4 Metabolic Equivalent of Tasks, METs, such as climbing up 1 flight of stairs[32]), or any contraindication for any of the study-related medications or interventions. C. Study Design and Research Methods We have designed a prospective randomized double-blind single center study on 100 patients with severe kidney failure undergoing kidney transplantation surgery. Patients will be randomized to receive either NMB with rocuronium and sugammadex for NMBR (intervention group) or NMB with rocuronium and neostigmine for NMBR (control group). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_619010] [ADDRESS_822847] the frequency of hypoventilation events as well as the accumulated minutes of hypoventilation. Quantitative TOF monitoring will be evaluated by a blinded investigator. Additional data related to patient’s comorbidities, morphine equivalents (mg/kg) received, validated dyspnea patient-reported scores, pulmonary complications, kidney graft relevant data and outcomes, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619011]. After signing informed consent, patients will be randomized to receive, during kidney transplant surgery, NMB with rocuronium and NMBR with either sugammadex (intervention group) or neostigmine (control group). Both groups will receive intraoperative NMB agents and reversal medications as guided by [CONTACT_619060]-approved doses (see details below). In the PACU, we will perform continuous monitoring of their MV during their PACU stay and assess qTOF at selected time points in all patients. Institutional discharge criteria from PACU is based on an Aldrete’s score[33] ³8 assuming there are no discharge concerns by [CONTACT_102]’s healthcare providers (PACU nurse, anesthesiologist and/or surgeon). After discharge from PACU and during the first 3 postoperative days (or until end of monitoring criteria if sooner) we will maintain the continuous MV monitoring and daily quantitative TOF assessment, collect opi[INVESTIGATOR_619012], kidney graft outcomes and estimated healthcare costs. At the postoperative surgery clinic visit or by [CONTACT_619061]’s subjective dyspnea scores and compare to their baseline (with a validated questionnaire), as well as updated PPCs, kidney graft outcomes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_618991].

Preoperative phase Screening for eligibility and consenting will take place once the patient has been accepted for kidney transplantation at the University of Colorado Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619015]. Randomization will occur after patients consent for the study. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_619016] (see below). Preoperative data will be collected by [CONTACT_73486] (study coordinator), including baseline vital signs (including room air SpO2), comorbidities, medications, and kidney graft relevant factors. The baseline dyspnea scores will be assessed by [CONTACT_619062]® v1.0 Dyspnea Functional Limitations Short Form 10a_9-2-2016 questionnaire (available at http://www.healthmeasures.net/administrator/components/com_instruments/uploads/PROMIS%2 0SF%20v1.0-Dyspnea%20Functional%20Limitations%2010a_9-2-2016.pdf). This is a validated and standardized short questionnaire to quantitate if sugammadex used for NMBR reduces the subjective dyspnea scores relative to baseline.   Intraoperative phase  We will perform a prospective parallel randomized study of rocuronium/sugammadex (intervention) vs. rocuronium/neostigmine (control) for NMB and NMBR at the end of kidney transplantation surgery. This will be performed by [CONTACT_514510], following the following protocol(s):  • A quantitative TOF (qTOF) monitor (the Stimpod NMS450®, Xavant Technology Ltd., South Africa, the acceleromyography-based monitor available at UCH, and/or the TwitchViewTM, Blink Device Company, Seattle, WA, an electromyography-based monitor) will guide the NMB and NMBR management in all study patients. Quantitative NMB monitoring are considered superior to the more routinely-used but subjective qualitative TOF monitors[34, 35]. The qTOF monitor will be placed in the ulnar nerve territory to stimulate the adductor pollicis muscle[36] immediately after loss of consciousness during induction of anesthesia. The exact location of monitoring will be marked and used for qTOF measurements in the postoperative period. • NMB brief protocol: Rocuronium will be the NMB agent used in both groups as guided by [CONTACT_619063] (routinely T4/T1 <T3 until closure of surgical incision). Rocuronium dosing: 0.6-1.2 mg/kg for intubation, 0.08-0.2 mg/kg bolus for maintenance with recovery of second twitch (T2) in qTOF. • NMBR brief protocol: The sugammadex (intervention) or neostigmine (control) will be administered at the end of the surgery. The goal will be to administer the appropriate NMBR medication when ³2 twitches are objectivized with the qTOF monitor. NMBR drugs and dosing for each group will follow standard of care FDA-approved doses, as follows: Sugammadex 2 mg/kg will be administered when spontaneous recovery has reached the reappearance of the second twitch in response to TOF stimulation.  Sugammadex dosing (mg/kg) Neostigmine dosing (mg/kg) T4 recovered 2 0.03-0.05 (max 5 mg) T2/T3 recovered 2 0.05-0.07 (max 5 mg) T0/T4 with 1-[ADDRESS_822848]- tetanic twitches present or T1 recovered  4 or wait  Wait Overdosing of neostigmine will be avoided to prevent neostigmine-induced muscle weakness. Neostigmine will be administered simultaneously with the appropriate glycopyrrolate dose (0.2 mg per 1.0 mg of neostigmine). 
Extubation will be performed following the usual standard of care criteria of adequate level of consciousness, presence of airway protection reflexes and spontaneous ventilation parameters in addition to quantitative TOF T4/T1 >0.9. The following times (minutes) will be recorded: NMBR administration-to-T4/T1 >0.9, NMBR administration-to-extubation, total operating room time. Postoperative in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619017]-related information: • Continuous respi[INVESTIGATOR_606782]: From the moment of arrival to the PACU, the patient will be continuously monitored with the FDA-approved noninvasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_619018]® (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_248683], Inc.) available at UCH. This electrical impedance- based monitor uses a sensor that is applied to the chest’s skin at three pre-determined locations: sternal notch, xyphoid and right mid-axillary line at the level of the xyphoid. By [CONTACT_619064] a high frequency current it continuously assesses the estimated volume between three thoracic points of reference. It provides 5-second updates of average respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume and MV volume (= respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] * tidal volume). Calibration is no longer required, but it requires the user to enter some patient’s information (gender, and height + weight, or body surface area) for the mathematical calculation of tidal volume and minute volume for that particular patient. By [CONTACT_619065] (expMV = tidal volume times respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) based on patient’s characteristics it provides the option to compare the observed estimated MV and detect hypoventilation events. The settings of hypoventilation events are customizable by [CONTACT_619066]. This monitor will be blinded to healthcare providers to avoid biasing routine standard of care. Continuous data from this monitor (respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume and MV volume) are automatically stored and will be exported at the end of PACU and daily for up to 3 days or sooner if the patient fulfills the following end of monitoring criteria: is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; or is freely ambulating (defined as patient walking outside of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223] ³2 times a day) and shows no signs or symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800], swallowing problems or muscle weakness. While attached to the monitor, this will be secured to a wheeled pole to facilitate the process for patient mobilization and ambulation. Once the respi[INVESTIGATOR_619019], we will measure the incidence of hypoventilation as defined below (primary outcome) during PACU and daily for up to 3 postoperative days, as well as characterize the distribution of respi[INVESTIGATOR_619020] (average, median, percentiles) during PACU and daily for up to 3 postoperative days. • The blinded investigator will assess the presence of residual NMB with the quantitative TOF monitor by [CONTACT_619067] 3 measurements of qTOF T4/T1 (40mA or adequate to achieve TOF response while comfortable for the patient) within 15min of PACU arrival and hourly until up to 3h after the end of surgery or sooner if the patient meets PACU discharge criteria. We will record the initial PACU TOF and calculate the PACU average TOF. After transfer to the postoperative floor, the blinded investigator will assess residual or recurrent NMB with the qTOF monitor twice a day, with 3 repetitions each time, and each assessment separated by ³6h. This will be maintained for up to 3 days after the end of surgery or until end of monitoring criteria are met. • The individual doses of administered opi[INVESTIGATOR_619021] (PACU and daily for up to 3 postoperative days or until the end of monitoring criteria are met) will be recorded and converted to morphine equivalents[21] to statistically evaluate the effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_619022]. • Nursing-charted epi[INVESTIGATOR_619023]. Postoperative pulmonary complications (as defined elsewhere[13]) during PACU and up to 3 postoperative days will be collected.  Postoperative end of study follow-up At postoperative day 14±3 during the patient’s visit to the transplant surgery clinic or via a phone call, the PROMIS® Dyspnea Functional Limitations Short Form questionnaire will be repeated 
and normalized to the patient’s baseline. Any postoperative pulmonary complications[13] and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619024]-up will be collected from the patient and the medical record, and the estimated costs based on average hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619025]. Any signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g. rash, anaphylaxis) detected during PACU and up to 3 postoperative days will be collected from the patient and patient’s providers. The relationship of these signs and symptoms to sugammadex will be assessed by [CONTACT_102]’s providers and also by [CONTACT_616177]. Their confirmatory diagnostic testing and management will be performed at the discretion of the patient’s providers. We hypothesize that the intervention group will present a ³50% reduction in the incidence of hypoventilation for the first 3h after the end of kidney transplantation surgery or until meeting discharge criteria from the PACU (if sooner than 3h), as defined by [CONTACT_619068] ³1 minute- long events of observed MV of <40% of expMV detected with a noninvasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_619026] T4/T1 and morphine equivalents received.   Tele-communication for screening, e-consenting and any eligible study-related visits  In line with current efforts to minimize face-to-face contact [CONTACT_619069]/or study participants in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we will maximize when possible HIPPA- compliant methods of tele-communication for any study-related tasks. HIPPA-compliant applications (i.e. REDCap, Qualtrics, MS Office, Zoom, Skype, or Vidyo) will be used for prospective study participants for electronic screening, consenting and any eligible study-related visits. The first goal of tele-communication with eligible candidates is to provide a detailed overview of the study protocol and consent form to be signed by [CONTACT_619070] (or research study staff).  a. After subject screening, a phone call will be made to introduce the purpose of the study and to request prospective study participation, upon verbal consent, a personal e-mail address will be requested.  b. After phone call, consent study forms in .pdf format will be sent via e-mail to prospective study participant with a follow up 30-minute video meeting request.  c. During 30-minute video meeting, detailed e-consent guidance will be provided to prospective study participant.  d. Participant will document and sign informed consent electronically or by [CONTACT_619071], signing with pen, and then scanning and emailing back to study team. After signed informed consent, all study-related visits will be evaluated for possible use of tele- communication. The study intervention during surgery and those postoperative in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619027]-communication, but all other visits for data collection from the participant (e.g. PROMIS questionnaires, end-of-study follow-up) will be attempted via tele-communication as described above.  D. Description, Risks and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools: • Insufficient neuromuscular blockade reversal (NMBR): Insufficient neuromuscular blockade reversal at the end of surgery can lead to postoperative complications related to neuromuscular weakness. Complications due to insufficient NMBR range from mild subjective sensation of muscle weakness and up to respi[INVESTIGATOR_619028], including problems with swallowing, speech or vision, airway aspi[INVESTIGATOR_152211], hypoventilation and increased requirement of oxygen supplementation and pneumonia. The use of sugammadex in this population with severe 
kidney disease has not been sufficiently studied but previous small studies have not observed early or delayed events of insufficient NMBR in patients with severe kidney disease. The long-term goal of this study is to reduce insufficient NMBR after kidney transplant surgery, and its contribution to hypoventilation and other complications. • Adverse effects related to NMBR agents, including sugammadex (intervention patients) and neostigmine (control patients): The most common adverse effects to sugammadex include: nausea, vomiting, pain, hypotension and headache. The most common adverse effects for neostigmine include: salivation, fasciculation, bowel cramps and diarrhea. A recent Cochrane systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis found that the overall risk of adverse effects, including residual NMBR, nausea/vomiting and bradycardia is lower for sugammadex than for neostigmine, and the risk of severe adverse reactions is similar after sugammadex and neostigmine[30]. • Local skin irritation to respi[INVESTIGATOR_619029]. The ExSpi[INVESTIGATOR_619030]’s skin at the sternal notch, xiphoid and right mid-axillary line at the level of the xiphoid. The risk of this bio-impedance-based monitor is minimum, with some possible irritation of the skin in susceptible patients. This monitor has been used with no adverse events[16-21, 37, 38]. • Discomfort during neuromuscular blockade monitoring: Monitoring of NMB with a Train- Of-Four (TOF) monitor consists of provoking muscle twitches that can be uncomfortable in awake patients, proportionally to the amplitude of the electrical signal used. In awake the TOF monitoring is usually well tolerated at 30-40 mA, which is the amperage we are planning on using. This has been used without problems by [CONTACT_355539][3, 29, 39], but we will reduce the amperage if uncomfortable for a study patient. • Risk to privacy: There is a small risk of loss of privacy of confidential data collected from study participants. We will collect the minimum patient information required for the study and use RedCap for data collection and storage. The paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_619031]’s office and protected by [CONTACT_619072].  E. Potential Scientific Problems:  This study has been designed to detect differences in the incidence of hypoventilation (primary outcome) but the sample size may be insufficient to detect differences in clinically relevant complications secondary to hypoventilation. Such a study would require a larger study sample.  F. Data Analysis Plan:  The investigator and statistician will be responsible for analyzing the study data. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_619032]. The study coordinator will be blinded to the randomization allocation, and will be responsible for performing the preoperative (baseline) and postoperative assessments. The official clinical database will not be unblinded until the data is clean and complete and the last independent safety review has been performed, and the study database is locked. The groups will be blindly labeled in the study website and only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_619033].  Variables/Time Points of Interest  Frequency of patients with one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_619034] (primary outcome). This will be obtained from the noninvasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_619035] a continuous assessment of the patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], tidal volume and minute volume. This continuous monitoring will be performed continuously during the PACU stay. When meeting PACU discharge criteria based on institutional standard of care (based on an Aldrete’s score[33] ³8 with patient’s nurse and anesthesiologist agreement and no surgical concerns), the every 5-second information will be exported, and the periods with MV <40% of expMV for that patient that last ³1 minute will 
be identified and counted. For the primary outcome patients will be classified as presenting or not at least one event of hypoventilation, summarized per group and compared.  Frequency of patients with one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_619036] [ADDRESS_822849] postoperative days or sooner if patient meets end of monitoring criteria. Similar as before, hypoventilation will be assessed once daily for up to 3 days, or less if the patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619037] (ambulates outside of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223] ³2 times a day) with no signs or symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800].  Additional assessments of hypoventilation (e.g. accumulated minutes of hypoventilation) will be performed during PACU and daily for up to 3 postoperative days.  Incidence of residual or recurrent NMB in PACU. This will be determined from the quantitative TOF measurements and calculated as the average qTOF T4/T1 at 40 mA from 3 repetitions at selected time points: 15min after arrival to PACU, hourly and before transfer to floor. A patient will be classified as presenting an epi[INVESTIGATOR_619038] T4/T1 at any time point during PACU is <0.9. In addition, a percentage of timepoints with an average T4/T1 <0.9 will be analyzed as an accumulated time with residual or recurrent NMB. This variable will be used as covariate in the logistic regression analysis (see below). An average TOF of 3 repetitions <0.4 will be considered a severe residual or recurrent NMB. Patient’s safety will be prioritized and thus an average TOF of 3 repetitions <0.9 will be immediately reported to the patient’s care team in addition to following the appropriate study regulatory safety communications of adverse events.  Incidence of residual or recurrent NMB in the postoperative floor. This will be calculated as described before (T4/T1 <0.9, considered severe if T4/T1 <0.4), as an average of [ADDRESS_822850] conversion formulas[21, 40]. This morphine equivalent dose will be calculated for the PACU period and daily for [ADDRESS_822851] been met, and used as covariate in the logistic regression analysis.  Time from NMBR administration to quantitative TOF T4/T1 >0.9 (minutes, one decimal). The quantitative TOF will be repeated at 80 mA every 30 seconds from the moment the NMBR medication (sugammadex or neostigmine) has been completely administered intravenously.  Time from NMBR administration to extubation (minutes, once decimal).  Time of total operating room time (minutes), counting from in-room time stamp to out-of-room time stamp.  The PROMIS® v1.0 Dyspnea Functional Limitations Short Form 10a_9-2-2016 questionnaire is a validated and standardized short questionnaire to quantitate if sugammadex used for NMBR reduces the subjective dyspnea scores relative to baseline. It will be completed by [CONTACT_619073]. It is available at http://www.healthmeasures.net/administrator/components/com_instruments/uploads/PROMIS%2 0SF%20v1.0-Dyspnea%20Functional%20Limitations%2010a_9-2-2016.pdf).   Postoperative Pulmonary Complications (PPCs) following previous definitions[13, 41, 42], including:  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064], defined as[41]: “When postoperative PaO2 <60mmHg on room air, a ratio of PaO2 to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_619039] <300 or arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation measured with pulse oximetry (SpO2) <90% and requiring oxygen therapy”. 
Unplanned intubation with postoperative mechanical ventilation (POMV), defined as placement of a breathing tube that was not intended or planned, excluding instances of intubation during an unplanned return to the operating room. Also excluded those patients that were transferred intubated and ventilated to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the operating room.  ARDS, based on the Berlin definition[43] 3 mutually exclusive categories of ARDS based on degree of hypoxemia: mild (200 mmHg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 300 mmHg), moderate (100 mmHg < PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 200 mmHg), and severe (PaO2/FIO2 ≤ 100 mmHg) and 4 ancillary variables for severe ARDS: radiographic severity, respi[INVESTIGATOR_77157] (≤40 mL/cm H2O), positive end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (≥10 cm H2O), and corrected expi[INVESTIGATOR_619040] (≥10 L/min).  Pneumonia – or “Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]” as defined per NSQIP criteria[42]: “having at least [ADDRESS_822852] 1 sign of pneumonia (fever, leukocytosis, or altered mental status with no other cause), as well as at least 1 microbiologic laboratory finding (positive cultures from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, or pleural fluid specimens) or at least 2 symptoms (purulent sputum, worsening cough, dyspnea or tachypnea, rales or rhonchi, or worsening gas exchange)”.  Pneumothorax defined as in: “Air in the pleural space with no vascular bed surrounding the visceral pleura”.  Atelectasis, defined as[41]: “Lung opacification with a shift of the mediastinum, hilum, or hemidiaphragm toward the affected area, and compensatory overinflation in the adjacent nonatelectatic lung” (based on radiology reports/medical chart).  Pleural effusion, defined as[41]: “Chest x-ray demonstrating blunting of the costophrenic angle, loss of the sharp silhouette of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm in upright position, evidence of displacement of the adjacent anatomical structures, or (in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]) a hazy opacity in one hemithorax with preserved vascular shadows“ (based on radiology reports/medical chart).  Bronchospasm, defined as: “Presence in medical chart of bronchospasm and/or wheezing plus the use of bronchodilators (not bronchodilators alone)”.  These pulmonary complications will be identified with information obtained directly from the patient’s medical chart. All testing will be performed by [CONTACT_619074]’s physicians. No tests will be ordered specifically for this clinical study. The clinical severity of pulmonary and non- pulmonary complications will be graded following accepted scales[44, 45].  Kidney graft outcomes, including postoperative ClCr, daily urine output, need for dialysis postoperatively, diagnosis of delayed graft function, kidney graft rejection. Postoperative hemodialysis is not usually planned and typi[INVESTIGATOR_619041]. The need of rescue hemodialysis within the first week after kidney transplantation is an accepted and simple definition of delayed kidney graft function[46].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_618994]: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619042] (LOS) (days, rounded to half a day), ICU admission and LOS, estimated cost based on average daily cost at a postoperative UCH floor or ICU and/or based on reported estimated costs per PPC[47, 48]  Hypersensitivity adverse events: hypersensitivity signs and symptoms, including but not limited to rash, bronchospasm or anaphylaxis, will be obtained for up to 3 postoperative days directly from the patient and the patient’s providers. Their relationship to sugammadex will be assessed by [CONTACT_102]’s physicians and the study safety officer. Their confirmatory testing and management will be performed strictly at the discretion of the patient’s physicians. 
Statistical Methods  The primary hypothesis is that the frequency of patients with one or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_619034] (% of patients) is lower in the sugammadex group compared to neostigmine (controls). This will be analyzed by [CONTACT_619075], total morphine equivalents, and TOF T4/T1 response, and other observed significant and clinically relevant differences between the groups. The odds ratio for the group covariate will be the primary outcome of interest, with the other covariates included in the model to adjust for potential confounders related to hypoventilation. The secondary analysis comparing delayed efficacy of sugammadex to neostigmine in reducing the incidence of hypoventilation during the first 3 postoperative days will assume the same model and covariates as the primary hypothesis. To compare the incidence of PPCs a logistic regression model will be used with the binary outcome of any PPC and will include covariates for group and total morphine equivalents. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619043] a linear regression model including covariates for group, total morphine equivalents, presence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_619044]. Continuous outcomes may be transformed if they violate the normality assumption (e.g., a log-transformation).  Multiplicity  Given only one primary outcome and hypothesis, there is a not a concern for multiplicity. Secondary analyses are considered exploratory in this protocol.  Power/Sample Size:  Based upon a sample size of 40 patients per group, this study has 90% power to detect a 50% difference in hypoventilation incidence in the PACU (from 76% as reported in previous studies[21] to 38%, alpha 0.05), assuming a potential dropout of up to 6 patients per group. The 50% reduction is considered clinically relevant for a decrease in the frequency of hypoventilation, a precursor of more clinically significant complications such as hypoxemia, reintubation or pneumonia. Quantifying the contribution of hypoventilation into more severe complications is challenging, and details of duration and severity of hypoventilation are not well known. Thus, only a significant reduction in hypoventilation incidence (i.e. 50%) may be accepted as relevant. This trial will provide additional detailed information that may provide more insight on the clinical consequences of hypoventilation (e.g. potential association between accumulated minutes of MV <40% expMV and decrease in SpO2/FiO2 over the following 30 min).  A sample size of [ADDRESS_822853] approximately 80% power (78%) to detect a difference in case the incidence of any hypoventilation events is 60%, instead of the literature-based 76%. The table below provides the sample size per group to achieve a variety of assumptions for the primary outcome, alpha, and power:  Incidence Group [ADDRESS_822854] also estimated the power that a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_822855] a difference on the incidence of residual NMB. In a preliminary sample of 25 patients after general anesthesia and neostigmine used for NMBR at our institution, 9 patients had a quantitative TOF T4/T1 <0.9 in the PACU (36%). This matches the incidence range 10-50% of TOF <0.9 observed in other studies[8, 10, 49]. The reported frequency of qTOF <0.9 after 15min of 
sugammadex administration in other surgical populations is <8%[34, 39, 50, 51]. With this incidence of residual NMB, our proposed sample size would have 90% power to detect a reduction to residual NMB to an incidence of 5% (alpha 0.05):  G. Summarize Knowledge to be Gained  This study will fill an important gap of knowledge with immediate clinical applications: 1) determine the efficacy of sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, for NMBR in patients with severe kidney dysfunction undergoing a kidney transplant; and 2) characterize the effect of sugammadex and neostigmine on postoperative ventilation, dependent and independent to residual or recurrent NMB and other contributing factors (e.g. opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]). Our study will describe the effect of NMBR on objective and quantitative assessments of qTOF and minute volume ventilation. Additional measures will include patient’s subjective dyspnea scores (with a validated questionnaire), PPCs and kidney graft outcomes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_619045].  H. References  • 1.

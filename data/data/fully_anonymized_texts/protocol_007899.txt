STUDY TITLE: Defining Adolescent Nausea through Brain-Gut Physiology and Non- Invasive  
       Neurostimulation Response   PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  [INVESTIGATOR_851650], M.D.  A. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
The main purpose of this study is to characterize adolescents w ith chronic nausea through non- invasive gastric 
motor function and autonomic tests, and subsequently evaluate brain connectivity changes induced by [CONTACT_851676] (FGIDs). Funct ional nausea is a poorly understood 
condition that is difficult to manage due to lack of diagnostic testing and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Symptoms often overlap with those of gastric motor disorders such as delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) and poor gastr ic 
compliance. We have recent ly demonstrated safety and efficacy of auricular neurostimulation for the treatment 
of FGIDs .  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an established technique for studying brain 
networks and their connections. fMRI -BOL D (blood oxygen level dependent) signals detect changes in blood 
flow as a measure of brain activity. Resting state functional c onnectivity (rsFC) analysis is based on studying 
the functional organization of large- scale brain networks  when a subject is not engaged in any mental task. 
Certain brain regions have greater coherence of neural activity as measured by [CONTACT_851677] -BOLD signal.  Studies of adult patients with a variety of chronic pain conditions show altered resting 
state brain network activity .
1-4 There is convincing data that baseline or rsFC between brain networks is  
dysregulated in patients with FGIDs.5,6 Our group has recently  reported similar findings in children with 
irritable bowel syndrome.7 The amygdala is a limbic brain structure involved in emotions, fear, anxiety and 
processing of visceral sensations. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interacts with the amygdala to mediate the behavioral responses to various stimuli.
[ADDRESS_1184180] recently demonstrated efficacy of non-invasive peripheral 
neurostimulation  of the external ear in adolescents with FGIDs (IRB ID# 689519-17) (unpublished data) . 
Preliminary animal studies from our group show significantly decreased neuronal signaling in the amygdala after auricular neurostimulation. The current  proposal will phenotype patients with chronic nausea into various 
subgroups and then investigate intrinsic  resting state  brain connectivity in the functional nausea subgroup 
compared to irritable bowel syndrome and health y controls before and after auricular neurostimulation therapy. 
 B. SPECIFIC AIMS / HYPOTHESIS  
  
Specific aim #1 : Define functional nausea (FN) as an entity subdivided by [CONTACT_851678], anxiety and 
gastric motor function.  
 Hypothesis : Adolescents with chronic nausea form subgroups based on clinical, physiologic and psychological 
parameters: 1) FN: characterized by [CONTACT_851679], autonomic imbalance/low vagal tone and absence of major foregut dysmotility, 2) gastroparesis, and 3) poor gastric compli ance. We will separate FN 
from other groups by [CONTACT_851680], autonomic tests (heart rate variability) and gastric motility tests (gastric emptying, accommoda tion tests).  
 Specific aim #2: Demonstrate that resting state functional brain connect ivity is different in female adolescents 
with FN  compared to gender and age-matched healthy controls.  
 
Hypothesis : Adolescents with FN  will have alte red rsFC between bra in regions associated with emotional 
arousal neurocircuits (amygdala) and the top -down regulation of these by [CONTACT_252099]. There will be 
decreased resting state functional connectivity  between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and 
amygda la in adolescents with  FN compared to healthy controls.  
 
Specific aim #3 : Demonstrate that four weeks of auricular neurostimulation improves nausea while 
strengthening the vagal tone and the abnormal  resting state brain connectivity in female adolescents with FN  
compared to baseline and to more resemble that of healthy controls.  
3 
  
Hypothesis:  3a) Compared to baseline (pre- stimulation), there will be reduction in nausea and concurrent 
symptoms in the active compared to sham neurostimulation group after 4 weeks of therapy . 3b) Active 
neurostimulation therapy will increase  vagal tone compared to baseline and also increase the rsFC  between the 
vmPFC and amygdala in female adolescents with FN . 
 
C. BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE, AND RATIONALE  
Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) affect a large percentage of children and negatively impact quality of life .
[ADDRESS_1184181] per patient is 
approximately $2800.10,11 In adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS), the annual direct cost is 
estimated at $1.35 billion .12 Our recently published study showed that over 50% of children with FGIDs suffer 
from  chronic nausea.[ADDRESS_1184182] that characterize functional nausea (FN) clinically or mechanistically. FGIDs  are 
currently defined using symptom criteria (Rome criteria) rather than through a mechanistic understanding of their pathophysiology.
18 Symptoms of FN often overlap with foregut motility disorders such as delayed stomach 
emptying (gastroparesis) and reduced stomach compliance (a ‘stiff stomach’) and are difficult to distinguish clinically. Current testing for gastric motor disorders is  very limited in children, with lack of pediatric norms, 
using tests that expose children to radiation (nuclear gastric emptying scintigraphy).  Non-invasive tests such as the 
[ADDRESS_1184183] (a non-radioactive isotope) has recently been studied in children and 
correlates well with scintigraphy.[ADDRESS_1184184] (NDT) is an easy and non-invasive method 
that has been used in children to test sensitivity to gastric distention and impaired accommodation.20,[ADDRESS_1184185] 
more severe GI and somatic symptoms, depression, low self- esteem, disability and family stress.27  
 
The sympathetic an d parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) connect with the 
enteric nervous system to modulate GI motor function and sensation.[ADDRESS_1184186] ANS changes 
indicated by [CONTACT_851681], pallor, lightheadedness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], salivation etc.29 Our studies show 
a strong association between FN and co-morbid symptoms of autonomi c imbalance (dizziness, anxiety, 
exhaustion, and postural tachycardia syndrome).24 Over 90% of adolescents seen in our Neurogastroenterology 
Clinic suffer from chronic nausea.[ADDRESS_1184187] found convincing associations between nausea, orthostatic disorders and anxiety.32-
34 Additionally, studies demonstrate low vagal (parasympathetic) tone in FGIDs, suggesting a possible 
pathophysiologic role.35-37 The brain stem nucleus tractus solitarius ( NTS) is a major relay center for afferent 
signals transmitted from the GI tract through the vagus (parasympathetic) nerve. The baroreflex is critical to maintain orthostatic control.
38  Baroreceptor signals travel directly along CN IX and X to the NTS.39 The NTS 
projects to higher limbic brain regions (amygdala, hypothalamus) involved in arousal, emotions and central autonomic control .
40-42  Autonomic imbalance in adolescents is closely linked to r educed vagal baroreflex 
response and heart rate variability (HRV).  43 HRV is a measure of the ability to modulate cardiac auton omic 
outflow via baroreceptors.44 A study of adolescents with chronic nausea showed decreased HRV, suggesting 
4 
 decreased parasympathetic vagal modulation of the heart.32 Cranial nerves IX and in particular X (vagus) may 
thus link ANS dysregulation with symptomatic nausea and indicate involvement of higher brain regions in FN. 
The emotional arousal neurocircuits are abnormally engaged in FGIDs, specifically during expectation  of a 
visceral stimulus.42,[ADDRESS_1184188] majority of nausea sufferers are adolescent females who suffer from anxiety. For unclear reasons, many suffer from intense morning nausea. A strong female predominance is well documented in FGIDs.
46 
There are significant gender differences in the regions of the brain activated following pain.6,47 Studies 
specifically point to gender- related differences in the rsFC of the insula and limbic regions with males 
demonstrating greater activation in insula while females showing more activation in limbic regions such as the amygdala and closely  associated structures such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).
45,47- [ADDRESS_1184189] enhanced sensitivity in the brain regions that process cognitive/emotional aspects of GI sensation
[ADDRESS_1184190] an abnormal emotional arousal control with concurrent low vagal tone/ANS imbalance, that predisposes to symptoms upon morning arousal, sustained and exacerbated by [CONTACT_851682]. Aberrant connectivity in emotional arousal neurocircuits is increasingly recognized through functional magnetic resonance imagining studies (fMRI) in FGIDs.   
 
Aberrant Brain Network Connectivity  The emerging concept in neuroscience emphasizes functional connections between brain areas as part of large-scale networks. Of particular importance to visceral sensation and emotion regulation in FGIDs is the emotional arousal neurocircuits (emotional arousal network), stimulus detection and the central autonomic network. fMRI studies show alterations in connectivity amongst affective (amygdala, insula), sensory and attentional brain regions in female FGID subjects.
52,53 Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) studies show abnormalities in 
limbic/affective brain areas such as  the amygdala and insula in adult FGID patients.6,45,51,[ADDRESS_1184191] autonomic responses. There are also projections from the amygdala to all major neuromodulatory systems including dopaminergic, cholinergic, serotonergic and noradrenergi c systems.
8 There are also consistent reports of sex differences in amygdala responses during the 
anticipation of aversive emotional stimuli in both healthy and IBS patients.45,49,55,56 Further, there is solid data 
that amygdala interacts with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area involved in higher cognitive processing to consolidate memories. RsFC analysis shows that the extent of amygdala coupling with the mPFC influences how a subject regulates their emotional response to a stimulus.
8 Brain areas such as the mPFC may 
attenuate sensory input such that it remains below the perception level.   The vmPFC regulates auto nomic responses in which lower vmPFC activity reflects vagal withdrawal.
57 
Numerous fMRI studies show increased vmPFC with concomitant decreased amygdala activity during successful emotional regulation, suggesting that the strength of vmPFC-amygdala coupling predicts healthier regulation of emotions and anxiety .
8,58-60 A developmental switch occurs during adolescence when there is a 
normal reduction in amygdala reactivity due to top-down mPFC control over amygdal a.61 Preliminary fMRI 
connectivity analysis by [CONTACT_851683], amygdala and hippocampal connectivity with the hypothalamus in adolescents with FGIDs. The emotional arousal network with amygdala as a key node is activated by [CONTACT_851684].
62 Abnormal emotional arousal with poor 
feedback inhibition of amygdala by [CONTACT_851685], lower vagal tone and morning symptoms upon awakening. Nausea coupled with anxiety is thus likely a manifestation of dysregulated emotional arousal and resulting impaired corticolimbic modulation of gut sensations. We hypothesize that there is aberrant top -down control by [CONTACT_851686], characterized 
by [CONTACT_851687]. Modulating brain signals that 
communicate discomfort such as nausea by [CONTACT_851688]- based treatment.   
 
5 
 Neuromodulation such as gastric electrical stimulation is an emerging therapy for GI disorders.63-65 These 
effects are believed to be mediated by [CONTACT_851689], influencing ANS and higher 
brain centers.66-68 Tracing studies confirm that the external ear contains branches of four cranial nerves (CN V, 
VII, IX, X) that project to the NTS.69,[ADDRESS_1184192] all four cranial nerves in the auricle that converge in the brainstem NTS.69 Peripheral nerve field 
stimulation of the auricle is thus a plausible means of modulating the vagal afferents and arousal neurocircuits. Our unpublished data on a percutaneous auricular neurostimulator , the Electro Auricular Device (EAD ), in 
adolescents with FGIDs show significant improvement in pain and global wellbeing (randomized, sham-controlled trial).  Animal data from our group also shows that EAD alter the response characteristics of 
amygdala neurons and improves visceral hyperalgesia. We hypothesize that ANS dysregulation and 
aberrant functional connectivity in emotional arousal circuits is the basis of an amplified perception of GI tract sensation, elevated anxiety, reduced vagal tone and negative emotional state observed in FN. We 
expect that peripheral stimulation of several cranial nerves will improve symptoms in adolescents with FN by 
[CONTACT_851690]-down regulation of vmPFC on amygdala. Improved phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_851651] a mechanistic basis for effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We therefore propose to define FN through clinical features and physiologic testing and underlying brain pathways and evaluate the response to a novel, non-pharmacological and noninvasive neurostimulation device.  
   D. DESIGN AND METHODS  
 
Feasibility of comparing fMRI data across age groups One of the primary concerns in interpreting fMRI data obtained in children and in making comparisons across age groups involves the significant developmental changes in brain morphology that occur during childhood and adolescence.  Although the majority of brain growth occurs prior to the age of 5 years, it has been estimated that approximately 5- 8% of cerebral growth occurs between the age of [ADDRESS_1184193] groups.  Recent studies do support the feasibility of making such comparisons within a common stereotactic space, suggesting that anatomical differences between  the atlas transformed brain morphology of children (aged 
7 to 8 years) and adults are minimal, relative to the level of resolution possible with current functional imaging and that would not result in spurious functional differences.

Study Design Overview  
Subjects will undergo medical workup per standard of care.  Subjects refractory to current medical therapy may be enrolled without changes to their current medical treatment. No new pharmacological agents will be added during the 4-week study period and no changes in dosing or scheduling of current therapy will be allowed during the study period. Subjects will be screened weekly for any side effects by [CONTACT_851691] (pTRU) .  All subjects will be asked to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_851654].  Any subject without improvement in symptoms during the study will be able to discontinue the study. If symptoms worsen or fail to improve during the study or if their clinical presentation changes in any way, subjects will have the option to drop out any time, receive standard medical therapy and appropriate referrals. If per standard of care, a subject requires a change in one or several of their regular medications during the study, they will be asked to notify the research team. To monitor this, the subjects will be inquired about their medication list and doses during their weekly visits. If the medication change is determined to potentially affect the stu dy results, the subject may be excluded from 
further study as determined by [CONTACT_978].   
 
Protocol and Procedures  
 
Pre (Baseline):  
The primary investigator, a co-investigator or research coordinator will introduce the study to eligible patients seen in the CHW Gastroenterology Clinic during their regularly scheduled clinic visit. A member of the research team will explain the details and purpose of the study during an informed consent discussion. Once the patient and caregivers have had enough time to consider participation, understand all of the risks and benefits and would like to participate, they will complete the informed  consent, assent and HIPAA documents.  
 
7 
 Medical and psychological history will be obtained to verify eligibility and screen patients for alcohol, nicotine, 
and drug abuse following the completion of consent/assent documents.  All eligible subjects will complete the questionnaires related to demographic, medical, and psychological factors including nausea, abdominal pain, IBS symptoms (Rome IV), anxiety, disability and quality of life (Table 1). This will take about 30 minutes total to complete .  Subjects will then undergo baseline heart rate variability (HRV) measurements in clinic. Children  
will perform a self -assessm ent of the Tanner stage of pubertal development using a validated self- assessment 
form.    
Visit 1: Subjects will undergo the 13C gastric emptying breath test (GEBT)  (Table 1).  See section on 13C GEBT 
for details and attached protocol.  
 
Visit 2: Subjects will undergo Satiety Drink Test (see SDT section and attached protocol). 
 
Visits 3 -6: Subjects will complete questionnaires as per Table [ADDRESS_1184197]- neurostimulation  #1: Subjects will not return but will complete questionnaires (Table 1) at the end of 4 
weeks of therapy which will be mailed back to the research team.  Participants in fMRI sub -study will undergo 
repeat fMRI scan (post -scan) at this visit and complete questionnaires per Table 1.  
  
Post- neurostimulation  #2: All subjects will retu rn to clinic for their regularly scheduled clinic follow-up visit 2 
months after end of therapy and will complete questionnaires as per Table 1.  
 **Subsequent to the initial 4 weeks of therapy, subjects will undergo another 4 weeks of active  
neurostimulation therapy (visits 7 -10) with the exact same protocol as during the first round of treatment. A 
post-neurostimulation #3 questionnaire assessment will be completed (just as with post-neurostimulation #1) although no repeat fMRI scans will be performed at this time. Similarly, a post- neurostimulation #4 clinic visit 
will be scheduled 2 months after the end of the second 4 week of therapy.    
Optional fMRI Sub- study  
Participants who are interested in learning more about the fMRI sub- study will indicate so on the main study 
consent form.  A member of the research team will explain the sub-study to the participant and guardian(s).  If the participant is willing to participate, the  sub- consent and assent forms will be completed.  [CONTACT_851734] will 
complete a psychological history for all participants who agree to participate in the fMRI sub-study. Female 
participants in the experimental group (Nausea group; n=15 and IBS group; n=15) who are found to be eligible to participate in the sub -study will be scheduled to complete the fMRI scans at Visit 3  (baseline scan) prior to 
EAD placement and Post #1 (post- scan; day [ADDRESS_1184198] neurostimulator placement within one hour of 
removing the device). The  post- scan will be compared to baseline and baselin e scans from 15 age-and gender-
matched healthy controls who will undergo one fMRI scan (no therapy). All ethnic categories will be included.  
Healthy control participants will be recruited via word of mouth. Researchers will mention the study to peers who will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_851692]. A member of the research team will introduce the study either in person or over the phone and will explain the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  If the participant is  eligible,  consent/assent documents will be completed. Participants will then be 
scheduled to visit the pTRU where they will meet with a study physician who will perform a brief medical 
examination to confirm participant eligibility.  Eligible participants will be e scorted to the MRI unit by a 
member of the research team where they will be introduced to the mock scanner.  Participants will have the option of lying in the mock scanner prior to their fMRI scan. A medical professional who is a member of the research team will be present during the scan.  Healthy controls will only have 1 fMRI visit which will be 
completed at their convenience.

All procedures will be performed in the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30857] (CHW) Pediatric Translational 
Research Unit ( pTRU). Prepackaged kits (Cairn Diagnostics, Brentwood, TN, [LOCATION_003]) for the gastric emptying 
breath test and nutrient drinks will be stored by [CONTACT_851694]. The prepackaged kits for the gastric emptying test and neurostimulators will be shipped by [CONTACT_851695]. A box labeled with subject ID and containing neurostimulators (four), a GEBT kit and a labeled folder with patient ID and relevant questionnaires will be premade and kept with each subject package. After the breath test is performed, research 
coordinators will ship the samples to Cairn Diagnostics within 2 days of collection.   
Measurements and Data Collection  
At the time of each neurostimulator placement, a member of the research team will inquire and document current medications and doses and if subjects experienced any side effects from the neurostimulator during the previous week. Subjects will also be asked if they wore the device for all five days and it will be documented if the device was returned to the research team.  
 Demographic Information Data will be collected as part of the clinic visit and at enrollment.  This includes child’s  date of birth, age,  sex, 
ethnicity, and caretaker marital status. The physician assessment will also include questions about prior medical 
diagnoses, co-morbid symptoms and the characteristics of pain and nausea such as timing and triggers.   Symptom Information  
Patients  will complete the questionnaires as outlined above before, weekly at the time of application of the 
neurostimulator and after the study completion.  These i nstruments have demonstrated reliability and validity 
and have been used for both clinical and research  purposes in pediatric populations. Up to one year after study 
completion, the investigators my conduct brief follow-up phone calls to subjects to assess long- term effects.  
   Medical Information  
Information recorded for patients is part of clinical care and includes weight, height, vital signs, medications, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, early life events, family history, surgeries and other medical co- morbidities.  
 Gastric Emptying Breath Test (GEBT)  
The 13C-GEBT is a validated, FDA approved and radiation free alternative in which the isotope 13C bound to 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_851655] a test meal.77,78 The 13C-labeled solid is absorbed in the duodenum, metabolized 
and excreted as 13CO 2 in breath.79 Breath samples are collected at specific intervals as gastric emptying is the 
rate-limiting step for the exhaled 13CO 2. Baseline 13C-GEBT is performed on all subjects using a standardized 
10 
 meal as previously performed in children and adults.19,77,78 End-tidal breath samples are collected before and at 
regular in tervals after ingestion (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 min). Breath samples are 
analyzed for 13CO 2 content using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Cairn Diagnostics, Brentwood, TN, [LOCATION_003]) as 
previously described.77 The time at which half of the 13CO 2 is excreted in the breath is defined a s the gastric 
emptying half time (t 1/2). Subjects are classified as delayed (t 1/2>90th percentile) vs normal (10th< t1/2 ≤90th 
percentile) gastric emptying based on control data obtained through separate study.  
 
Regulatory status 
The 13C-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_851656] (GEBT) is FDA approved (PMA #P110015) for use in adults 
(see attached forms and intended use statement below).  
 
Intended Use Statement  
The Gastric Emptying Breath Test (GEBT), to be used with the GEBT test meal, is intended fo r use in the 
measurement of the rate of gastric emptying of solids and as an aid in the diagnosis of delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) in adult humans who are symptomatic for gastroparesis. For these purposes, the test system utilizes a Gas Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (GIRMS) for the measurement of the ratio of 
13CO [ADDRESS_1184202] (GEBT)  
The GEBT is a non -radioactive breath test that uses the stable isotope, carbon 13 (13C).80 13C stable isotope 
labeling is inherently  safe as 1.1% of all the carbon in nature, our bodies and in the food we eat is 13C, with the 
remaining 98.9% being 12C. The test consists of a breath collection kit with subsequent analysis of the breath 
samples by [CONTACT_851696] (“GI RMS”).  The breath collection kit includes a standardized 
test meal that contains freeze-dried 13C labeled Spi[INVESTIGATOR_112174]. 
 After an overnight fast, the patient consumes the test meal consisting of: • a dried scrambled egg mix containing approximately 100 mg of 
13C-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_112174].  The 13C- labeled 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_112174]/scrambled egg mix  is rehydrated with potable water just before cooking in a microwave oven 
• Six (6) Nabisco PREMIUM Saltine crackers  
• Six (6) ounces of potable water  Breath samples, collected before and after the test meal, are sent to Cairn Diagnostic’s  CLIA certified  
laboratory for analysis by [CONTACT_851697] 
13CO 2/12CO 2.  This ratio is used to calculate the 
13CO [ADDRESS_1184203] GEBT meal 
consisting of 27 grams of re-hydrated, pasteurized scrambled egg mix containing a dose of 43 mg of 13C 
(provided by [CONTACT_3450] 100 mg of 13C-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_112174]), 6 saltine crackers, and 6 ounces of potable water. The 
caloric value of the meal is approximately 230 kCal. As the egg meal containing the 13C-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_851657] a particle size of 1 – 2 mm, it passes through the pylorus into the intestine. In the intestine, the labeled products of 
13C-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_851658] (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) are absorbed and metabolized 
giving rise to 13C-labeled carbon dioxide expi[INVESTIGATOR_851659]. Breath samples, collected periodically in capped 
glass tubes before and after test meal administration, are returned to a central laboratory for analysis by [CONTACT_851698] (GIRMS) to determine the ratio of 
13CO 2/12CO 2 in each sample. By [CONTACT_851699]- meal value, the rate of 13CO 2 excretion can be 
calculated and the individual’s gastric emptying rate determined.  In addition, MLR equations78 can be used to 
11 
 calculate “breath test fraction emptied” values and a “breath test t ½” value that are comparable with 
scintigraphic fraction emptied and scintigraphic half emptying times.  
 
GEBT Configuration 
The G EBT procedure is conducted over a 4- hour period. Following an overnight (or ≥8 hour) fast, duplicate 
pre-meal breath samples are collected from the test subject. Two pre- meal samples are collected to ensure that 
in the event of breakage, leakage or a lost sample, there is a “back -up” available in order to establish a subject’s 
baseline 13CO [ADDRESS_1184204]’s baseline 13CO [ADDRESS_1184205] of all materials provided with the GEBT kit: 
• 1 Pouch of Diagnostic Dosage (13C-Spi[INVESTIGATOR_112174]/Egg Mix in a foil pouch with oxygen absorber) 
• 6 Saltine crackers (3 packages, of two crackers each, repackaged in a foil pouch with oxygen absorber) 
• 1 large (~8 oz) microwaveable cooking cup 
• 1 filling cup (small (~ 3.5 fl oz) plastic cup with pour spout for transferring water) 
• 1 plastic cutlery kit (knife, fork and spoon)

Shelf Life and Storage  
The 13C-GEBT Administration Kit will be stored at controlled room temperature*.  The kit has an expi[INVESTIGATOR_5695]; 
the GEBT Kit will not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_851660].   Collected breath samples should be stored at controlled room temperature*. Breath samples need to be shipped to Cairn Diagnostics, in a sample mailer, within three weeks of collection.  
 *Controlled room temperature: a temperature maintained thermostatically th at encompasses the usual and 
customary working environment of 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F).   
Subject Preparation  
The GEBT should be administered after an overnight fast. No solid food should be consumed or vigorous activity undertaken within [ADDRESS_1184206], but not more than 4 fluid ounces. Coffee may enhance gastric motility and should not be consumed within 8 hours prior to testing.  Subjects should not smoke/use tobacco products (e.g. chewing tobacco, nicotine gum) before or during administration of GEBT.  The research team will confirm that the individual being tested does not have a known hypersensitivity to Spi[INVESTIGATOR_112174], egg, milk, or wheat allergens; is not severely lactose intolerant; and has not taken medications known to influence the rate of gastric emptying (e.g., erythromycin, metoclopramide, opi[INVESTIGATOR_851661]) within [ADDRESS_1184207] (with the exception of the test meal) for the duration of the test. Limited walking is allowed, when necessary, e.g., use of restroom.  
Satiety Drink Test (SDT) 
[ADDRESS_1184208] a nutrient formula at a predetermined rate until reaching maximal satiety  (see protocol below). The volume ingested when reaching a satiety score of 5 corresponds to 
the maximal ingested volume (i.e. drinking capacity). The SDT measurements will be compared to normative data from a separate study. A d rinking capacity (kcal) of <[ADDRESS_1184209] a room temperature liquid nutrient drink (Ensure Original Vanilla; Abbott Laboratories, IL, U.S.) containing 220kcal per 237ml, 18% protein, 11% carbohydrates and 9% lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. One of two beakers will be filled with the drink by a research coordinator or nurse at a rate of 30 ml/min. The subject will be instructed to ingest the drink at the filling rate by [CONTACT_851700].  Every 5 min, they will be asked to score their satiety and symptoms of nausea, bloating, pain, burning sensation and vomiting on a scale 1-5: 1= no sensation; 2=first sensation; 3=mild sensation; 4=moderate sensation and 5= maximum sensation. The maximum tolerated gastric volume (kcal), i.e. drinking capacity, is recorded after subjects reach  maximal satiety  with a score of [ADDRESS_1184210] their nausea on a validated pi[INVESTIGATOR_851662] (BARF scale) [ADDRESS_1184211] decreases in vagal output. The high frequency range of HRV is considered representative of vagal (parasympathetic) activity and studies show altered vagal tone as measured by [CONTACT_851701].
86 All subjects will undergo a 9 min ute baseline HRV measurement (3 minutes 
sitting , 3 minutes standing and 3 minutes sitting ) after [ADDRESS_1184212]. This will be repeated 20 minutes into 
neurostimulation and following the end of therapy. Data will be compared to the healthy controls from IRB protocol (#1030543-5 ). Recordings will be performed supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , sitting  and standing to assess baroreflex 
response. HRV indices such as Respi[INVESTIGATOR_851663] (RSA), low frequency domains, low/high frequency ratio and the time domain RMSSD as a surrogate of vagal tone
84 will be analyzed using 
CardioEdit/Batch software. The RSA values will be the primary HRV outcome and compared to baseline pre-neurostimulation  and previously collected normative data from age-matched, healthy controls.  
 Questionnaires:  
All patients will complete the questionnaires listed below.  Patients are allowed to skip any questions that they do not feel comfortable answering. A member of the research team will introduce each questionnaire and explain the instructions to each of them.    
1.  Nausea Profile (NP). The NP is a two page, 17 -item questionnaire validated in adolescents which measures  
     the subjective experience of nausea on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 9 (severely) across three dimensions: 1)       somatic distress; 2) GI distress and 3) emotional distress.
[ADDRESS_1184213] week. Three subscale scores and a total score is generated which can be used to measure an  
     individual’s experience of nausea and how it changes over time.88  This instrument has demonstrated  
13 
      excellent internal reliability in adolescents (Cronbach’s  α=0.941).32 Subjects will also rate their usual level of  
     nausea on a scale fr om 0 to 10 ([ADDRESS_1184214] nausea imaginable).  
2.  Baxter Retching Faces (BARF): pi[INVESTIGATOR_851664] (0 -10)83 
3.  Subjective Unit of Distress Scale (SUDS): during active  
     treatment (3x) and off days (1x) to measure amount of distress on a severity scale (0=peace to 10=nervous  
     breakdown)89 (weekly averages will be computed)  
4.  Abdominal Pain Index (API). The API [CONTACT_832] a short, one-page instrument validated in children with functional       
abdominal pain.90 A revised form of t his scale will be used to assess nausea  (=Nausea Severity Scale) .  
5. Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Systems (PROMIS) Pediatric Anxiety -Short Form scale:[ADDRESS_1184215] (PhD) will assist with interpretation of the psychometric data. Scores  
     will be compared against healthy norms, and pediatric chronic pain patients.  6.  Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global healthy: A newly developed and validated global health/quality of life outcome measure that provides an efficient (7- item) summary of a 
child’s physical, mental and social health (both self and parental reports will be assessed) .

8.  Children’s Somatization Inventory (CSI): 24-item instrument assessing child and parent report of multisystem somatic complaints. The CSI has been validated in children with functional pain disorders.
94  
9.Visceral Sensit ivity Index (VSI): The VSI is a short, one- page validated instrument assessing gastrointestinal 
symptom- specific anxiety.95  
10. Subjects will also fill out a short validated overall symptom response scale.96 Subjects will rate their  
     symptoms as better, worse or no change based on a 15 point scale: -7 to -1= worse; 0 = no change; +1 to +7       = better). A score of +5 to +7 will be considered significant improvement.  11. Patient Assessment of upper Gastrointestinal Symptom Severity Index (PAGI- SYM):  
97 Upper 
gastrointestinal symptoms including symptoms of gastroparesis will be assessed via this 20- item instrument.  
12. Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire on Pediatric Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: clinical  
     classification into Rome IV criteria for functional GI disorders (baseline only)98  
 Neurostimulator   
Auricular Neurostimulation ( EAD) treatment protocol  
Subjects  will enter a 4 -week, prospective randomized, double blind sham controlled treatment trial with the 
FDA -approved and commercially available EAD manufactured by [CONTACT_96196] (Jeffersonville, IN, [LOCATION_003]) 
and distributed by [CONTACT_96197] (Versailles, IN, [LOCATION_003]). The device is cleared under the BWK 
classification,  with intended use in the practice of acupuncture by [CONTACT_851702].  EAD is an ambulatory, neurological device which consists of a battery powered, 
externally affixed generator with 4 wire leads attached to 3 electrode/ needle arrays and one single point needle. The arrays are designed to produce a field effect similar to surgically implanted peripheral neurostimulators. The electrodes will be placed percutaneously in the external ear with the help of a tr ansilluminator to visualize 
the neurovascular bundles. Three electrodes will be placed on the ventral and one on the dorsal aspect of the ear. The electrodes will be taped and secured behind the ear next to the generator itself which is secured to the skin with adhesive. The entire device may be covered by [CONTACT_851703]. The placement of the devices is within standard of care by [CONTACT_851704] (IRB
# 689519- 17). 
Training of MDs has been performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Chris Brown or Brian Carrico as representatives of Innovative Health Solutions. Training of other involved physicians may be performed if protocol approved. 40- 50 subj ects 
will receive the active EAD  device while 40-50 subjects will receive an inactive  device that is identical to the 
active device but lacking the battery.     
 
14 
 Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either treatment or sham group.  Randomization will be determined 
using a computer program based on random number generation in blocks of 10 subjects at a time. The manufacturer will provide the researchers with four devices per package (4 weeks per patient) and distribute [ADDRESS_1184217]’s numbered package to the research area (Translational Research Unit) when patient arrives. The package for the subject will be stored locked in the TRU until the 
subject finishes the [ADDRESS_1184218] to complete the pre- placement 
questionnaires (Table 1; visit #3) and hand the device (numbered with serial # and patient ID only) to one of the certified MDs for placement. The devices will be "made to order" when requested by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_851665].  
 Patients will be told that they may or may not feel a slight flushing or tingling sensation after device placement. The electrode/needle arrays are implanted according to the individual’s arterial and cranial nerve anatomy. The exact location of the implan tation may vary slightly from person to person but is determined by [CONTACT_851705]-anatomy and visualization of the neurovascular bundles by [CONTACT_170579]- illumination  (IHS, 
Versailles, IN, [LOCATION_003]). The points will be targeted by [CONTACT_66997]- point electrical stimulation using the EAD device after 
carefully disinfecting the ear. The small device will be positioned and secured behind the ear similar to a hearing aid, which may be covered by [CONTACT_370197]. Neurostimulation will be delivered below sensation threshold continuously for [ADDRESS_1184219] them as they are non-functioning after 5 days (5 days battery life). If a device is lost or broken, the research team will attempt to schedule placement of a new EAD within 1 
day if you wish. The devices are easily removed by [CONTACT_851706]. Before and during the treatment trial, subjects and parents will complete questionnaires as shown in Table 1. 
 The EAD Surgical kit consists of : 
- an alcohol swab  - prep and stay swab  - round fixation plasters - fixation plasters to fasten the generator  - Steri -strip adhesive vial  
- Sterile wire harness pack  - Generator  
- Tweezers  
- Surgical marker  
- Transilluminator  
 EAD  placement details:  
1. A research coordinator in the GI office will be asked to open the package and obtain either a true device or a control device as outlined in a randomization scheme provided by [CONTACT_851707]. This research 
coordinator will document the patient ID, name [CONTACT_851732].  This lead research coordinator will be the only 
unblinded person and she will not be involved in any patient contact [CONTACT_851708].  
[ADDRESS_1184220] 
but should report if the discomfort persists or gets worse after a few minutes. The patients should be advised that they may feel a slight pulsing sensation and perhaps a warming sensation in the ear to which the electrodes are affixed. The pulsing and warming sensation may disappear after approximately 5 minutes. If the discomfort level increases the offending electrode can be slightly repositioned until the patient’s discomfort level decreases to an acceptable level.  
4. Device placement will take approximately [ADDRESS_1184221] a dry wash cloth or plastic such as Press n’ seal over the area to help pro tect the device. Subjects will be given a contact 
[CONTACT_9702] (primary investigator and research coordinator) to call if they are having any problems with the device or if it falls off.   
6. The patient will be instructed on removing the device after 5 days. If not comfortable doing so or unable to carry out the instructions, the patient may be seen that day for removal by [CONTACT_54858].  
7. At the end of the study (post-neurostimulation #1), subjects will be asked to guess their group allocation  to test blinding. 
8. The patient will be asked to return the used device for proper disposal when they return for their follow-up appointment.  
9. The subject will be given a handout with information (attached) on device handling, exact date and time of device removal and  date and time to return.  
10. The subject will be advised to refrain from using any new or as needed anti- emetic or pain medications.  
11. The subject is dismissed.  
  
 Optional fMRI  sub-study  
Participants will be given the option to participate in the f MRI sub-study.  Post menarche patients must yield a 
negative urine pregnancy test on the day of each scan.  Participants will then be escorted to the f MRI scanner in 
the lower level of FH where t hey will complete the safety screening questionnaire.  The patient will be given the 
option of lying down in the mock scanner prior to their first fMRI scan.   
 The fMRI scans will be carried out using GE 3T short bore scanner.  This scanner is located at the Froedtert  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  For each participant we will perform one baseline whole brain anatomical scan and one resting state  
fMRI  scan before and after therapy. Healthy controls will have only one baseline fMRI scan. The healthy 
controls will also undergo a visual task where they are simply shown images while in the fMRI scanner. These images will be related to toilet training and this data will be used for healthy comparison data from separate study by [CONTACT_27156] (IRB #774802- 6). We anticipate the whole ses sion to last about 40 minutes.  Echo  planner 
images resolved to 64x64 pi[INVESTIGATOR_41463]/slice at TR of 2s and echo time of 25 ms will be obtained.  
Resting State Functional Connectivity MRI  
Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis measures the temporal correlation between a predetermined seed region of interest and functionally related brain regions. After subgroupi[INVESTIGATOR_851666], [ADDRESS_1184222] EAD placement which is repeated after 4 weeks of therapy (after stimulator removed) (Table 1; post- neurostimulation  #1). 15 female subjects classified as irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS group) will undergo the same protocol. Resting state MRI scans will be performed per protocol below. The amygdala will be used as a seed region and the functional connectivity between the 
amygdala and PFC regions will be examined during rest at baseline. Data will be compared i n treatment 
16 
 responders (if possible) and non-responders in order to evaluate connectivity differences before and after 
therapy in these two groups.   
Multimodal Imaging protocols  
Research -dedicated GE MR750 3.0 Tesla whole -body scanners with 32- channel phase -array head coil will be 
employed and the scanner is located in the Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (FH)/Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW). Our scanning protocol will focus on integrating the most recent advances in multimodal imaging technologies, including T1 SPGR, T2 FLAIR, R -fMRI, and ASL -CBF images.  The justifications of utilizing these imaging 
protocols are: 1) to noninvasively characterize the structural, functional, and metabolic changes in subjects; 2) these imaging protocols will provide robust quality control, repeatable and reliable imaging datasets for imaging post- processing and statistical analyses; 3) most of these imaging protocols and pulse sequences have been tested 
and released as products by [CONTACT_851709] (GE, Siemens, and Philips), ther efore, they can be immediately 
translatable to the clinic setting.  Specifically, the integrated multimodal imaging protocols and justification are summarized below:  
 1)  SPGR high -resolution images.  Acquire T1 weighted spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPG R) images for 
high spatial resolution of anatomical images. The SPGR images can be employed for tissue segmentation and volumetric analysis using FreeSurfer, and image registration for functional neural network studies.  2)  FLAIR images .  Acquire T2 weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images for general 
pathological detection such as for macroscopic white matter lesion quantification, and micro hemorrhage. In addition, the T1/T2 ratio can provide myelination information.  3)  R -fMRI images.  Acquire resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R -fMRI) datasets to study 
intrinsic blood oxygenation level dependent (iBOLD) signal. These iBOLD signals will be employed to study changes in neural networks of the disease and control brains. It is hypothesized that a) alterations in functional 
cortical networks are apparent; b) Network wide analysis can identify and classify functional disease status together with their comorbidity.  We will utilize “seed” -based, module- based, and whole brain network- based 
analyses to characterize the changes in nausea/pain brains. For the image acquisition, we will employ our newly developed pulse sequence, named Spatially compensated Intra-shot Turbo keyhole (SCITH), based on multi-echo denoise approach for robust reliability and repeatability for functional connectivity analyses.    All these imaging protocols and data acquisition will be completed within one scanning sessions in [ADDRESS_1184223].    Data Acquisition and Analysis   
Data acquisition: The cerebral cortical activity will be monitored in all subjects with a blood oxygenation level -
dependent (BOLD) fMRI technique. Gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) data will be acquired on a Neuro-
optimized 3.0 T MR system (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, [LOCATION_003]). A quadrature birdcage head coil will be used for radio frequency (RF) transmission and reception. One hundred and twenty T2*- weighted images depi[INVESTIGATOR_627966]-dependent (BOLD) contrast (Ogawa et al., 1990) will be acquired over 6 min at each of 14 near -axial non- contiguous 4 mm thick planes parallel to the inter commissural (AC±PC) line: TE 
(echo time) = 25 ms; TR (repetition time) = 2 s; matrix size = 64 x 64; FOV (Field of view) = 240 mm; in -plane 
resolution = 3.75*3.75 mm
2; interslice gap = 0.7 mm.  
 
Scanning protocol : A 6  min resting state scan will be performed at baseline. The same protocol is repeated at 
end of therapy with another scan after device is removed (Table 1; post-neurostimulation #1) . This will allow us 
to examine functional connectivity changes induced by [CONTACT_851710]. rsFC will be compared between baseline and end of treatment in both treatment responders and non-responders and compared to healthy controls and IBS patients . Brain  activation will be quantified for each voxel by [CONTACT_851711]. Spatial smoothing of the response magnitude across voxels will be 
17 
 conducted using a 6- mm full-width half- maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel ﬁlter  to compensate for 
intersubject variability. In the group analysis, activation maps for each stimulation state and group will be 
derived by [CONTACT_851712]- sample t -tests of fitting coefficient from regression analysis. The obtained 
statistical maps  were corrected for multiple comparisons using the probability and cluster thresholding 
technique (AlphaSim in AFNI).  
fMRI-guided connectivity analysis: We have developed a novel fMRI -guided connectivity analysis  in previous 
investigations by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Li to determine the distribution of an arousal network by [CONTACT_2329] a seed region in a specific brain area of interest. In this protocol, we will examine resting state functional connectivity with amygdala as the seed region of interest and its coupling with prefronta l cortex areas as well as insula and hypothalamus as 
key nodes of the emotional arousal neurocircuit and internal awareness. 
 Statistical Analysis  
 
Data Management  
The data gathered will be entered into REDCap  data system with each ID having a unique identifier for each 
participant. REDCap is a secure, web -based application for building and managing online databases. All data 
will be de -identified and samples will only have a unique identifier that will link th e unique identifier with the 
patient’s name.  
 The REDCap clinical database will be maintained by [CONTACT_851713], at the Children's Research Institute under the direction of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_249341], PhD.     
Missing Data Handling 
Missing Data:  Every effort will be made to avoid missing data. Using logistic regression, the pattern of missing 
data will be explored. Assuming the data are missing at random (MAR) multiple imputations for items will be used. Data analysis overview:  Summary statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, range and 
correlation will be used as a first step to examine data.  To satisfy parametric assumptions, we may perform transformations with justifications if possible and otherwise use non- param etric tests. We will use CART and 
biological and physiological information to identify interactions when formulating regression models. Statistical software employed for data analysis will be: Cytel StatXact, SAS version 9.4, Salford System CART for trees, SPSS Version 24. The power calculation was made using PASS 13.’  Power  
 
Aim 1.  We will summarize characteristics by [CONTACT_173376][INVESTIGATOR_14839].  
Aim 2.  See fMRI analysis section below  
Aim 3 . Hypothesis 3a): Four weeks of active neurostimulation will reduce nausea and concurrent symptoms from 
baseline compared to sham therapy as measured by [CONTACT_12884] N ausea Severity Scale total score (primary outcome)  
after 4 weeks of therapy. Secondary outcomes include  daily nausea (BARF)  scores,  and weekly nausea profile 
scores, upper GI symptoms (PAGI -SYM), abdominal pain (API), anxiety ( SUDS, PROMIS and VSI) , quality of 
life (PROMIS), disability (FDI) and co-morbid symptoms (CSI) . Another secondary efficacy variable will be the 
change in Nausea Severity Scale score after the second [ADDRESS_1184224] at a Bonferroni corrected alpha of 0.05. Power:  with ~ 40 in each group initially, allowing 
for 12% dropout  based on our prior study, we will have ~ 35 subjects and 80% power to detect a difference of at 
least XX standa rd deviations (SD). We will similarly compare the other variables. Further we will use regression 
and regression trees with final value as the outcome and demographics, baseline values and overall symptoms as covariates. Hypothesis 3b: Adolescents with FN will have reduced vagal tone as measured by [CONTACT_851714]. Active 
neurostimulation therapy will elevate vagal tone compared to baseline  and sham therapy, resembling that of 
healthy controls . We will similarly analyze the change in vagal tone in nausea subjects . Furt her we will compare 
[ADDRESS_1184225] of equivalence where equivalence will be defined as 
within 20%. See fMRI analysis section for details on resting state fMRI analyses.  
Longitudinal Continuous Variables 
The efficacy parameters of longitudinal continuous variables such as nausea and pain will be analyzed using a 
mixed effects covariance pattern model to utilize all the data collected over time with consideration of the variance- covariance matrix of the repeated measures. This method allows a general unstructured variance-
covariance matrix and allows patients to have incomplete data across scheduled time points. The method applied is also known as mixed- effects repeated measures analyses (MMRM).  
 The primary model wi ll include independent variables of the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, assessment 
visit, and treatment-by-assessment, interaction, along with the continuous effects of baseline and baseline-by-assessment interaction up to end of study. An unstructured variance- covariance structure will be used to model 
the within -patient  errors and different variance -covariance structures will be tried for goodness-of- fit 
exploration.  
Continuous/ Ordinal variables 
Summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, range and correlation plots and tree analysis will be used to examine distributions and interrelationships. Where necessary, for parametric assumption, we will 
employ appropriate transformations with justifications. If data cannot be appropriately transformed we will 
compare variables between the two groups using a Mann- Whitney test.  
 Additional Analysis  
In addition to the above described primary analysis, the following analysis will be done. 1. The mean change from baseline in all efficacy variable scores will be summarized using descriptive statistics at all assessment time points.   2. To assess effects of dropouts, the dropout cohort analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_851715]. Dropout cohorts will be formed by [CONTACT_851716].  
 For all efficacy variables, nominal p -values will be presented without applying any adjustment for multiple 
comparisons.  GEBT Metrics  
The preferred and FDA approved GEBT metric is the Percent Dose (abbreviated PCD) excreted at time t after 
consumption of the test meal.  To provide a more convenient scale, we multiply PCD by 1000 to produce kPCD at any time, t.

The kPCD va lues will be used to estimate the fraction of meal emptied from stomach at the specific time points.

 For all efficacy variables, nominal p -values will be presented without applying any adjustment for multiple

Safety Data  
All safety variables (e.g., adverse events will be summarized for each assessment time (including follow-up) 
using descriptive statistics. Incidence of adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148].  
 
fMRI analyses  
 
Strategies for imaging data analysis and data fusion with clinical observation .  The goal for analyzing results 
from integrated multimodal imaging protocols is provide structural, functional, and metabolic information for the insight into the mechanisms of pain/drug abuse brains in order to advance long- term prevention, diagnosis, 
prediction and treatment planning.  Our strategy for analyzing these large complexes imaging datasets will involve 
four steps: First step , preprocess imaging datasets for individual subjects and then convert voxelwise imaging 
parameters into standard imaging  matrices in MNI templates.  Second step , conduct group- level statistical 
analysis based on each of imaging modalities, e.g. functional (R -fMRI) or ASL -CBF images. There are three 
levels of neural network analyses: 1) Seed -based network analysis; 2) ROI -based large scale network analysis; 
and 3) whole brain Graph theory analysis (e.g., Small -world graphical analysis). From the second step, we will 
obtain imaging parameters as independent variables for each subject such as brain atrophy, CBF and functional connectivity index (FCI) at seed, regions, and whole brain networks levels. Third step , construct a database 
containing demographic information and a battery of neuropsychological and behavioral testing scores. Fourth step, conduct Data fusion processes from step 2 and step 3 with Multivariate analysis  and Multivariate Linear 
Regression for establishing the neural biomarker for diagnosing and measuring treatment responses/efficacy.  
 
Multivariate analysis will be employed in determining the sensitivity and specificity in discriminating normal, pain, or drug abuse subjects as described in specific Aims. The imaging parameters P  from step 2 (e.g. Functional 
connectivity index (FCI) and metabolic information (CBF) will be statistically combined to give a composite imaging Index, which will be employed in disease diagnoses. We propose to use a multivariate classification 
20 
 technique, such as Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Function. Assume that we have a training sample of n  normal 
subjects, and m dise ased subjects (nausea or pain ).  For each subject, we measure P  parameters.  Then, we can 
assemble this data into the matrices: X 1 = [x 11, x12,…, x 1,n] and X 2 = [x 21, x22,…, x 2,m], 
where x ij = vector of P  measurements for subject j from group i (i=1,2 (nor mal and diseased, respectively).   Let 
μ1, μ2 =  sample mean vectors, and S 1, S2 = sample covariance matrices, for the normal and diseased groups.  The 
sample covariance matrices can be combined into a single, pooled estimate:  S pooled   =  [(n-1)S1 + (m -1) S2] / 
(n+m -2). 
From these quantities, Fisher’s Sample Linear Discriminant Function is given by: 
y(xo) = ( μ1 – μ2) S-1pooled  xo, where x o represents a vector of observations for a new subject.  Define q as the 
midpoint between the transformed sample means: q  =  ½ [y( μ
1) + y( μ2)] = ½ (μ 1 – μ 2) S-1pooled (μ1 + μ 2) 
Then, using Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Function, we classify x o as belonging to the normal group if y( xo) > q, 
and classify x o as belonging to the diseased group if  y( xo) < q.    
Based on these values of y(x o), ROC curves can be constructed.  Note:   In order for the matrix inverse S-1pooled   to 
exist, it is necessary that n + m - 2 > P .  
 Multivariate Linear Regression will be employed in determining the neural correlates of clinical parameters. The imaging parameters P from step [ADDRESS_1184228] j  in the study, we measure 
the vector m  of cognitive attributes at time t: 
Y
j (t) = [Y j1 (t)  Y j2 (t) …   Yjm (t)]. 
We will assemble these measurements for each of the n subjects into the n  x m matrix Y.  The design matrix X  is 
an n x p matrix, Xj (t) = [X j1 (t)  X j2 (t) …   X jp (t)]. In this case, the regression coefficients, which relate the 
independent to the dependent variables, are represented by [CONTACT_941] p x m matrix β.  Then, the multivariate linear 
regression model is given by:   Y = X
 , where ε  is the error matrix.   The error terms corresponding to the m  
cognitive observations for the j th subject may be correlated.  Likelihood ratio tests will be performed to assess 
the statistical significance of various components of the regression coefficient matrix β , in order to determine 
which subsets of the independent variables can be used to predict variations in cognitive ability across subjects.    MCW Research Team and imaging facility:  MCW is a national leader with a well-established model for basic and clinical translational research. Our MCW research group was the first to discover and devel op R-
fcMRI methodology in 1995 and has been at the forefront in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] R-fcMRI applications for nearly two decades.  Our group has previously used R- fcMRI to describe changes in neural networks in a variety of 
diseases and conditions, including cocaine/heroin abuse, mTBI, pain, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, and anesthesia, etc. Also, MCI imaging research center, has a team of imaging physicists and imaging processing scientists and the -state-of-the- art GE MR750 3T scanner to conduct the proposed studies.  
 Outcome measure and Impact :  The proposed study will provide biomarkers for the functional 
pathophysiology of functional GI disorders, as well as other comorbidities that can lead to improved diagnostic and treatment options for these debilitating conditions and ultimately improve the long- term health and welfare 
of functional GI disorders.  G. RISK CATEGORY:  
Nausea and IBS patients - 45 CFR 46.405: Research involving greater than minimal risk but presenting 
the prospect of direct benefit to the individual child subjects Healthy controls in fMRI sub-study - 45 CFR 46.404: Research not involving greater than minimal risk to the children 
H. RISKS AND THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN TO MINIMIZE RISK 
 EXPOSURE  
21 
  
Gastric function tests:  
Involved risks are minimal.  Possible risks involve allergies to contents  of formula or premade meal for GEBT; 
although these will be carefully screened for prior to enrollment there is a possibility of unknown allergies.  Patients may experience some d iscomfort, nausea and possible vomiting with satiety drink test. However, 
patients are instructed to cease drinking at point of satiety so extreme symptoms should not be experienced. 
Questionnaires:  
Patient distress during questionnaire completion:  If children become distressed during completion of study 
questionnaires, they are instructed in the consent and assent forms to inform the researchers or nurse.  The researchers/nurse will then contact [CONTACT_851718] a referral to a psychologist.as necessary and as dictated by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., suspected child abuse/neglect) to ensure patient and family safety and to address psychosocial needs. 
Patient/Parent report of clinically significant psychosocial or safety issues:  Any child endorsing  clinically 
significant psychological distress on questionnaire- reported screening measures will be referred to a 
psychologist. The PROMIS anxiety and global health scales will be scored by [CONTACT_851719] a week of completion. The raw score will be covered to a standardized T score where a T score of [ADDRESS_1184229] ([CONTACT_851734]) as necessary.       
 Heart Rate Variability: Participants will be asked in advance if they have a history of skin allergy to adhesives to avoid provoking any skin irritation or rash.  However, some redness from the adhesive on the ECG surface electrodes may temporarily appear.  
Neurostimulation: 
Overall risks/ discomforts involved are very minimal – Rare (event rate 1% - < 5%)  
 Possible risks/discomforts may involve: 
a. Discomfort upon insertion of the electrodes for < 5 minutes - Rare (event rate 1% - < 5%)  
b. Discomfort at the lead placement site > 5 minutes – Rare (1 % - < 5%)  
c. Bleeding at the electrode site if the neurovascular bundle is penetrated - Rare (event rate 1% - < 5%)  
d. Localized discomfort if the electrodes should become dislodged during the wearing of the device  - Rare (event rate 1% - < 5%)  
e. Localized dermatitis - Rare (event rate 1% - < 5%)  
f. Drop in blood pressure - Rare (event rate 1% - < 5%)  
g. Syncope (fainting) - Rare (event rate 1% - < 5%)  
  Adverse effects to supporting personnel 
a.  Skin pi[INVESTIGATOR_851669] - Rare (event rate 1 % - < 5%)  
 **In our recently completed randomized trial of auricular neurostimulation for functional abdominal pain (unpublished data), there were no significant or serious adverse events noted. Of 115 enrolled subjects, 10 reported side effects for following reasons, none of which were serious: ear discomfort n=6 (three active/three placebo device); adhesive allergy n=3 (one active/two placebo); syncope due to needle phobia n=1 (placebo).   
fMRI  sub-study  
1) Interviews and surveys : In this case that the subject becomes tired they will be permitted to rest.   
2) Magnetic Resonance (MRI) Studies:   MRI studies are associated with the following risks and discomforts:  
22 
 a) An MRI machine acts like a large magnet.  If the study subject has a pacemaker or any metal, such as an  
      aneurysm clip, ear implant, or nerve stimulator in their body, they will not be allowed to have an MRI scan.   
b) If a pi[INVESTIGATOR_851670] (such as a tool, keys, or watch) is released into the scanner room, study subject may be  
      injured.  This chance is minimized by [CONTACT_851720], which is otherwise restricted.  
c) Subjects will be required to wear ear protection to minimize noise injury in the scanner.  
d) If the child brings credit cards, other magnetic media, or fine electronics or devices (such as a watch) into  
      the MRI scanner room, they may be damaged by [CONTACT_851721]. The risk is minimized by [CONTACT_851722]. 
3) Pregnanc y Related Risk:  Pregnant women will not take part in this research study.  The effects of a MRI 
scanner on an unborn baby [CONTACT_56830].  All female participants past puberty will take a urine pregnancy test prior to participating in the fMRI scan.  
4) Fatheri ng a child:  The effects of a MRI scanner on an unborn baby [CONTACT_56830].   Participants  should not 
father a baby [CONTACT_305350].   
5) Claustrophobia:   If the subject experiences fear of being trapped in a narrow space the scan will be stopped.  
If the subject wishes to re-attempt the scan another appointment can be made. 
 There may be other risks and side effects that we cannot predict.  If these should occur the participant should 
discuss them with the researcher and /or their  regular doctor. 
 Safety Monitoring Plan  All procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_851723][INVESTIGATOR_6885] (research unit). Side effects will be inquired about and documented every week during the study and at the post-study follow-up visit. Daily nausea ratings will be filled out by [CONTACT_851724].  If any  serious harm or discomfort is identified by [CONTACT_851725], the treatment will be discontinued. Any patient with worsening or no improvement in symptoms during the study will be able to drop out at any time and receive standard of care medical therapy. The skin of the external ear will be carefully disinfected to avoid any infection risks.  Subjects will undergo vital sign screening before enrollment and vital sign assessment before neurostimulator placement.   Safety Analysis Plan   
There are no dangerous interventions related to this study, and the short study timeline allows for 
discontinuation of treatment when it is proven to be ineffective.   Completion of psychometric questionnaires may be associated with mild distress in some par ticipants. Because 
the questionnaires include assessment of patient psychosocial functioning, clinically significant symptoms that the patient or parent were unaware of may be brought to light.    
Patient distress during questionnaire completion:  If children become distressed during completion of study 
questionnaires, they are instructed in the consent and assent forms to inform the researchers or nurse.  The researchers/nurse will then contact [CONTACT_851718] a  referral to a psychologist.as 
necessary and as dictated by [CONTACT_2371] (e.g., suspected child abuse/neglect) to ensure patient and family safety and to address psychosocial needs. 
 
Patient/Parent report of clinically significant psychosocial or safety issues:  An y child endorsing  clinically 
significant psychological distress on questionnaire- reported screening measures will be  referred to a 
psychologist.  Regarding psychological screeners, rese arch assistants will score the PROMIS questionnaires 
within a week of completion.  Any scores [ADDRESS_1184230]

 There are numerous, possible direct and long- term benefits to the subjects in this study.  Our recently completed 
study of EAD in children with various functional abdominal pain disorders demonstrate improved pain, global 
well- being and functioning after only 3 weeks of therapy with effects sustained at 2 months follow-up 
(manuscript under review). Since it is well documented that functional disability and quality of life is worse in adolescents with functional pain disorders with concurrent nausea th an in those without nausea,
13,[ADDRESS_1184232] improve ment  in concurrent nausea, we postulate that some of the 
improvement in well -being and functioning may be due to reduction in nausea (along with pain) . There  is now 
also mechanistic data through heart rate variability studies before and after therapy (unpublished data), suggesting the EAD acts through peripheral vagal nerve stimulation effects. Given the known vagal pathways involved in nausea and vomiting, we anticipate a reduction in nausea in subjects suffering from chronic functional nausea. Our prior studies on functional nausea show a high prevalence of anxiety and co-morbid GI symptoms including bloating, fullness and discomfort.
13,[ADDRESS_1184233]-prandial fullness, and anxiety may improve. Of 104 subjects  
analyzed, there were no significant side effects reported other than mild ear discomfort (n=6; n=3 in active and n=3 in placebo arm), adhesive allergy (n=3), and one subject with syncope due to needle phobia (placebo arm). Adolescents suffering from functional GI disorders thus have the opportunity to benefit from a non-pharmacological and non-invasive therapy without the adverse effects of pharmacological agents. The results of this study may provide important insights to the medical field  regarding a poorly characterized group of patients 
and the underlying mechanisms.  
As an added incentive, all  participants who complete the study will receive a $75 check mailed to their address 
on file. Those who complete the fMRI portion will receive $125. Subjects who do not complete all parts of the study, will still receive a prorated stipend of $10 per each week of therapy they completed.   L. STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_851674], unanticipated adverse events , and inability  to obtain enough data or patients/caregivers electing to discontinue 
the study.    Reporting Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
Expected adverse events that  are not serious will be  reported on the Continuing Review Progress  Report.  
Continuing Review will be  performed on a 12-month cycle, starting at time of protocol’s  initial approval. More 
frequent progress reports will be submitted  at the request  of the IRB.  
 
Serious Adverse Events: The PI, within 24 hours , will report a ll ser ious adverse events occurring in any 
enrolled subjects to the IRB. Unexpected (but not serious) adverse events occurring in e nrolled subjects which, 
[ADDRESS_1184234]?  WHO ARE IT'S 
 MEMBERS?  HOW OFTEN DO THEY MEET?   
As this is a low risk protocol, no data safety monitoring board will be appointed unless requested.   N. DESCRIBE HOW THE CONSENT PROCESS WILL TAKE PLACE.  INCLUDE A LIST 
 OF APPROPRIATELY TRAINED PERSONNEL WHO WILL BE INVOLVED.  
Written informed consent for participation will be obtained from the parents and children for their child’s participation.  Written assent will be obtained from youth 12 and 13 years  of age using the CHW assent form.  
Patients ages 14 and above will sign the assent line on the consent form per CHW policy.  Consent will be obtained by a study investigator or member of the research team  at the patients ’ appointment in the GI Clinic . 
Volunteers’ consent will allow for accessing information collected for program evaluation/clinical purposes. Participating children and parents will have the option of having the consent/assent document read aloud to them to facilitate understanding.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_247045]/assent documents will be given to participants.  When consent is given for a minor child to participate in a research study by [CONTACT_123566], and the child reaches the age of majority (18 years) the child will be re-consented as an adult to continue participation in the study.  If age of majority is reached while the participant is active and continues to receive study interventions per the study protocol, he/she will be re-consented using the most current approved IRB informed consent document and HIPAA form. If age of majority is reached after all study interventions have been completed and the participant remains in the study for purposes of data collection for outcomes only a separate “Age of Majority” informed consent will b e obtained.  
 O. PROCEDURES TO BE EMPLOYED IN ANALYZING DATA AND THE ANTICIPATED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED STUDY 
Analyses will be conducted with SPSS and SAS software programs.  Probability levels of < .05 will be used as cut offs for statistical signif icance.  
  
The key significance of this study is the identification of a successful, non-invasive therapy for chronic nausea and to study the underlying brain connectivity that may be altered by [CONTACT_494248]. With this study, we hope to lay the foundation for the application of auricular neurostimulation for pediatric functional GI disorders by [CONTACT_851726].  This is an innovative and novel treatment, which will enhance our knowledge on the brain-gut neural connectivity underlying functional disorders and ultimately improve patient care.   
 
P. FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS  
The EAD devices will be supplied by [CONTACT_851727] (IHS) at manufacturing rate. The gastric 
emptying breath test kits and analysis will be supplied by [CONTACT_851728] (Cairn Diagnostics) at a discounted rate. Internal funds from Department of Pedi atrics have been received to support this study and grant

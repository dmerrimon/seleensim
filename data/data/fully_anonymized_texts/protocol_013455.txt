Study Title  Methadone in Ambulatory Surgery  
Objective  Two arm randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_650685] a single dose of 
intraoperative methadone in reducing post -operative pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_660535] , ambulatory  (less than 24 hr  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]) surgi cal 
procedures .  Our secondary goal is to assess  opi[INVESTIGATOR_660536] 30 postoperative days  
Study Period  Planned enrollment duration: Approximately 12 months. 
Planned study duration: Approximately [ADDRESS_890874] 60 evaluable patients in each of two cohorts (ambulatory with less than 24 hr 
overnight stay, and same -day outpatient s) will be randomized into two  groups. Group I will 
receive 0. 1- 0.3 mg/kg IV methadone HCl .  Group II will be the control group and not 
receive any methadone.  
Study Design  Single -center, r andomized, single blinded, positive -controll ed dose escalation pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   
Patients receive standard monitoring for anesthesia and postoperative care. Surgical and 
anesthesia care (except for intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) are not altered for study purposes.  In 
each cohort, s ubjects are randomized 1:2 to either control (standard intraop opi[INVESTIGATOR_660537]’ discretion , not methadone ) or methadone HCl (0. 1 – 0.3 mg/kg ideal 
body weight, IBW) . Subjects in Group I will receive methadone (IV bolus, a t induction of 
anesthesia) as their primary intraoperativ e opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480].  Dose of methadone may be increased up 
to 0.3 mg/kg IBW  following preliminary analysis and review of initial subjects enrolled to 
Group I. Subjects i n Group II (control)  will receive intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_660538]  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_660539]) . Postoperati ve 
pain management for both groups will be per standard of care.

1.1.  To study the effects of a single dose of methadone on postoperative pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_660548], ambulatory  surgical procedures . 
1.2. Determine opi[INVESTIGATOR_660547] 30 postoperative days  
1.3. Determine cytochrome P4502B6 (CYP2B6) genotype in patients receiving methadone , and any 
relationship to postop pain relief and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]  
 
2. Background  
Inadequate pain relief has a significant psycho logical and physiological impact  on patients . The degree to 
which  postoperative pain is controlled impacts the ability of patients to cope with the next pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]  
(1, 2) . Postoperative pain itself is a risk factor for development of chronic pain syndro mes (3).  
 
Methadone is a µ opi[INVESTIGATOR_660549], chronic, 
neuropathic  and cancer pain.  In adults it is increasingly being used as a first -line analgesic.  Methadone is 
highly efficacious in adult anesthesia  and postoperative pain  (4, 5) . The typi[INVESTIGATOR_660550] 20 mg (nominally 0.3 mg/kg) at the beginning of anesthesia.  Methadone is advantageous 
because it has slow elimination, resulting in prolonged effect and significantly dimin ished need for 
postoperative analgesics.  Reducing postop opi[INVESTIGATOR_660551] -
related side effects.  Methadone has a long half -life, averaging 24 -36 hours in healthy adults  and 
adolescent patients .  It has no active  metabolites or pro -drug forms.  Methadone is metabolized in the 
liver primarily by [CONTACT_9058] P450 CYP2B6  (6, 7) . 
 
Perioperative analgesia remains a major challenge for physicians who care for patients undergoing any 
type of  surgery , including  ambulatory and [ADDRESS_890875]  of care intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_660552] . 
 
Evaluating the role of methadone in ambulatory surgery patients is advantageous because 1) prolonged 
analgesia from methadone is expected to decrease the need for additional opi[INVESTIGATOR_660553], 2) opi[INVESTIGATOR_660554] ,  3) lower  overall dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_660555], and 4) improved  immediate postoperative pain relief can decrease occurrence  of chronic 
postoperative pain . 
 
Assessment of pain has become standard practice in the treatmen t of surgical patients. Several tools are 
often used , including the Numeric Rating Scale  and colored -visual analogue scale  (8, 9, 10).  
 
We propose to evaluate intraoperative and postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], pain intensity and pain 
relief in patients undergoing moderately painful, ambulatory  surgical procedures (anticipated length of 
stay < 24 hrs) in 2 cohorts, and 2 groups  in each cohort . Cohort 1 is ambulatory patients with <24 hr 
overnight stay, cohort 2 is  same -day surgery outpatient s).  In each cohort, Group I will receive a single 
dose of methadone during surgery  and Group II will receive a non -methadone intraop erative  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]  
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_660539]) .  Secondarily, we will study opi[INVESTIGATOR_660556] -
assessments within approximately the first [ADDRESS_890876] is about 2 -10 min for parenteral dosing.  Methadone is primarily metabolized 
by N -demethylation to an inactive metabolite, 2 -ethylidene -1,5-dimethyl -3,3-diphenylpyrrolidene 
(EDDP). In vivo, CYP2B6 is a major determi nant of metabolism to inactive metabolites which are 
excreted mainly in the urine.  The terminal half -life (T½) in healthy adults averages 24 -36 hrs  (11, 12 ).

4. Eligibility  
Inclusion Criteria  
 Age 1 8-65 years  
 Undergoing general anesthesia and moderately painful, ambulatory  surgical procedures  with 
anticipated postop hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660558] < 24 hours  
 Signed, writte n, informed consent  
 
Exclusion Criteria  
 History of or known liver or kidney disease.  
 Females who are pregnant or nursing.  
 Opi[INVESTIGATOR_660540] ( e.g. preoperative methadone therapy or use of fentanyl transdermal patches ) 
 History of allergy to methadone  
 
5. Enrollment  
Subjects will be approached prior to surgery  in the Center for Preoperative Assessment and Planning  or 
preoperative holding area .  Patients will be consented for participation and enrolled in the study b y trained 
study personnel.  
 
6. Methods  
Preoperative and Intraoperative Period  
Enrolled subjects will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their current pain and what they 
anticipate following surgery. Patients will receive standard physiologic monitorin g for anesthesia and 
postoperative care.  Subjects within each cohort (n≥60 evaluable , depending on the number of dose levels 
in each cohort ) are randomized 1: 2 to receive either control ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_660559] , such as  fentanyl or 
morphine ) or methadone HCl (0. 1 – 0.3 mg/kg ideal body weight, IBW).  It is anticipated that the first ten 
patients will  receive 0.1 mg/kg IV methadone . If patients still have significant post -op opi[INVESTIGATOR_16443], subsequent group s may receive 0.2 mg/kg and the n 0.3 mg/kg  ideal body weight.  
 
Anesthesia and surgical care will not be altered for the purposes of this investigation, except that subjects 
in methadone group  will receive methadone as their intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], rather than leaving the choice 
of intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_660560] . The control group patients will receive intraoperative 
analgesia with opi[INVESTIGATOR_660561]  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_660562] ). 
 
Administration of Study Medication  
Methadone is administered as an IV bolu s at induction of anesthesia . Methadone hydrochloride is 
available commercially for injection (10 mg/ml ). Subjects randomized to the control group will receive 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (non -methadone) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Both groups will receive standard of care postoperative analgesia as 
determined by [CONTACT_1963].  Postoperative care is not altered for purposes of this study.  
 
Assessments  
Pain assessment s at rest (when patient awake) will be conducted in  the postoperative period by a trained 
membe r of the research team . These will occur after handoff in the Postop Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) 
and approx every [ADDRESS_890877]. Pain intensity will be assessed using the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale  and 
a colored -visual analogue scale . Pain relief will be assessed using five point scale (0 -no relief, 4 -comp lete

Follow -up Assessments  
A home diary  will be used to assess daily drug dosing history upon discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660568]’s posto p clinic visit  at approx imately  [ADDRESS_890878]  daily pain self-
assessments using a colored -visual analogue scale (at rest, with activity and with coughing). The ORSDS 
will be completed and recorded on approx imately  the 7th, 14th and 30th day. We will also ask subjects 
about remaining number of pain medications and their disposal at the 30 day time point.  
 
CYP Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_660569]  5 ml of blood will be collected from an IV line  for CYP2B6 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_660570] (GTAC).   
 
Other Measurements  
Required baseline measurements that will be obtained from the EMR are age, vital signs, weight, height, 
and peripheral oxygen sa turation by [CONTACT_660586].  
 
8. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
In general, the Department of Anesthesiology has developed a specific set of Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) for clinical res earch.  All individuals working o n study  are required to read and be 
totally familiar with and co mpliant with the SOPs.  The  SOPs are in part developed from and are 
compliant with the Institutional guidelines, including those for a) Interactions with the W ashington 
University Human Subjects Review Committee, b) Informed Consent Development and Implementation, 
c) Subject Recruitment and Screening, d)  Subject Management While on Study, e) Adverse Event 
Reporting.  The specific plan for submitting Adverse Even t Reports to the IRB is detailed in the SOP for 
Adverse Event Reporting.  
 
The specific monitoring plan for this investigation is commensurate with the risks , size and complexity of 
the investigations planned.  The potential risks are attribu table to the us e of methadone.  Based on the 
small size and relatively low risks nature of the protocol, only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_660571], rather than a full DSMB .  These individuals  will review the annual summary of adverse events. In 
addition, they will review all reports of a Serious Adverse Event, or an Unexpected Adverse Event.

10. Risk Assessment  
Methadone     
The most common side effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_660574]. Since patients will be 
anesthetized during this period, clinical methadone effects are expected to be no different from those of 
anesthesia and a ny other opi[INVESTIGATOR_660575] .  The most common adverse effect  of 
methadone is nausea and/or vomiting.  Patients will have only clear liquids [ADDRESS_890880] of care.  If nausea and/or vomiting occur, they will be t reated using the standard of care for all 
post-anesthesia nausea and vomiting.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_660576] a potential concern with all opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], but 
has not been problematic at the doses of methadone that have been used in similar previous studies.  Mild 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_660577] <8/min in adults.  Severe depression will be defined 
as the administration of naloxone to a patient with respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] < 6/min.  If treatment is required, 
naloxone will be used.  Patients in the hospit al are routinely periodically monitored by [CONTACT_660587]/or pulse oximetry, and receive supplemental oxygen if dictated, according to good clinical practice.   
 
Special Precautions  
Standard of care for all surgical patients includes an IV, pulse oxime try, ECG , blood pressure monitoring.  
 
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_660578]2B genotype: 1) CYP2B genes are not associates with any 
disorder(s), syndrome(s), or adverse condition. 2) Samples will be kept confidentially. They will be 
coded, with  a key to the code linking code numbers to names kept at a separate location, under lock and 
key. 3) The link to identifiers will be destroyed at the end of the study. 4) We have no evidence to suggest 
that testing will provide evidence of previously undia gnosed or unrecognized illness, or susceptibility to 
illness. 5) We will not use samples for any purpose other than to study genes related to the disposition and 
response to study drugs. 6) Blood samples will not be used to establish permanent cell lines. 7) Data will 
be stored under lock and key (office, file cabinet) and only the investigators will have access. If data are 
published, there will be no link to identifiers. Study data will not be revealed to any organization, 
individuals other than the subje cts, or the subjects themselves. 8) We will not enter any genetic study data 
in subjects’ medical records. 9) Studies are not likely to result in findings that meet the National Bioethics 
Advisory Commission criteria for disclosure. 10) We will not have ge netics counseling available to 
subjects, as they will not be informed of results and there are no know implications with respect to 
disease. 11) DNA samples will stripped of identifiers and given a separate code numbers unrelated to the 
subjects’ study ide ntification numbers. The code key will be kept by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_660579].

Any information that is obtained in connection with research that can be identified with a subject will 
remain confidential.  The consent form, medical information, flow -sheets, will be stored under lock and 
key (office, file cabinet) and only the PI, phys ician investigators, and research team will have access.  
Statisticians involved in the project will have access to de -identified data for the purposes of analysis.   
 
Risk/Benefit Assessment

11. Human Subjects Research  
Protection of Human Subjects  
The study will be conducted under appropriate Washington University Institutional Review Board 
protocols and consent forms approvals.  The study will be conducted under the supervision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_260572]-Investigator , who is a Board -Certified anesthesiologis t with many years of experience in the conduct 
of human volunteer studies.  
 
Sources of Materials  
Information including demographic data, outpatient medications, chronic medical conditions, surgical 
procedure, length of stay, opi[INVESTIGATOR_660581]’s electronic medical record.  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Patients will be screened based on operating room schedules, and approached prior to surgery at the 
Barnes -Jewish H ospi[INVESTIGATOR_660582]. All study related procedures, 
risks and benefits will be described to eligible patients, and time will be provided for addressing all 
questions and concerns.  
   
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Res earch to the Subjects and Others  
1) Prolonged analgesia from methadone is expected to decrease the need for additional opi[INVESTIGATOR_606593], 2) opi[INVESTIGATOR_660583] , 3) lower overall dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_660555],  and 4) improved  immediate postoperative pain relief may decrease the occurrence  of chronic 
postoperative pain

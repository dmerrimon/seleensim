SPECIFIC AIMS:  
     The primary objective of this application is to test the feasibility of a care model whe re clinic nurses play a vital  role in 
promoting the adoption of web -based CBT pain program in the ambulatory setting. We will accomplish this objective 
through suc cessful completion of the following Specific Aims:  
1. To evaluate the adoption of a clinic process that introduces web-based CBT to patients and providers in the clinic  
2. To determine engagement of patients in the use  of web -based CBT by [CONTACT_23992] 2 treatment a rms:  
a. Six telephone contacts  over an 8 -week period  by a trained clinic nurse in motivational interviewing (MI)  
b. Six computer generated email reminders (control arm)  over an 8 -week period  
3. To assess feasibility of clinic nurse s to provide telephone support , using MI technique , to increase patient 
engagement  on the use of web-based CBT program  
 
SIGNIFICANCE:  
     Pain is the most common symptom reported in both the general population and in primary care  1. Pain complaints 
account for more than 40% of all symptom -related outpatient visits and over 100 million ambulatory encounters in the 
U.S. alone each year  2. Pain costs the U nited States (U S) over $ [ADDRESS_802990] important determinants of physical 
disability  9-11. In addition to the physical health consequences, chronic musculoskeletal pain ( CMP ) can have a profound 
negative impact on an individu al’s emotional and social well -being  12-15.       
     Despi[INVESTIGATOR_606125], pain management  remains suboptimal. Pharmacological 
treatments often provide minimal  pain relief  16, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_606126] . 
The evidence for a number of non -pharmacological treatments is limited, except for those using cognitive behavioral 
therapy  (CBT)  for chronic pain  17.  
     Patients with chronic pain often develop maladaptive thought patterns (i.e., catastrophizing) and behaviors (i.e., 
kinesiophobia, or fear of movement) that contribute to physical and emotional suffering. The goal of CBT is to aid the 
patient in reconceptualizing his or her personal view of pain and role in t he process of healing to promote being proactive 
rather than passive. There is substantial evidence for face-to-face delivery of CBT in low back pain, neck pain, temporo -
mandibular joint pain, knee osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia 17. 
     Despi[INVESTIGATOR_606127]  18, access to care is one major limitation . Barriers to accessing face -to-face 
programs are numerous and include cost, stigma, and availability of psychologists  that a re trained in pain management.  
Thus , use of CBT in primary care (and even subspecialty care) where most patients with CMP are seen is almost unheard 
of. Effective , accessible and scalable  psychoeducational treatments are needed to manage CMP  in real world clinic 
setting s 19.  
     Internet -delivered CBT is one innovative approach to increase access to pain management programs. Internet -delivered 
programs use the same principles, content, and components as face -to-face programs but can be provided with varying 
levels of clinician support ranging from regular clinician contact [CONTACT_606132]. 
Systematic  reviews have found small but clinically significant  improvements  in several i mportant domains  including 
disability (effect size= 0.39) and pain severity  (effect size= 0.33)20,21. However, as with face -to-face programs, clinical 
improvements have not been consistently observed in all studies and the magnitude of improvements has varied 
considerably across studies.  
3 
      There are two possible explanations for the inconsistent out comes of internet -delivered CBT  for pain : (1) poor  
participant engagement and (2) absence of regular clinical support  in most  published studies20,[ADDRESS_802991] (i.e., average 81 m inutes per participant) found moderate -to large  improvement s in various 
domain s including disability22. Moreover, while many i nternet -delivered programs reported high non-completion , this 
same Australian study  reported  a high completion  rate ~ suggesting that participants were well engaged in the program22. 
Based on these findings, it appears that some level of clinical support is required to increase partic ipant adherence (or 
engagement)  in order  to enhance clinical outcomes.  
    With our proposed line of research , we hope to address several important unanswered questions : (1) What is the amount 
(or extent) of clinical support needed to yield the best outcome? (2) Could a health care professional without formal 
degree in psychology provide the clinical support (or guidance )? and (3) Is adherence -focused guidance enough to achieve 
acceptable treatment outcome s? Adherence -focused guidance entails adherence monitoring , including reminders  by [CONTACT_606133], to foster  treatment completion . On the other hand, content -focused guidance includes provision of 
personalized feedback for completed treatment modules.  In a pooled analysis  of [ADDRESS_802992] benefit 
implication.  
     Our proposed line of research  is significant  because it will potentially make CBT, a signif icantly underutilized 
modality in pain management, more affordable and accessible. Without overburdening the already “stressed” US Health 
Care S ystem, nurse -guided web -based CBT may reduce the  enormous burden of chronic pain  at the individual and 
societal levels .   
 
INVESTIGATORS:  
Dennis C. Ang, MD  will be responsible for the overall conduct of the  project  that includes : collaborate with the Australian 
team that operates the web based CBT; work with Wake One builder to buil d the new clinic process  in Wake One ; interact  
with [CONTACT_606144]  to ensure adequate training of the triage nurses  in time for the start of rec ruitment , and with [CONTACT_606145]  to enhance adoption of the proposed new clinic process.    
[CONTACT_606146], MD  is the main supervisor of the OPD at Janeway 7th floor. She will work with [CONTACT_606147] to address 
issues affect the implementation of the new clinic process by [CONTACT_606134], residents, CMA/LPN in the clinic.  
[CONTACT_606144] is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine. He will 
supervise the initial and ongoing training of the triage nurses. He will also assess treatment fidelity to the prin ciples of 
motivational interviewing (MI).  
[CONTACT_606148]  is a first year rheumatology fellow who will be in charge of implementing the proposed new clinic process 
in the rheumatology outpatient clinic. He will  participate in collecting measures related to health care use and completion 
of the research dataset.   
Drs. Christina Rinaldi  and David Ansley  are internal  medicine (IM) residents in charge of implementing the proposed 
clinic process at OPD . They will work with their co -residents, nurses and physician supervisors  to increase buy -in of the 
proposed project. They will both participate in collecting measures related to health care use.  
 
INNOVATION:  
     Our study is the first study on web-based  CBT that is specifically designed for implementation and adoption in the 
ambulatory medical setting. As opposed to mental health professional , utilizing clinic nurses to provide support and 
guidance  is relatively new in internet -based psychoeducational interve ntions for chronic pain.   
 
APPROACH:  
 
Study Design : Hybrid effectiveness -implementation  
 
I. Effectiveness . Sixty  subjects (N=60) with CMP will be randomized into one of two treatment arms: (1) free 4 -
month subscription to web -based CBT and six telephone contacts over an 8 -week period by a trained clinic nurse  
(n=30) , and (2) free 4 -month subscription to web -based CBT and six computer -generated email reminders  (n=30) . 
The purpose of (trained) nurse contact [CONTACT_606135]’ motivation to engage in the web-
based CBT program , rather than providing psychological treatment. The active intervention phase is for 8 weeks  
4 
 and the follow -up phase is for another 8 weeks. During the follow -up phase, all partici pants will maintain access 
to the w eb-based CBT program, but will not receive any communication o r support from the nurse . Outcome 
assessments will be conducted at baseline, week 8 (at the completion of  the active intervention phase), week 16 
(primary endp oint).   
 
II. Implementation . We propose a new clinic process  to be implemented in the primary care clinics , and 
rheumatology prac tices throughout the Wake Forest Baptist Health System . At the vital sign station, certified 
medical assistant (CMA) or licensed practice n urse (LPN) will ask 1 -3 questions:  
1. Do you have a computer at home with a reliable internet access?   
a. Yes (Proceed to next question)  
b. No (No further question)  
2. Over  the last [ADDRESS_802993] daily PAIN that interfered with your general activity or 
enjoyment of life ?  
a. Yes (Proceed to next question)  
b. No (No further question)  
3. Have you ever wondered if there is something that you could do on your own to better manage your pain?  
a. Yes (Proceed)  
b. No (End)   
      
     An affirmative response to the 3rd question  would prompt the provider (via a pop -up message)  to request  an 
educational video on pain self -management  by [CONTACT_606136] . After the order is made, the provider will 
receive a message, “ Your patient has been sent a video on Pain Self -Management via Emmi. Please let your patient know 
to expect an e -mail, phone call or portal message with more information ”. 
     The order is received by [CONTACT_606137], a Wake -approved vendor and an industry leader in patient education.  EMMI will 
sends  the video to the patient and makes follow -up contact [CONTACT_606138] [ADDRESS_802994] of a physical informed consent . We also will hav e the subjects complete 
follow up questionnaires in the RedCap program itself. There are no PHI within RedCap . 
 
Study Eligibility  
     The study  inclusion criteria will include: 1) p atients at the primary care or rheumatology clinic  with daily pain for 6 
months or longer affecting the low back, neck, hip, knee or widespread pain ; 2) at least moderate in average pain severity, 
defined as a weekly average pain severity score of 5 or greater  24; 3) at least 18 years of age ; 4) reliable phone (landline or 
cell), and 5 ) have home computer with reliable inte rnet access . 
     The study  exclusion  criteria include: (1) planned elective surgery during the study period; (2) active suicidal ideation 
or very severe symptoms of depression (i.e., PHQ8 score of ≥ 20 ); (3) ongoing unresolved disability claims; (4 ) cancer -
related musculoskeletal pain; (5 ) history of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia ; (6) takes daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_606128]; and (7)  physician -diagnosed active  inflammatory arthritis (e.g., lupus , rheumatoid arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis, 
etc.). 
     For subject who is actively suicidal, we will advise them to go to the nearest emergency room. For subject with PHQ8 
score of ≥ 20, we will provide the contact [CONTACT_606139] .  
     We will recruit [ADDRESS_802995] access to multimodal pain management program. Thus, 
we will make every effort to recruit 36 (60%) subjects on Medicaid.  
 
Web-based CBT program.    
     The web-based CBT program (“ PainTrainer ”) consists of eight online lessons, to be completed over 8 -12 weeks by [CONTACT_2416]  28. The release of content is staged throughout the course duration (one new lesson released every 7 -10 days). 
Lesson content is focused on (1) understanding pain and relaxation , (2) brief relaxation with mini -practices , (3) 
5 
 activity/rest cycles, 4) pleasant activity scheduling, (5) copi[INVESTIGATOR_104326] , (6) pleasant imagery, (7) problem solving, and (8) 
looking back and moving forward . With each lesson, the participant has access to a downloadable lesson summary with 
practical homework exercises, related educational videos, relaxation audio files, and an “at home” exercise program. 
Participants are only able to progress to the next lesson if they ha ve accessed each component of the current lesson . 
 
Randomization  
     Participants  will be randomized and will be stratified by [CONTACT_606140] ( PHQ8<10 vs. ≥10) into one of the 2  
treatment groups : (1) trained MI nurse phone contacts, and (2) computer -generated email reminder s (control group).  [CONTACT_606149] , who will be blinded to treatment group assignment, will be responsible for outcome data collection.   
 
Intervention  
     As previously stated, t he primary  purpose of (MI-trained) nurse contact [CONTACT_606135]’ 
motivation  to engage in the web-based CBT program, rather than providing psychological treatment . Subjects randomized 
to the trained MI phone contact [CONTACT_606141] 6 phone calls from the MI -trained  nurse  at week 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and week 
8. Subjects randomized to control group will automatically receive six computer -generated email to encourage to 
complete 1 lesson every week .  
     Importantly, the MI-trained nurses will use MI  technique to encourage  completion of all the required learning modules  
and to continuously practice newly learned pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] . MI is an effective  counseling approach  to elicit behavior 
change ( e.g., medication adherence , increase physical activity, reduction in  caloric intake  for weight loss , etc.) and 
promote healthy lifestyle  29-33. In contrast  to delivering simple advice, an MI -trained nurse helps a patient discuss the pros 
and cons, and the barriers and solutions to completing all the web-based learning modules; consequently,  enhancing self -
efficacy. Self -efficacy determines  whether an individ ual attempts a given task, the degree of persistence when difficulty is 
encountered and ultimate success or failure of the behavior.  [CONTACT_606144],  a member of the Motivational 
Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT) , will provide the in itial and o ngoing training of the nurses , including 
assessment of treatment fidelity. To assess treatment fidel ity, all nurse phone sessions will be audiorecorded for quality 
control.   
  
Outcome  Measure s. We will collect outcome measures at baseline, week 8, week 16 (primary endpoint).  The study visits 
at baseline, week 8, and week 16 will require an in person  visit. 
 
Primary outcome : PROMIS pain intensity and PROMIs pain interference  
 
Secondary outcome : Number of completed phone calls by [CONTACT_46566]; and number of comp leted learning modules per 
treatment arm  
 
Exploratory:

b. Non-study (pain -relevant)  related phone calls  
c. New referrals to other musculoskeletal -related specialties  
d. Number of emergency room visits related to pain  
 
V. Clinical  measures   
a. PROMIS Adult Self -reported Measures on physical health (fatigue, physical function, sleep disturbance, pain 
behavior and sleep -related impairment) and social health (ability to participate in social roles and activities); 
BPI-pain severity  and BPI-pain int erference  34,35; Pain C atastrophizing Scale (PCS) 36,37; Global Rating of 
Change 38 39; Patient Health Questionnaire 8 -Item Depression Scale (PHQ -8) 40-43; and Generalized Anxiety 
Disorder 7 -item scale (GAD -7) 44,45.  
 
Relevance to Wake Baptist Health Care System   
     We surveyed 86 patients with CMP (48% females; mean ag e= 51 years old) at Downtown Health Plaza (DHP). We 
found that 58  (67%) patients continue to have a significant amount of pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_156788] , and also reported 
that pain prevented them from working or doing the things they enjoy almost every day. From these 58 patients, 50 (86%) 
have expressed willingness to participate in clinical studies to help reduce their pain and improve their quality of life . 
     In both traditional and in new technology -based mode of delivery, psychological treatment options for chronic pain are 
cost-effective  46-48. In a rec ent meta -analysis, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_606129]  (consultations and resource use)  49. During an [ADDRESS_802997] may also develop its own web -
based CBT that can be commercialize  in the future .

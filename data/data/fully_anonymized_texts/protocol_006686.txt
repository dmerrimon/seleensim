STUDY DESIGN  
- Study Subjects:  A total of 88 individuals (age 45 -74 years ) with stage IIIb and IV CKD will be recruited. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1 and discussed in the Protection of Human Subjects  
section. Estimated GFR will be calculated based on the 4-  variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
(MDRD) formula 1. After obtaining informed consent, individuals with estimated GFR 15- 45 mL/min/1.73m2 who 
fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in the study. We chose an estimated GFR cut -off of 
<45 mL/min/1.73m2 (stage IIIB) for the inclusion in the study  based on data by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tamura that indicate the 
prevalence of cognitive impairment is significantly increased when estimated GFR is <50 mL/min/1.73m2 2. All 
subjects will be required to have adequately controlled blood pressure  (BP), as our hypothesis is that curcumin 
reduces vascular dysfunction by [CONTACT_301735] -traditional risk factors for CVD. Adequately controlled BP will be 
defined as BP  <140/90 mmHg in accordance with the current Joint National Committee guidelines 3. However, 
if the guidelines change for older adults without DM (based on the recent evidence from Systolic Blood 
Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)  4), then we would require a s ystolic BP <120 mmHg for those patients .  
  Table 1:  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
Inclusion Criteria  Exclusion Criteria  
Age [ADDRESS_368571] 12 months  
CKD stage IIIb and IV  
(estimated GFR: 15 -45 mL/min/1.73m2)  Life expectancy <1  year 
BMI < 35 kg/m2 [ADDRESS_368572] year  
We will also screen for the use of supplements that may improve vascular function including vitamins C and E 6 
and resveratrol 7. Subjects who are taking these supplements but otherwise qualify for the study will be asked 
to undergo a 6- week wash -out period prior to participating in the study.  
- Experimental Design:  88 subjects, recruited at t he University of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84059] (UIHC)  and The 
Iowa City VA Medical Center,  will be randomized to receive either placebo or curcumin (2000 mg/  day) for 12 
months  and stratified randomization will be employed based on age  ≥ 55 yeas 8-10 and baseline DM  status  11. 
Block  randomization is an alternative for consideration.  Study outcomes  will be evaluated at baseline, 6 
months, and 12  months ( except cognitive function will be evaluated at baseline and 12 months only ).  
- Curcumin supplementation: B ased on our preliminary data we will use a solid lipid curcumin particle 
(SLCP, Longvida, Verdure Sciences)  at a dose of 2000 mg/d.  Based on our preliminary data, we believe this 
will be an effective dose to improve vascular function in patients with CKD. Longvida will provide the 
supplement in addition to identical -looking placebo. The randomization table will be generated by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. You and 
provided to Longvida. Once a subject is randomized, Longvida will package and ship the study drug (curcumin or placebo). The package will only state “study drug” in order to guarantee blinding of all the study staff and 
participants.  As we show in the Preliminary Data  and Protection of Human Subjects  sections , curcumin was 
well-tolerated with a small number of adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal discomfort).  
- Rational for the duration of the study:  In specific aim 2, we intend to evaluate whether curcumin improves 
cognitive function in patients with CKD. Although our preliminary data suggests that curcumin may improve cognition in as little as 12 weeks, we believe a  longer duration is  necessary to minimize  practice effects from 
repeated cognitive testing 
12,13. Thus , the study duration will be 12 months . In addition, this longer duration will 
Figure A : Study Design  
 enhance our ability to detect a benefit on vascular stiffness  (specific aim 1) . Large elastic artery stiffness 
reflect s structural  changes of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall 14. Based on this, the longer duration of 
study will allow the treatment to reverse these structural changes in the vasculature. The vascular 
measurements will be conducted at  baseline, 6 months , and 12 months.  In order to reduce practice effects, 
cognitive function will be measured at baseline and 12 months only.   
- Recruitment Clinics:  The trial will be conducted through CRU of the ICTS at UIHC.  Patients will be 
recruited from 2 clinics with access to >1500 CKD patients from all over the Iowa State area including:  
1) UIHC Renal Clinic: The renal clinics at UIHC see approximately [ADDRESS_368573] 2500 patient visits are related to stage III/IV CKD. This is a similarly -sized practice to the prior proposal.  
2) Iowa City VA Medical Center: The VA renal clinics see approximately [ADDRESS_368574]. Jalal has been successful in recruiting patients with CKD to clinical trials, including single 
center, completing recruitment prior to end of funding period on corresponding grant applications. Additionally, 
UIHC has been a successful site of recruitment for clinical researchers at the University of Iowa (for example 
Bradley Dixon).

OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS  
- BA-FMD (primary outcome):  BA-FMD will be  measured at the CRU at  UIHC by a trained research assistant 
using high- resolution ultrasonography ( GE Healthcare, Inc. ) as described originally by [CONTACT_184530]. 16 and 
by [CONTACT_27156] 17-20. Electrocardiogram (ECG) gated end- diastolic ultrasound images and D oppler flow of the 
brachial artery are acquired during baseline and FMD conditions.  For FMD, reactive hyperemia is produced by 
[CONTACT_57094] a pediatric forearm cuff around the forearm to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes followed by [CONTACT_184531].  
Endothelial independent dilation (EID) is determined by [CONTACT_184532] 10 minutes after 
administration of sublingual nitroglycerin (0.4 mg). A commercially available software package (Vascular 
Analysis Tools 5.5 , Medical Imaging Applications, LLC, Coralville, IA) is used to acquire and analyze ECG -
gated brachial artery diameters.  The analysis of the images will take place at [CONTACT_301744] s’s lab in Boulder.  
Brachial artery dilation is determined as mm and % change from baseline 21. Doppler blood flow velocity is 
recorded at baseline and for [ADDRESS_368576], BA- FMD is adjusted accordingly.   We propose to use BA -FMD  as opposed to ACh -
FBF since BA -FMD is less invasive and considering that BA -FMD has been utilized extensively in patients with 
CKD 19,22- 24.  
- aPWV:  Large elastic artery stiffness will be determined by a PWV as previously described 19,25- 27 , utilizing the 
Non-Invasive Hemodynamic Workstation (NIHem, Cardiovascular Engineering, Norwood, MA).  The subject is 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a quiet, dim, climate -controlled room. Blood pressure readings are obtained after [ADDRESS_368577]. A 
custom trans -cutaneous tonometer is placed at the carotid and femoral arteries to non- invasively assess 
aPWV. The distance from the supra- sternal notch to the carotid is subtracted from the distance between the 
two recording sites. a PWV = distance divided by [CONTACT_301737].  
Similar to BA -FMD, the aPWV images will be analyzed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Seal s’s group.  
- Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) infusion : The influence of  oxidative stress on BA- FMD and aPWV  will be 
determined by [CONTACT_184537] a supraphysiological dose of ascorbic acid (American Regent Laboratories Inc.) or 
isovolumic saline. A priming bolus of 0.06 g ascorbic acid/kg fat free  mass (FFM) dissolved in 100 mL of saline 
will be infused intravenously at 5 mL/min for 20 minutes,  followed immediately by a “drip- infusion” of 0.02 g/kg 
FFM dissolved in 30 mL of saline administered over 60  minutes at 0.5 mL/min. Vascular measurements will be 
made at the end of the 20- minute bolus during the “drip infusion” when peak plasma concentrations of ascorbic 
acid occur. The difference in BA- FMD and aPWV  during ascorbic acid vs . saline infusion will be taken as a 
measure of the  modulation of EDD/stiffness by [CONTACT_174026]. This technique has been developed and well 
established by [CONTACT_301738]  28-31, which included [CONTACT_301745][INVESTIGATOR_835].  [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_301731], where several protocols that utilize vitamin C infusion are 
ongoing.  In addition, [CONTACT_184561] , who has successfully performed and reported this technique in several  
clinical trials  20, will remain a co -investigator for the application.   
- Systemic markers of inflammation and oxidative stress: High sensitivity CRP, IL -6, and MCP -1 will be 
measured as markers of inflammation. OxLDL will be measured as a marker of systemic oxidative stress.  
These markers will be measured on the serum or plasma by [CONTACT_301739].  
- Endothelial cell sampling and cell protein expression:  This technique performed and described by [CONTACT_301740]  20,30,32- [ADDRESS_368578]. Jalal (PI). Briefly, J -wires are advanced into a brachial artery and/or 
an antecubital vein and withdrawn, and cells are recovered by [CONTACT_215466]. Collected cells are 
fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and plated on slides. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with 5% donkey 
serum (Jackson Immunoresearch), cells are incubated with the primary antibody. Then, cells are incubated 
with CY3 -conjugated secondary antibodies (Research Diagnostics). Slides are systematically scanned to 
identify endothelial cells (positive VE -Cadherin), and nuclear integrity is confirmed using 4',6' -diamidino -2-
phenylindole hydrochloride staining. Once endothelial cells with intact nuclei are identified, images are captured 
and then analyzed using Metamorph Software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA) to quantify the intensity 
of CY3 staining (i.e., average pi[INVESTIGATOR_215431]). Values for each sample are reported as ratios of endothelial cell 
protein expression/human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) to account for any variation in the staining 
procedure. Technicians are blinded to subject identity during the staining and analysis procedures. The 
following proteins will be evaluated: eNOS (BD Biosciences) and eNOS phosphorylated at Ser 1177 (BD 
Biosciences)  as an indicator of eNOS activity 20,35, NF-κB (Santa Cruz) as a marker of pro -inflammatory 
signaling 32,36, and NAD(P)H oxidase (Upstate) 30,33,34 and nitrotyrosine (Abcam) 30,33,34 as markers of oxidative 
stress.  
- Cognitive function assessment: The NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral 
Function was initiated by [CONTACT_301741]- of-the-art 
measurement tools to for the  collection of cognitive data in large cohort studies  37. The NIH Cognitive Toolbox 
is a validated multidimensional  assessment of cognitive function domains , with minimal floor and ceiling 
effects,  that enables us to evaluate (consistently) cognitive changes in response to our intervention  13. The 
cognitive battery of the NIH Toolbox will be administered to our patients by a trained research assistant 
(blinded to subject randomization)  at the CRU UIHC in a quiet and private exam room  over approximately [ADDRESS_368579], subdomain, and tasks that will be applied:

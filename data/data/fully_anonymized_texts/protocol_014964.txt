1.1 Background Information and Relevant Literature  
About 14% of Americans have Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and it is the third leading 
cause of death in both the U.S.A. and the world.1,2 The prevalence and burden of COPD on patients, their 
families, and society is high and will only contin ue to grow with the aging of the population.3-6 COPD is 
characterized by [CONTACT_248693],7,8 increased dyspnea, chronic inflammation, 
and increased sympathetic nerve activity9. Dyspnea (labored, uncomfortable breathing10) is th e most 
prevalent, emotionally distressing, and disabling symptom of COPD; it limits physical activity, exercise 
tolerance, and quality of life and is associated with increased mortality.11-[ADDRESS_302327] sensations, such a s “air hunger“, increased “urge to breathe“, “chest tightness“, and feeling “starved 
for air“.14 It is the main reason why patients with COPD seek medical and rehabilitation services. The insula, 
a sensorimotor area of the limbic system in the brain,  acti vated during inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], plays an integral role in 
dyspnea perception by [CONTACT_248694].14-16 The high prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders 
(up to approximately 40%) and panic disorder (up to 10 times higher than in the general population) in 
COPD17,18,19 increases the severity of dyspnea and related disability,20-22 and increases the risk for acute 
COPD exacerbations (ACOPDE) and associated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248648]23. 
In COPD, dyspnea is associated with a vicious cycle of physical activity (PA) decli ne and 
deconditioning, leading to increased ventilatory requirements of PA, further impairement of physical function 
and quality of life (QOL), and social isolation; 24,[ADDRESS_302328] of abnormally rapid breathing (tachypnea), air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and lung 
hyperinflation both at rest and with physical exertion (dynamic hyperinflation), leading to further dyspnea 
and PA limitations and impaired QOL (see Appendix A for the COPD mo del underlying this study).[ADDRESS_302329] 
important muscle of breathing; causing it to shorten, lower, and flatten (inspi[INVESTIGATOR_248649]) and become 
hypertonic;  limiting its functions such as venous and lymphatic return and optimal posture. 27,28  
A rapid, upper thoracic breathing pattern allows insufficient time to empty the lungs;24,29,[ADDRESS_302330] secretions and bronchoconstriction8 and cause the loss of elastic recoil.24 
Rapid breathing due to exercise intolerance and emotional stress can lead to neuromechanical uncoupling 
(failure of  the ventilatory pump and CO 2 retention)29,31 and associated panic, fear, and emergency medical 
care.29  
Altered breathing behavior also leads to neuroplasticity and a profound network disorganization 
between the sensorimotor cortex and brainstem in COPD.15 Sensory neural coding of breathing patterns 
(muscle mechanics, CO2, pressure, volume, and airflow) are gated into the cerebral cortex for conscious 
cognitive and emotional processing based on individual threshold levels.32  
Benefits of Breathing Training  
Slow breathing training is an important rehabilitation and self -management intervention to 
systematically alleviate dyspnea, prevent or manage dyspnea crisis33, manage anxiety and panic in 
COPD,34-36 and improve sympathovaga l imbalance9. Breathing techniques designed to mitigate the 
ventilatory consequences of COPD include pursed lips breathing (PLB), pranayama yoga breathing, 
diaphragmatic breathing (DB), Buteyko breathing technique,37-39 mindful breathing40-42, and device -guided 
breathing with biofeedback. Given that respi[INVESTIGATOR_248650], patients can learn to control their respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) to help manage their symptoms.8,9,39,[ADDRESS_302331] studies of breathing  exercises were reduced by [CONTACT_248695].44  
Study Importance and Innovation  
The rationale supporting the importance and innovation of this trial study is that: (1) it uses a novel 
therapeutic approach; both a novel capnometer computer syst em and a newly developed smartphone 
breathing app (new to both pulmonary rehabilitation and COPD) to promote improved learning and 
adherence to home breathing exercises; (2) it includes anxiety and physiological outcomes omitted from

as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_248690]: [ADDRESS_302332] previous COPD cli nical trials of breathing training to help explain the mechanisms of treatment effects; 
(3) it includes allocation concealment and assessor blinding of exercise stress testing to address limitations 
of previous studies; and (4) it includes an expanded theo retical base of breathing training effects to 
potentially improve dyspnea management outcomes. This breathing study is important because it measures 
physiological, performance -based, and patient -reported outcomes (including anxiety) to more 
comprehensively  study the benefits of breathing training in COPD.  
The proposed study translates new theory from basic science and brain imaging studies to promote 
improved dyspnea management for COPD. The novel breathing training protocol is designed to both 
modulate per ception of dyspnea at the CNS level as well as improve neuromechanical coupling (matching 
between respi[INVESTIGATOR_248651]). Breathing training is 
theorized to improve neural connections, that is, decrease ac tivity of the amydala in the limbic system and 
improve prefrontal cortical regulation, as well as decrease arousal of the sympathetic nervous  
system. 15,32,41,48,[ADDRESS_302333] focused inadequate 
attention on respi[INVESTIGATOR_248652].50 This timely study is needed to advance our knowledge of th e effects of 
breathing training with respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR) and end -tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) – CO [ADDRESS_302334] studies were preliminary. One pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265]54 showed that patients with COPD in an 8 -
week mindfulness group (who attended ≥ 6 sessions) had improved emotional function following 
mindfulness exercises compared to a wait -list control. Another pi[INVESTIGATOR_248653] 8 -week mindfulness -based stress reduction (MBSR) program for COPD.[ADDRESS_302335] found low acceptability based on retention rates and no differences in dyspnea, functional status, or 
quality of life outcomes between a mindfulness -based breathing therapy group and a support group of 
veterans with moderate to severe  COPD (n = 86).57 
Capnometry -assisted respi[INVESTIGATOR_248654] (CART) is a new, innovative approach for COPD. This is 
the first study to investigate the therapeutic potential of CART for adults with COPD in pulmonary 
rehabilitation.  While CART improves asthma  and panic disorder (PD) (both common comorbidities of 
COPD), its efficacy has not yet been investigated in adults with COPD. CART (with both RR and ETCO 2 
biofeedback), increased ETCO 2, reduced respi[INVESTIGATOR_248655], decreased distress, and improved asthma  
symptoms at follow -up in adults with asthma compared to a comparison group of slow breathing training 
with RR feedback alone (n = 120).[ADDRESS_302336] control 
group (n = 37).58  
1.2 Rationale  
Hypotheses  
1. Participants’ change scores in the CATCH group will be significantly greater compared with 
those of the control group for the primary outcomes of peak HR, exer cise duration, 6MWD, 
DMQ -CAT dyspnea, SGRQ quality of life, and exercise adherence (> % of sessions or < time 
to complete).  
2. Ve will decrease (indicating decreased RR and improved breathing efficiency) and peak VO 2 
will increase in the CATCH group (indicati ng improved pulmonary function) and changes will 
be significantly greater compared with the control group.  
3. Participants’ change scores in the CATCH group will be significantly greater compared with 
the control group for the secondary outcomes of RR, ETCO 2, Borg RPE, anxiety, 
CRQMastery, SEBQ, PROMIS -36, and Physical Activity.

mechanics, resulting in less dyspnea, improved exercise capacity and tolerance, eucapnia (optimal carbon 
dioxide pressure), and the prevention of neuromechanical uncoupling.8,59,24,29 In a meta -analysis of four 
studies of mostly severe COPD, slow breathing exercises (PLB, DB, and 3 -months of yoga) improved 
6MWD by 35 - 50 meters, which was beyond the minimal important difference47.44 
 Device -guided slow breathing training when combined with PR using a pneumotachometer 
interfaced with a compute r display of respi[INVESTIGATOR_248656] (increased expi[INVESTIGATOR_21265]) in COPD compared with both PR -alone and 
breathing -training -alone groups.43 Device -guided breathing instruction in COPD also  improved self -efficacy 
(breathing confidence) compared with a traditional method of teaching pursed lips breathing (PLB).60  
PLB training (quiet breathing in through the nose and out through pursed lips with expi[INVESTIGATOR_248657]) decrea sed respi[INVESTIGATOR_248658],61,62 alleviated long -term dyspnea 
compared with control groups46, and improved oxygen saturation62. By [CONTACT_248696][INVESTIGATOR_1516], PLB reduced 
dynamic hyperinflation during daily activities and submaximal exercise in som e patients with COPD.62,63 
Similarly, Visser64, found that PLB decreased hyperinflation and oxygen saturation, and decreased ETCO 2, 
and RR in patients with severe COPD. PLB has been endorsed in evidence -based practice guidelines to 
relieve dyspnea in advan ced COPD.11,65 A systematic review of PLB for stable COPD found that PLB (1) 
reduced RR and increased tidal volume both at rest and during sub -maximal exercise, and (2) improved 
oxygen saturation.[ADDRESS_302338] the effectiveness of exercise training or 
behavioral therapy, however more research is needed.40,67,68 A randomized study found that health coaching 
(consi sting of daily slow breathing exercises, physical exercises, and an emergency plan combined with 
motivational interviewing) reduced short -term rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_248659] -related quality of life 
in adults with COPD compared with usual care.69 
Slow, controlled breathing exercises (with prolonged expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) reduce anxiety and sympathetic 
nerve activity. For example, slow breathing (6 breaths per minute; 3s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_23735] 7s exhalation) reduced 
sympathetic nerve activity compared with 15 breaths  per minute and spontaneous breathing and improved 
baroreflex sensitivity in patients with COPD.9 Similarly, Buteyko -device -guided breathing training using 
capnometry reduced panic symptoms, panic -related cognitions, and perceived control, and increased PC O2 
to normocapnic levels in adults with panic disorder and agoraphobia.70  
1.3 Potential Risks & Benefits  
1.3.1  Known Potential Risks  
The immediate and long -term risks of participation in the study are minimal. Respondents may 
become emotionally upset by [CONTACT_248697] a person's 
shortness of breath and related anxiety with activity performance. There is also a small risk that the 
breathing evaluation and capnometry feedback may initially trigger some shortness of breath, disco mfort, 
or nervousness. In our previous research with the DMQ -CAT, no respondent has ever expressed 
emotional concern or upset about the questions that have been asked. Our research team has been 
trained in the methods to protect confidentiality and the imp ortance of this protection. The study 
intervention and outcome evaluations are non -invasive.  
The value of the information to be gained outweigh the minimal risks to subjects. Participants in 
the CATCH intervention group may benefit from biofeedback by [CONTACT_248698]. Mindfulness breathing exercises may help subjects to 
better manage their dyspnea and anxiety and improve their functional status and quality of life.

Evidence for Breathing Training.   
Slow breathing training is a self -management, behavioral intervention to systematically alleviate 
dyspnea, prevent or manage dyspnea crisis33, manage anxiety and panic in COPD,34-36 and improve 
sympathovagal imbalanc e9. Given that respi[INVESTIGATOR_248650], patients can learn to control their RR to help manage their symptoms.8,9,39,43 In a systematic review 
of sixteen breathing studies of breathing exercises of four to 15  weeks for COPD, the breathing exercises 
were found to improve exercise capacity compared to no intervention.44 
PLB training (quiet breathing in through the nose and out through pursed lips with expi[INVESTIGATOR_248657]) decreased respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y rate in adults with COPD,61,62 alleviated long -term dyspnea 
compared with control groups46, and improved oxygen saturation.62 PLB has been endorsed in 
evidencebased practice guidelines to relieve dyspnea in advanced COPD.11,65  
Slow, controlled breathing  exercises (with prolonged expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) reduced anxiety and sympathetic 
nerve activity. In particular, slow breathing (6 breaths per minute; 3s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_23735] 7s exhalation) reduced 
sympathetic nerve activity compared with 15 breaths per minute and spontan eous breathing, and improved 
baroreflex sensitivity in patients with COPD.9 Similarly, Buteyko -device -guided breathing training using 
capnometry reduced panic symptoms and panic -related cognitions, improved perceived control, and 
increased PCO 2 to normocap nic levels in adults with panic disorder and agoraphobia.70  
Device -guided breathing instruction in COPD improved self -efficacy (breathing confidence) 
compared with a traditional method of teaching PLB.60  Capnometry -assisted respi[INVESTIGATOR_135733] (CART), 
with both RR and ETCO 2 biofeedback, increased ETCO 2, reduced respi[INVESTIGATOR_248655], decreased 
distress, and improved asthma symptoms at follow -up in adults with asthma compared to a comparison 
group of slow  breathing training with RR feedback alone (n = 120).[ADDRESS_302339] control group (n = 37).58  
Evidence for  Mindful -Based Therapy.  
In a neuroimaging study, mindful attention to breath was shown to down -regulate amygdala 
activation (associated with fear processing) and improve amygdala -prefrontal integration in the brain as the 
mechanisms for emotion regulation.[ADDRESS_302340] size 
(Hedge’s g = 0.89; 95% CI 71 to 1.08) for MBT post -intervention on anxiety compared to a waitlist control; 
the largest effect size was found for improving anxiety compared to other phys ical or medical conditions; 
MBT did not differ from pharmacological treatments.[ADDRESS_302341] on improving anxiety (ES = 0.38, CI 0.12 to 0.64) compared to attention -control conditions.72 
Interestingly , for patients diagnosed with anxiety (aged 18 – 65), a third meta -analysis found MBT to have 
large effect sizes (Hedge’s g = 0.97 and 0.95) for improving anxiety and mood symptoms respectively; with 
effects maintained at follow -up.[ADDRESS_302342] good acceptability and retention rates 
(84%) in an RCT (n = 47) for adults with COPD.54 A significant improvement was found in the mindfulness 
group for emotional function (for those who attended ≥ 6 classes) compared with a wait -list control. Further, 
a 12-week yoga intervention for older adults with COPD (n = 29) was found to be safe, enjo yable, and 
feasible and to improve dyspnea -related distress, functional performance, and walk distance compared to 
a usual care control group.74 In summary, little is known about the benefit and effects of mindful breathing 
exercises for COPD management si nce mindfulness as a therapeutic approach is novel to rehabilitation 
and self -management.41,53 -56  
2 Objectives and Purpose  
2.1 Primary Objectives  
Objective 1 : Test the feasibility of implementing an RCT of capnometry -assisted training in COPD to slow 
the breath  (CATCH) intervention combined with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) based on retention of 
participants with COPD and estimates of short -term treatment effects (at 10 weeks).  
Objective 2 : Evaluate the acceptability of the CATCH intervention as perceived by [CONTACT_248699], CATCH attendance, and adherence to home breathing exercises.

2.2 Secondary Objectives  
1a. Compare a CATCH intervention group (CATCH + PR, n = 15 ) with a control group (PR alone, 
n = 7) on the outcomes  of exercise capacity [peak heart rate (HR), exercise duration, ventilation (Ve), and 
peak oxygen consumption (VO 2)]; DMQ -CAT dyspnea; [ADDRESS_302343] distance (6MWD); COPDspecific 
quality of life (St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015]); and exercise adherence.  
1b. Compare score differences of a 6 -week CATCH intervention combined with PR (CATCH +  
PR, n = 15) with those of a control group (PR alone, n = 7) on the outcomes of ETCO 2, RR, Borg Rate of  
Perceived Exertion (RPE), anxiety, CRQ Mastery, SEBQ, physical activity (PA), and PROMIS -36 quality 
of life (physical function, anxiety, depression, satisfaction with participation in social roles, sleep 
disturbance, and fatigue); N = 22.  
[ADDRESS_302344] study design to compare primary and secondary outcomes of the 
CATCH group (n = 15) with a control group (n = 7). This study uses a RCT design to control for confounders, 
to minimize imba lances in characteristics between the groups at baseline, and to demonstrate feasibility of 
carrying out a RCT research protocol in preparation for a larger study.75,[ADDRESS_302345] -treatment will be blinded to the treatment group 
assignment. We will also use a qualitative (descriptive, exploratory) study design to evaluate patient 
acceptability of CATCH and analyz e themes of 15 semi -structured interviews.  
3.2 Study Endpoints  
3.2.1  Primary Study Endpoints  
The primary endpoints are feasibility (retention of participants with COPD)  and acceptability 
(qualitative data, CATCH attendance rate, and % adherence to home breathing exe rcises) of the CATCH 
intervention.  
3.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are  estimates of short -term treatment effects (at 10 weeks), which 
include: exercise capacity; DMQ -CAT dyspnea; 6MWD; SGRQ quality of life; exercise adherence; 
ETCO 2; RR;  Borg Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE); anxiety; CRQ Mastery; SEBQ dysfunctional 
breathing symptoms, moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA); and PROMIS -36 quality of life

4.3 Vulnerable Subjects  
Vulnerable subjects will not be recruited in this study.  
4.4 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Active recruitment efforts to ensure the inclusion of appropriate numbers of patients from each sex, racial, 
and ethnic group will include: 1) a paper recrui tment flyer distributed to potential subjects by [CONTACT_248700]; 2) recruitment after pulmonary rehabilitation consultation by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Whiteson; and 
3) use of an automated EHR alert system.  
To increase retention of subjects, the res earch assistant will send visit reminders via the subject’s 
preferred method of contact (phone, text, or email) [ADDRESS_302347] ete the entire study. 
If retention rates drop below acceptable levels, the study team will engage CTSI Recruitment and  
Retention Unit (CTSI RRU) for consultation on engagement strategies and methods to improve retention.  
4.4.1  Use of DataCore/Epic Information f or Recruitment Purposes  
This study will utilize EPIC to alert the study team of potentially eligible subjects. We will use an EHR report 
system. The pulmonary rehabilitation intake evaluation schedule in EPIC will also be used to alert the study 
team of po tential participants.  
Any recruitment information sent by [CONTACT_248701].  
Once potential subjects have been identified, the study team will notify the treating physician (TP) that 
they have patients eligible to participate as follow:  
 TP has been notified that the study team will contact [CONTACT_93578], by [CONTACT_31711], phone, 
and/or email.  
Once contact [CONTACT_58661], approved recruitment language using a script will be used to communicate the 
reason they are being contact[CONTACT_248702]. Should the potential subjects agree, the study team will provide the subjects with 
information regarding the next steps for participation.  
If a subject requests information  regarding opting out of further recruitment for all research, subjects will 
be directed to contact [CONTACT_79161] -contact -[EMAIL_2365] or 1 -[PHONE_2698].

The duration of study participation is approximately 10 - 12 weeks including: 1 – [ADDRESS_302348]. An investigator 
may terminate participation in the study if:  
• Any clinical adverse event (AE) or other medical condition or situation  occurs such that continued 
participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Partic ipant requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248660] 2 weeks following an exacerbation.  
5 Behavioral/Social Intervention  
5.1 Study Behavioral or Social Intervention(s) Description  
Capnometry -Assisted Training for COP D to Slow the Breath (CATCH) Intervention.  
The CATCH intervention was developed to promote a slower, more regular, efficient breathing 
pattern and optimum breathing amplitude and mechanics, including improved respi[INVESTIGATOR_13945] 
(especially of the  diaphragm), reduced dyspnea, improved autonomic nervous system regulation, and 
neural modulation (creating new neural connections).15,28,78 A portable capnometer (CapnoTrainer, Better 
Physiology, Cheyenne, WY) will be used in -session to provide continuous  visual feedback of RR, ETCO 2, 
rhythm, and depth of breathing, and ratio of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_248661]. The CapnoTrainer is not FDA 
approved. We will be using the CapnoTrainer device under a non -significant risk device determination. Hard 
copy print outs from each capnometry session will be made and reviewed with patients to discuss progress.  
The tailored CATCH intervention will emphasize a slow, quiet, regular, nasal breathing pattern, as 
well as PLB in faciliatory supi[INVESTIGATOR_248662].79 Patients will be educated to regulate the 
volume of their breathing, use a ratio of 40% inhalation to 60% exhalation (with breath pauses), and 
approximately 10 – [ADDRESS_302349] and mouth breathing will be discouraged (because they contribute to dyspnea and can 
trigger bronchoconstriction and airway hyperreactivity), as will breath sounds (such as sighing), deep and 
rapid breathing (hyperpnea), paradoxical breathing (dr awing in of the abdomen during inspi[INVESTIGATOR_248663]), and forceful, irregular breathing.82-84 Patients will also be directed to breathe 
mindfully (“paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, nonjudgmentally”85, p.91).41,48,5 6 CATCH will 
be once weekly for 6 weeks, for a total of 6 sessions; each session will be approximately 60 minutes 
duration. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_248664].  
Some breathing exercises during CATCH sessions will be audio or video recorded or photographed 
to provide participants with additional instructions to use at home to help them complete guided home 
breathing exercises. For the at -home training, patients will also use the Address Stress app on a 
smartphone or computer ta blet for tailored paced breathing exercises. The breathing app will provide 
auditory and visual cues for the paced exercises. Patients will also keep a breathing exercise log of total

as part of their home exercises.86 The Address Stress app  collects email address for downloading the app 
on a personal smartphone or tablet computer. The app transmits adherence data only via email to the study 
PI. It is not necessary for participants to own a smartphone or tablet computer to use the app since tablet 
computers will be loaned to participants as needed to access the app.  
CATCH will be grounded in social cognitive theory87 to promote behavior change, impro ve 
selfefficacy and outcome expectation, and support the use of interactive technologies to guide and motivate 
patients. CATCH also applies the hyperventilation model, in which hyperventilation leads to hypocapnia, 
dyspnea, and panic.88 Other underlying th eoretical models are the neurophysiological model of dyspnea,31 
the model of mindfulness48, and the neurophysiological theory of functional connectivity in COPD.15 
Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR).  
Patients in both treatment groups will participate in a 10 -week (16 - 20 sessions) comprehensive 
PR program. As per standard of care, the control group will receive the 10 -week PR program with traditional 
breathing training instruction only (without biofeedback). The PR program comprises two or three exercise 
traini ng sessions per week implemented by [CONTACT_149440][INVESTIGATOR_11437] (each of 1 -hour duration). PR sessions 
include individualized self -management education.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_302350] for CATCH ( [CONTACT_248711], PI) is a trained pulmonary rehabilitation professional 
(an occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]). An intervention manual for CATCH will be developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_248665]. The interventionist will have received at least [ADDRESS_302351] taken the basic Mindfulness -Based 
Stress Reduction (MBSR) course and adopted a personal mindfulness practice for at least [ADDRESS_302352]’s fidelity to the intervention manual will be monitored via regular consultation 
phone calls with two experienced practitioners in CART and mindfulness respectively.  
Supervision of CATCH interventionist to ensure fidelity of motivational i nterviewing (MI) / brief action 
planning: Some discussions of CATCH sessions will be audio recorded and transcribed. De -identified typed 
transcripts of CATCH intervention discussions will be reviewed by [CONTACT_248703] e nsure fidelity of intervention and to provide interventionist with supervision.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_302353] Compliance with Study Intervention  
Pulmonary rehabilitation session attendance documented in the EMR will be used to evaluate PR 
adherence. Adherence to b reathing exercises for participants in the CATCH intervention will be evaluated 
using a paper breathing log. Adherence data will also be available from the AddresStress app.

Outcome Measures.  
Exercise Capacity : Clinical treadmill stress tests will be used to measure exercise capacity pre - 
and post-treatment, including: peak VO 2 (ml/kg/min and % predicted based on age), Ve (l/min) at isotime 
(2-minutes prior to exercise termination at baseline), peak HR, and exercise duration. Exercise stress tests 
will be administered by a clinician as part of standard care.  
Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT).  The 6MWT is a standardized, performance -based test to measure 
exercise tolerance (functional status) using the American Thoracic Society’s standardized protocol.[ADDRESS_302354] (DMQ -CAT)90. The DMQ -CAT 
is a COPD -specific functional status measure that captures four dyspnea domains: intensity, anxiety, activity 
avoidance, and self -efficacy. Higher scores are b etter. It has been shown to be reliable and valid in 
rehabilitation and primary care patients.91,[ADDRESS_302355]. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] (SGRQ).93,94  The S GRQ is a widely used quality of life 
measure for adults with chronic airflow limitation, consisting of three domains: symptoms, activity, and 
impacts. Lower scores indicate better quality of life. The SGRQ activity domain measures dyspnea and its 
functiona l impact. The symptoms and impacts domains measure several respi[INVESTIGATOR_248666]. Several studies have supported its reliability and validity.93,95,96 We 
will use the American version for this study.94 
Adherence to Exercise Training . Exercise adherence is the % of exercise training sessions 
completed and the time taken (in weeks) to complete the PR program. Adherence to daily home breathing 
exercises is the % completed (at least 5 minutes per day for 6 w eeks; the goal is 70% adherence).

Self-Evaluation of Breathing Questionnaire (SEBQ) .103 The SEBQ is a 12 -item measure of 
dysfunctional breathing symptoms with two domains: i) lack of air (sensations of air hunger); and ii) 
perception of inappropriate or restricted breathing (related to work of breathing and biomechanics of 
breathing).  
Patien t-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS -36).104,105 To

7 Assessment of Safety  
7.1 Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
An internal committee (comprising the PI, Anna Norweg, PhD; Jonathan Whiteson, MD, co -investigator; 
and Francois Haas, PhD, co -investigator) will be responsible for data safety monitoring of the overall 
study. 
Data safety monitoring reviews will be conducted every 6 months. During data safety monitoring reviews, 
adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be reviewed and captured on CRFs. Information 
to be collected will include event descriptio n, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship 
to study intervention (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time 
of resolution/stabilization of the event.  
UPs that are SAEs will be reviewed and  reported to the IRB and study sponsor within 24 hours of the 
investigators becoming aware of the event. Other SAE, whether related or unrelated, will be reviewed and 
submitted to the IRB and study sponsor within 72 hours of site awareness. Adverse events (AE) will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_248704]. AE will be reported to the IRB and study sponsor annually.  
The internal committee will review and record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time 
after informed consent is obtained u ntil 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation. At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since 
the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until res olution or stabilization.  
There are no predefined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_17781].  
As a follow -up to the initial report, within the following 48 hours of awareness of the event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_248667], as applicable, on the unanticipated e vent or the unanticipated problem in the

informatio n on ongoing unanticipated adverse effects shall be provided promptly to the study sponsor.  
7.2 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.2.1  Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_1372]  
7.2.2  Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical si gnificance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of  bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
7.2.3  Definition  of Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (includin g physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).

as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_248690]: 5 MAY 2017  7.3 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.3.1  Severity of Event  
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minima l or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe  – Events  interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
7.3.2  Relationship to Study Intervention  
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's rel ationship to study intervention is part of the documentation 
process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as 
to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. All AEs must have their 
relationship to study intervention assessed. In a clinical trial, the study intervention must always be 
suspect. To help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
• Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a r easonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study interventi on and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been estab lished.  
For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE’s 
causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about 
causality will be graded using the categor ies below.  
• Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to  intervention administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the 
intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible.  
• Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a  causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a 
reasonable time after administration of the intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Possibly Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. , the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial intervention). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related,” as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test r esult, whose 
temporal relationship to intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., 
the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial intervention) and in

as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_248690]: 5 MAY 2017  which other drugs or chemicals or underl ying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
7.[ADDRESS_302362] be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collecti on system 
throughout the study.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration  of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instr uct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The 
investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event o ccurring at any time after a 
subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
7.5 Reporting Procedures – Notifying the IRB  
7.5.1  Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of an UP 
report form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB and to the study sponsor. 
The UP report will include the following information:  
• Protocol identifying information: prot ocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
• A descriptio n of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP.  
7.6 Reporting Procedures – Notifying the Study Sponsor  
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigat or deems the event to be 
chronic or the adherence to be stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by 
[CONTACT_8704].

The sample size of 22  patients, randomized 2:1 to CATCH + PR and PR alone, provides approximately 
80% power to detect a difference between groups of 1.[ADDRESS_302363].  We will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to conduct preliminary  analyses of between -group 
differences in mean change scores for the primary and secondary outcomes (CATCH + PR group versus 
PR alone control group). Age, lung function (FEV 1), and Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) 
dyspnea will be used as covariates . We will use paired t -tests to evaluate within -group intervention 
differences (pre -intervention to post -PR intervention) at 10 weeks. We will estimate the mean change and 
variances for all primary and secondary outcomes. Residual scores will be checked fo r outliers and 
normality. SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) will be used to conduct all quantitative analyses 
with significance set at p < 0.05. In addition, data from interviews will be analyzed using qualitative, thematic 
analysis to generate  initial codes and broader themes.108  
9 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and ev aluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in 
source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_19093], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm 
or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records  kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All  missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is 
left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is 
not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any 
entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry 
and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR 
WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For c larification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the 
item, then initial and date it.  
10 Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be 
run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated for 
clarification/resolution. We will use a plan of evaluation to ensure that we meet our monthly recruitment and 
data collection goals; to assess the quality of our data, adherence to our research and treatment protocols, 
and the rigor of our research; and to prevent delays. A study REDCap database will facilitate efficient data 
collection and entry, minimize data errors and missing data, and ensure data are secur ed. We will develop 
a Data Collection Training Manual that contains information on all data collection procedures. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_248668].

The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant  materials will be 
submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by [CONTACT_248705]. All changes to the consent form 
will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants 
need to be re -consented.  
11.3 Informed Consent Process  
11.3.1  Consent/Assent and Other Informatio nal Documents Provided to Participants  
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention, study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting intervention.  
11.3.2  Consent Pr ocedures and Documentation  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible 
benefits of participation will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will be IRB 
approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain 
the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive 
a verbal explanation in terms suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential 
risks of the study and of their rights as research participants. Participants will have the oppor tunity to 
carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants should have 
the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. 
The participant will sign th e informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically 
for the study. The participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. A copy 
of the signed informed consent document will be given to the participant s for their records. The rights and 
welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_248706].  
A copy of the signed informed consent document will be stored in the subject’s research record. The 
consent process, including the name [CONTACT_21811], will be thoroughly documented in 
the subject’s research record. Any alteration to the standard consent p rocess (e.g. use of a translator, 
consent from a legally authorized representative, consent document presented orally, etc.) and the 
justification for such alteration will likewise be documented.  
11.[ADDRESS_302366] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorizat ion for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For 
subjects that h ave revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain

12.1 Data Collection and  Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site PI. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the 
data reported.  
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, 
cross out the original entry with a s ingle line, and initial and date the change.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_58625] (eCRF) will be provided for use as source documents and maintained for 
recording data for each participant enrolled in the study. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source 
docum ents should be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies should be explained and 
captured in a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record.  
The data system includes password protection and internal qua lity checks, such as automatic range 
checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered 
directly from the source documents.

longer needed. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor.  
13 Study Finances  
13.1 Funding Source  
This study is funded by [CONTACT_248707].  
13.2 Costs to the Participant  
Participants will not incur any costs from participating in the study.  
13.3 Participant Reimbursements or Payments  
Participants will be paid $25 for each study assessment visit they complete (for a total of $50) to compensate 
them for their time and transportat ion cost for the study. Subjects will not be paid for the study treatment 
visits because this would be prohibitive based on the grant funds available.

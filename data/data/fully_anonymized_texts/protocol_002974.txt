  3 2  INTRODUCTION 
 
Study Rationale The purpose of this study  is to determine if hematopoietic  reparative cells are 
defective in individuals  with diabetes. Diabetic  
retinopathy  (DR)  is an eye disease  related to diabetes. It can cause  blurred vision  and 
possible  bleeding from the blood vessels in the back of the eye (retina). Damage to the 
cells of the blood vessels from DR can initiate pathology that then may cause vision loss or 
blindness. Even with current treatments, the quality of life for people with DR is much 
reduced.  
 
Overall, this proposal will address the novel concept that the diabetes -induced decreases in 
DHA, and associated endothelial - speciﬁc  increase in the central  enzyme  in sphingolipi d 
metabolism  ASM,  aﬀects  both retinal  endothelial  cells and bone marrow-derived EPCs. 
Understanding both mechanisms of damage and repair have the potential to lead to 
therapeutic strategies that will address the dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_437828] -induced retinal damage. 
 
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
  
Peripheral  blood (200 cc) is removed from diabetics with and without diabetic retinopathy. 
Blood sampling is done in the AM between 8-10 due to circadian variation in bone marrow cell release.

4.3 SCREEN FAILURES  
N/A 
4.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION 
 
Clinic subjects will be recruited.  
 
4.5 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 There is minimal risk with a single blood draw and only infrequently is pain, bruising or 
infection at the site of the blood draw experienced. Occasionally a patient may feel faint 
during the blood draw and if this is the case, the patient will remain sitting for 
approximately 10 minutes until faint feeling dissipates.   
 
 
5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
5.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  AND ANALYSIS 
 Diabetic individuals with diabetic retinopathy and age and gender matched controls were enrolled and CD34+ cells were isolated, and levels of ASM determined. All analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism v9.1 software. Prior to hypothesis testing, data were assessed for outliers, as indicated by [CONTACT_437830], and outliers excluded from further analyses. Data 
underwent assessment for adherence to a normal (Gaussian) distribution using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-
Wilks Normality test. Data which were found to be normally distributed were analyzed by [CONTACT_437831]’s t-test (categorical predictor with 2 levels). For all statistical analyses, each input measure was indicative of a single, independent sample from one human subject. All data was analyzed at α=0.05.

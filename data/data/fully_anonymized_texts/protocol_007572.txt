Study Title  Horyzons: Implementation in Clinical Practice  
Funder  North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill  
Clinical Phase  Phase I  
Study Rationale  The purpose of the present study is to  investigat e the feasibility 
and acceptability of implementing a moderated online social media platform with therapeutic content, Horyzons, as a part of care received at first -epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743] (FEP) clinics across North 
Carolina.  
Study Objective(s)  Examine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing Horyzons  
at NC FEP clinics through the following objectives:  
1. Assess change in psychological measures across the three -
month (cohort 1) and six -month (cohort 2) study period 
(primary)  
2. Ability to meet our recruitment targets  
3. Evaluation of the safety and privacy protocol  
4. Evaluate f requency and types of engagement on Horyzons  
5. Identify barriers/facilitators to implementing Horyzons  
Test Article(s)  
(If Applicable)  Horyzons  is a private digital platform that includes curated 
therapeutic content surrounding issues such as generalized anxiety, 
social anxiety, social functioning, depression, and distress 
tolerance. The site also includes a social media function, in which 
partic ipants and peer support specialists (P SS) can post text, 
images, and videos. The site is moderated by [CONTACT_291926].  
Study Design  
 This is an open trial enrolling both clients from NC FEP clinics. FEP clients will participate in the experimental arm of the trial (access to Horyzons), and FEP clinicians will not.  We will also ask clients 
and clinicians to complete qualitative feedback about Horyzons.

telephone screen  to confirm study eligibility . 
Baseline - Participants  i n both cohorts who are deemed eligible  
schedule a virtual appointment with the study coordinator  to 
obtain consent , HIPAA authorization,  and complete the baseline  
assessments ( Demographics, UCLA Loneliness Scale, MOS Social 
Support Survey, SIAS, short -form PWS). Client participants are 
then oriented to the Horyzons site.  Participants in the second 
cohort only also complete other assessments (Questionnaire 
about the Process of Recovery, Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media Users, Mod ified Colorado Symptom Index, and Twente 
Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale).  
Study Treatment - Clie
 nt participants will be given access to the 
digital platform Horyzons for three months. Weekly engagement is 
decided by [CONTACT_2299]. Digital access is available daily, digital

 access to PSS and online therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291904], and 
virtual “Horyzons Hangs” are hosted over Zoom by [CONTACT_291927].  
Mid-treatment - Participants in both cohorts will complete  
assessments (UCLA Loneliness Scale, MOS Social Support Survey, 
SIAS, short -form PWS, WAI -I, and Perceived Autonomy Support 
Scale ). Participants in the second cohort only also complete other 
assessments (Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery, Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media Users, Modified Colorado Symptom Index, and Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale).  
Post -treatment  
 – Participants in both cohorts will complete  
assessments (UCLA Loneliness Scale, MOS Social Support Survey, 
SIAS, short -form PWS, WAI -I, and  Perceived  Autonomy  Support 
Scale ). Participants in the second cohort only also complete other 
assessments (Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery, Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media Users, Modified Colorado Symptom Index, and Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale). An additional feedback survey and qualitative interview are completed.  
Additional assessment timepoints for the second cohort:  
P
articipants in the second cohort will complete  the following 
assessments at 1.5 months and 4.5 months following baseline 
(WAI -I, Perceived Autonomy Support Scale, Twente Engagement 
with eHealth Technologies Scale).  
Focus Groups -  Participating clinicians and PSS take part in small 
focus groups to discuss feasibility, acceptability, and implementation of Horyzons at their NC FEP clinics.  
Efficacy Evaluations  Primary o utcome s (both cohorts) - The UCLA Loneliness Scale and 
MOS Social Support Survey  (total  score ) will be used to assess 
subjective feelings of loneliness and social support.  
Secondary outcomes  (b oth cohorts) - The SIAS and short -form PWS 
will be used to assess subjective feelings of social anxiety and 
psychological wellbeing.  
Tertiary/Exploratory Outcomes (both cohorts) - Qua ntitative and 
qualitative feedback collected at post -treatment and in focus 
groups will be used to explore  feasibility and acceptability of 
Horyzons as a support tool in NC FEP clinics. Subscales from the 
MOS Social Support Survey and the short- form PWS as well as total 
scores from the WAI -I and Perceived Autonomy Support Scale may 
be explored in data analysis.  Among the second cohort only, other

MONITORING PLAN Privacy and online safety will be managed in accordance with the 'Online social networking' guidelines published by 'Cybersmart', a 
national cybersafety  and cybersecurity education program 
managed by [CONTACT_291928] 
(ACMA). Online safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_291929] (clinicians involved in the project, peer support specialists, graduate students in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience) with supervision from the Principal Investigator.

Horyzons: Implementation in Clinical Practice  
 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_356162] devastating and costly of the medical/psychiatric disorders. In the last [ADDRESS_356163] epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743] (FEP) services have emerged to thwart the high relapse rates associated with this 
disorder and increase client treat ment engagement. Increasing evidence shows that such services lead to 
improvements in symptoms, social functioning, quality of life and treatment satisfaction ( 1). In the United 
States, these services have come to be known as Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC).  
 There are a number of North Carolina based CSC programs that provide early psychosis treatment to adolescents and young adults who have recently experienced the onset of psychosis.  Specifically, there are 4 CSC programs in operation in North Carolina, inc luding the Outreach and Support Intervention Services 
(OASIS) clinic in Chapel Hill, the Eagle Program for First Epi[INVESTIGATOR_291905], the Wake Encompass Program in Raleigh, as well as the SHORE program in Wilmington. Each CSC clinic employs a mu ltidisciplinary 
team of providers that promotes recovery, person -centered and culturally competent evidence -based 
interventions with the goal of decreasing illness severity and reducing or preventing disability by [CONTACT_291930]. The goal of these programs is to help individuals get back “on track” in order to achieve school, work, relationship and other life goals. Evidence -based services including CBT -based individual 
psychotherapy, evidence -based pharmacology, supports for wel lness and primary health coordination, family 
education and support, case management, supported employment and education, and/or peer support with an emphasis on shared decision -making, values, and recovery.  
 Young people receiving services from CSC programs typi[INVESTIGATOR_291906] ( 2). However, treatment benefits are usually not maintained over time (3- 4) in particular 
when clients are less engaged in treatment or have recently experienced discharge from the program. For instance, the benefits of early intervention seen at the end of [ADDRESS_356164] at 5 years ( 5). There is a 
need, therefore, to explore ways to provide ongoing support for individuals experiencing first epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743]. This support should address specially what some have called "social network crisis" experienc ed by 
[CONTACT_291931]. This refers to the limited social networks and community support that individuals with psychosis generally have. Innovative approaches through internet -based interventions may shed valuable light 
on the issue of maintaining treatment effects derived from FEP services, and offer additional social support to those enrolled in such services.  
 Additionally, the proposed research is aligned with the NIMH strategic objective of striving for prevention and cures through the study of mechanisms of therapeutic action. Specifically, it aligns with the goals of developi[INVESTIGATOR_291907]. This project in essence builds and extends the findings of research on the effectiveness of CSC and looks to determine whether these benefits can b e extended beyond 
CSC in a web -based platform delivered to individuals in the community.  
 We suggest that internet- based interventions have the potential to provide cost- effective, non -stigmatizing, 
constantly available support to FEP people. These interventions, especially those aimed to strengthen social networks, can be used to counteract social isolation and disadvantage; increase functional outcomes and engagements ( 6); reduce symptomatology; and improve uptake and acquisition of therapeutic strategies.

 These also provide an entirely new approach in which participants can safely self -disclosure, take positive 
interpersonal risks, gain perspective, broaden and rehearse copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], obtain encouragement and 
validation, and learn how to solve problems ( 7). 
 The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing Horyzons across two cohorts of clients receiving routine care at clinics across North Carolina that provide services to individuals experiencing schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders, including those in their first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_114332] (FEP). Horyzons is an online platform that integrates: i) peer- to-peer on -line social 
networking; ii) individually tailored interactive psychosocial interventions; and (iii) trained moderation. First 
tested in Australia, this type of intervention has not been evaluated as part of standard service provision to individuals with psychosis in the US.   Of note, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_291908] (OASIS) clinic incorporated Horyzons as an adjunct to care rather than part of routine services. Also, there will be no incentives provided for engagement in Horyzons during the proposed implementation as our goal is to see examine the process by [CONTACT_291932].  As such, we seek to evaluate the extent to which Horyzons can be integrated into typi[INVESTIGATOR_291909].  
 
2 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
2.1 OVERVIEW   
Participants (clients) will be given access to Horyzons (which is considered a “non significant risk” 
medical device  and is described below) from their date of enrollment up to [ADDRESS_356165] cohort 
(enrolling January 2021) and up to 6 months in the second cohort (enrolling February 2022) . Horyzons will 
be monitored daily (two hours per weekday & one hour per weekend day) by [CONTACT_291933], master's level clinicians, [CONTACT_291949] (PI), and/or graduate students in the Department of 
Psychology and Neuroscience at UNC.   In an effort to facilitate and monitor engagement, a protocol is in 
place that  directs moderators to contact [CONTACT_291934]/or email if an he/she/they have 
not logged onto the platform for two weeks, and via telephone if a participant remains inactive for an additional two weeks. The principal investigator, David Penn, will lead weekly supervision calls to ensure 
appropriate care and support of clients involved in this project, to discuss case conceptualization and suggestions for engaging clients in the platform, as well as to monitor any potential safety concerns . 
 Overview of Horyzons. H
 oryzons is an online social media platform that integrates: i) peer -to-peer 
on-line social networking; ii) individually tailored interactive psychosocial interventions; and (iii) expert 
moderation.  
 Pe
er-to-peer online social networking (the “Community”).  The ‘community’ page includes a web feed 
where clients and moderators can post comments, information, upload pi[INVESTIGATOR_291910], and ‘like’ different content. Moreover, the system includes a ‘wall’ function displaying the activity of individual users, an d a ‘network’ (similar to a ‘friends’ function). The open trial also incorporates the participation of 
peer support specialists. Peer supports are individuals with lived experience of severe mental illness who are familiar with the Horyzons platform and affiliated with one of the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_291911]: Implementation in Clinical Practice  
 
Protocol Version 1.0  
Page 10 of 29 
 at which this study will be implemented.   These individuals are part of the investigational staff who will be 
interacting with participants for research purposes, and will also provide feedback (via focus groups with 
clinicians) upon completion of the study. Their primary function will be to induct clients to the platform, reach out to inactive participants, answer any questions clients may have about the site, and help facilitate discussion in the cafe and other sharing areas of the platform. Research staf f at the university and/or 
clinicians at the FEP clinics in North Carolina will train and supervise all Horyzons peer support specialists, and will also be asked to provide feedback through participation in focus groups.  
 Interactive psychosocial interventions.  Horyzons includes a range of tailored interactive 
psychoeducation pathways divided into separate steps. These pathways target key risk factors and salient domains in the early recovery process including: (a) managing symptoms of (social) anxiety, (b) deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_291912], and (c) improve social skills and functioning. Individuals are able to select which pathways they would like to utilize based on their treatment goals. All pathways are available to all participants in this study.  
 Expert Moderation.  Peer support specialists, clinicians with significant experience in the psychosocial 
treatment of FEP clients, as well as graduate students with relevant clinical/research experience with individuals with psychosis will serve as expert moderators. Their role is to provide guidance, monitor participants’ clinical status and ensure the safety of the social networking environment. The moderator reviews interactivity in the social networking space and information from individual participants’  modules 
to monitor clinical risk. The Horyzons Moderation Checklist will be completed by [CONTACT_291935]/she moderates the platform. The checklist is designed to ensure moderators complete the 
appropriate safety checks during the moderation s ession, and to give moderators ideas as to how to 
engage users.  
 Treatment period.  P
 articipants in both cohorts will complete study assessments at baseline, mid -
treatment, and post -treatment. Participants in the second cohort will complete two additional 
assessments before and after mid -treatment assessment at 1.5 months and 4.5 months following baseline, 
respectively.  
 Fo
r all administration of assessments/interviews, the study coordinator will use screen sharing via 
secure videoconferencing  to complete measures with the participant. Baseline assessment will be 
completed alongside the review and completion of informed consent and onboarding of participants onto the Horyzons platform. Participants will complete a mid -treatment assessment with the study coordinator 
or other trained research assistant, which corresponds to approximately [ADDRESS_356166]- treatment, both clients and clinicians (procedures described below) will be provided with an 
optional feedback form as a way of better understanding their experience with the platform and colle cting 
suggestions for improving the site. Individual feedback interviews with clients will also be completed at post -treatment, lasting 60 minutes. These interviews will address participants’ social relationships, 
experiences with loneliness, and thoughts about connecting with others through Horyzons.  
Horyzons: Implementation in Clinical Practice  
 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_356167] impacted participants' 
perceptions of their social environment, participants will be asked to complete brief psychological measures. In the first cohort at baseline, mid -treatment (6 -8 weeks), and post- treatment (12 weeks), 
participants will complete measures of loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale), social support (MOS Social Support Survey), social anxiety (Social Interaction Anxiety Scale), recovery (short form PWS - Psychological 
Well being Scale), and therapeutic alliance (WAI -I and Perceived Autonomy Support Scale).  
 The second cohort will complete all aforementioned measures at baseline, mid -treatment (12 weeks), and 
post -treatment (26 weeks) alongside additional measures of personal recovery (Questionnaire about the 
Process of Recovery), social anxiety related to use  of social media (Social Anxiety Scale for Social Media 
Users), and self -report psychological symptomatology (Modified Colorado Symptom Index). A self -report 
measure of engagement (Twente Engagement with Ehealth Technologies Scale) will be completed at baseline, mid -treatment, and post -treatment as well as at two additional timepoints: 1.5 months and 4.5 
months following baseline. Measures of therapeutic alliance (WAI -I and Perceived Autonomy Support 
Scale) will be administered at 1.[ADDRESS_356168] -treatment only. As this 
platform will be provided as part of clients' routine clinical care, we will also share clinical impressions and other relevant clinical information to the clinical team at the client's respective FEP clinic.  
 Feedback from providers or staff (i.e., program directors, clinicians, peer specialists) will be collected through focus groups (lasting 60 -75 minutes). Prior to initiating the focus groups, providers will complete a 
brief survey which will include (a) gen eral feedback questionnaire about Horyzons and (b) service mappi[INVESTIGATOR_291913]; regarding the latter, program directors and clinicians/peer specialists will complete separate service mappi[INVESTIGATOR_291914]. In the qualitative focus groups, all providers will be asked to provide feedback about their perceptions of their clients’ experiences using the platform, and will also be asked to provide opi[INVESTIGATOR_291915]/barriers to engagement and challenges to implementing and disseminating the Horyzons platform within the clinic. All individual interviews and focus group feedback sessions will be conducted virtually via secure videoconferencing  and will be led by 
[CONTACT_291936]/or a graduate student in clinical psychology at UNC -Chapel Hill. All 
feedback sessions will be digitally recorded, and will be de -identified and transcribed by a member of the 
research team or by a transcription service. The purpose of these recordings and transcriptions is to allow the research t eam to examine the feedback provided in the focus groups for the purposes of improving the 
process of integrating this type of treatment in clinics that provide mental health care to individuals with first epi[INVESTIGATOR_16743].

clinics in North Carolina (OASIS, Encompass, Eagle, and SHORE), including up to 30 FEP clients and 20 FEP providers (clinicians and PSS) . For the second cohort of participants, up to 80 total study subjects will be 
recruited from the four FEP clinics in North Carolina as well as the UNC -affiliated STEP clinics, including up 
to 60 FEP clients and 20 FEP providers (clinicians and PSS).  All clients who enroll in the study  will have a 
primary diagnosis of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Demographic and clinical information that will be

agreed to by [CONTACT_291937], the research team will review the  clinical census 
at each clinic and/or identify potential participants (clients) via the EPIC system.  Clinical 
team members will be asked to review their current caseloads to identify potentially eligible participants (i.e., patients who are currently receiving services at OASIS, SHORE, Encompass, Eagle , or STEP clinics  and are considered clinically stable without current active suicidal 
ideation). The study coordinator and research assistant will engage in discussion with the treatment team to help identify appropriate clients for inclusion in the project. When particip ants have been identified and expressed interest in participation to their clinician or 
other treatment provider, the research study coordinator or RA will reach out to the client in their preferred method of  contact (i.e., in person at the clinic or via phone/email) to 
discuss the project and complete an initial screen to confirm the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.

4.3  FOCUS GROUPS 
Clinicians and PSS from the four FEP clinics in North Carolina will take part in small focus groups 
to discuss the feasibility and acceptability of Horyzons as a supplementary intervention at NC FEP clinics. Providers will complete informed consent and a demographic form collecting basic information about their age, sex, race, current position at the clinic, and years of experience in the 
mental health field  over secure Zoom with the study coordinator before being assigned to a focus 
group. Focus groups will begin with a short feedback survey followed by a group interview led by [CONTACT_291938]: Implementation in Clinical Practice

Page 22 of 29 
 We will use the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system to facilitate data entry and 
management. We will leverage features in REDCap such as real- time data validation, built -in integrity 
checks, and other mechanisms for ensuring data quality (i.e., double data entry). Our team will use 
the DeDoose program for qualitative analysis. All analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_158850] (Elena Pokowitz) and graduate student (Bryan Stiles).   
 
[ADDRESS_356207] contain personal information, such as 
the document that links study ID number to personal identifying informati on (necessary due to the 
longitudinal nature of this study) are kept in locked filing cabinets in locked rooms. Research data is kept on password -protected drives, and our computer systems are HIPAA compliant. All study staff participate in 
annual human subjects training that includes education about responsibilities to minimize risk that confidentiality may be breached.  
 Risks for clients only. Risk of anxiety, paranoia, and/or shame/embarrassment due to experiences using 
this online platform is minimized by [CONTACT_37142] a Horyzons induction procedure. This will also be mitigated through the use of consistent moderating of the site as well as mo derators’ use of a nonjudgmental clinical 
attitude. The informed consent process will be completed in private spaces within the clinic/research setting or via video conferencing will be done in secure locations and on secure servers. The participant will b e 
instructed via email or phone call before the interview to find a private location to complete the induction to the platform. All documents such as consent and feedback measure/questionnaire will be sent to the 
participant using a secure UNC email accoun t. Documents will not contain confidential information.  
 
Risks for providers only. T
 he informed consent process will be completed in private spaces within the 
clinic/research setting or via video conferencing will be done in secure locations and on secure servers. Providers will be instructed via email or phone call before the focus grou ps to identify an appropriate location 
for the group discussion (i.e., private space) if held virtually rather than in person. All documents such as consent documents will be sent to providers using a secure UNC email account. Doc uments will not contain 
confidential information.

 Online safety.  P
 rivacy and online safety will be managed in accordance with the 'Online social 
networking' guidelines published by 'Cybersmart', a national cybersafety and cybersecurity education program managed by [CONTACT_291928] (ACMA). Cybersmart is 
designed to meet the needs of its target audiences young people, parents, teachers and library staff. 
Information about Cybersmart can be found at http://www.cybersmart.gov.au/, while the guidelines are available at http://ww w.acma.gov.au/.  
 Saf
e and informed orientation to the system  will be a priority for the research team. Peer support 
specialists, clinicians, and/or a graduate student in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience  at 
UNC -CH will meet with each participant to provide them with login information, help set up their account 
and orient them to the Horyzons system, including details of the terms of use. All users of Horyzons will be asked to nominate an emergency contact [CONTACT_9702], s uch as a close family member. The terms of use explain 
to users that information passed onto moderators or communicated within the system that may indicate concerns regarding their wellbeing may be communicated with their treating team or private practitioner. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309]  ‘Horyzons Terms of Use’  will be provided to users which will be made available online and in printed form. Participants will be required to sign the hard copy as well as accepting the terms of use on entry into the system. The system also includes a "report function" which enables  users at any time to 
indicate to the moderator a concern about any material posted by a user, including concern about potential abuse or concerns about the well being of another participant. The moderator will assess the basis of the report and respond accordingly, which can include the removal of the material or deactivation of an account.   
 In addition, users will be able to "switch off" their profile and hide all of their existing comments on 
the system should they become concerned about their privacy during their course of participation. The limits of the moderator to respond (e.g., in a timely manner to emergencies) will also be fully explained. In order to protect the privacy of users who discontinue using the system, any accounts that have not been activated for one month may be deactivated following a follow -up telephone call from the mo derator. 
Specifically, our disengagement protocol is such that a participant will receive an email/call/text message if they have not logged onto the platform for two weeks. If another two weeks pass, we will call this person to check in about any potential issues or concerns. If participants do not comply with the guidelines for safe use of Horyzons (e.g., discriminatory comments towards other users) they will be excluded from the system.  
 Clinical safety .
  Clinical risk will be managed through manual and automated procedures. Information 
related to clinical risk will be screened twice daily by [CONTACT_291939] (in the morning and late afternoon/evening). This information can include: 1) post made by [CONTACT_4317],  which disclose evidence of 
psychotic, depressive or suicidal symptoms; 2) participants reports or complaints of posts made by [CONTACT_250851]; 3) risk or self -harm related words automatically detected and blocked by [CONTACT_1190]; and 4) 
Horyzons: Implementation in Clinical Practice  
 
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_356210] information (i.e., on every webpage).  
 
An automated keyword system has also been built in Horyzons which will be activated each time a 
participant posts a contribution containing the words or phrases: suicide, die, kill myself/you/him/her/them, hang myself/you/him/her/them, harm myself/you/him/ her/them, snort, shoot 
up, burn myself/you/him/her/them, cut myself, drown myself/you/him/her/them, stab myself/you/him/her/them, slit, slice, electrocute, shoot myself/you/him/her/them, top myself, jump in front of, jump off, end it all, sleep and never wake up, death, die, asphyxiate, or gas. When these words are detected the contribution will be blocked and the participant will be sent an automated message explaining that the content has been blocked and if they are facing distress then they should contact [CONTACT_291940]. An automated message will also be sent to the Horyzons moderator containing the attempted post.  
 
In addition, a message will be available on each page providing a cell phone number carried by a 
member of the research team for any emergencies that are related specifically to the use of the Horyzons  
system (e.g., highly inappropriate use of the system). Further, each page includes an "In case of 
emergency" link that provides information about ways to contact [CONTACT_9150] (911), the UNC crisis line (984 -974- 3950), and crisis services ( http://crisissolutionsnc.org/ ). 
 
6.2 NON- SIGNIFICANT RISK DOCUMENTATION  
The present study has been deemed of non- significant risk (NSR) to participants.

 Benefits to providers.  Clinicians and peer support specialists may gain insight into clients’ experiences 
using the platform, including possible barriers to engagement and challenges to disseminating the 
Horyzons platform within the clinic. This information may prove useful to clinicians as they consider ways 
to incorporate online interventions and other adjunct services into their existing treatment approaches in the future.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_356212] information will be destroyed immediately after it is ascertained that an individual does not want to participate in the study. Declining participants’ names will be retained on  a secure password protected network to ensure 
that the same participant is not contact[CONTACT_291941].  
 
A member of the research team will meet individually with the client in order to explain the components of the Horyzons platform, elicit and answer any questions the client may have, and obtain informed consent. We will also collect  information about current suicidal ideation and stability (e.g., recent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]) to assess eligibility for participation.  Persons will also be creating a Horyzons profile and answering questions about character strengths (e.g., curiosity, love o f learning), which are e mbedded in 
the Horyzons platform.  These data will be linked to other sources of information, including the record of their interactions within the Horyzons system (e.g., number of posts/comments on the cafe).  
 
The Horyzons system and data generated by [CONTACT_291942] a secure web server. A range of measures are in place to ensure the security of the Horyzons website and the data generated by [CONTACT_8333]. In addition, the team who developed the web application has placed measures within the 
application to secure the application and database against unauthorized access. These measures conform 
to industry best practice as defined by [CONTACT_291943] S ecurity Project (www.OWASP.org). 
Feedback in terviews/focus groups will be conducted via secure Zoom , and will be digitally recorded (via 
Zoom  or using audio recorders) for the purposes of transcription. These recordings and transcripts will be 
immediately uploaded to a secure,  password -protected server and deleted from local devices. The project 
electronic database (including all transcripts f rom interviews/focus groups) will be password protected and 
stored securely, and will only be directly accessible by [CONTACT_291944], clinician s and peer 
support specialists, involved in this project, or PI ([CONTACT_291950]).  
 
As this research program is being implemented in clinical settings, it is possible that FEP clinicians will 
create notes that indicate the participant is involved in the project, describe any issues may arise, etc. that will be connected to their medical record. These documents will be stored in approved medical record systems on HIPAA -compliant computers.  If researchers complete inductions or introductions to the site 
via video conference, the video or audio from these interviews will not be saved or reco rded. Audio from 
qualitative interviews and focus groups will be stored on a secure, password -protected server.

 Identifiable data will only be shared with the clinicians of subjects  in the study with the permission of the 
subjects  (obtained during informed consent). Clinicians will be contact[CONTACT_291945]. As part of the informed consent process, all subjects  will provide the name [CONTACT_3669] 
[CONTACT_104647] a clinician that we may contact [CONTACT_104648] ( e.g., physical and/or 
mental health) during the course of the trial. We will not be sharing any confidential information with 
anybody outside of these clinicians.  
 
Identifiable data will be maintained for [ADDRESS_356213] information will be shredded. Electronic data will be de-identified upon entry, with the exception of the subjects ' birth dates for the purposes of calculating 
their exact age.  
 
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 
7.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Client activity on the platform will be monitored daily by [CONTACT_291946]. Signs  of 
potential clinical deterioration will be reported to the client’s treatment team. It is highly unlikely that 
clinical deterioration will be attributable to the Horyzons system. However, in the event that this becomes 
evident (e.g., a participant has clearly communicated that they have incorporated aspects of the Horyzons  
system into their delusional beliefs) the moderator will communicate this information to the clinical 
treatment team and/or the principal investigator. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_291923].  
 
7.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events  (AE) will be assessed to determine if they meet criteria for a serious adverse events 
(SAE). SAE, as defined by [CONTACT_1622], will be systematically evaluated at each clinic visit. The trial period is 
defined from the time that the informed consent document is signed until [ADDRESS_356214] study visit. All SAE occurring during the trial period (including death due to any cause) or within [ADDRESS_356215] 
study visit will be communicated within 1 day of the investigator becoming aware of the event to designated personnel, using the telephone or fax numbe rs provided in the Study Reference Manual. Any 
fatal or life -threatening AE will be reported immediately, but no longer than 1 day from the time the 
investigator becomes aware of the event. A causality assessment will be provided for all SAEs. Critical 
follow -up information on SAEs will be pro vided as soon as it is available, but no longer than 1 day from the 
time the investigator became aware of the information. Other essential, but not critical, information may 
be reported within the following 5 days. An SAE, as defined by [CONTACT_104649]://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/howtoreport/ucm053087.htm), is an adverse event that satisfies any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death.  
• Is immediately life -threatening, including potentially life threatening suicidal behavior or 
suicidal behavior that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
Horyzons: Implementation in Clinical Practice

Page 27 of 29 
 • Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to  prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples would include allergic 
bronchospasm that requires  treatment in an emergency department, or a seizure that does not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
The causality of SAEs (i.e., their degree of relatedness to study treatment) will be assessed by [CONTACT_291947].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_356216] epi[INVESTIGATOR_291924]  (OASIS, 
Encompass, SHORE, and Eagle)  and the UNC -affiliated STEP clinics (Carr Mill Mall, Vilcom Center, Main Wake 
Clinic) .  The  OASIS clinic was co -developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Penn for the treatment of people with first epi[INVESTIGATOR_114333]. Currently, each clinic has a census of approximately [ADDRESS_356217] been self -identified as clinicians or PSS  providing 
services to clients at one of the four participating clinics; therefore, we expect approximately [ADDRESS_356218].  
 Once a client is referred to the study (or self refers), a study clinician or research assistant will speak with the individual (and any other individuals that she/he indicates, such as a family member) to describe the study protocol, expectations of study  participation and potential study risks and benefits. If a client contacts a 
member of the research project to indicate interest in the study, a member of the research team will explain the study over the phone and use the screening questions to assess fo r potential eligibility. Providers will be 
contact[CONTACT_103825]/or email in order to obtain consent and schedule focus groups.  
 Recruitment will be completed by [CONTACT_9137], research assistant, and/or clinical providers involved in this project.  The latter include s peer support specialists and clinicians at the local FEP clinics.  
 
[ADDRESS_356219] a series of questions about the study, such as 
what they are to do if they no longer want to participate, or what they would do if they experience any stress

virtual research study, participants will provide verbal consent as recorded by [CONTACT_9137].

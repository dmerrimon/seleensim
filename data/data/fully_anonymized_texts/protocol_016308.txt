1.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Objectives  
 
 Primary Objectives: (6/25/15) 
1.1.1 T o determine the objective response rate of pat ients with advanced, persistent or 
recurrent endometrial cancer when treated with each of the arms of the trial. The 
proposed arms are:  
 
• Arm #1 everolimus 10 mg daily and Letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily 
 
• Arm #2 Tamoxifen 20 mg PO BID; on alternating weeks (even numbered) weeks, 
Medroxyprogesterone Acetate 200 mg PO once daily  with Tamoxifen 20 mg PO 
BID 
 
Secondary Objectives : 
1.1.2   T o estimate the t ime to disease progression for each arm  
 
1.1.3 T o describe the toxicities of each of the arms of the trial when used for patients with 
advanced/metastatic endometrial cancer.  
 
 1.2 Translational Research Objectives: 
 
1.2.1  To determine if relevant biomarkers correlate with response to treatment in each of the 
two arms. Three panels of biomarkers are proposed. 
• immunohistochemical expression of hormone receptors (estrogen receptor -alpha, estrogen receptor- beta, progesterone recep tor-A, 
progesterone receptor B and the G protein -coupled estrogen receptor, 
GPR -30), 
• immunohistochemical evaluation of components of the mTOR pathway and related proteins, including phosphorylated  S6 ribosomal protein, 
PTEN, total and phosphorylated AKT , total and phosphorylated 
mTOR , and phospho- ERK1/2   
• mutational analysis  including PTEN, PIK3CA , KRAS , and CTNNB1 
(beta-catenin ) performed using a sequencing panel assay.  
    
 
 
   
 
 
 
 GOG -[ADDRESS_607848] common gynecologic malignancy in the [LOCATION_002] with 
53,630 new cases and 8, 590 deaths estimated for 2014 (Siegel, 2014) . The standard treatment 
for primary endometrial cancer consists of a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -
oophorectomy and possible lymph node dissection. This may be followed by [CONTACT_474414]. Treatment failure in low -risk patients is rare. Tumor 
recurrence is most common in women with advanced -stage disease or those with high risk 
features. Women with isolated pelvic recurrences can potentially be salvaged with radiation therapy or surgery. However, in women with distant recurrent disease, treatment is largely 
systemic. 
 
 2.[ADDRESS_607849] been studied in the treatment 
of women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Paclitaxel and carboplatin has been established as the usual  initial chemotherapy for endometrial cancer  (Miller, 2012).  Initial 
chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin is given either in the adjuvant or 
advanced/recurrent disease setting.  
 
In addition, some endometrial cancers ar e hormonally sensitive. Treatment of recurrent and 
progressive tumors with progestins and  progestins in combination with tamoxifen (a selective 
estrogen receptor modulator) has been evaluated  (Lentz, 1996; Thigpen, 1999; Whitney, 2004; 
Fiorica, 2004) .  In GOG 81, medroxyprogesterone acetate at 200 mg daily resulted in an 
objective response rat e of 25% (36/145 patients) (Thigpen, 1999).  Median duration of response 
was short (3.2 months).   In GOG 119, single arm phase II trial of medroxyprogesterone acetate 
plus tamoxifen (tamoxifen 20 mg BID with medroxyprogesterone acetate 100 mg BID given on alternating weeks) showed a 33% (19/58 patients) objective response rate (Whitney, 2004).  
Again, median progression free survival was short (3 months).  In a phase II study by [CONTACT_218480], an aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole) had limit ed activity as a 
single agent against recurrent and progressive endometrial cancer  (Rose, 2000). In this study, of 
the 23 patients enrolled, two had partial responses (9%) and two had short -term stable disease.  
 
More effective systemic agents with longer d urations of response are needed. Prognosis remains 
poor for patients who recur following first -line chemotherapy (generally paclitaxel/carboplatin) 
given in either the adjuvant or advanced/recurrent disease setting.  
  
 2.3 PTEN/ AKT /mTOR Pathway  
   
PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene, has been shown to play several roles in tumor suppression, 
including cell cycle arrest and promotion of apoptosis. Inactivating mutations in PTEN occur 
frequently in many human cancers. In particular, mutations in PTEN are fr equent in endometrial 
carcinomas (TCGA, 2013). 
 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -3- 
Tumor cells lacking PTEN contain high levels of activated AKT . This suggests that PTEN is 
necessary for the appropriate regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase/ AKT  pathway. 
Recent studies have identified the AKT  kinase as a potential mediator of tumorigenesis in 
endometrial cancer cell lines. The finding of PTEN mutations in the majority of endometrial 
cancer suggests that the loss of PTEN function may be one mechanism by [CONTACT_474415]. Because PTEN -deficient cancer cells may have upregulated activity 
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is downstream of AKT , these cells may 
be sensitive to mTOR inhibition.  
  
 2.4 Everolimus  
Everolimus is a novel derivative of rapamycin. It has been in clinical development since 1996 as 
an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation. Everolimus is approved in Europe and 
other global markets (trade name: [CONTACT_117]®) for cardiac and renal transplantation, and in the 
[LOCATION_002] (trade name: [CONTACT_118]®) for the prevention of organ rejection in kidney transplant 
patients.  Afinitor® was  approved for adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after 
failure of trea tment with sunitinib or sorafenib in 2009. In 2010, Afinitor® received United 
States (US) approval for patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated 
with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Everolimus  is also available as Votubia® in th e 
European Union (EU) for patients with SEGA associated with TSC who require therapeutic 
intervention but are not candidates for curative surgical resection. Afinitor® was approved for 
“progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET) in patients with unresectable, locally 
advanced, or metastatic disease” in 2011 in various countries, including the US and Europe. In 
2012 Afinitor® received approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2- negative breast can cer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination 
with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole. Furthermore in 2012, Afinitor® received approval for the treatment of patients with TSC who have renal 
angiomyolipoma not requiring immediate surgery.  
 
Approximately 30,[ADDRESS_607850] been treated with everolimus as of 30- Sep-2013 
• 16,671 patients in [COMPANY_001] -sponsored clinical trials  
• 1,911 patients in the individual patient supply program  
• More than 12,000 patients in investigator-sponsor ed studies.  
• In addition, healthy volunteer subjects and non-oncology hepatically impaired subjects 
have participated in the clinical pharmacology stu dies. 
 
The following is a brief summary of the main characteristics of everolimus. More complete 
informatio n can be obtained from the everolimus Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
 2.41 Overview of Everolimus 
Everolimus is a derivative of rapamycin which acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. 
Everolimus selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), specifically 
targeting the mTOR -raptor signal transduction complex. mTOR is a key serine-
threonine kinase in the PI3K/AKT  signaling cascade, which is known to be 
dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers ( Boulay, 2007).  
Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act  
• Directly on the tumor cells by [CONTACT_069]; 
• Indirectly by [CONTACT_37951] g angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity (via 
potent inhibition of tumor cell VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
production and VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells).

 GOG -3007 
 
 -4- 
At the cellular and molecular level, everolimus  acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. It 
selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key protein kinase 
which regulates cell growth, proliferation and survival. The mTOR kinase is mainly 
activated via the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3-Kinase) pathway through 
AKT /PKB and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2). Mutations in these 
components or in PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3- kinase, may result in their 
dysregulation. Abnormal functioning of various components of the signaling pathways 
contributes to the pathophysiology of numerous human cancers. Various preclinical 
models have confirmed the role of this pathway in tumor development ( Cohen, 2005).  
The main known functions of m TOR include the following ( Bjornsti , 2004):  
• mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors and energy and nutrient levels; 
• Facilitating cell- cycle progression from G1 -S phase in appropriate growth 
conditions; 
• The PI3K/mTOR pathway itself is frequently dysregulated in many human 
cancers, and oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR 
inhibitors; 
• PI3-kinase mutations have been reported in the primary tumor in 10-20% of 
human col orectal cancers ( Frattini 2005, Velho 2005);  
• The loss of PTEN protein, either through gene deletion or functional silencing (promoter hypermethylation), is reported in approximately 60% 
of primary human colorectal cancers (Goel , 2004);  
• The mTOR pathway is involved in the production of pro- angiogenic factors 
(i.e., VEGF) and inhibition of endothelial cell growth and proliferation; 
• Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins and activating the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates 
protein translation, including the HIF -[ADDRESS_607852], prostate, colon, melanoma and glioblastoma. IC50s range from sub/low nM to µM. Everolimus also inhibits the 
proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS) in vitro , with 
particular potency against VEGF -induced proliferation suggesting that everolimus  may 
also act as an anti -angiogeni c agent. The anti -angiogenic activity of everolimus  was 
confirmed in vivo . Everolimus  selectively inhibited VEGF -dependent angiogenic 
response at well tolerated doses. Mice with primary and metastatic tumors treated with 
Everolimus showed a significant reduction in blood vessel density when compared to controls. 
The potential of everolimus  as an anti -cancer agent was shown in rodent models. 
Everolimus is orally bioavailable, residing longer in tumor tissue than in plasma in a 
subcutaneous mouse xenograft model, and demonstrating high tumor penetration in a 
rat pancreatic tumor model. The pharmacokinetic profile of everolimus  indicates 
sufficient tumor penetration, above that needed to inhibit the proliferation of endothelial 
cells and tumor cell lines deemed sensitive to everolimus  in vitro . 
Everolimus administered orally daily was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth, at well tolerated doses, in 11 different mouse xenograft models (including pancreatic, colon, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_015], lung and mela noma) and two syngeneic models (rat pancreatic, mouse 
orthotopic melanoma). These models included tumor lines considered sensitive and 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -5- 
“relatively resistant” in vitro . In general, everolimus was better tolerated in mouse 
xenograft models than standard cytotoxic agents (i.e., doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil), 
while possessing similar anti- tumor activity. Additionally, activity in a VEGF -
impregnated subcutaneous implant model of angiogenesis and reduced vascularity (vessel density) of everolimus -treated tumors (murine melanoma) provided evidence of 
in vivo  effects of angiogenesis.  
It is not clear which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells to everolimus . Molecular analysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to everolimus in 
vitro  correlates with the degree of phosphorylation (activation) of the AKT /PKB protein 
kinase and the S6 ribosomal protein; in some cases (i.e., glioblastoma) there is also a correlation with PTEN status. 
In vivo  studies investigat ing the anti -tumor activity of eve rolimus in experimental 
animal tumor models showed that everolimus monotherapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_474400]. These effects occurred within the dose 
range of 2.5 mg to 10 mg/kg, orally once a day. 
In preclinical  models, the administration of everolimus  is associated with reduction of 
protein phosphorylation in target proteins downstream of mTOR, notably 
phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6rp) and p -4E-BP1, and occasionally with an 
increase in phosphorylated AKT , a protein upstream of mTOR signaling pathway. 
All significant adverse events observed in toxicology studies with everolimus in mice, 
rats, monkeys and mini-pi[INVESTIGATOR_474401] -proliferative and i mmunosuppressant and at least in part reversible after a [ADDRESS_607853] notably testes. 
In vitro genotoxicity studies covering relevant genotoxicity end -points showed no 
evide nce of clastogenic or mutagenic activity.  
In male fertility studies in rats, testicular morphology was affected at 0.5 mg/kg and 
above, and sperm motility, sperm head count and plasma testosterone levels were 
diminished at 5 mg/kg which corresponded to 0.7 times the estimated clinical exposure 
at 10 mg/day, and caused a decrease in male fertility. There was evidence of reversibility. 
Female fertility was not affected, but everolimus caused an increase of pre- implantation 
loss in female rats at doses > 0.1 mg/kg, suggesting it could also potentially  impact 
fertility in females.  Everolimus  crossed the placenta and was toxic to the conceptus. In 
rats, everolimus caused embryo/fetotoxicity at systemic exposure below the planned 
therapeutic level comprising mortality and reduced fetal weight. The incide nce of skeletal 
variations and malformations at 0.3 and 0.9 mg/kg (e.g. sternal cleft) was increased. In rabbits, embryo toxicity was evident by [CONTACT_321792]. Effects of everolimus on the pre - and postnatal development of rats were limited to slightly affected 
body weight and survival in the F1-generation at ≥0.1 mg/kg, and did not indicate a specific toxic potential.  
The potential reproductive risk for humans is unknown. However, due to the observed malformations in rats, everolimus should be considered potentially teratogenic. 
Everolimus should not be given to pregnant women unless the potential benefit outweighs 
the potential risk for the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use highly effective contraception met hods while they are receiving everolimus and up to 8 
weeks after treatment has been stopped. It is not known whether everolimus is excreted 
in human milk. In animal studies, everolimus and/or its metabolites were readily 
transferred into the milk of lactating rats. Therefore women who are taking everolimus  
should not breastfeed. 
Further details can be found in the everolimus Investigator’s Brochure.

 2.5 mTOR inhibition  and endometrial cancer  
 
Recent molecular profiling has shown that increased PI3K/AKT /mTOR signaling is associated 
with aggressive disease and poor prognosis, irrespective of endometrial cancer histology.   
 
Clinically available mTOR inhibitors target either mTORC1 alone, or mTORC1/2. Others in 
development target multiple nodes of the PI3K pathway including PI3K.  mTORC1 inhibitor 
currently in clinical development include everolimus, temsirolimus and ridaforolimus.  
 Recently, everolimus and temsirolimus showed antitumor activity in endometrial cancer cell 
lines, with greatest sensitivity in cells with PIK3CA  and/or PTEN  mutations. Furthermore, 
everolimus reduced progression of endometrial hyperplasia in a PTEN  heterozygous mouse 
model, and repressed tumor growth in mouse xenograft models harboring endometrial cancer cells with loss of PTEN and/or PIK3CA  mutations. Consistent with these findings, 
ridaforolimus also showed antitumor activity in endometrial cancer cells and a mouse xenograft model, with grea test sensitivity observed in cells with loss of PTEN or increased 
phosphorylated or total AKT .  
 In patients with recurrent and/or metastatic endometrial cancer, single- agent treatment with 
everolimus, temsirolimus, and ridaforolimus has led to clinical benefit rates of 21%, 52% to 83%, and 33% to 66%, respectively (Slomovitz, 2010; Oza, 2011; Colombo, 2013) . For both 
temsirolimus and ridaforolimus, the best responses were seen in patients with no prior 
chemotherapy. Furthermore, ridaforolimus was also shown to significantly improve 
progression- free survival (PFS) in patients with no further approved treatment options. 
Common adverse events in these studies included fatigue, nausea, mucositis, diarrhea, and rash. Hypertriglyceridemia was also reported in 2 s tudies, and pneumonitis was common in 1 study 
(37%). In addition, hyperglycemia, a possible “on target” effect of PI3K/ AKT /mTOR pathway 
inhibition, was observed in 2 studies (27% and 19%, respectively). 
 
2.6 Hormonal Therapy and endometrial cancer  
The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) has a long history of studying hormonal therapy in women with advanced/recurrent endometrial carcinoma.  Although such regimens are generally 
well tolerated, and may produce responses of long duration in selected patients, the overall 
response rates and progression free survival (PFS) have been disappointing.  Among the more 
active hormonal regimens tested by [CONTACT_474416] 
(MA) at 80 mg bid for 3 weeks alternating with Tamoxifen (T) 20 mg bid for 3 weeks (Fiorica, 2004).  This regimen produced a response rate of 27% in 56 eligible women with no prior 
chemotherapy or hormonal therapy.  Median PFS was 2.7 months and median overall survival 
was 14.0 months. This trial was closed to patient  entry in November 1995. Another study 
(GOG -0119), evaluated 
the efficacy of tamoxifen citrate plus intermittent administration of 
medroxyprogesterone acetate in patients with recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma 
(Whitney, 2004).   This regimen produced a response rate of 33% in [ADDRESS_607854] received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. 
 
  
2.7 Rationale for the combination of hormones and everolimus  
 
Given the importance of ER signaling in type I endometrial cancer, and the cross-regulation 
between the ER and PI3K/ AKT/mTOR pathways, combining agents that disrupt ER signaling 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -7- 
with PI3K/ AKT /mTOR pathway inhibitors may also result in synergistic antitumor responses. 
The combination of everolimus  with the aromatase inhibitor exemestane significantly improved 
PFS in patients with aromatase inhibitor-refractory breast cancer, thus demonstrating proof-of-
concept that PI3K/ AKT /mTOR pathway inhibitors may reverse resistance to aromatase 
inhibitors. 
 
The GOG -0248 evaluated the combination of temsirolimus and megestrol acetate compared to 
temsirolimus alone ( Fleming, 2014). In this study, the temsirolimus/hormonal arm was closed 
secondary to a high rate of thromboembolic events.  
 
In patients with advanced breast cancer, the combination of ever olimus 10 mg/day and letrozole 
2.5 mg/day was tolerable.  Efficacy data in patients with advanced breast cancer have 
demonstrated some activity in some patients that do not respond to letrozole alone.  
 
Our group recently completed a single arm phase II activity trial of everolimus in combination 
with letrozole for patients with recurrent endometrial cancer  (Slomovitz, 2011) . Of the 35 
evaluable patients, the response rate was 31% (11/35). There were 8 patients who achieved a 
complete remission and 3 patien ts with a partial remission.  
 The safety profile of everolimus was acceptable in the context of heavily pretreated patients 
with endometrial cancer. Compared to a previous phase 2 single agent everolimus trial showing 
no objective responses , the addition of letrozole likely blocks the by[CONTACT_474417]3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway and thus resulted in better treatment response. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_607855] developed from two SPORE-sponsored completed clinical trials: the 
first was a single agent everolimus study (Slomovitz, 2010) and the second was a dual 
everolimus and letrozole study (Slomovitz, 2011). 
 
Biomarkers to predict responsiveness to mTOR  inhibitors have been examined in a number of 
different cancers, including renal cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine cancers, sarcoma, 
glioblastoma and endometrial cancer. To date, no single biomarker predictive of response to an 
mTOR inhibitor has been identified and validated. In a Phase II study of temsirolimus in renal 
cell carcinoma, high phospho- S6rp levels were correlated to response, with phospho -AKT  
levels demonstrating a trend toward positive response. In endometrial cancer, neither we, nor 
the Canadian NCIC group found an obvious correlation between PTEN status, phospho- AKT , 
phospho- S6rp or phospho- mTOR levels and response to temsir olimus or everolimus  (Oza, 
2011).  Although our numbers were small, our study showed that the combination of high 
phospho- S6rp levels with an activating KRAS mutation was predictive of non -response to these 
agents in endometrial tumors. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that predict non-response to mTOR inhibitors may be a more clinically achievable goal, and will contribute to the 
development of personalized treatment regimens for endometrial cancer.  
 With the positive report of BOLERO [ADDRESS_607856] cancer (BOLERO 2 
study; Baselga 2012), there is increasing clinical and pre- clinical evidence of the close 
interaction between the PI3K/ AKT /mTOR pathway and ER ligand-independent signaling. More 
specifically, studies have demonstrated that S6 kinase is involved in phosphoryl ation of  
estrogen receptor for ligand -independent receptor activation (phospho- ERalpha- S167  and 
phospho-ERalpha-S118) ( Yamnik, 2010; Yamnik, 2009, de Leeuw, 2011 ).  With  the 
 GOG -[ADDRESS_607857]- treatment samples.    
 
i)  Tissue Analysis  
For the GOG trial, biomarkers will be performed from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded 
samples.   Three panels of biomarkers are proposed.  
- First, immunohistochemical express ion of hormone receptors (estrogen receptor-alpha, 
phospho-ERalpha-S167, phospho-ERalpha-S118, estrogen receptor -beta, progesterone 
receptor -A, progesterone receptor B and the G protein -coupled estrogen receptor, GPR-30) 
will be quantified.  
- Second, immunohistochemical evaluation of components of the mTOR-signaling pathway 
and related proteins, including phospho- S6 rp, PTEN, total and phospho- AKT , and 
phospho- ERK1/[ADDRESS_607858] recently identi fied beta -catenin 
(CTNNB1 ) as a predictor of poor outcome for patients with endometrioid endometrial 
cancer (unpublished data).   Hotspot mutations for these genes will be analyzed using a 
CLIA -certified next -generation sequencing panel including 42 additi onal cancer -related 
genes ( Singh , 2013) .  This assay has been validated for use with FFPE samples.  In 
addition, because of the low somatic mutation rate of KRAS we observed in previous phase II trials , it is possible that rather than the KRAS mutation, the KRAS expression level may 
play a role in response to everolimus. Quantitive  PCR analysis of mRNA extracted from 
patient tissue will be used an alternative method to study KRAS as a biomarker.  
 ii) Blood collection  
We plan to collect pre-treatment blood from patients enrolled in this study . DNA extracted from 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) can be used as control to identify somatic mutations in tumor tissue samples.  Approximately 10ml of blood should be collected at the time 
of study entry.

version 1.1). Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded). Each lesion mus t 
be greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_607861], MRI or caliper measurement 
by [CONTACT_461]; or greater than or equal to [ADDRESS_607862] or MR I (See section 8).  
 
Patients must have at least one “target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 (Section 8.1). Tumors within a previously irradiated 
field will be designated as “non- target” lesions unless progression is documented or a 
biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.

the adjuvant setting for Stage I, II or III disease is permitted.  
  Note:  No prior chemotherapy in the setting of Stage IV disease is permitted unless the 
patient was without evidence of disease at the compl etion of chemotherapy and had at 
least six months of progression- free survival since the completion of chemotherapy.

4.40 Adverse Effects: Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus  are rash, 
stomatitis/oral mucositis, fatigue, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 
Infections have not been notably frequent or severe. Non- infectious pneumonitis has 
also been observed. The majority of these AEs have been of mild to moderate severity (CTC grade 1 -2). Overall, the most frequently observed laboratory abnormalities 
include reduced blood counts, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_309932]/or hypertriglyceridemia.  
 
Stomatitis (grade 3) was the principal DLT in Phase [ADDRESS_607876] of rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus, and 
everolimus ). Numerous case reports in the literature suggest that rapamycin -associated 
pneumonitis is relatively unaggressive, limited in extent, and reversible upon drug discontinuation. The term ‘pneumonitis’ is used here to describe non-infectious, non-
malignant infiltration in the lungs which is evident radiologically. More precise 
diagnosis should follow histocytological examination following lung biopsy, generally 
during bronchoscopy which may or may not be symptomatic.  
In oncology studies with everolimus , severe pneumonitis suspected as drug - related has 
been reported as a serious adverse event on 13 occasions and additionally in the following associated preferred terms including acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] 
(n=2), alveolitis (n=1) and allergic alveolit is (n=1), interstitial lung disease (n=10), lung 
infiltration (n=23), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, lung consolidation, pulmonary 
alveoloar hemorrhage, pulmonary toxicity and pulmonary fibrosis (n=1, each). One 
fatal case of drug - related pneumonitis was reported for a patient with metastatic 
infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast treated with 10 mg/day, which developed approximately two months after starting everolimus. Cytology for both the pleural and 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -17- 
pericardial fluids were positive for malignancy. The death was considered possibly 
related to the underlying late stage tumor and study drug. Additionally, one patient 
treated with 10 mg/day died due to severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_474407]. Thoracic CT scan demonstrated conden sation in the majority of the left 
lower lobe and frosted glass appearance in the left upper lobe, lingula, and right lung.  
 
Serious opportunistic infections have also been reported in cancer patients treated with 
RAD001: mycobacterium, Aspergillus, and fa tal candidal sepsis, and fatal 
pneumocystis carinii  in particular. Because everolimus, as other rapamycins, inhibits 
proliferation of activated lymphocytes and reduces neutrophil counts, treatment with everolimus must be considered as predisposing patients to the risk of infection. This 
risk will be higher in patients severely immunocompromised because of their 
underlying disease and/or co- medications. Outcome may be fatal in case of serious 
infections.  
Cytopenias. A reduction in blood cell counts is frequent when everolimus therapy is 
initiated. Without clinical significance and infrequently, anemia and thrombocytopenia have been reported. In heavily pretreated patients with aggressive lymphoma, the 
incidence of grade 3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was reported to be 
11%, 16%, and 30%, respectively. Serious, suspected drug- related hemorrhages have 
been exceptional. Nevertheless, everolimus  should be considered as predisposing 
patients to hemo rrhage, potentially fatal, should they develop severe drug- related 
thrombocytopenia. 
 
Liver Transaminase Elevation. Discrete, reversible changes in liver enzymes have been found to occur in numerous patients during treatment with everolimus in oncology 
clinical studies, and in a study in rheumatoid arthritis. In oncology studies, these 
changes may be evident only in patients without severe underlying morbidity. The 
increase in transaminases (AST and ALT) generally appears after four weeks of 
treatment. In all but a few cases it does not exceed Grade 1 (≤ 2.[ADDRESS_607877]). Similarly, 
mild increases in alkaline phosphatases can coexist. Spontaneous corrections or 
intermittent correction with continued treatment can occur. Serum bilirubin is not increased. In studies of patients with advanced cancers, clinically relevant changes in 
liver enzymes have been invariably associated with the presence of liver metastases 
and/or progression of the underlying cancer. Fatal reactivation of hepatitis B and C have 
been reported. 
 
Renal failure has been reported in five suspected cases to date. One patient with no alternative explanation made a complete recovery following study drug adjustment and 
no treatment/therapy for the event. The rest of the patients had concurrent morbiditi es, 
which might have contributed to the reported events. 
 
Electrolyte Abnormalities. Hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia and hypocalcemia have been reported as serious adverse reactions. Electrolytes should be monitored in patients treated with everolimus.

notified , via e -mail, from GOG, that patients may be screened and enrollment can begin.    
5.1 Patient Entry and Registration  
This trial is open to U.S. GOG Member Institutions. The GOG Statistical and Data Center (SDC) utilizes a web -based patient registration system (available at the GOG web menu page). 
When a suitable candidate has been identified for protocol entry, the following steps should be taken:  
5.[ADDRESS_607879] register the patient using the web -based registration application or 
by [CONTACT_32627] (800-523- 2917). Instructions for web- based registration and 
randomization can be found by [CONTACT_474423], selecting 
"Start/finish a patient registrat ion," and then selecting "Directions" found on the left 
side of the page.  
5.15 The institution will enter the patient's name, GOG patient identification number, and 
date of registration in the appropriate place in their Log Book to document the patient's 
entry.  
 
5.2 Treatment Plan  
 
Treatment randomization will be stratified into two levels based on previous treatment for endometrial cancer: Level 1. Patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy or 
chemoradiation either at time of initial diagnosis or for a pelvic recurrence; Level 2. Patients 
who have never received adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation.  
 
Prior radiotherapy in the absence of chemotherapy is not considered in this stratification.  
 
Study therapy will be randomized between: Arm 1: Everolimus 10 mg PO daily and Letrozole 2.5 mg PO daily  
Arm 2: Tamoxifen 20 mg PO BID; on alternating weeks (even numbered) weeks, medroxyprogesterone acetate  200 mg PO daily  with Tamoxifen 20 mg PO BID. 
 
Therapy is to be continued until tumor progression or undue toxicity. Tumor assessments will be 
performed per Appendix V (excel tool for calculating dates).   
See Appendix II for General Chemotherapy Guidelines.

Toxicity will be assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) , 
version 4.0 . 
 
6.1   Tamoxifen/ medroxyprogesterone acetate  
 
There are no dose modifications for the tamoxifen/ medroxyprogesterone acetate.  However, 
because of the risk of DVT, subjects not already on anticoagulation who require major 
abdominal or pelvic surgery or fracture a femur or pelvis should have drug held from one week prior to the procedure (if it is a p lanned procedure) un til they are ambulatory again. Suspected 
severe and unusual toxicities from either agent (e.g. hives from tamoxifen) should be discussed with the study chair. 
 
6.2   Everolimus /Letrozole 
For patients who do not tolerate the protocol- specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments are 
permitted in order to allow the patient to continue the study treatment. Details of study treatment schedule adjustments and dose levels are provided in Table 6 -1.

6.22 Management of specific toxicities  
Overall, safety data available from completed, controlled and uncontrolled studies 
indicate that everolimus is generally well tolerated at weekly or daily dose schedules. 
The safety profile is characterized by [CONTACT_58858] (AEs). These AEs are generally reversible and non -cumulative.  
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus  are stomatitis, rash, diarrhea, 
fatigue, infections, asthenia, nausea, peripheral edema, decreased appetite, headache, dysgeusia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], mucosal inflammation, pneumonitis, weight decreased, vomiting, 
pruritus, cough, dyspnea, dry skin, nail disorder, and pyrexia. . Overall, the most 
frequently observed laboratory abnormalities include decreased hematology parameters 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -25- 
including hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelets, and neutrophils (or collectively as 
pancytopenia).; increased clinical chemistry parameters including cholesterol, 
triglycerides, glucose, aspartate transaminases,  creatinine, alanine transaminases, and 
bilirubin; and decreased clinical chemistry parameters including phosphate and 
potassium.. The majority of these AEs have been of mild to moderat e severity (CTC AE 
grade 1 -2). 
6.[ADDRESS_607887] been severe (e.g. , leading to  sepsis,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_58799]) and occasionally have had a fatal outcome.  
Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with everolimus Treat pre- existing infections p rior to st arting treatment with 
everolimus . While taking everolimus, be vigilant for symptoms and signs of 
infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of everolimus . 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue 
everolimus and treat with appropriate antifungal therapy. 
Cases of pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP), some with a fatal outcome, 
have been reported in patients who received everolimus. PJP may be associated 
with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.  
Prophylaxis for PJP should be considered when concomitant use of 
corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents are required.  
6.[ADDRESS_607888] be reported as an AE. Patients with grade 2 or higher 
toxicity may be treated with the following suggested supportive measures at the 
discretion of the investigator: oral minocycline, topi[INVESTIGATOR_027], topi[INVESTIGATOR_47288], topi[INVESTIGATOR_029], diphenhydramine, oral prednisolone 
(short course), topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], or pi[INVESTIGATOR_031].  
6.[ADDRESS_607889] pain or angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respi[INVESTIGATOR_88739]) have been 
observed with everol imus . 
6.224 Angioedema with concomitant use of angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors  
Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (e.g. swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respi[INVESTIGATOR_36880]).  
6.224 Renal Failure Events  
Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with fatal outcome, occurred in patients treated with everolimus . Renal function of patients should 
 GOG -[ADDRESS_607890] been reported 
in patients taking everolimus. Monitoring of renal function, including 
measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein, or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of everolimus  therapy and 
periodically thereafter.  
6.225 Management of stomatitis / oral mucositis /  mouth ulcers  
Adverse Drug Reaction  Severity  Everolimus  Dose Adjustment and Management 
Recommendations  
Stomatitis  Grade 1 
(Minimal 
symptoms, normal diet)  
 No dose adjustment required.  
Manage with non-alcoholic or salt water (0.9%) 
mouth wash several  times a day  until resolution. 
 Grade 2  
(Symptomatic 
but can eat and 
swallow modified diet)  Temporary dose interruption until recovery to grade 
≤1.  
Re-initiate everolimus at same dose.  
If stomatitis recurs at grade 2, interrupt dose until 
recovery to grad e ≤1. Re- initiate everolimus  at lower 
dose. 
Manage with topi[INVESTIGATOR_032] (e.g. benzocaine,  butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol or phenol)  with or without 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (i.e. triamcinolone oral paste)*.  
 Grade  3 
(Symptomatic 
and unable to 
adequately eat or hydrate orally)  
 Temporary dose interruption until recovery to grade 
≤1.  
Re-initiate everolimus at lower dose.  
Manage with topi[INVESTIGATOR_032] (i.e. 
benzocaine,  butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol or phenol) with or without 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (i.e. triamcinolone oral paste)*  
 Grade 4  
(Symptoms 
associated with 
life-threatening 
consequences)  Discontinue everolimus  and treat with appropriate 
medical therapy.  
* using agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives in management of 
stomatitis  is discouraged  as they may worsen mouth ulcers . 
Patients with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/mouth ulcers and those with gastrointestinal morbidity associated with mouth/dental infections, irritation of esophageal mucosa e.g. gastro esophageal  
reflux disease (GERD) and pre- existing stomatitis/mucositis must be monitored even more closely. 
Patients should be instructed to report the first onset of buccal mucosa irritation/reddening to their study physician immediately.  
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulc ers due to everolimus  should be treated using local supportive care. 
Please note that investigators in earlier trials have described the o ral toxicities associated with everolimus 
as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis or stomatitis. If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than 
a more general inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse event as such. Agents containing 
alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen mouth ulcers.  These agents 
should be avoided. Antifungal agents should be avoided un less a fungal infection is diagnosed. In 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -27- 
particular, systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) should be 
avoided in all patients due  to their strong inhibition of everolimus metabolism, therefore leading  to higher  
everolimus exposures. Therefore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_033].

followed by 2 mg orally every 2 hours until resolution of diarrhea). 
6.227 Management of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_474409] 
(e.g., hyperglycemia,  
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035])  Grade 1  No dose adjustment required. Initiate appropriate medical therapy and monitor. 
 Grade 2  No dose adjustment required.  
Manage with appropriate medical therapy and 
monitor.  
 Grade 3  Temporary dose interruption.  
Re-initiate everolimus at lower dose.  
Manage with appropriate medical therapy and 
monitor. 
 Grade 4  Discontinue everolimus  and treat with appropriate 
medical therapy.  
 
Treatment of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_89383]- treatment status and 
dietary habits of the patient. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 
7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia or higher (>300 mg/dl or 3.42 mmol/L 
should be treated with a 3 -hydroxy-3- methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitor 
(e.g. atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin) or appropriate triglyceride -lowering 
medication, in addition to diet. 
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (including hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceri demia) has been 
reported in patients taking everolimus.  Monitoring of blood cholesterol and triglycerides 
prior to the start of everolimus  therapy and periodically thereafter as well as 
management with appropriate medical therapy is recommended.  
Note: Con comitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is 
associated with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested 
by [CONTACT_090], markedly elevated creatin ine phosphokinase (CPK) levels and 
myoglobinuria, a cute renal failure and sometimes death. The risk versus benefit of using 
this therapy should be determined for individual patients based on their risk of 
cardiovascular complications of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
Hyperglycemia has been reported in patients taking eve rolimus. Monitoring of fasting 
serum glucose is recommended prior to the start of everolimus and periodically 
thereafter.  More frequent monitoring is recommended when everolimus is co -
administered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia. Optimal gly cemic control 
should be achieved before starting a patient on everolimus . 
 
6.228 Management of non- infectious pneumonitis ` 
Non-infectious pneumonitis is a class effect of rapamycin derivatives. Cases of non -
infectious pneumonitis (including interstitial lung disease) have also been described in 
 GOG -[ADDRESS_607892] been severe and on rare occasions, a fatal 
outcome was observed . 
• A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients 
presenting with non- specific respi[INVESTIGATOR_036], 
pleural effusion, cough or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other 
non-medicinal causes have been excluded by [CONTACT_091]. Opportunistic infections such as PJP should be ruled out in the 
differential diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis. Patients should be advised to report promptly any ne w or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  
 
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non -infectious pneumonitis and 
have few or no symptoms may continue Afinitor therapy without dose alteration. If symptoms are moderate (grade 2), consideration should be given to interruption of therapy until symptoms improve.  The use of corticosteroids may be indicated.  Afinitor 
may be reintroduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously 
administered. 
 
For cases of grade 3 non -infectious  pneumonitis, interrupt Afinitor until resolution to less 
than or equal to grade 1.  Afinitor may be re- initiated at a daily dose approximately 50% 
lower than the dose previously administered depending on the individual clinical circumstances.  If toxicity  recurs at grade 3, consider discontinuation of Afinitor.  For 
cases of grade 4 non -infectious pneumonitis, Afinitor therapy should be discontinued.  
Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve.  
For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non- infectious 
pneumonitis, prophylaxis for pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) may be considered. The two compounds studied most extensively for prophylaxis against PJP 
have been trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole, given orally, and pentamidine, given as an 
aerosol.

6.229 Management of hepatitis reactivation / flare 
Reactivation  of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer receiving 
chemotherapy (Yeo 2004 ). Sporadic cases of Hepatitis B reactivation have also been 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -30- 
seen in this setting with everolimus. Use of antivirals during anti- cancer therapy has 
been shown to reduce the risk of Hepatitis B virus reactivation and associated morbidity 
and mortality (Loomba 2008). A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history 
and risk factors must be done for all patients at screening, with testing performed prior to 
the first dose of everolimus.

 6.230 Hepatic impairment dose modifications  
• Mild hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh A) – the recommended dose is 7.5 mg daily. 
• Moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh B) – the recommended dose is 5 mg 
daily.  
• Severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh C) – not recommended. If the desired 
benefit outweighs the risk, a dose of 2.[ADDRESS_607904] not be exceeded. 
• Dose adjustments should be made if a patient’s hepatic (Child -Pugh) status changes 
during treatment. 
• Afinitor is not recommended for patients with hepatic impairment who require doses 
below 2 mg every other day or 2.5 every other day.  Everolimus exposure was 
increased in patients with mild (Child-Pugh A), moderate (Child-Pugh B), and 
severe (Child -Pugh C) hepatic impairment (see Section 5.2.3). Everolimu s is not 
recommended for use in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer, or in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors of 
gastrointestinal, lung, or pancreatic origin or advanced renal cell carcinoma with 
severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh C) unless the potential benefit outweighs the 
risk.

 GOG -[ADDRESS_607905] be instructed not to take any medications (over -the-counter or other products) 
during the protocol treatment period without prior consultation with the investigator. The 
investigator should instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications 
he/she takes after the start of study drug. All medications (other than study drug) and significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therapy and blood transfusions) taken 
within 28 days of starting study treatment through the 30-day safety follow up visit should be recorded.  
 Cytochrome P450 and P -glycoprotein inhibitors/inducers/substrates  
Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or PgP should be avoided; and  may  
cause increased everolimus concentrations. For a current table of Substrates, Inhibitors and 
Inducers please access the following website:  
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInter
actionsLabeling/ucm093664.htm  
 Everolimus is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall.  
Therefore, the following are recommended: 
• Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
ritonavir) or P -glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitor should be avoided. 
• Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole) 
or PgP inhibitors should be used with caution. If a patient requires co-administration of 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors, reduce the dose of everolimus  by 
[CONTACT_3450] 50%. . Additional dose reductions to every other day may be required to 
manage toxicities. If the inhibitor is discontinued, the everolimus dose should be 
returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor after a washout period of 2 to 3 days. 
• Grapefruit, Seville oranges and star fruit  juices  effect P450 and PgP activity. 
Concomitant use should be avoided.  
• If patients require co -administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, consider doubling the 
daily dose of everolimus (based on pharmacokinetic data), using increments of [ADDRESS_607906] 3 to 5 days (reasonable time for significant enzyme 
de-induction), before the Afinitor dose is returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer. 
• This dose adjustment of everolimus is intended to achieve similar AUC to the range 
observed without inducers. However, there are no clinical data wit h this dose adjustment 
in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the strong inducer is discontinued the 
everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong 
CYP3A4/PgP inducer. 
 
Please refer to Table [ADDRESS_607907] of relevant substrates, inducers, and inhibitors of PgP.   
 
Everolimus and drugs influencing CYP3A4 enzyme 
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and a substrate and moderate inhibitor of the multidrug efflux pump, PgP (PgP, MDR1, and ABCB1). Therefore, extent of absorption and 
subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus  may be influenced by [CONTACT_474427], inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4 and/or PgP. Concurrent treatment with strong CYP3A4 -inhibitors should be avoided. Refer to Table 6-[ADDRESS_607908] of inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and Table 6- 3 ]for a list of relevant

  7.[ADDRESS_607919] – Solid Tumors  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eisenhauer , 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
 8.[ADDRESS_607920] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_607921] scan, as >[ADDRESS_607922] x -ray, or > [ADDRESS_607923] be recorded in decimal fractions of centimeters.  
 Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area will not be considered measurable unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to 
confirm persistence at least [ADDRESS_607924] be > [ADDRESS_607925] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended t o be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal/pelvic masses (identified by [CONTACT_474428] d not CT or MRI), are 
considered as non- measurable.  
 Notes:  
Bone lesions :  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions, with identifiable soft 
tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_474429].  Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
 
Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability 
described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, and in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend 
itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the di ameters (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -40- 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be 
used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and abov e the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
 8.12 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging-based 
evaluation  is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation 
by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_607926] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the slice  thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans), but NOT lung.   
   Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at 
follow- up should be the same as was used at baseline, and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, subsequent image acquisitions should use the same type of 
scanner and follow the baseline imaging protocol as closely as possible.  If possible, 
body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques. 
 
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET-CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  PET -CT scans are not always done with oral and IV contrast.  In 
 GOG -[ADDRESS_607927] 1.1 response criteria.  
 
 FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response assessments need ad ditional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease).  New 
lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a sign 
of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], 
this is PD.  If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site 
of disease on CT, additional follow- up CT  scans are needed to determine if 
there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of P D will be the 
date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -
up corresponds to a pre-existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on 
the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
 
 Note:  A “positive” FDG -PET s can lesion means one that is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement .  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, 
it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the nex t.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_43896], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where 
recurrence following co mplete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
  
Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases, e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain. 
 
It is mandatory to obtain cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when measurable disease has met 
criteria for response or stable disease.  This confirmation is necessary to differentiate response or stable disease versus progressive disease, as an effusion may be a side effect 
of the treatment.  
 
  8.13 Response Criteria 
 
  Determination of response should take into consideration all  target (See 8.131) and non-
target lesions (See 8.132) and, if appropriate, biomarkers (See 8.133). 
 
    8.131   Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -42- 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
       
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in  the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study 
(this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diame ters while on study. 
 
    8.132  Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All 
lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal 
progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Not evaluable (NE):  When at least one non -target lesion is not evaluated at 
a particular time point.  
 
Although a clear progression of only “non- target” lesions is except ional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_36465] (or Principal Investigator). 
 
8.[ADDRESS_607928] Overall (unconfirmed) Response  
 
The best overall response is the best time point response recorded from the 
start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest sum recorded since baseline).  
The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of 
both measurement and confirmation criteria in some circumstances.

*If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent 
time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the 
disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR).  
However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small 
lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR or SD, not CR at 
the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR or SD and the best response is PR or SD.  
 
In non- randomized trials where response is part of the primary endpoint, 
confirmation of CR or PR is needed to deem either one the “best overall response.”   Responses (CR and PR) require confirmation at greater than or 
equal to 4 weeks from initial documentation.  
 For this study, the minimum criteria for SD duration is 8 weeks. 
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment or die without objective evidence of disease progression at that time 
should be reported to be o ff study treatment due to “symptomatic deterioration.”  
Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment. 
  
  8.14 Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the 
first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measur ements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
 GOG -3007

Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since date of study entry, including the baseline measurements.  
 
8.15 Progression- Free Surviva l 
 
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.

10.0 STUDY MONITORING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES  
   
Sponsor:  GOG 
10.1 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
   
 10.11 Definitions  
  
  10.111 Adverse Event (AE) :  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
  
  10.112 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR):  Adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational drug caused the adverse event 
(i.e., attribution to study drug of possible, probable, or definite).   
 
  10.113 Serious Adverse Event (SAE ):  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction 
is considered “serious” if in the view of either the Investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 
1) Death,  
2) A life -threatening adverse event,  
3) Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155190] n or existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions,  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6) Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
10.114 Unexpected Adverse Event:  An adverse event is considered “unexpected” if it 
is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed.  
 
10.12 Reporting Requirements:  All investigators and ultimately the protocol Principal 
Investigator (PI) have the primary responsibility for AE identification, documentation, grading, and assignment of attribution to the study drug.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to supply the medical documentation needed to support expedited AE 
reports in a timely manner.  Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor any 
serious adverse event, whether or not considered drug related, including those listed in the protocol or investigator brochure and must incl ude an assessment of whether there 
is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event (21 CFR 312.64(b)).  Please 
refer to Section 10.[ADDRESS_607932] (IRB) or other committees in accordance with local institutional and IRB 
policies.   
 
10.13 Crite ria for Determining Adverse Event Severity:  The descriptions and grading scales 
found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  
 
10.14 Criteria for Determining Adverse Event Causality :  The following attribution categories 
will be used in assessing the relationship between the AE and the study drug: 
   
 
  
 
 
  
10.15 Procedures for SAE Reporting :  The investigator must report to GOG any serious 
adverse event, including pregnancy, whether or not considered drug-related, within 24 
hours of any site personnel becoming aware of the event.   
 
All SAE reports (both initial and follow-up) are to be submitted using the GOG SAE 
Portal within SEDES.  Instructions for using the GOG SAE Portal can be found at (GOG username [CONTACT_474440]):   
https://gogmember.gog.org/gog/sae_portal/using%20the%20sae%20portal%20-
%20site%20user.pdf

11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS (06/25/15)  
 
Overview, Study Registration and R andomization:   This study is a single stage, open- label 
randomized phase II clinical trial.  The intent of this study is to screen regimens for activity.  The two 
regimens will be assessed separately to estimate the probability of response.  All patients o n this study 
will be registered and receive a random treatment assignment centrally at the GOG Statistical and Data 
Center.  Prior to registration, eligibility will be reviewed via Fast Fact Sheet verification.  The sequence 
of treatment assignments will b e concealed from institutions and patients until registration with 
verification of eligibility.  A procedure will be used that tends to allocate the two regimens in the ratio of 1:1 within the strata defined by 1) Patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy or any chemoradiation for treatment of endometrial cancer and 2) Patients who have never received adjuvant 
chemotherapy or chemoradiation for treatment of endometrial cancer.  Study reports will include a complete accounting of all patients registered to this protocol.  
 11.1 Data Collection:   The principal parameters to be collected, analyzed and reported to evaluate 
the activity level of these treatment regimens are:  
 
11.11  Outcome Variables: the primary outcome variable is the frequency of complete and 
partial clinical response among all eligible patients; survival time and progression -free 
survival time distributions will also be estimated.  
11.12 Tumor Characteristics: FIGO stage, recurrence status, sites and sizes/status of target and non- target lesion s, tumor grade, histological cell type and estrogen receptor status.  
11.13 Patient Characteristics: age at entry, performance status, race, and prior therapy.   
11.14  Adverse Effects:  frequency and severity of adverse effects, regardless of attribution, i n 
patients who received any amount of study drug categorized and graded according to 
CTCAE v4.0.  
11.15 Treatment:  the total dose of each study drug administered, the number of cycles of 
study therapy administered, the reason for discontinuing study thera py. 
11.16 Laboratory Testing Results :  immunohistochemical expression of estrogen receptor-
alpha, estrogen receptor -beta, progesterone receptor -A, progesterone receptor B and the 
G protein-coupled estrogen receptor, GPR-30, phosphorylated S6rp , PTEN, total and 
phosphorylated AKT, total and phosphorylated mTOR, mutational analysis for PTEN, 
PIK3CA and K -ras, and mutational analysis of K -ras in circulating tumor cells  
 
11.2 Accrual Rate:  5 per month based on accrual to GOG-0248   
 
11.3 Study Design and Sample Size:  This study will implement a single stage stratified statistical 
design. There is no planned statistical test to compare the regimens with respect to response.  
 
Hormonal agents studied by [CONTACT_474430] 11% to 33% in 
chemo -naïve patients.  Within estrogen receptor positive subgroups, response rates of hormonal 
agents studied varied from 0% to 50%.  The response rate for a standard hormonal therapy studied by [CONTACT_69142] (Protocol 81 MPA:  200 mg PO daily) is 25% ove rall.   
 
Response rates are expected to differ based on a history of previous chemotherapy (alone or in 
combination with radiation) for endometrial carcinoma.  Patients with or without a history of 
chemotherapy or chemoradiation are eligible for this study.   
 
Fifty -five percent of patients enrolled on GOG -0248 in 2010-2011 had received adjuvant 
chemotherapy.  The increasing use of adjuvant chemotherapy for endometrial carcinoma 
suggests that the proportion of patients receiving prior chemotherapy is increasing over time.  A 
simple (i.e. single) binomial distribution approximating the marginal number of responses over 
both populations may not be adequate.  Furthermore, splitting the patient population by [CONTACT_474431] t feasible due to the length of time it would take 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -52- 
to get sufficient patients in each trial.  Therefore, a conditional stratified phase II trial as 
proposed by [CONTACT_474432].  
Conditioned on the realized sample size in each stratum, the probability mass function for R 1 
can be found with: 
 
( ) ( )

j kj jnr ij r
jj i i
ij r rr in
PR r p p jr−
++= == = −= 
∑∏
 
 Where i indexes the number of im portant stratification levels under consideration and j indexes 
the stage of accrual, in this case there is only one stage.  The distribution of R
j depends on the 
probabilities of response, p i, within each stratum.  Stratum [ADDRESS_607934] never had prior chemotherapy.  A response rate of 20% or less in those 
patients who have not had previous chemotherapy and a response rate of 10% o r less in those 
patients who have received previous chemotherapy would be considered not worthy of further study.   The null hypothesis of no treatment effect is H
0: p1 = 0.10 and p 2 = 0.20.  Under the 
alternative hypothesis of H 1: p1 = 0.30 and p 2 = 0.40, the following design will limit the 
probability of type I error to 0.06 and type II to 0.10.  According to London and ChangA, the 
rejection boundary, a 1, is found with the following equation: 
 
( )11 0 |ii i PR a p p γβ < = +∆ ≈  
 where p
10 = 0.20, Δ 1 = 0.20, p 20 = 0.10, Δ 2 = 0.20, and γβ is the probability of a type II error.  
Since it is important to maintain the original design parameters for this study, a 1 is found with  
 
( )11 0 | 0.5 0.10 0.05ii i PR a p p< = +∆ ≈ × =  
 
The cumulative targeted accrual will be set at [ADDRESS_607935] of rejection boundaries that could be used to determine the worthiness of the agent to undergo further investigation, however, Table 11.1 is provided here 
to give examples of the properties of the design where α is the probability of a type I error, and 
β is the probability of a type II error:

11.4 Study Monitoring:   In general, data sheets from patients on this protocol will be reviewed 
semi -annually and will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_474433].  In some instances because of unexpectedly severe toxicit y, the 
Statistical and Data Center may elect to suspend accrual and, after consultation with the Study 
Chair and the committee responsible for monitoring the safety data for phase II trials, 
recommend early closure of a study.  
 
The frequency and severity of all toxicities will be tabulated from submitted case report forms 
and summarized for review by [CONTACT_474434] 
(SRC) in conjunction with each semi-annual Group meeting.  
 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -54- 
All reports of serious and/or unexpected adve rse events are communicated to the Study Chair, 
sponsor, and regulatory agencies as mandated in the protocol. These reports are reviewed by [CONTACT_107421] (or designated co- chair) for consideration of investigator notification, amendment, 
or immediate stu dy suspension. When immediate suspension is warranted, all participating 
institutions will then receive notification of the toxicities and reason for study suspension. Under these circumstances, accrual cannot be re- activated until the study is reviewed by  [CONTACT_474435]. However, in some instances patients currently receiving treatment may continue to receive treatment in accordance 
with protocol guidelines at the discretion of their physicians,  unless directed otherwise.   
 
11.5 Study Duration:   The anticipated duration of accrual is 17 months.  An additional 6- 18 months 
may be necessary for data maturity, laboratory and statistical analysis.  
 
11.6 Secondary Objectives:  Progression -free survival (PFS) will be estimated using the Kaplan -
Meier product limit estimator and graphed  by [CONTACT_2939] .  Median PFS will be reported with 
a 95% confidence interval  for each treatment arm .  The frequency and severity of adverse 
events will be tabulated without regard to attribution by [CONTACT_474436] 4.   
 
11.7 Translational Research Analysis:  
The expression of candidate markers will be determined by [CONTACT_474437] -quantitative methods 
for IHC evaluation of hormone receptors (estrogen receptor-alpha, estrogen receptor-beta, 
progesterone receptor -A, progesterone receptor B and the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor, 
GPR -30) and components of the mTOR signaling pathway (phosphorylated S6rp , as well as 
PTEN, total and phosphorylated AKT, phospho- ERK1/2 ). Additionally, mutational analysis, 
including PTEN, PIK3CA , KRAS, and CTNNB1  will be  performed . These data will be 
transmitted to the GOG Statistical Office, Buffalo, NY.  The levels of expression of the candidate markers measured prior to study treatment will be tabulated and described. 
Associations between markers, other baseline data and clinical outcome will be assessed in an 
exploratory manner. Methods such as logistic or proportional hazards regression will likely be 
used for these analyses when response, PFS or survival is the dependent variable when 
necessary model assumptions are appropriate.  Exploratory analyses utilizing methods 
appropriate to the type of data will be conducted to examine the associations between markers 
and between markers and clinical characteristics.

APPENDIX II - General Chemotherapy Guidelines  
 
• For [ADDRESS_607938] a new cycle of chemotherapy 
delayed up to 7 days (without this being considered to be a protocol violation) for major life events (e.g., serious illness in a family member, major holiday, vacation which is unable to be re-scheduled).  Documentation to justify this decision should be provided. 
• It will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses to be delivered within a “24-hour 
window before and after the protocol- defined date” for “Day 1” treatment of 21 or 28 day 
cycles.   If the treatment due date is a Friday, and the patient cannot be treated on that Friday, 
then the window for treatment would include the Thursday (1 day earlier than due) through the 
Monday (day [ADDRESS_607939] due). 
• For w eekly regimens, it will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses to be delivered 
within a “24-hour window,” for example; “Day 8 chemotherapy” can be delivered on Day 7, Day 8, or Day 9 and “Day 15 chemotherapy” can be given on Day 14, Day 15, or Day 16. 
• Chemotherapy doses can be “rounded” according to institutional standards without being 
considered a protocol violation ( most institutions use a rule of approximately +/- 5% of the 
calculated dose).  
Chemotherapy doses are required to be recalculated if the patient has a weight change of greater 
than or equal to 10%. Patients are permitted to have chemotherapy doses recalculated for < 10% weight changes.

[ZIP_CODE], Phone: (614) 722- 2865, FAX: (614) 722- 2897, Email: BPC [EMAIL_9111]  
 
II. Obtaining a Biopathology C enter Number  for Translational Research Specimens   
 
Only one G OG Foundation BPC # (# # # # - # # - F # # #) is assigned per patient. Note: GOG 
Foundation BPC # includes the letter “F.”  All translational research specimens and 
accompanying paperwork must be labeled with this  coded patient number. A BPC # can be 
obtained online via the Tissue Bank Portal (under Tools on the Web Menu page).  Obtain the patient ’s study ID before requesting a BPC #  from the Tissue Bank Portal. Be sure to 
indicate if the patient has a previous study ID  when registering.   
 GOG -[ADDRESS_607940] assigned more than one BPC #  to a patient 
(Email: [EMAIL_2784] ; Phone: [PHONE_3035]). 
 
III. Requesting Translational Research Specimen Kits   
 
Kits are not p rovided for this protocol. A pre -paid FedEx air bill is provided for the submission of 
whole blood. 
 
IV. Labeling Translational Research Specimens   
 
A waterproof permanent marker or printed label should be used to label each translational research specimen with: 
 BPC #  (# # # # - # # - F # # #)  Note: GOG Foundation BPC # includes the letter “F.”  
GOG protocol number (GOG-3007) specimen code (see section I)  
collection date (mm/dd/yyyy) surgical pathology accession number (tissue specimens only) block number (tissue specimens only) 
 
Note: If labeling slides, only label on the top, front portion of the slide. Do not place a label on the back of the slide or over the tissue. The label must fit on the slide and should not be wrapped around the slide or hang over the edge.  
 V. Submitting  Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin- Embedded Tissue  
 
Formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue should be the most representative of the 
specimen type (primary, metastatic, recurrent). Primary  and metastatic  tumor should be 
collected prior to all treatment. Recurrent  and persistent  tumor should be collected prior to the 
study treatment. Recurrent or persistent tumor collected from the site of primary disease should 
be labeled recurrent primary  or persistent primary , respectively. Recurrent o r persistent tumor 
collected from a site other than the site of primary disease (e.g., lymph node) should be labeled recurrent metastatic or persistent metastatic , respectively. Only one block may be submitted 
per tissue type.  
 
Every at tempt should be made to provide a FFPE block; however, if a block cannot be provided 
on a permanent basis , then 20 unstained slides (10 charged, 5µm and  10 uncharged, 10 µm) 
should be submi tted. All tissue sections should be cut sequentially from the same block.  
 The type of  specimen (block or slides) should be specified on Form TR . If submitting slides, the 
slide type, thickness, and count should also be specified.  All FFPE  tissue  should be submitted with the corresponding pathology report. 
 
VI. Submitting  Whole Blood 
 
1.  Labe l the lavender/purple top (EDTA)  collection tube(s) as described above. Multiple tubes 
may be used to collect the required amount. 
 GOG -3007 
 
 -64- 
 
2. Draw 7-10mL of blood into the labeled lavender/purple top tube(s). A minimum of 3mL is 
needed for processing. 
 3.  Immediately after collection, gently invert the tube 5- 10 times  to mix the blood and EDTA. 
   4. Whole blood specimens should be refrigerated (4°C) until the specimens can be shipped. Ship 
whole blood to the Biopathology Center the day the specimen  is collected.  If the whole blood 
absolutely cannot be shipped the day it is collected, the tube(s) should be refrigerated (4°C) until the specimen  can be shipped. 
 VII. Submitting Form TR 
 
Form TR must be submitted via SEDES for each required specimen  regardless of whether the 
specimen is submitted for research . 
 A copy of the SEDES -completed Form TR  must accompany each specimen shipped to the 
Biopathology Center (or alternate laboratory) . Handwritten forms will not be accepted. 
 Note: A copy  does not need to be s ent if the specimen is  not collected.  
 Retain a printout of the completed form for your records.

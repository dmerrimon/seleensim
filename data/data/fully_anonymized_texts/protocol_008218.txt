 1 1. BACKGROUND	 Low back pain (LBP) has for long been the world’s leading cause of years leaved with disability,1 and, considering that the overall life expectancy is rising, this pandemic only tends to get worse. Nearly everyone is affected by [CONTACT_131176] (70-80% of lifetime prevalence).2–4 As a consequence, LBP is also presented as a leading cause of work absenteeism worldwide.5–[ADDRESS_148118] in patients’ daily life,9,10 and ultimately promoting a high consumption of healthcare resources.2,8,11 In the US alone, health expenditures for adults with spi[INVESTIGATOR_131156] $[ADDRESS_148119] of $102 billion each year.12  The dim pi[INVESTIGATOR_131157], improve quality of life and decrease productivity losses.13   Current guidelines on CLBP management recommend patient education, exercise, physical therapy (PT), and behavioural therapy as the mainstay treatments for this condition.14   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_131158] (e.g. aquatic exercises, stretching, back schools, McKenzie exercise approach, yoga, tai-chi) and mode of delivery (e.g., individually designed programs, supervised home exercise, and group exercise), exercise therapy is recommended nearly transversally,14–[ADDRESS_148120] studies concluding that exercise intervention programs should include a combination of muscular strength, flexibility and aerobic fitness exercises.18–[ADDRESS_148121] follow-up has proven highly effective.21–25   This is not, however, how LBP is currently managed. Appropriate patient education and structured behavioural training are rarely provided, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_131159] a common practice,14,26 despi[INVESTIGATOR_131160]-related morbidity and mortality rates.27 Because the prevalence of CLBP is 

SH-RCT-LBP-US-[ADDRESS_148122] 4 sessions, and only 30% complete their programs.28  In this context, new ways of delivering care are much needed. Crucially, these need to: a) address the three pi[INVESTIGATOR_131161]; b) overcome barriers to access; c) ensure patients are engaged throughout the programs; d) be scalable and cost-efficient.  Thus, SWORD Health has developed a digital care program to address these needs.   2. SWORD HEALTH DIGITAL CARE PROGRAMS  SWORD Health’s Digital Care programs address the three pi[INVESTIGATOR_20789]: therapeutic exercise, patient education and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).   The exercise component is delivered through a digital feedback system - SWORD PhoenixÒ- which is an FDA-listed class I medical device. This device uses motion tracking technology to digitize motion and provide real-time biofeedback on performance during exercise execution (see more below). This allows individuals to perform independent exercise sessions at home without the need for constant face-to-face therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20790], while still being remotely monitored (asynchronously) through a cloud-based Portal.  The safety and effectiveness of digital exercise programs performed with this device, in a home-based scenario, have already been demonstrated for recovery after total knee and hip arthroplasty.29–31 In these studies, where digital programs based on this device were compared with conventional PT, the clinical outcomes were superior in the digital group. These results were explained by (a) the positive impact of a kinematic biofeedback tool on patient performance, especially regarding error correction and stimulation of a greater range of motion; (b) patient empowerment regarding their rehabilitation process; (c) high patient engagement through the use 

 3 of gamification strategies; (d) the positive effect of remote monitoring on patient effort and (e) the availability of objective data for clinical review, enabling data-driven decisions.  The educational component is  delivered through a smartphone app. Each individual is presented with educational content on their condition, in the form of small articles curated by [CONTACT_20813]’s clinical team, focusing on subjects ranging from anatomy and physiology, pain, exercise and fear avoidant behaviours.  A dedicated third-generation Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) program, which takes the form of a self-paced program consisting of written and pre-recorded audio materials, is also made available to the individual, through a secure email platform.  3. SYSTEM TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS  SWORD Phoenix® is a proprietary, 510(K) exempt, class I medical device, with CE mark, which is composed of the following three interconnected components:  § Motion trackers, placed on body segments using Velcro® straps. Each motion tracker is placed in a specific position. To assist in the correct placement of the motion trackers, both the trackers and the matching straps are color-coded. The motion trackers' setup varies according to each therapy.  § Mobile App, that comes pre-installed on a tablet, that guides the patient in each exercise session. Before each exercise, the patient is presented with a real-life video and audio explanation of that exercise. The execution interface is subsequently shown. This screen features: a) a progress bar; b) a repetition counter; c) a star counter and d) a timer displaying time left in the exercise. A correct repetition is defined as a movement starting at the baseline and reaching or surpassing the specified target, without violating movement or posture constraints. In case the patient violates a constraint, a message is prompted showing which movement error was performed, so that the patient can correct the movement in the following attempts. For each correct repetition, the patient earns from 1 to 5 stars, depending on the range 

 4 of motion of that specific movement in comparison to normative values for that movement. At the end of each session, the patient is presented with a summary of the number of completed repetitions and stars, as well as with badges rewarding him for the progresses achieved in each exercise.  § Web-based Portal that allows the clinical team to generate new patient profiles and create exercise sessions for each patient. To prescribe a session, the clinician needs to select the exercises, number of sets and number of repetitions.  When a patient performs a session, the results are uploaded to the platform and available for review. Based on this information, the clinical team can edit the parameters of each exercise according to patient performance and progress.   4. SECURITY AND DATA STORAGE  4.[ADDRESS_148123] Health’s infrastructure is hosted are maintained by [CONTACT_20814]’s SOC2 and HITRUST certifications. Security-related configurations are registered and verified periodically.

SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION  Sample size estimation calculations were performed taking into consideration the primary outcome measure – The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). In the absence of similar studies, the calculations were made considering the study by [CONTACT_131177]. (2012). This was a large study (n=160 patients), which compared two different rehabilitation protocols for CLBP and which used the same primary outcome as the present study. In this study, the standard deviation of the ODI at baseline was 17.83 points. A Minimal Clinically Important Change (MCIC) of 10 points was considered, based on the study by [CONTACT_131178].32 Considering a power of 80% and a two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_148131] a 10-point difference between the two groups.  10. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA  10.1 Inclusion Criteria a) Subjects aged between 18 and 80 years of age at enrolment b) Reporting intermittent or persistent low back pain for at least 12 weeks, and/or present at least 50% of the time in the past 6 months c) Ability to understand complex motor tasks DocuSign Envelope ID: D928341E-2E8F-4CAB-BCD7-6B63043E0B8E

CANDIDATE IDENTIFICATION AND PROCEEDINGS  Candidates will be evaluated at the outpatient musculoskeletal clinic at Emory Orthopaedic and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_117736] (Atlanta, Ga). To centralize all study-related information, a commercially available electronic data capturing (EDC) system will be used. Following the identification of a potential candidate, the investigator will enter the EDC portal and fill the screening survey. If the patient is eligible (i.e. meets inclusion criteria and does not have any exclusion criteria) the investigator will present the study and invite the patient to participate and provide consent.   12. PROCESS OF CONSENT  

 9 The study will be presented verbally to potential participants by a study investigator, in a face-to-face meeting. Adequate time will be allowed for the candidate to clarify any doubts about the study, following which the eConsent form will be sent through the EDC platform to the participant and investigator, for signature. The study consent form (Annex 1) will then be signed by [CONTACT_20821], and stored in the EDC platform.  13. ALLOCATION & BLINDING  Patients will be randomly allocated to one of two groups, using random permuted blocks of 6. After eConsent collection, the investigator will enter the EDC portal and proceed with randomisation (also built into the EDC). Following randomisation, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_20822]. Blinding of investigators and patients regarding allocation arm will not be possible, given the nature of the intervention. Analysis of study results will be performed by a statistician blinded to allocation groups.   14. INTERVENTION   14.1 Digital program  Patients in the digital intervention group will benefit from an 8-week program composed of therapeutic exercise, education and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program provided by [CONTACT_20824]. These patients will be referred to SWORD Health by [CONTACT_20825]. SWORD Health will then assign a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20795]. The physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20796].  Patients in this group will performed home-based rehabilitation sessions using SWORD Phoenix®, under remote monitoring by a PT. Participants will be provided with a tablet computer with a SWORD mobile app installed, along with two inertial motion trackers (each comprised of a gyroscope, an accelerometer and a magnetometer) to be placed on the upper and lower back, DocuSign Envelope ID: D928341E-2E8F-4CAB-BCD7-6B63043E0B8E
SH-RCT-LBP-US-01 Clinical Investigation Protocol 
 10 respectively. These trackers enable precise movement quantification, feeding the mobile app, which guides the patient through the session, providing video and audio instructions before each exercise, as well as real-time audio and video biofeedback during the exercise. On the other end, the clinical teams are allowed to remotely monitor results and prescribe/edit exercise sessions through a web-based portal.    The exercise component will follow the protocol outlined in Annex 2, which can however be adapted by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_20797]. Participants will be asked to start with three 20 min sessions per week, building gradually to three 30 min sessions per week. Participants will not be excluded from the study in case of lower adherence. Participants in this group will be considered as dropouts if they: a) choose to abandon the study; b) do not engage in any exercise session for at least fourteen consecutive days.  The educational component will be delivered automatically through a smartphone app (available for iOS and Android), and will take the form of small educational texts that will be released periodically to the participant. This component is not mandatory per protocol, but metrics on user engagement will be measured.  The CBT program will take the form of a self-paced program consisting of written and pre-recorded audio materials. An email will be sent weekly by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_131163], during the 8 weeks of the program. Each email will contain an introductory text describing the objectives for that week, as well as a link to that week’s audio session and a PDF attachment with self-guided exercises. The CBT component is not mandatory per protocol, but metrics on user engagement will be measured.    14.[ADDRESS_148132] DocuSign Envelope ID: D928341E-2E8F-4CAB-BCD7-6B63043E0B8E

 11 will be considered as dropouts if they: a) choose to abandon the study; b) miss four consecutive scheduled PT sessions.  15. ASSESSMENTS AND SPECIFIC DATA COLLECTION  Patients will be assessed at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. All questionnaires will be collected through the EDC system. These will need to be filled within 5 consecutive days. To promote compliance with this schedule, whenever the deadline is approaching, automatic email reminders will be sent to participants. Participants will be excluded from the study for protocol breach in case they don’t fill in the assessment forms.   Regarding the baseline assessment, participants will be asked to complete the survey before the start of the program. This assessment will include all the information pertaining to the primary and secondary outcomes, as well as the following information: a) date of birth b) gender c) height & weight d) body mass index e) formal education (years of schooling) f) job type g) baseline physical activity level h) previous back surgery (> 3 months ago)  i) risk factors: working status, smoking status  For the 4- and 8-week assessment, participants will be required to complete the questionnaire within a 5-day window beginning at the start of week 4 and 8. These assessments will include all the information pertaining to the primary and secondary outcomes. Physical activity will be measured only at baseline and 8 week assessment.  For participants on the digital group, engagement and usage metrics of the educational and CBT components will also be collected automatically. 

 12  Additionally, the following activity log will be collected from patient’s Electronic medical records and time stamps, as well as paper survey (or, in the case of the digital group, sent to the study coordinator via email, with the participant identified only by [CONTACT_20827]), to be entered into EDC portal by [CONTACT_2420]: 1. Face-to-face visits registry (dates, times and duration) 2. Remote sessions registry (dates, times and duration) 3. Total time spent on remote monitoring of the patient (digital group only)  When applicable, adverse events reporting will also be made through this portal and annexed to patient’s file (beginning date, resolution date (if applicable), resolution state, severity, description).  16. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  To assess differences in clinical and demographic variables of the patients allocated to the two study groups, independent samples t test or Mann–Whitney U test will be used for quantitative variables. For categorical variables, Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test will be used.  Outcome analysis will be performed using both an intention to treat analysis and a per-protocol analysis.  The overall impact of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed considering both the results at the 12-week assessment as well as change from baseline.  Differences between interventions will be evaluated using independent samples t test or Mann-Whitney U test. For non-normally distributed variables, the magnitude of the difference in the medians will be assessed using Hodges-Lehman estimator. Additionally, a repeated measures ANOVA will also be performed, with group as an independent factor and time as a within-subjects factor. When necessary, logarithmic transformation will be performed to obtain normally distributed variables. In all analysis, a significant level of 0.05 will be considered.  17.

There will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. This research study has been thoroughly reviewed by [CONTACT_131180] (“IRB”). An IRB is a group of people who perform independent review of research studies. The protocol number given by [CONTACT_20829]. If you don’t understand, ask questions. Ask all the questions you want before you decide.  Why is this research being done? The purpose of this study, which is looking to enroll about [ADDRESS_148141] of a digital program for chronic low back pain versus conventional physical therapy.  How long will I be in this research? We expect that your taking part in this research will last 8 weeks. You will be asked to fill in a reassessment questionnaire once every four weeks.  What happens to me if I agree to take part in this research? If you decide to take part in this research study, you will be assigned at random (i.e., as if tossing a coin) to one of two groups, which we have named digital or conventional. If you are assigned to the digital group, you will be receiving a kit with a tablet and sensors in the next few days. A mobile app on the tablet, together with the sensors, will be guiding you through exercise sessions according to a protocol specific for your condition. You will be assigned a Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_20805], and adapting the program accordingly.  

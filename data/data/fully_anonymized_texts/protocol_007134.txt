TABLE OF CONTENTS 
Table of Contents  ..................................................................................................................... [ADDRESS_993946] relationships between CAC scores and histologic, intracoronary ultrasonic, and 
angiographic measures of plaque burden [1]. Use of CACS has been proposed as an alternative to more expensive and 
invasive exams, such as coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to evaluate the coronary arteries. Thus, the 
CACS has the potential to be a powerful clinical tool in the workup of cardiac disease.  
While CT CACS is an effective and informative diagnostic imaging technique there are several downsides. CT is 
expen sive, it subjects the patient to large amounts of radiation, can be time consuming, and is possibly unavailable if the 
patient is too large or is unstable. An alternate approach is needed to evaluate CHD and coronary calcium.  
Chest tomosynthesis is a reaso nable alternative to CT for CAC scoring. Imaging of porcine hearts with artificial CAC has 
yielded promising results (Image 1). Gated respi[INVESTIGATOR_727723], (1), demonstrate the gating 
capabilities of our system. Chest scans of pediatric CF patients, (2), have allowed for accurate Brasfield scoring. Tomosynthesis scans have the advantage of improving upon the currently accepted imaging modality, CT, while 
simultaneously exposing the patient to 10% the dose of radiation, at 17% the  price [4]. The benefits of tomosynthesis 
suggest that it may be the superior imaging modality for CAC scoring as compared to CT.  
Tomosynthesis has already been validated as an imaging technique for breast cancer screening. It has been shown to improve cancer detection rates, decrease false positives, and decrease recall rates [2]. It also has a role in pulmonary 
nodule detection. Studies have demonstrated an improved detection rate of pulmonary nodules when compared to chest radiography, up to 3 times as m any nodules were detected [3, 4].  
The proposed research, if successfully implemented, will contribute to the development of a new method for evaluating coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) in individuals with coronary artery disease. Using the Cardiac Gat ed Stationary 
Chest Tomosynthesis (CG -SDCT) system the imaging dose for a full tomosynthesis scan is expected to be only 10% of 
that from a cardiac CT. The targeted imaging time of 25 -30 seconds is 1/[ADDRESS_993947] tomosynthesis (CG -SDCT) will be an effective imaging modality for 
calcium scoring as compared  to CT. This method will be more cost effective and expose the patient to far less radiation. 
We predict that tomosynthesis calcium scoring will result in accurate scoring and allow for a more complete patient risk assessment as compared to Framingham risk  scoring alone.  
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a novel study that will provide data on the accuracy of calcium 
scoring by [CONTACT_727726]. If successful, this information can be used to promote larger studies or perhaps warrant the 
usage of tomosynthesis as the standard imaging modality for calcium scoring.  
Aim 1: Perform the first in human cardiac gated stationary chest tomosynthesis.  
Aim 2: Perform a reader study and compare Coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) derived from CG- SDCT against 
conventional CACS.  
1.[ADDRESS_993948] tomosynthesis  (s-DCT)  system is based on the carbon nanotube (CNT) x -ray source array 
techno logy invented by [CONTACT_727727]. Instead of mechanically moving a large x -generator 
to different viewing angles for the projection images, s -DCT generates the images by [CONTACT_727728] x -ray sources inside spatially distributed CNT x -ray source array without moving the source, 
detector or the patient.  
The clinical test ready prototype device will be constructed by [CONTACT_727729]  (Paxscan 4030) with a dedicated CNT x -ray source array (XinRay Systems Inc., NC).   An external collimator is 
connected to the source array to confine the x -ray radiation only to the region of inte rests to minimize the radiation to 
the patient and the staff. A computer station (RealTime Tomography, LLC, PA) will be used for near real- time 
reconstruction and display of the images.   
1.[ADDRESS_993949] that the IRB make a determination that this study is no greater than minimal risk. This study meets all the requirements for an NSR determination including:  
• The device will not be implanted.  
• The device is not intended to support or sustain human life.  
• The device is not being used of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease.  
• The device does not present a potential  for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject  
1.4.[ADDRESS_993950]: The s -DCT scan exposes the body to radiation. The estimated 
additional radiation dose is 30.[ADDRESS_993951] for TAVR: Additional chest tomosynthesis scan (s -DCT) and CT scan

expand the field of view by 6 centimeters. This expanded view exposes patients to slightly higher radiation. The effective radiation dose that patients will receive from added length of the scan 55.5 mrem which is only 2% more than what he/she will receive from the scan without added length. For comparison, the average person in the [LOCATION_002] receives a radiation exposure of [ADDRESS_993953] ives of this study are: 
• To evaluate the practicality of using CG -SDCT in terms of image quality  and artifacts.  
• To determine the accuracy of gating, which is measured by [CONTACT_727730] 
x-ray pulses and the EKG R-wave  within a 30ms window around the x -ray pulse . 
 
[ADDRESS_993954], will be performed within four weeks of his/her clinical evaluations by [CONTACT_727731] a TAVR CT. 
There cannot be any intervening therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21882] (i.e. line placement, biopsy or excision of lesions) done in 
between the CT chest imaging and the s -DCT.  
For patients that receive a CT for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), this will require an expans ion of the 
field of view from 5cm to 15cm coverage. This group of patients will receive an additional dose of approximately [ADDRESS_993955] after the patie nt has undergone clinical decision -making  (treatment versus following), the 
results of this study will not affect patient care. Clinical calcium scoring will be performed using conventional software by  
[CONTACT_21724]. Calcific lesions in the distribution of the coronary arteries will be identified on tomosynthesis images and a total score also derived. Readers will be blinded to the calcium score from the other modality. Reader confidence in image quality will also be assessed on a 1 to 10 scale.  
 
3.2 Study Population  
The study population will be twenty (20) patients who have undergone clinical outpatient non -contrast CT of the chest 
will be asked to have a CG- SDCT within 4 weeks (+/ - 1 week) of their clinical CT, with no intervening procedure or 
therapy (i.e. biopsy, line placement, etc). Alternatively, patients scheduled to undergo a clinical CT for transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may also be included with a modified field of view.

4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Screening/Baseline Visit procedures  
The r eferring physician will apprise the potential patient of the study. If they agree to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the study te am will 
approach the patient in the treating clinic or contact [CONTACT_727732].  If the patient is interested in participation, 
he/she will be consented either then (in their treatment clinic) or when he/she arrives to have his/her s -DCT, but prior to 
any study procedures. Patients with a modified TAVR CT will be consented prior to this imaging. Review of the consent 
will take place in the privac y of an exam room. Once the patient has consented, women of child bearing potential 
(WCBP) will be given a urine pregnancy test in order to ensure that they are not pregnant. If a urine pregnancy test 
shows a result positive for pregnancy, the patient will be excluded from the study per the exclusion criteria.  
4.2 Intervention/Treatment procedures  (by [CONTACT_41995])  
Subjects  who meet eligibility criteria and who consent to the study  will undergo a Cardiac Gated stationary Chest 
Tomosynthesis (CG- SDCT) within 4 wee ks (+/ - 1 week) following their clinical CT.

Confidence Intervals (CI) to be between .215 and .823. Using Blan d-Altman analysis we hope to find a difference in the 
mean that is within a margin of 25%. We will calculate sens/spec. This will be exploratory;  we do not believe that this 
method will reveal lesions not shown by [CONTACT_434172].

our 95% co nfidence intervals will be between .[ADDRESS_993962] (UADE)  
The investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) as 
“any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects” (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
7.1.2  Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
As defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study subjects refers to any incident, 
experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, sev erity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was prev iously known or 
recognized . 
7.[ADDRESS_993963] be reported by [CONTACT_87226], as described below:  
For this device study, investigators are required to submit a report of a UADE t o the FDA, the manufacturer of 
the device and the UNC IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_993964] learns of the event (§ 812.150(a)(1)), using the MedWatch Form 3500A.   Sponsors  must immediately conduc t an evaluation of a UADE and must report the results of the evaluation to FDA, the UNC IRB, and 
participating investigators within [ADDRESS_993965] (§§ 
812.46(b), 812.150(b)(1)).  
For this device study,  we will submit a report of a UADE to the manufacturer and the IRB as soon as possible, but 
no later than [ADDRESS_993966] learn of the event.  
7.2.2  UP 
Any events that meet the criteria for “Unanticipated Problems” as defined b y UNC’s IRB must be reported by [CONTACT_727733]’s web -based reporting system.   
Any unanticipated problem that occurs during the conduct of this study and that meets at least the first two 
criteria listed in section 7.[ADDRESS_993967] be reported  to the UNC IRB using the IRB’s web -based reporting system.  
7.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
All studies will be reviewed within 7 days (time is needed to move and reconstruct the acquired images). If there are 
concerning lesions or indicator is identified, this information will be communicated to the referring surgeon or the 
patient's primary physician.  
There will not be a Data and Safety Monitoring Board for this study. There will be a non -study related medical monitor, 
Keith Smith (Vice Chair of Clinical Research, Radiology). The medical monitor will review all Adverse Events (AE) greater than grade 2 with the PI. In addition, he will do an aggregate review of all AEs annually with the PI. In addition, the medical monitor and PI [INVESTIGATOR_727725] (UP) to determine whether changes are needed to the 
study protocol or whether the study should end.  
 
[ADDRESS_993968] access to the spreadsheet.  
Patient imaging data will be coded with a study ID number . No identifying patient information (besides consent forms) 
will be used in the study. All PHI will only be stored in Epic. A linkage file with the study  ID and Medical Records # will be 
maintained in order to minimize risk and maintain confidentiality. Patient images will be de -identified prior to the reader 
study portion of this study.  
  
[ADDRESS_993969] in 
participation. The coordinator either will go to the trea ting clinic, or will call the patient at home, after he/she has been 
apprised of the study by [CONTACT_5657] /her  treating physician/nurse. 
If the patient is interested in participation, he/she will be consented either then  (in their treatment clinic) or when 
he/she arrives to have his/her s -DCT, but  prior to any study procedures. Review of the consent will take place in the 
privacy of an exam room, or when possible, a sample consent form will be sent to the patient via email prior to arriving for the scan to allow fo r ample review. Once the patient has consented, women of child bearing potential (WCBP) will be 
given a urine pregnancy test in order to ensure that they are not pregnant. If a urine pregnancy test shows a result positive for pregnancy, the patient will be  excluded from the study per the exclusion criteria because the investigators 
cannot, in good conscience, expose a fetus to unnecessary radiation exposure. If the urine pregnancy test shows that the patient is not pregnant, she may participate in the study . 
For patients that receive a CT for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), this will require an expansion of the field of view. Therefore, these patients must be consented to participate prior to receiving their clinical CT.  
 
[ADDRESS_993970] learn more, he or she will be met by [CONTACT_727734]  (a coordinator or research assistant)  to 
review the  study procedures and the consent  forms  in a private setting where questions may be  asked and answered. 
The consent forms will be signed and the subject will be given a signed copy.  The original copy will be kept and filed by 
[CONTACT_093].  
The referring physician, PI, and Co -Is will not be involved in the consent process to minimize undue influence.

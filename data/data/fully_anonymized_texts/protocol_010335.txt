Protocol name: [CONTACT_154466] 5-HTP on Body Composition, a Randomized Investigation   Protocol Version 2 Document Date: 01/03/2022  Principal Investigators: Jose Antonio PhD FNSCA FISSN CSCS and Cassandra Evans MS RD   Abstract The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of supplementing with 100 mg daily of 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) on indices of body composition in exercise-trained men and women.  Specific Aims:  Aim 1: Anthropometric measurements will be collected to determine if 5-HTP supplementation can induce changes in body composition.  Aim 2: Self-reported dietary intake will be tracked using MyFitnessPal to determine if daily 5-HTP supplementation influences eating behaviors. Aim 3:  Methods: Subjects were randomized into a treatment (100 mg 5-HTP daily; CLEANMOOD™) or a placebo (maltodextrin). Body composition was assessed pre- and post-treatment after eight weeks via a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance device (InBody® 270). Subjects were instructed to not change their training or eating habits; moreover, they were instructed to track their diet ~2-3 days per week using a mobile app (MyFitnessPal).  Hypothesis: Compared to placebo, daily supplementation with 5-HTP will result in changes in body composition.   Background 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is an amino acid and intermediate metabolite of L-tryptophan. 5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier, stimulating serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptors in the central nervous system.[1, 2] Increasing serotonin levels may lead to changes in eating behavior, such as reduced calorie intake and increased satiety.[3, 4] When consumed orally, 70% of 5-HTP is delivered to the bloodstream. Once absorbed, 5HTP supplementation increases serotonin production and other brain chemicals such as melatonin, endorphins, dopamine, and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. Supplementing with 5-HTP is linked to appetite suppression, improved sleep quality and decreased feelings of anxiety and depression. [2, 3, 5-8]  5-HTP has been posited to be an effective weight-loss aide due to its anorexigenic effects; however, little data exists and virtually all investigations have studied overweight or obese subjects. Cangiano et al. showed that 5-HTP supplementation influenced energy intake in non-insulin dependent diabetic subjects.  Subjects receiving 5-HTP consumed less energy via decreased consumption of fats and carbohydrates resulting in weight loss.[5] Another study observed the effects of a 5-HTP containing supplement on body composition in overweight females. Subjects were instructed to reduce their energy intake moderately. Following 4-weeks of 5-HTP supplementation, significant reductions in BMI, arm circumference and hip circumference were observed. Increased feelings of satiety were greater in the supplement group when compared to placebo.[8] Ioannou and Williams examined the effects of 5-HTP intake on brain activity as it relates to food sensitivity in healthy individuals.[6] Subjects were randomly assigned to a 5-HTP or vitamin C supplement group.  This investigation discovered that 5-HTP intake influences areas of the brain related to macronutrient selection and increased awareness of the body’s internal physiological needs. The vitamin C group was more responsive to high caloric and fatty foods compared to the 5-HTP group.  This study suggests that 5-HTP intake can influence macronutrient intake as well as modulate eating behaviors. Presently, there 
Protocol name: [CONTACT_154466] 5-HTP on Body Composition, a Randomized Investigation   Protocol Version 2 Document Date: 01/03/2022  Principal Investigators: Jose Antonio PhD FNSCA FISSN CSCS and Cassandra Evans MS RD   are no studies that have assessed the effects of 5-HTP in exercise-trained individuals. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of supplementing with 100 mg daily of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) on indices of body composition in exercise-trained men and women.  Study Objectives  Primary Objective To assess changed in body composition.  Secondary objective  To assess any changes in dietary intake.   Study Methods Study Design This study followed a placebo (PLA)-controlled, double-blind and parallel-group design. Study population 61 physically active, healthy, adults (>18) were volunteered for this study. Inclusion-Exclusion Criteria  Inclusion Criteria: • Healthy or free of disease • Minimum of [ADDRESS_178397] 2 days a week. Exclusion Criteria: • Physically inactive • Regularly used sleep aids of any kind • Currently taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or 5-HTP containing supplements. Discontinuation or Withdrawal from Study The reasons a subject may discontinue or be withdrawn from the study include, but are not limited to, adverse events, non-compliance or personal request to no longer participate in study. Randomization and Blinding All subjects and investigators were blinded. The supplement and placebo were in similar in capsule appearance and were packed in unmarked packaging. The research team were unaware of the subject assignments until completion of the entire study. Intervention and Placebo The dietary supplement (100 mg of 5-hydroxytryptophan; CLEANMOOD™) was provided by [CONTACT_154463]™ (Irvine, [LOCATION_004] [LOCATION_003]). CLEANMOOD is an organic 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) ingredient. The placebo consisted of maltodextrin in a capsule. Subjects were instructed to consume one capsule daily at their convenience for [ADDRESS_178398]-testing occurred between 1200 and 1700 hours.

Statistical Analysis All data is presented as the mean+SD. GraphPad (Prism 8) software was used for statistical analyses. A t-test was used to determine if statistically significant differences (p<0.05) existed between the delta scores of the treatment versus the placebo.  Summary of Study Data Demographic and Baseline The characteristics of the treatment and placebo groups were as follows (age: 5-HTP 30+10, placebo 29+11; height cm: 5-HTP 171.0+8.7, placebo 167.7+15.0; body mass kg: 72.9+13.4, placebo 69.1+11.9). Subjects in this investigation were exercise-trained (years of training: 5-HTP 14+10, placebo 16+11; hours of resistance training per week: 5-HTP 5+2, placebo 5+3; hours of aerobic training per week: 5+4, placebo 6+5).

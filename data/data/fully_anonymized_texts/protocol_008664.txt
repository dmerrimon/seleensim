Title  Safety of Donor Alloantigen Reactive Tregs (darTregs ) to Facilitate Minimization and /or Discontinuation 
of Immuno suppression in Adult Liver Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (ARTEMIS)  
Short Title  darTregs  for CNI Reduction  
Protocol Number  CTOTC -12  
ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Clinical Phase  Phase I /II 
Primary Safety 
Objective  This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single  IV dose  of the darTregs  product.  
Secondary Safety 
Objective  This study will evaluate the safety of immunosuppression (IS) 1) minimization  and 2) discontinuation 
after  one IV dose of  darTreg s. 
Primary Efficacy 
Objective  The study will evaluate the ability of a single IV dose of darTregs  to reduce baseline, standard of care 
(SOC) calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)  dosing by 75% along with discontinuation of either prednisone or 
mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), as applicable.   
Secondary Efficacy 
Objective  This study will determine whether a single IV dose of darTregs  can induce operational tolerance.  
Mechanistic Objective s We will assess the pharmacokinetic profile of darTregs  by [CONTACT_693669] -labeled Tregs 
in circulation. Potential impact of darTregs  therapy on immunological profiles will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_693670], tissue histology and gene expression in protocol and for -cause biopsies, 
and alloantibody before and after darTregs  infusion.  
Study Design  A multi -center, open -label clinical trial in adult liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693541]:  
• administration of a single IV dose of darTregs  and  
• reduction of IS dosing with possible complete IS discontinuation.   
Adult living donor liver recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693542].  Twelve to 14  weeks 
later, they will receive a single dose of darTregs  and continue IS withdrawal .    
Primary Safety 
Endpoint  The safety and tolerability of a single infusion of darTregs  administered to LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_171519]  
24 weeks after  darTregs  by [CONTACT_76725] : 
1. Occurrence of CTCAE Grade 3  or higher adverse events (AEs) attributable to the darTregs  
infusion including infusion reaction / cytokine release syndrome  
2. Occurrence of study defined Grade 3  or higher  infections  
3. Occurrence  of any malignancy, including PTLD   
Secondary Safety 
Endpoint  The trial will assess the safety of IS withdrawal in the context of darTregs  therapy by [CONTACT_693671]:  
1. Rate of composite outcome measure including refractory acute rejection, chronic rejection,  re -
transplantation, and death  
2. Incidence of biopsy proven or clinical acute rejection and/or chronic rejection 
3. Timing of biopsy proven or clinical acute rejection and/or chronic rejection 
4. Severity of biopsy proven acute rejection and/or chronic rejection

Endpoint  The efficacy of a single IV dose of darTregs  will be assessed by [CONTACT_693672] 75% and discontinue a 2nd IS drug (if applicable)  with stable liver 
tests for at least  [ADDRESS_940759] received darTregs  and are identified as operationally tolerant, defined 
by [CONTACT_693673] (assessed by [CONTACT_693674]) and histology (determined by [CONTACT_693675]) in the absence of IS for one 
year .  The frequency of tolerance will be compared to historical cohorts of adult liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693543].   
Primary Mechanistic 
Endpoints  The level and p ersistence  of deuterium -labeled darTregs  in the circulation will be determined by [CONTACT_693676] -mass spectrometry (GC -MS) testing . 
Secondary Mechanistic 
Endpoints  The overall increase of darTregs  in circulation will be assessed using the alloreactive T cell frequency 
(ATF) assay  
Exploratory 
Mechanistic Endpoints  The immunologic impact of infused darTregs  will be determined by [CONTACT_161200]:  
• Leukocyte phenotypes before and after darTregs  infusion using multi -parameter flow cytometry 
(MFC).  
• Alloantibody responses before and after darTregs  infusion during IS withdrawal.  
• Histology and multiplex immunohistochemistry of protocol and for cause biopsies    
• The composition of immune infiltrate in liver biopsies post Treg infusion and at the time of 
for-cause biopsies will be profiled using single -cell RNA+TCRseq  
Accrual Objective  Up to [ADDRESS_940760] is anticipated to be 2 years.  The total 
trial duration will be 3 years.  
• One year period to accrue nine patients eligible for both IS withdrawal and darTregs  infusion 
that will be given approximately 10 -11 weeks after initiating IS withdrawal  
• Minimum of 52 weeks  follow -up after any AR epi[INVESTIGATOR_693544]  
• For all subjects able to discontinue IS, [ADDRESS_940761] depending on his/her duration of IS withdrawal .  
Accounting for a one year enrollment period , the primary endpoint for all participants will be assessed 
approximately 1.5 years after trial initiation.

Acute Rejection , Severe  
(1997 Banff Criteria)  
(Demetris A. J., 1997)  Histopathologically, severe AR shows brisk portal inflammation that expands most of the triads 
and often extends into the periportal hepatic parenchyma, similar to moderate AR . More 
importantly, there is inflammation in and around the connective tissue sheath surrounding the 
terminal h epatic venules, which extends out into the perivenular parenchyma and is associated 
with perivenular hepatocyte necrosis. In fact, the combination of perivenular inflammation and associated necrosis is the critical lesion used to recognize severe AR . The a ssociated 
mononuclear perivenular inflammation helps to distinguish ischemia- induced perivenular 
necrosis from that seen with severe AR . In some of these cases, the accompanying bile duct 
damage is severe, with disruption of the ductular basement membrane and even partial 
destruction of the duct, recognized by [CONTACT_46917] a few biliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. This can 
quickly lead to bile duct loss, or CR .  
 It should be stressed the perivenular necrosis and inflammation of severe AR  must occur in 
combination  with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_693552] . 
Perivenular necrosis and inflammation alone can be seen with more mild forms of rejection, but these occur in association with none or mild portal inflammation and none or mild bile duct damage.  
 
In the vast majority of cases, the total score will range from 7 to 9 and the venular 
inflammation score is by [CONTACT_108] a "3".

 Mortality  and morbidity of conventional IS medications  
It is well known that conventional immunosuppression ( IS) imposes substantial mortality risk for adult liver transplant ( LT) 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693554].  The probability of death after LT has been reported to be trimodal: steepest in the first 6 
months after LT, fairly flat between 6 months and 8 years, and then rises again  (Watt KD, 2010) .  The late increase in the 
risk of death is thought to reflect the cumulative impact of IS exposure.  Examining the causes of death for LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693555].  
 
Standard IS medications suppress the immune system in a generalized, non -specific manner that leaves the transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693556].  Within the first 6 months to 1 year after LT, infection is the dominant 
cause of death ( Figure 1) (Watt KD, 2010) .  While deaths secondary to infection continues to accumulate over time after 
LT, the slope is modest and steady over the decade plus follow- up period.  However, the probability of death from hepatic 
causes (inclusive of recurrent disease) and malignancy increases steeply over tim e, representing the 1st and 2nd most 
common etiologies of death in the medium - and long- term after LT (Watt KD, 2010) , (Chandok N, 2012) , (Schoening WN, 
2013) , (Schoening WN, 2013) , (Rodriguez- Peralvarez M, 2014) .  Among the drugs that are commonly employed in current 
IS regimens, calcineurin inhibitors ( CNIs ), the pi[INVESTIGATOR_693557], are most strongly associated with a pro -
oncologic effect (Rodriguez- Peralvarez M, 2014) .   Minimization of lifetime exposure to CNIs may significantly mitigate the 
escalating risk of de novo malignancy for stable, long -term LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 
Figure 1. Cause specific probability of death after LT over time  
In addition to increasing mortality risk secondary to immunologically -mediated mechanisms of weakening host defenses  
against infection and malignancy, CNIs are also well known to predispose to and/or exacerbate non -immunologically 
mediated medical co -morbidities that threaten the longevity of adult LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. CNI exposure exerts a strong 
deleterious impact on renal function, particularly in the current climate of LT in the [LOCATION_002] where deceased donor liver allocation is based on the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score that has resulted in a steep increase in the 
proportion of LTs performed in candid ates with acute kidney injury and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD) (Sharma P S. D., 
2011)  (Sharma P G. N., 2013) .  There is substantial literature that adult LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693558] e 
development of severe chronic kidney disease ( CKD) and even end stage renal disease (ESRD) over time (Ojo AO, 
2003) (Sharma P G. N., 2013) .  Severe CKD in a LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], defined as a GFR <30 ml/min/1.73m2, has been recently 
reported to increase the risk of death exponentially (Allen AM, 2014) .  As a result, renal failure emerges as an increasingly 
common cause o f death late after LT (Watt KD, 2010)  (Allen AM, 2014) .  There is interest in CNI minimization and/or 
withdrawal as a primary strategy to reduce CNI -mediated kidney injury (F arkas SA, 2009)  (Saner FH, 2012) (Penninga L, 
2012)  (McKenna G, 2010; Trotter J, 2012) .  Although spontaneous operational tolerance may allow for IS/CNI wit hdrawal 
with reasonable success late after LT, the ability to induce tolerance with darTregs , and thereby [CONTACT_693686]/or 
completely discontinue CNIs early after LT is likely to better salvage and preserve renal function.

In addition to nephrotoxicity res ulting in CKD/ESRD that predisposes to late mortality for LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], CNIs are strongly 
associated with other potent atherosclerosis risk factors such hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (low high -density lipoproteins 
and high triglycerides), obesity, and diabet es / insulin resistance –  the primary components of the metabolic syndrome 
(Berenson, 1992) (Davis, 2001) (Nair S. S., 2002) (Shalev, 2005) (Textor SC, 2000)  (Varo E, 2002) .   These considerations a re 
particularly important because the indication for LT is anticipated to, over the [ADDRESS_940775] from 
viral hepatitis (both hepatitis B and hepatitis C) to non -alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non -alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH). The epi[INVESTIGATOR_693559] a national but also a worldwide public health 
care concern with the hepatic component manifest as NAFLD/NASH (AJ., 2011) .  The influx of candidates undergoing LT 
with metabolic disease will undoubtedly translate into a heavy burden of metabolic syndrome post -transplant  and focus 
intense attention on the negative impact of standard IS medications such as CNIs on these important medical co -
morbidities (Pagadala M, 2009)  (Watt KD, 2010)  (Oliveira CP, 2013) .  Again, there is interest in reducing lifetime CNI 
exposure to avoid precipi[INVESTIGATOR_693560], alone or in combination 
with CKD/ESRD, predispose to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
 Spontaneous / operational tolerance after LT  
 Previous experiences  with IS withdrawal for adult and pediatric LT re cipi[INVESTIGATOR_693561], several different single centers have reported their experiences with transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693562].  Transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693563], incidentally (non -adherence), or obligatorily (major 
contra indication to ongoing IS) weaned from IS.  In sum, these series suggest that approximately 19% of selected adult 
and/or pediatric LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693564]  (Mazariegos GV, 1997)  (Oike, 20 02) (Ramos, 1995)  (Takatsuki, 
2001)  (Devlin, 1998)  (Assy, 2007)  (Tisone, 2006)  (Eason JD, 2005)  (Tryphonopoulos, 2005) .  
 Recent trials of IS withdrawal for pediatric LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_693565] 20 pediatric recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693566] 4 or more years after LT 
(ITN029ST; WISP -R; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]6) identified [ADDRESS_940776] been off drug for 70.5 -91.0 months  as of 
September 30, 2014 (Table 1)  (Feng S, 2012).  Predictors of successful IS withdrawal were increased time after LT (tolerant 
versus non -toleran t subjects were 99.46±29.97 versus 69.70±13.67 months p=0.025), absent or minimal portal 
inflammation (p=0.03), and decreased C4d score (p=0.04) on screening liver biopsy were predictors of successful IS 
withdrawal.

suggest that IS withdrawal is safe and feasible. Twelve of the 20 enrollees (60%) have achieved the primary endpoint of 
one year off IS with normal graft function assessed by [CONTACT_693674]. Protocol b iopsies performed more than two years and 
again more than four years after the last dose of IS have not shown significant histological change compared with the 
screening biopsies performed more than three or five years earlier, respectively. Eight patients  failed to achieve the 
primary endpoint: one for violation of an exclusion criterion and seven for biopsy proven (n=2) or clinical (n=5) rejection. Five of the seven participants developed elevated liver tests during withdrawal, between 43 and 169 days aft er initiating 
IS withdrawal; 1 participant developed elevated liver tests after cessation of withdrawal, 333 days after initiating withdrawal. The seven participants were all treated with increased IS. Three received bolus corticosteroids (intravenous and/ or oral) plus an increase in CNI dose beyond their dose at study start (escalation). Among the 4 that were not treated 
with corticosteroids, 1 was treated with escalation of IS while 3 were treated simply with return to their IS dose (baseline)

Lastly, t here is an ongoing, large prospective multicenter trial involving 12 pediatric transplant centers in North American 
([LOCATION_002] and Canada) ( iWITH; RTB001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) that is fully enrolled.  Compared to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_693570], this trial includes both deceased and living donor LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The primary objective of the trial will be to 
determine the frequency of operational tolerance in a well- defined population of pediatric LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Preliminarily, 
based on the observed incidence of AR, the prevalence of tolerance in this trial will be very comparable to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 
in spi[INVESTIGATOR_693571].  This is harmonious with the literature that suggests minimal  
immunologic benefit of HLA matching in the liver transplant setting  (Balan V, 2008)  (Lan X, 2010)  (Yosry A, 2012) . 
 Recent trials of IS withdrawal for adult LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
A European , multi -center, adult IS withdrawal trial enrolled 102 adult deceased donor LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693572] 41 (40%) 
were operationally tolerant ( V-2005- CE512090 -O; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  (Benitez, 2013) .  Clinical parameters that differentiated 
tolerant from non -tolerant patients included increased time after transplantation (p<0.0001), increased age (p<0.0005), 
and male gender (p=0.016). Specifically, with respect to time after LT, among subjects who were 3.0-5.7 years after LT, 
only 3 of 24 (12.5%) succeeded with IS withdrawal, compared to 19 of 24 (79.2%) among subjects who were >10.6 years 
after LT  (Table 3).

Finally, a trial entitled “Gradual Withdrawal of Immune System Suppressing Drugs in Patients Receiving a Liver Transplant ” 
(AWISH/ITN030ST/ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) that enrolled adult de novo LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693573].  In total, 76 subjects attempted IS withdrawal; 5/30 
(16.7%)  subjects with HCV and 6/46 (13.0%) subjects with non -immune, non -viral liver disease were identified as tolerant  
(Table 4).   
 
Taken together, the historical experiences and the recent adult and pediatric withdrawal trials  convincingly show that 
operational tolerance indeed occurs in both adult and pediatric LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and perhaps more often in the latter (Mazariegos GV, 1997)  (Oike, 2002) (Ramos, 1995) (Takatsuki, 2001)  (Feng, 2012). AR epi[INVESTIGATOR_693574], 
highly supervised IS  withdrawal were c onsistently mild to moderate in histologic severity, almost never requiring antibody  
treatment, and resolved without  permanent allograft damage or dysfunction  (Mazariegos GV, 1997)  (Ramos, 1995)  
(Takatsuki, 2001) . Graft loss related to IS withdrawal has not been observed. Presumably, close surveillance ensures 
expeditious detection, diagnosis, and treatment of allograft rejection. The literature supports the intuition th at delayed 
diagnosis and treatment leads to the varied outcomes of rejection occurring outside of the close surveillance characteristic of IS withdrawal protocols (Neil, 2001) .  Time after LT has emerged as a consistent factor relative to the prevalence of 
operational tolerance.  Among adults 2 -6 years after LT, the prevalence of tolerance is low, approximating 13% .  
 Rationale for Accelerating Successful IS Minimization / Withdrawal  
One of the primary findings of the large, Euro pean, prospective multi -center trial of IS withdrawal for adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693575] (Benitez, 2013) (Table 3).  The success rate of IS withdrawal increased from 12.5% (3 of 24) to 38.0% (19 of 50) to 79.2% 
(19 of 24) for patients who were 3.0 -5.7, 5.7– 10.6, and >10.6 years after LT  (Table 3) .  Moreo ver, in AWISH, where de novo 
adult deceased donor LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693576] 1 -2 years after 
LT, the frequency of operational tolerance  among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22590] -immune or non -viral liver disease was 1 3.0% (6/ 46).   
Finally, WISP -R, a multi- center prospective pi[INVESTIGATOR_693577], 
increased time after transplantation was identified as significantly associated with operational  tolerance  (Feng,  2012) .  
Therefore, spontaneous operational tolerance does occur among adult and pediatric LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693578] a low frequency early after LT (<6 years).  Since the toxicities of conventional IS as delineated above (Section 1.1) are cumulative, 
LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693579]/or discontinued earlier, within the first [ADDRESS_940778] Table 4. Prevalence of tolerance among

similar approach can be rationally applied to patient undergoing IS withdrawal at a later time  point after transplantation.

with AWISH, a trial of IS withdrawal in adults starting [ADDRESS_940780] or Intervention  
 Rationale  for darTregs  Therapy  
The recent elucidation of Tregs and their importance in suppressing autoimmunity and alloimmunity has inspi[INVESTIGATOR_693581]. Emerging data suggests designing IS regimens with a “Treg- centric” approach to 
promote regulation may fav or induction of graft tolerance and improve long -term graft outcomes (Wood, 2003)  
(Bluestone, 2004)  (Walsh, 2004)  (Kang, 2007)  (Sagoo P. G., 2008)  (Waldmann, 2008)  (Long, 2009) . Unlike generalized IS 
regimens, Tregs are long -lived and function in a dominant and antigen -specific manner. Thus, therapeutic infu sion of Tregs 
has potential to induce long -term donor -specific tolerance without impeding desired immune responses to pathogens and 
tumors in transplant patients. Research in animal models has demonstrated Tregs can be used to treat many auto -
inflammatory diseases such as type [ADDRESS_940781] disease 
(GvHD) as well as organ and cell transplantation in animal models.  
 Rationale for darTregs  Dosing  
The Treg dose in protocol CTOTC -12 was selected based on three primary factors: prior human experience, estimated 
effective dose, and manufacturing capacity at the UCSF facility.  
 Dosing precedents  in humans  
Currently, there are five published reports of Treg therapy in humans, four  studies in adults for GvHD (Di lanni, 2011)  
(Trzonkowski, 2009)  (Brunstein, 201 0) (Martelli MF D. I., 2014)  and one study in children with new onset type 1 diabetes  
(Marek -Trzonkowska N., 2012) . All these studies administered polyclonal Tregs, and currently no prior experiences with 
darTregs  have been reported.  Since polyclonal Tregs are most similar to darTregs  when compared to other cellular 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is nonetheless helpful to review the do sing and safety information from these studies.  The results of these 
protocols, particularly with respect to the safety of Treg administration, are detailed in S ection 1.6.  The discussion below 
provides the rationale for selection of Treg doses for administration to human subjects participating in protocol CTOTC -
12. 
 The highest dose used in the  referenced GvHD  studies was 2 infusions of 3  x 10
6 Tregs/ kg each on da y [ADDRESS_940782] blood transplan tation. No infusion reactions or severe adverse events ( AEs) was observed with this dose. In fact, the 
investigator reported that maximal tolerated dose could not be assessed due to limitation in manufacturing capac ity 
(Brunstein, 2010) .  
 In the type 1 diabetes  pediatric  study  (Marek -Trzonkowska N., 2012) , children age 8 to 16 were given 10 x 10
6 Tregs/k g 
(n=4) or 20 x 106 Tregs/kg  (n=6) , corresponding to 700 – 1,[ADDRESS_940783] been 
infused with  5, 40, 320, and 2, 600 x 106 Tregs total dose,  corresponding to approximately 0.07, 0.6, 4.6, and 3 8 x 106 
Tregs/k g.  All [ADDRESS_940784] been  administered . As of September 2014, all 14 subjects were active 
 Confidential  Page 25 of 89 
darTregs for Tolerance in Liver Transplantation (CTOTC -12)                                                         Version 7.0/ October 15, 2018  in the study.  Cohorts 1 -4 are 3, 2.5, 1.5, and 1 year after administration , respectively.  No infusion reaction  of any grade  
was observed in any patient.  Four  serious adverse events ( SAEs) deemed unrelated to Treg infusion were reported, as of 
August 2014.  
 
Thus, based on published data and UCSF’s  clinical experien ce, infusion s of up to 2,600 x 106 (38 x 106/kg) polyclonal Tregs 
were well tolerated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Estimated  efficacy  dose for darTregs  in organ transplantation  
Results from p reclinical studies in mouse models of transplantation  in the past 30 years provide strong rationale for the 
use of Tregs to induce transplant tolerance  (Tang Q, 2013) .  In these models, a high percentage of Tregs , as many as  30-
50% of CD4+ cells,  is needed to prevent transplant rejection (Hara,  2001)  (Graca, 2002) . To achieve this high percentage  
of Tregs in a 70kg adult  human , an infusion of 4 ,500 x 106 (642 x 106 Tregs/kg) Tregs would be  needed.  This dose can be 
reduced by 80 to 90% (to 500 -1,000 x 106 total d ose) if darTregs  are used  (Lee K, 2014) .  While these estimates provide 
useful guidelines for dose selection in humans, these should not be directly applied because of the many differences 
between mouse models and human trial de sign such as the use of concurrent IS and the timing of Treg infusion.   Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
Tregs are given around the time of transplantation in mouse models without additional IS when strong activation signals and highly inflammatory conditions increase the resis tance of effector T cells to Treg -mediated suppression.  Thus, i t is 
very likely that a lower percentage/ fewer Tregs would be required to induce tolerance when IS is present to control T cell activation and when Tregs are given years after transplantation  without acute tissue injury and inflammation of the 
surgery.  
Recently , an ongoing clinical trial of Treg therapy in LT conducted in Japan has been  reported , providing valuable clues  
(Yamashita, 2013)  (Yamashita, 2014)  (Todo S, 2016) .  This trial was conducted in de novo adult , living donor LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693582] a standard triple IS regimen comprised of corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and MMF.   Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693583] ( PBMCs ) expanded with irradiated donor PBMCs in the presence of anti -CD80 and anti -CD86 
antibodies to block co -stimulation were administered 13 days after LT and 8  days after a single dose of cyclophosp hamide 
(40mg/kg).   In total, 6 10 - 2,590 x 106 expanded autolog ous PBMCs expanded in the presence of donor cells and 
containing an average of 28% Foxp3+ cells ( 31 - 466 x 106 Foxp3+ Tregs) were infused  (Table  5).  IS was withdrawn 
gradually starting 6 months after LT. As of July , 2014 (personal communication ; presentation at the World Transplant 
Congress, July 2014, San Francisco, CA; manuscript in preparation), [ADDRESS_940785] been weaned off IS for 
6-23 months with five  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693584] 12 months (13 to 23 months), Three of [ADDRESS_940786] failed IS 
withdrawal, two secondary to AR and one secondary to IS re -initiation for brachial plexus neuritis  who later developed 
AR while on IS .  The cell manufacturing  protocol has been shown to inactivate effector T cells and favor the outgrowth of 
Tregs  (Davies JK, 2009) . Similarly manufactured cells have als o been used therapeutically to control GvH D (Guinan EC, 
1999)  (Davies JK G. J., 2008) , and kidney transplant rejection in non -human primates  (Bashuda H, 2005) . 
To determine appropriate Treg dosing, the outcome relative to the dose of Foxp3+ Tregs administered was considered.  
Three patients received only 5 90 - 630 x 106 PBMCs, corresponding to 31 to 43  x 106 Foxp3+ Tregs .  Two of these three 
subjects developed AR  while [ADDRESS_940787] successf ully discontinued IS received 7 90 to 2,590  x 106 PBMCs, corresponding to 94 to 466 x 106 Foxp3+ Tregs.  
The other patient who failed IS withdra wal received 272 x 106 Foxp3+ Tregs failed IS withdrawal due initially to brachial 
plexus neuritis and later AR.  
This study suggests that Treg doses of <50 x 106 Tregs are not sufficient  to induce operational tolerance (1 success out of 
3).  However, doses between [ADDRESS_940788] some efficacy (2 successes out of 3) and doses >300 x 106 Tregs 
appear to be reliably adequate (4 successes out of 4) to support successful IS withd rawal.  
 The product used in this  Japanese  trial is enriched for donor alloantigen specificity as is the darTregs  product  we plan to 
use.  However, there are several important differences regarding the context of Treg administration  between their trial 
design and CTOTC -12.  The depletional therapy that they administered prior to Treg infusion (cyclophosphamide) is likely 
to support Treg expansion, engraftment, and function ; depletion  is perceived to lower the Treg dose needed for efficacy.  
However, they ad minister Tregs 13 days after LT, during the highly inflamed peri -transplant period to subjects who are

believe that these are compensatory differences and therefore can reasonably extrapolate their dosing regimen in this  
clinical trial.

*As of April 30, [ADDRESS_940790] to our clinical scenario of adult LT. In sum total, we estimate that the 
requisite dos e of darTregs  to facilitate IS withdrawal in stable, long -term LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693585].  We estimate that a dose of <[ADDRESS_940791] low efficacy; that a dose of 100 –  [ADDRESS_940792] moderate ef ficacy; and that a dose of >[ADDRESS_940793] high efficacy for successful IS minimization / 
discontinuation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose limitations imposed  by [CONTACT_693687] 600 x 106 darTregs  from 1 unit of blood  (450 ml) or 
500 x 106 leukapheresis products , a quantity that is approximately double the dose estimated to be effective based on the 
LT Treg trial conducte d in Japan .  On average, 6.6 x 106 (range 3 to 11.9 x 106) Tregs can b e purified from one unit of blood 
and expand ed >200 fold (range 200 to 4000)  during the 16-day ex vivo culture (Figure 2A) to produce more than 600 x 106 
Tregs (Figure 2B).  The expanded darTregs  retain their phenotypes and  are highly suppressive of donor antigen stimulated 
proliferation in vitro (Figure 2B).   
 
Taken together, we plan to infuse a targeted dose of 400 x 106 ± 100 darTregs  in this trial.  A range of +/ - 25% change from 
this targeted dose is allowed such that the range of darTregs  to be infused is [ADDRESS_940794] will be infused and the patient will be allowed to start IS 
withdrawal because a favorable probability of efficacy with this dose compared to no treatment ( Table 7 and Table 8).  
Participants receiving 100 – 300 x 106 darTregs will only be allowed to progress to the primary endpoint: 75% reduction of 
CNI dosin g along with Prednisone or MMF discontinuation (if they entered the trial on Prednisone or MMF).

 Rationale for Proposed IS Withdrawal Algorithm  
The IS withdrawal as proposed ( Section 5.1; Table 11. CNI Withdrawal Algorithm , Table 12. MMF Withdrawal Algorithm ) 
is based on recently completed or currently ongoing clinical trials for pediatric or adult liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( Table 6. 
Completed and ongoing IS withdrawal clinical trials ).  For comparison purposes, the currently proposed trial is listed as 
the last two entries: “ARTEMIS Minimization” and “ARTEMIS Complete Withdrawal”. The AWISH 
(ITN030ST/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  and the European multi -center  (Benitez, 2013)  trials which provide historical controls for the 
proposed trial are also listed.   
 Essentially all trials withdraw IS completely over approximately 9 –  12 months, reducing IS doses in 6 – 10 steps, eac h of 
4 – 8 week duration.  The European multi -center trial  (Benitez, 2013)  has a less regimented withdrawal algorithm, with 
less clearly delineated dose reduction algorithm and a “target” withdrawal timeframe of 6 –  [ADDRESS_940795] of either a significantly shorter or much longer weaning protocol on the safety or efficacy of withdrawal.  
 The currently p roposed trial seeks to enroll subjects who are “early” after liver transplantation (2 – 6 years) who have a 
low likelihood, in the absence of darTregs , of successful IS minimization or complete discontinuation.  Such subjects, when 
managed according to sta ndard of care, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_94705] a calcineurin -inhibitor (CNI) based regimen but often with an 
additional medication, either Prednisone or mycophenolate.  The other adult withdrawal trials  (de la Garza RG, 2013)  
(Benitez, 2013)  similarly allow subjects on one - or two -drug therapy to attempt withdrawal.   AWISH is unique, only 
allowing subjects on monotherapy even though withdrawal is initiated early after transplantation, between 1 –  [ADDRESS_940796] decided to withdraw both CNI and either prednisone or MMF simultaneously rather than seq uentially (Section 
5.1) to allow gradual reduction of drugs, while maintaining the overall timeframe of withdrawal at approximately one year 
(48-50 weeks).  We beli eve that gradual reduction of prednisone, from the maximal allowable entry dose of 5 mgs daily 
to none over 16 weeks (Section 5.1.2  ), is important for subjects who have been maintained on corticosteroids for as 
many as six years.  There is little precedent to suggest that there is a difference in efficacy or safety with s equential versus 
simultaneous withdrawal of two IS medications.

 Rationale for Timing of Treg Administration during IS Minimization/Withdrawal  
Protocol CTOTC -[ADDRESS_940798] -LT timeframe may still be maintained on a 2nd 
drug, subjects can enter the trial if they are similarly maintained on low to moderate dose of a 2nd IS medication.  There is 
precedent for allowing adult subjects on more than a single drug to enter IS withdrawal trial (Benitez, 2013) .

darTregs for Tolerance in Liver Transplantation (CTOTC -12)                                                         Version 7.0/ October 15, [ADDRESS_940799] imposed specific limits for 12 hour CNI trough levels to ensure that the infused darTregs  are not exposed to high 
circulating levels of CNIs.  Moreover, the darTregs  infusion will occur after a 25% reduction of the study entry CNI dose.  
Treg function depends on activation by [CONTACT_693688] T cell receptors and the antigen -presenting cells.  
High CNI doses are often used early after transplantation to block Treg activation and suppress IL -[ADDRESS_940800] that low to moderate CNI levels, as would be expected for the population enrolled in this study  
who are not recently transplanted , may be less harmful for Tregs because 1) Tregs have more active Ca++ signaling 
machinery than c onventional T cells requiring a higher CNI concentration to be blocked; 2) IL -[ADDRESS_940801] 
higher binding affinity than those expressed on conventional T cells and effectively compete when IL -2 production is 
restricted.  Therefore, the function  or persistence of the infused Tregs should not be critically impacted by [CONTACT_693689], 
moderate CNI doses subjects will be taking in this protocol (Brandt C, 2009)  (Calvo -Turrubiartes M, 2009) . Tregs also 
function by [CONTACT_693690] T cells, termed “infectious tolerance.”  This activity depends 
on antigen activation of conventional T cells and Tregs (Qin S., 1993), (Dieckmann, 2002), (Jonuleit, 2002), (Kendal, 2011) ) 
that may also be inhibited by [CONTACT_693691].  Finally, subjects may enter the trial if they are on a modest 
dose of a 2nd IS medication, either Prednisone or MMF.  At the doses typi[INVESTIGATOR_693586] [ADDRESS_940802] on Treg function or longevity  (Lim DG1, 2010) .   
 
We have deliberately selected to administer darTregs  at the end of the 2nd IS withdrawal step for several reasons.  First, 
as mentioned above, darTregs  will be infused after 25% reduction of CNI dosing.  Second, delaying darTregs  infusion will 
eliminate subjects who develop abnormal liver tests/AR very early in the IS withdrawal algorithm, perhaps those who are the fart hest from tolerance.  The 1st step  (Table 7) stipulates that the morning and evening doses be combined into a 
single dose, taken in the morning.  As such, there is no dose reduction.  The 2
nd step entails a 25% dose reduction.  In 
AWISH  (ITN030ST/ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), out of [ADDRESS_940803], administration at the end of the 2nd step will also deliver darTregs  more 
proximal to the time when immune responses are escalating, as reflected by [CONTACT_693692]  
(ITN030ST/ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).

 Rationale  for Timing  of IS Withdrawal Resumption after darTregs  Administration  
The protocol mandates that IS withdrawal be initiated soon, within [ADDRESS_940804], CNI is known to be detrimental t o darTregs  function 
and homeostasis  (Baan, 2005)  (Rudensky, 2006)  (Pascual J, 2008) .  Although CTOTC -12 patients will receive lower dose s 
of CNI s compared with typi[INVESTIGATOR_693587], further reduction in  CNI exposure will be beneficial for the infused 
Tregs.  Second, it is well established that Treg induction of transplantation tolerance depends on a process called infectiou s

darTregs for Tolerance in Liver Transplantation (CTOTC -12)                                                         Version 7.0/ October 15, 2018  tolerance  (Kendal AR, 2010) .  The infused darTregs  create a tolerogenic microenvironment in the tissue, allowing host T 
cells activated in this environment to acquire regulatory properties and thereby [CONTACT_693693].  Infectious 
toleran ce requires therapeutic Tregs and host T cells to be activated by [CONTACT_2030] T cell receptors, which is blocked by [CONTACT_497448].  
Therefore it is proposed that reduction of  CNI doses will favor development of infectious tolerance.  Third, our experience 
with the ex-vivo expanded autologous CD4+CD127lo/-CD25+ Treg s thus far show that the infused Tregs peaked in the 
circulation within two weeks of infusion and persisted at a relatively low level for at least 3 months ( data shown in UCSF 
IB).  We think it is best to reduce CNI exposure when the infused Tregs are at the highest circulating level s to maximize 
the effect of Treg therapy.   
 Clinical Experience with Treg Therapy  
There have been and continue to be multiple clinical experiences with Treg infusion in distinct settin gs that provide 
relevant information to this protocol with respect to both the safety and the efficacy of Tregs.  Tregs have been 
administered to adults and children, to patients on and off generalized IS, for wide -ranging indications including the 
prevent ion or treatment of GvHD, the stabilization and/or reversal of type I diabetes mellitus, and the induction of 
tolerance after LT  (Table 8).

treat established GvHD (Trzonkowski, 2009) .  As such, these two patients w ere also receiving IS.  The first patient had 
chronic GvHD two years after bone marrow transplantation.  After receiving 0.1 × 106/kg fluorescence -activated cell 
sorting (FACS) purified ex vivo  expanded Tregs from the donor, the symptoms subsided and the p atient was successfully 
withdrawn from IS.  The second patient had acute disease that progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_693588] a cumulative dose 
of 3 × 106/kg expanded donor Tregs.   After the initial report in 2009, the investigators continued to enroll pa tients who 
are taking conventional IS with chronic and acute GvHD for Treg therapy.  Their recent review suggests that Treg therapy 
is effective at reversing chronic GvHD and allowing patients to be weaned off IS, but ineffective at controlling acute GvHD 
(Trzonkowski P, 2013)  
 
In all of the other GvHD trials reported thus far, Tregs were given at the time of stem cell transplant to prevent the development of GvHD.  A phase I trial by [CONTACT_693695]. was reported in 2010 (Brunstein, 2010) .  Twenty -three patients 
with advanced hematologic malignanc ies were enrolled and treated with two units of umbilical cord blood as source of 
stem cells and effector T cells.  Tregs were isolated using anti- CD25 immu nomagnetic bead selection from third -party cord Table 8. Summary of Treg cell therapy in humans

using anti -CD3 and anti -CD28 conjugated beads, were infused.  The infused Tregs were detec tible in circulation for up to 
7 days.  During the one -year period after Treg infusion, the investigators observed no dose -limiting toxicities or increase 
in AEs when compared to historical controls. Incidences of severe acute GvHD were significantly reduc ed in patients who 
received Treg therapy.  For those who developed GvHD after Treg therapy, the median time to disease onset was longer.  
The investigator monitored opportunistic infections and tumor relapse rates to determine if Treg therapy led to over -IS in 
these severely immunocompromised individuals.  They reported that Treg treatment did not increase opportunistic 
infection or tumor relapse rates when compared to historical control patients who underwent the same regimen without 
Treg infusion.   
 
Anot her published GvHD prophylaxis trial enrolled 28 patients with high -risk hematological malignancies (Di lanni, 2011) . 
Patients received anti -CD25 immunomagnetic bead -enriched donor Tregs without ex vivo  expansion four days befo re 
receiving one haplo -mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplant (average 9.4 x 106 stem cells/kg) and CD19 -depleted 
donor PBMC as source of conventional T cells (Tconvs) from the same donors.  The majority of the patients received 2 × 10
6/kg Tregs with 1 × 106/kg Tconvs.  No adjunct IS was given after transplant due to the lower risk of GvHD secondary to 
the infusion of a lower dose of donor T cells.  Patients demonstrated accelerated immune reconstitution, reduced cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) reactivation, a lower incidence of tumor relapse, and less GvHD when compared to historical 
controls.   More recently, the same group published their phase II trial using a similar protocol in 43 high -risk leukemia 
patients.  The results were consistent with their previou s report that Tregs given concomitantly to stem cells and Tconv 
cells enabled infusion of higher dose of Tconv cells for the prevention of cancer relapse without increasing GvHD (Martelli 
MF D. I., 2014) .   
 Similar GvHD trials  are being conducted with non -expanded Tregs (CD4+CD25hi) (P. Hoffmann and M. Edinger in 
Regensburg, [LOCATION_013]),  Tregs grown in IL -10 and sirolimus (M. Grazia- Roncarolo, Milan), CD4+CD25+ Tregs 
immunoselected via CliniMACS (M.F. Martelli, Italy), and CD4
+CD127- Tregs sorted from a CD34+CD25+ CliniMACS selected 
population (R. Negrin, Stanford).   
 Treg  Therapy  in Type 1 Diabetes  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treg Therapy in Children with Type 1 Diabetes  
A clinical trial infusing Tregs in diabetic children has been  reported  (Marek -Trzonkowska N., 2012) .  The investigators 
administered Tregs to 10 type 1 diabetic children (aged 8 -16 years) within 2 months after diagnosis.  In total, 4 patients 
received 10 × 106 Tregs/kg, and the remaining 6 patients received 20  × 106 Tregs/kg. The preparation consisted of sorted 
autologous CD3+CD4+CD127lo/-CD25+ Tregs expanded under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions.  The children 
were not receiving IS.  For safety, the investigators monitored infusion reactions, epis ode of hyper - or hypo -glycemia 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], and infections.  No toxicity of the Treg therapy was noted. To assess the efficacy of the treatment, the 
investigators monitored percentages of circulating Tregs in patients after infusion and metabolic parameters including 
fasting C -peptide levels, HgbA1c, and daily insulin requirements.  A significant increase in Treg percentages in the 
peripheral blood was observed on the day of infusion.  These patients were followed along with matched type 1 diabetic patients no t treated with Tregs.  Half a year after type 1 diabetes onset (4 -5 months after Tregs infusion), 8 patients treated 
with Tregs still required <0.5 IU/kg of insulin daily, with 2 patients no longer requiring insulin.  In the untreated group, 6 
out of 10 re quired > 0.5 IU/kg. In addition, plasma C -peptide levels were significantly higher in the treated group as 
compared with those not treated.  The investigators concluded that the administration of Tregs was safe and tolerable in 
children with recent -onset t ype [ADDRESS_940808] beyond 6 months after treatment.  Given the promising pro file of 
the treatment, the team has reported treatment of additional children with repeated Treg  infusions  resulting in more 
sustained effects.

Stable isotope labeling has been employed to track CD4+CD127lo/ -CD25+ polyclonal Tregs in the peripheral vascular space 
in the study “A Phase 1 Safety Trial of CD4+CD127lo/ -CD25+ Polyclonal Treg Adoptive Immunotherapy for the Treatment 
of Type 1 Diabetes” conducted under IND [ZIP_CODE]  and in the study “A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_693589]4+CD127lo/ -CD25+ Polyclonal Treg 
Adoptive Immunotherapy in Renal Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (TASKp)” conducted under IND [ZIP_CODE] .  During ex vivo expansion, 
the 2H label from deuterated glucose (2H2-glucose) contained in the cell culture medium is incorporated into the 
deoxyribose moiety in replicating DNA through the de novo purine nucleotide synthesis pathway.  Following infusion of 
stable isotope -labeled Tregs, the total number of Tregs in periph eral blood can be measured by [CONTACT_693696] -
isotope enrichment in purified Tregs can be determined.  Following isolation and hydrolysis of genomic DNA, the isotopic 
enrichment of the purine deoxyribonucleosides in Tregs sorted from whole blood can be assessed by [CONTACT_116036]/mass spectrometry.  The change in 2H enrichment in the total Treg pool can be assessed at specified time 
points post -infusion.  
 
In the T1D Phase 1 study, three subjects in cohort 3 and four subjects in cohort 4 were t reated with 2H -labeled Tregs. The 
2H2 (deuterium) label was incorporated into replicating DNA such that 59.8% +/ - 1.03% (SD) of the deoxyribose in purine 
deoxyribonucleosides isolated from cellular DNA was labeled in the expanded Tregs (range 58.2% to 60.9 %). The labeled 
cells were transferred into the patients and blood samples were harvested at various time points after administration. 
Tregs sorted from purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were analyzed for deuterium enrichment of in the D NA Figure 3. As seen in Figure 8 (inset), at day 1, there was a significant percentage of deuterium label in the DNA of 
circulating Tregs in each individual. The maximal percentage of the adoptively transferred PolyTregs occurred by 7 -14 
days, after which point there was a decline in the percentage of labeled Tregs in the circulation. Thus, by ~ [ADDRESS_940809] infusion about 25% of the peak labeling in cells was still observed in the circulation. Interestingly, this percentage stabilized over the next [ADDRESS_940810] decay phase of about 19.6 days (range 4.7 to 32.5 days) and a second slow decay phase with a half -life 
of a year or more in 4 of 7 patients studied.

Three subjects (002 -015, 007 -102, and 002 -017) were treated with a single dose of 2H-labeled Tregs at a target dose of 3.2 x108 cells, 
and four subjects (002 -018, 002- 019, 007 -103, and 002- 022) were treated with a target dose of 26 x108 cells that were approximately 
60% enriched for the 2H-label . Peripheral blood was collected on days 1, 4, 7, 14, 28, 91, 182, and [ADDRESS_940811] infusion , and Tregs 
were sorted from the peripheral blood. Following isolation and hydrolysis of genomic DNA, the 2H isotopic enrichment of the purine 
deoxyribonucleosides  in Tregs sorted from whole blood was assessed by [CONTACT_48577]/ mass spect rometry. Background 
enrichment of unlabeled Tregs was ≤0.1% for each of the seven subjects .

The UCSF Diabetes Center group completed enrollment and infusion o f expanded, polyclonal Tregs in recent onset adult

also be responsible for producing Tregs for this trial.  The UCSF T1D trial include d 4 escalating dosing cohorts –  3 patients 
each at 5 x 106 and 40 x 106 Tregs and 4 patients each at 320 x 106 and 2,600 x 106 Tregs  (Bluestone JA, 2015 ) .   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety of Treg Therapy in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_940814] common SOC affected was “Infections and Infestations” followed by 
“Gastrointestinal Disorders” and “General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions.” Of 36 infections recorded, 24

Specify) and 5 were judge grade 2 in severity (CTCAE designation; Upper Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60623]). One infection, initially reported as grade [ADDRESS_940815] a new cytome galovirus (CMV) infection that 
occurred prior to treatment with Tregs.  
 Of the nine AEs judged as severe (grade 3), all were judged unlikely related or unrelated to the investigational agent. Two occurred prior to Treg infusion and were judged unrelated to  the investigational agent. Four events were hypoglycemia, 
of which three were judged unrelated and one judged unlikely related to the investigational agent. One event was syncope occurring 35 weeks after Treg infusion. One event was hyperglycemia occurrin g 10 weeks after Treg infusion. One was 
depressed level of consciousness due to inebriation.  
 Two events were life- threatening (grade 4) events of hypoglycemia in one subject occurring 59 and 62 weeks after Treg 
infusion. Grade 4 hypoglycemia is defined with a glucose < 30 mg/dL. Both of these events were judged unrelated to the 
investigational product.

 A review of laboratory parameters demonstrates a pattern of an approximately 0.5 -1 g/dL drop in hemoglobin after 
protocol -specified phlebotomy performed day - [ADDRESS_940817] an elevated LDH, which was judged to be due to a CMV infection acquired prior to Treg infusion as discussed above. This same individual had detectable CMV on days 7, 14 and 21.  CMV was undetectable by [CONTACT_4475] 28, and the infection resolved without antiviral treatment. Otherwise neither EBV nor CMV has been detected in the trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Feasibility of Multi- Site Trials  
Two of the enrolled patients in cohort 3 and one of four patients in cohort 4 were at Yale University.  Whole blood collected from Yale was shipped to UCSF for expansion.  After 14 days of expansion, the cellular products were shipped back to Yale 
for infusion .  These experiences  demonstrat e that raw materials and Treg products are sufficiently stable for overnight 
shipment to the UCSF manufacturing team and that the manufacturing facility can support multi -site studies.

will resume IS withdrawal.  Subjects will be assessed for their ability to reduce IS by 75%  while maintaining normal liver 
tests.  Subjects willing to proceed with IS withdrawal will then attempt to discontinue IS alto gether . Those able to maintain 
normal liver tests and demonstrate stable allog raft histology for one year in the complete absence of IS will be identified 
as operationally tolerant.  
 
Up to 18 subjects will be enrolled in the study to account for potential dropout prior to darTregs  infusion.  Dropout can 
occur based on screening liver biopsy findings (estimated to occur at 20 -33% frequency ; 3–5 subjects)  in Screen 1;  or IS 
withdrawal failure during the early steps of IS withdrawal (10%; 1 -2 subjects) in Scre en [ADDRESS_940820] participation is 
anticipated to be 24 months.  Therefore,  the total study duration is projected to be 42 months.

 Rationale for Study Population 
The study aims to prospectively i denti fy a cohort of stable, adult,  living donor LT  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_225663] 24 months but less 
than 84 months  after transplantation to attempt IS withdrawal.  Subjects will initiate IS withdrawal, receive a single 
infusion of darTregs , and resume IS withdrawal, to reduce IS by 75% and possibly discon tinue all IS while maintaining 
stable allograft function and stable allograft histology.   
 Rationale for Adult Living Donor LT Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693592]. First, manufacturing of the darTregs  product requires 
access to donor lymphocytes, either from the peripheral blood or from the spleen.  Consent of living donors for HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_693593] t he DR locus and, pending full eligibility assessment of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], 
70 mLs of blood  will be drawn  to make stimulated B cells (sBcs) for darTregs  manufacturing.  Second, adult to adult living 
donor LT has matured over the past [ADDRESS_940822] 
procedure.  Patients 24-84 months  after living donor LT with a good profile of liver tests and liver histology do not pose 
any contraindication to enrollment in a trial of IS withdrawal supported by [CONTACT_693701] . 
 Rationale for Adult Living Donor LT Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 2 -6 Years after  Transplantation 
The decision to enroll subjects who are 24 -84 months  after LT is informed by [CONTACT_693702].  As the primary endpoint for this trial is IS m inimization, defined as successful reduction of SOC CNI dosing by 75% 
and, if applicable, discontinuation of a 2nd IS medication, we aimed to select a population with expected low success 
rates.  Previous IS withdrawal trials in both adult and pediatric de ceased and living donor LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693594] (Feng, 2012; Benitez, 2013) . 
 Prospective IS withdrawal trials also provide data regarding failure rates for subjects who are early after LT.  Th e 
prospective European multi -center trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) allowed adult recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693595] 3 years after LT to enroll and 
withdraw IS.  In that trial, as shown in Table 3, subjects who were 3.0 -5.7 years after LT had a 12.5% (3 of 24) prevalence 
of operational tolerance. This frequency is strikingly similar to the 13% frequency (6 of 46) of tolerance observed in AWISH (ITN030ST/ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) for participants who were [ADDRESS_940823] a 12 -13% prevalence of operational tolerance.  The relatively low rate of success, as 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_693703] (ITN030ST/NCT00 135694) and the European tria l (Benitez, 2013) , suggests that a 
contemporaneous control group for this safety study is not warranted as it would expose subjects to unnecessary risk.  
 The low frequency of tolerance – complete discontinuation of IS for one y ear with stable liver tests and allograft histology 
- also reflects the low frequency of success with reducing CNI dosing by 75%.  As can be seen in  Table 7, 31 of 46 (67.4%) 
AWISH (ITN030ST/ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) subjects did not tolerate a 75% CNI dose reduction, with 2 (4.3%) failing during steps 1 
or 2 and 29 (63%.0%) subjects failing during steps [ADDRESS_940824], as presented in Section 1.2.2  , WISP -R, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_693596], identified 12 (60%) tolerant subjects and 7 (35%) non -tolerant 
subjects; one subject has an indeterminate phenotype secondary to early study discontinuation.  Currently, the iWITH trial has enrolle d 88 subjects, of whom 57 (64.8%)  were recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693597].  As of 10 /31/2014, 1 0 subjects are 
still undergoing withdrawal.  Among the 78 other subjects, 3 1 (35.2%) have experienced AR while 46 (60.5%) have 
successfully discontinued all IS medications from less than one month  to [ADDRESS_940825] observed a negligible rate of developi[INVESTIGATOR_693598]. Moreover, 
the observed rate of AR thus far strongly also strongly supports our contention that donor type –  living versus deceased – 
does not strongly impact success / failure rates of IS withdrawal.  Second, in clear contrast to kidney transplantatio n, the

(Balan V, 2008)  (Lan X, 2010)  (Yosry A, 2012 )(A Shaked, 2009) .   We hypothesize that a single infusion of darTregs  given 
towards the end of step 2 (25% CNI dose reduction) will enable subjects to reduce CNI dosing by 75% (and discontinue a 
2nd IS medication, if app licable) while maintaining stable liver tests.  
 Rationale for Inclusion of Subjects with History of HCC  
Eligibility criteria relative to hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC) in this trial has been strongly associated with low rates of 
recurrent HCC.  The requirem ent for ALL of the criteria to be satisfied results in a cohort of HCC recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693599] , particularly as subjects must be more than three years after LT .   
 Rationale for Enrollment of Liver Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693600] C virus ( HCV ) infection before and 
after LT. What is unique about HCV is that the RNA replicon is cytoplasmic and does not establish latency or incorporate 
into the cellular genome, like HIV or other viruses (HSV, VZV). Thus, patients with HCV who achieve sustained virological 
responses (SVR = virus undetectable at least 3 months after antiviral therapy) are ‘cured’ and are not at risk of recurrence 
from the initial virus. It is well known that achievement of a SVR following HCV therapy is associated with significantly 
improved long term outcomes, such as reduced rates of fibrosis progression and liver decompensation  (Morgan TR, 2010) . 
This is also true in patients who are cured of HCV with antiviral therapy following LT; they have no risk of recurrence and 
have excellent long term graft function and outcomes, similar to LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693601]  (Levitsky J, 
2013) . In the past, HCV therapy, however, included the use of interferon which was both difficult to tolerate following LT 
and was associated with rejection and immune -mediated graft dysfunction  (Levitsky J F. M.,  2012) . Fortunately, in the 
past [ADDRESS_940826] -acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have been approved to treat patients with chronic HCV infection, 
including LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], resulting in 90%+ cure rates with minimal side effects or complications (Brown RS, 2015) (Kwo PY, 
2014) . Liver transplant centers, including those in the ARTEMIS study, are actively treating recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693602] a growing population of patients achieving SVR. G iven the virus does not relapse and is effectively cured with 
therapy, there is no reason non -viremic patients with excellent histology should be excluded from cellular therapy and 
tolerance trials, such as ARTEMIS, as they represent a similar immunological risk as non -HCV non -immune patients. In 
addition, immunosuppression withdrawal can be achieved in viremic patients, as HCV expands CD8+ Tcells that are less 
responsive (e.g. “exhausted), further supporting enrollment of non -viremic patients, an even lowe r risk group, into 
withdrawal studies (Bohne F, 2014) .

 IS Withdrawal  
Participants who fulfill all eligibility criteria will withdraw IS.  Subjects may enter on CNI monotherapy or a CNI -based 
regimen with either Prednisone or MMF as a second IS medication.  Subjects on two drugs will reduce dosing of both drugs 
simultaneously.  The algorithm for dose reduction for each agent is delineated below.  
 CNI taper algorithm  
Subjects on CNI inh ibitor monotherapy with either tacrolimus or cyclosporine will change the CNI dosing according to the 
algorithm shown in Table 11.  Step [ADDRESS_940836] week of the 2nd step.  Moreover, a ±7 day window is allowed for IS reduction at each step, including Step 2.    
 Finally,  there is the option of invoking a “logistical pause” of up to 26 weeks (see Section 5.4 ) during Step 2 of the CNI 
taper algorithm in the event of manufacturing and/or patient scheduling /logistical conflicts , including manufacturing 
failure of the first darTreg lot and the requirements to manufacture a second production run .  During such a logistical 
pause, tapering of Prednisone and/or MMF will also be suspended.   
 
Subjects who attain a 75% reduction of CNI dosing will also, if applicable, have discontinu ed Prednisone or MMF (refer to 
Table 11 and Table 12 below).  They will remain at this dose for a total of [ADDRESS_940837] met the primary efficacy endpoint of the study.  Subjects will then be asked 
whether they wish to co ntinue with IS withdrawal, attempting complete discontinuation.   Only subjects who receive 300 
– [ADDRESS_940838] the option of complete IS withdrawal.       
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pause in CNI taper  
At any step, additional  monitoring at a specific dose level may be undertaken  prior to continuing withdrawal.  Unless a 
logistical pause is implemented during Step 2, intentional  “pauses” can last no longer than [ADDRESS_940839] be performed.  Unless a study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_693604] a stipulation approved 
by [CONTACT_693704]/or Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), failure to resume withdrawal will be considered a failure 
of IS withdrawal.  Aside from logistical pauses during Step 2 , the total duration of pauses during withdra wal cannot exceed 
8 weeks  during the initial IS withdrawal attempt.    
During Step 1 and Step 2 before darTregs  is administered, a pause cannot exceed 4 weeks.

tests: those obtained just prior to study entry and at the study entry screening visit.  A tolerance adjudication committee 
will convene to review cases, if warranted.  A  liver biopsy will be obtained and compared to the baseline biopsy.  Pathologic 
criteria for tolerance are defined in Table  13 below .   
Table 13.  Tolerance  Biopsy  Criteria * 
Compartment  Findings  
Portal inflammation and interface 
activity  Increased portal inflammation (in comparison with a pre -weaning biopsy sample), 
especially in association with histopathological evidence of tissue damage manifest as:  
focally worsening or more prevalent lymphocytic bile duct damage, interface hepatitis, 
fibrosis, or the appearance of definite venou s endotheliitis.  
Centrizonal/perivenular inflammation  New onset perivenular inflammation (in comparison with a pre -weaning biopsy 
sample) associated with even mild perivenular necro -inflammatory activity.  Note:  
these changes might be present in the abse nce of typi[INVESTIGATOR_693606].  
Bile duct changes  New -onset biliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_693607]/or an alternative, non -immunological explanation (e.g. biliary strictures) 
can be reasonably excluded  
Fibrosis**  Greater than 1 grade increase in fibrosis in any one compartment: (a) 
portal/periportal; (b) peri -sinusoidal; or (c) perivenular fibrosis; or new onset bridging 
fibrosis without an alternative explanation (e.g. biliary strictures) that  is reasonably 
prevalent and not readily explained by a possible sampling error.  
Arteries  Any evidence of foam cell or obliterative arteriopathy  
*Patients with underlying AIH,  PBC, or PSC are excluded (Demetris A. , 2012) . 
** Fibrosis should be graded as follows  (Venturi C, 2012) : 
Portal/periportal: 0 –  3 
Peri-sinusoidal:  0 – 3. 
Perivenular:  0 – 3. 
 Allograft Dysfunction  
Allograft dysfunction occurs when ALT is >120 U/L, alkaline phosphatase is >300 U/L, or GGT is >120 U/L.  If allograft 
dysfunction is unexplained, liver biopsy must be performed, although liver tests can be repeated once for confirmation 
prior to biopsy. At the discretion of the site principal investigator, allograft biopsy may b e triggered by [CONTACT_693707]'s baseline.  
 Acute Rejection (AR)  
Clinically indicated b iopsies will be read locally according to the Banff global assessment criteria (Demetris A. J., 1997)  to 
guide prompt clinical decision -making.  If the biopsy is non -diagnostic, other causes of liver dysfunction should be 
thoroughly considered.  Liver biopsies will then be reviewed centrally and data an alysis will be based on central pathology 
readings.  In the case of a non -diagnostic biopsy performed for either allograft dysfunction or elevated liver tests (liver 
tests above baseline but not meeting criteria for allograft dysfunction), including biopsies read as “indeterminate” AR, a clinical management decision to increase or to reinitiate IS constitutes a clinical diagnosis (as opposed to a histologic diagnosis) of AR.  
 Treatment of AR  
Treatment for AR will be determined by [CONTACT_6962].  The therapeutic regimen can be comprised of one or more 
of the following treatment options:

• Dose increase:   resumption (if completely discontinued) or dose increase  of CNI, MMF, or prednisone  
o For CNI and MMF: this terminology can only be used for the drug was part of the subject’s maintenance 
IS regimen immediately prior to study entry  
o For Prednisone:  this terminology does not include the “pulse” of steroids used to  treat acute rejection 
but can be utilized if a subject entered the trial on prednisone and returns to a maintenance IS regimen 
that includes prednisone  
• Initiation of an additional agent (s) 
o This terminology does not apply to a corticosteroid pulse (defined  below) which represents a discrete 
course of treatment and does not apply if a new IS medication is initiated to substitute for another 
medication.  
• Substitution:   substituting one IS medication for another. Examples include:  
o Tacrolimus for cyclosporine, or vice versa  
o mTOR inhibitor for prednisone, CNI, or MMF  
o MMF for prednisone  
• Antibody treatment:   administration of a course of an antibody preparation, typi[INVESTIGATOR_693608] a 
second biopsy demonstrating the absence of treatment response.   
 Resolution of AR  
ALT and alkaline phosphatase/GGT will be used to asses s whether AR has resolved. AR is considered resolved when  ALT 
and alkaline phosphatase or GGT are either ≤1.[ADDRESS_940846] or ≤1.5 baseline.  
 Chronic Rejection (CR)  
A diagnosis of CR requires abnormal total and direct bilirubin and liver histology that fulfills Banff criteria. CR will be 
treated according to center SOC.  Any participant who develops CR will be considered to have failed IS withdrawal and 
will enter follow up according to Appendix 7.  Medium Frequency Schedule after Rejection.  
 Premature Discontinuation of IS Withdrawal  
Participants who fail IS withdrawal will be followed for 52 weeks from  the date of rejection (Appendix 7.  Medium 
Frequency Schedule after Rejection).  
Subjects who require a pause beyond [ADDRESS_940847] dose change or rejection  (Appendix 7) .  Subjects 
who experience rejection will have 52 weeks of follow up as previously described.  Any further changes to IS will be determined by [CONTACT_6962].

available during the infusion in case the subject has an allergic response or an infusion reaction that can result in a cytok ine 
release syndr ome.   
 Drug Accountability   
Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) , the investigator will  maintain adequate records of the 
disposition of the darTregs  products , including the date and quantity of the  investigational product  received, to whom the 
investigational product  was dispensed (participant -by-participant accounting), and a detailed accounting of any 
investigational product  that is accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  
 
Records for receipt, storage, use, and dispositio n will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  A dispensing log will be kept current 
for each participant.  This log will contain the identification of each participant and the date and quantity of  biologic  
product dispensed.  
 All records regarding the dispositi on of the investigational product will be available for inspection.   Unused  product will 
be de-identified  and destroyed .  They may  be utilized  for laboratory studies.   
 Intervals between darTregs  infusions  
Eligible subjects  will receive a single infusion o f darTregs  at the end of the 2nd step of IS withdrawal.   darTregs  infusions 
will be staggered  between subjects .  There will be a mandatory observation interval of [ADDRESS_940850] 3 subjects to ensure that there are no acute  safety signals (Section 14.8.3  ) related to either the

 Liver biopsies  
Liver biopsies  both protocol and for cause, will be done during the trial.  For each biopsy, a 16G needle will be used and a 
total of 4cm of tissue will be required.  Therefore, two passes may be required for each liver b iopsy performed during the 
trial.  A separate consent that describes the procedure  and its risks  in detail , including the need for more than a single 
pass to obtain adequate tissue  will be signed prior to each biopsy . 
 Protocol Mandated Liver Biopsies  
Subjects will have two to three  protocol mandated liver biopsies during study participation .  All subjects will undergo a 
protocol biopsy to determine eligibility for study entry and IS withdrawal.  A second liver biopsy will be performed 6-[ADDRESS_940856] IS dose.   
 Clinically Indicated (For Cause) Biopsies  
Clinically indicated biop sies will be obtained when liver tests are elevated  at the discretion of the site principal investigator

darTregs for Tolerance in Liver Transplantation (CTOTC -12)                                                         Version 7.0/ October 15, 2018  9. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Participants  
 Risks of IS Withdrawal  
The main risks of IS withdrawal are (1) AR and/or CR (2) silent / subclinical chronic allograft injury (3) graft loss and (4)  
potential immune and non -immune complications associated with increased dosing or reinstitution of IS.  The data from 
recent pedia tric as well as adult trials provides significant reassurance that these risks are minimal when IS withdrawal is 
conducted within the context of a clinical trial under highly supervised conditions (Benitez, 2013) . In spi[INVESTIGATOR_693611], for 
completeness of consideration, we will segment AR risks into mild, moderate and severe risk categories based on severity 
as determined by [CONTACT_193741] (Demetris A. A., 2006)  (Demetris A. J., 1997)  (Demetris A. D., 2000)  and response to 
therapy.  CR will be assigned to the severe risk category.  We will also address the potential impact of AR on short and long- term  graft function and on short and long term IS exposure. Although severe A R is a defined risk, we consider it to 
be unlikely given the (1) enrollment of carefully selected subjects who have undergone screening allograft biopsy (2) intense monitoring of allograft function during IS withdrawal and (3) preliminary results from mult iple IS withdrawal trials 
in both adults and children .   
 
Mild  
IS withdrawal will trigger epi[INVESTIGATOR_693612]. AR epi[INVESTIGATOR_693613], almost never requiring treatment with potent antibodies. A llograft recovery from mild AR, diagnosed according to Banff criteria (Demetris A. A., 2006)  (Demetris 
A. J., 1997)  (Demetris A. D., 2000)  is almost always complete, occ urring without significant fibrosis, architectural distortion, 
or loss of function (Mazariegos GV, 1997)  (Ramos, 1995) (Tisone, 2006)  (Koshiba, 2007)  (Feng, 2012) .  Although treatment 
of mild AR requires increased IS dosing relative to the dose at which AR occurred, it is expected that overall IS exposure during and after the trial would be comparable (Benitez, 2013) . 
 
Moderate  
Mod erate risks associated with IS withdrawal include the risk of moderate AR, diagnosed according to Banff criteria 
(Demetris A. A., 2006)  (Demetris A. J., 1997)  (Demetris A. D., 2000) . Although it is expected that moderate AR will be 
effectively treated by [CONTACT_693711]/or dose increase, substitution, or addition of IS medications. Allograft recovery from moderate AR should be complete, occurring wit hout significant fibrosis, architectural distortion, 
or loss of function. Therefore, long -term and indefinite increased IS exposure is not anticipated.  
 A second moderate risk of IS withdrawal is related to progressive allograft changes that may occur sil ently without changes 
in liver tests. In the ITN029, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_693614], [ADDRESS_940857] IS dose.  Compared to screening biopsies, there wa s no systematic 
change in allograft histology. Moreover, in [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , a multi- center prospective trial of IS withdrawal for adult LT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], protocol biopsy [ADDRESS_940858] not exhibited any  evidence of progressive allograft 
histopa thology after AR associated with IS withdrawal.  Therefore, while the limited nature of the currently available data 
urge caution, they do not robustly support the notion that IS withdrawal is inherently associated with substantial risk for histological de terioration.  
 
Severe  
Severe risks associated with IS withdrawal include steroid unresponsive or refractory AR or CR, as defined by [CONTACT_193741] (Demetris A. A., 2006)  (Demetris A. J., 1997)  (Demetris A. D., 2000) .  In each of these scenarios, there is increased risk of 
graft loss leading to a requirement for re -transplant along with increased short - and long- term IS exposure. Consequently, 
each scenario is associated w ith increased susceptibility to infection, elevated blood pressure, renal dysfunction, and/or 
diabetes. Among adult and pediatric LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693615], severe rejection has been 
exceedingly rare.  
 Risk of Treatment for Rejection  
All transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693616] ( Section 1.1) are no greater for study 
participants. However, rejection during the trial will require treatment with one or more of the following: corticosteroids, 
 Confidential  Page 53 of 89 
darTregs for Tolerance in Liver Transplantation (CTOTC -12)                                                         Version 7.0/ October 15, 2018  increase in CNI dosing, conversion to a different IS agent, addition of a new IS medication, and/or thymoglobulin. The 
additional exposure to IS agents and possible concomitant m edications (i.e. prophylaxis for opportunistic infections) as a 
result of rejection during this trial is a risk that study participants might not otherwise have.  Moreover, although the 
subjects will have had reduced IS exposure during IS withdrawal prior to failure, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_693617]- term but may also result in increased IS exposure cumulatively and/or in 
the long- term.  
 Risks of darTregs  infusion  
Transfusion /Infusion  Reaction  
Side effects reported from previous human trials involving T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea .  
Infusion reactions are, however, usually self- limited and resolve without any permanent sequelae.  Pre- medications will 
be administ ered to mitigate the risk and severity of infusion reactions.  
 
Immune Suppression  
Tregs are known to suppress naïve T cell responses to a variety of antigens. Less is known about ongoing immune responses especially to viruses and bacteria. It is not known whether Tregs in general or darTregs  in particular will alter 
protective immunity.  
 
Infection  
As with any therapy that suppresses the immune system, there is a risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_48947]. It should be noted that on a theoretical basis, this risk is minimal, since the total input of darTregs  is far below the resident  Treg  population.   
Moreover, the darTregs  product is  manufactured to be highly enriched for Tregs with donor -specificity.  We will, however, 
take additional precautions and exclude subjects wi th detectible EBV, CMV, or HBV DNA prior to infusion.  
 
Loss of Tumor Surveillance  
T lymphocytes are one major component of tumor surveillance and it is possible that cells that inhibit T lymphocytes could impair this function. There has not been evidence o f tumors in preclinical models .  The impact of Tregs on tumor 
surveillance in the organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693618] .  Clearly,  the long term follow up of all treated patients will 
determine whether there is evidence of an increase in the frequency of tumors.   The population under study, adult LT 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693619] a generally low-risk population for malignancies, with the exception of skin 
cancer.   
 
PTLD  
Treg IS has been shown to enhance tumor growth in some small animal model systems. Thus, complicati ons such as PTLD 
are possible on a theoretical basis. Clinical experience in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693620] a primary EBV infection while immunosuppressed.  Therefore, we are excluding patients who are EBV 
naïve to minimize the risk.  We will also check EBV DNA shortly prior to planned darTregs  infusion and exclude any subjects 
with detectible EBV DNA.  
 
Rejection  
It is possible that darTregs  could have anti -allograft effect and thus precipi[INVESTIGATOR_693621]. This may  occur  secondary to 
contamination of the darTregs  product by T effector cells or secondary to instability of the regulatory phenotype such that 
darTregs  change f rom a regulatory to an effector phenotype after in vivo adoptive transfer.  These risks may be mitigated 
by [CONTACT_693712].

 Risks of Study Mandated Procedures  
 Risks of Blood Draw  
Risks of b lood draw or venipuncture are typi[INVESTIGATOR_693622].  More serious risks would 
include ecchymosis and , rarely, localized infection.  There is also the risk of anemia, particularly for the large volume  blood 
draw (450 ml s) for darTregs  manufacturing.  However, subjects are screened for study eligibility and are not expected to  
have significant baseline anemia.  
 Risks of Leukapheresis  
The common risks of leukapheresis  include bruising and discomfort at the site of needle placement, typi[INVESTIGATOR_693623].   Calcium level in blood may fall due the citrate anticoagulant  used to prevent clotting in the leukapheresis 
instrument.   Hypocalcemia can lead to perio ral or digital numbness and tingling.   Calcium replacement may be used during 
the procedure and is routinely used at the conclusion of the procedure.   Platelet count may fall due to platelet loss during 
processing.   Hemorrhagic complications due to thrombo cytopenia have not been reported in normal donors.   Thrombosis 
and bleeding could theoretically occur , although they are rarely if ever observed.   The study  population consists of 
relatively healthy  subjects with excellent liver tests and liver function .  In addition , subjects will have undergone rigorous 
assessment of general and cardiac health as part of the standard evaluation for liver transplant candidacy that is standard 
of care for both clinical sites.  As a result, subjects are expected to tolerate the procedure with a low side effect profile.  
 Risks of Liver Biopsy  
Participation in this clinical trial includes protocol biopsies and, potentially, additional for cause or clinically indicated biopsies.  
 Mild risks of a liver biopsy include local pain du ring and for a short period of time (hours or at most days) after the 
procedure that will be experienced to some degree by [CONTACT_693713].  The second AE that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_693624].  Although some bleeding likely occurs w ith every biopsy, it typi[INVESTIGATOR_693625]; the only sign might be a small decrement in hemoglobin / hematocrit.  More serious bleeding after a liver biopsy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_693626] a significant drop in the hemoglobin / hematocrit that does not cause any symptoms.  The risk of requiring a transfusion secondary to excessive bleeding is 0.5 to 1% (Rockey, 2009) .  Even rarer would be 
symptomatic hemorrhage and/or the requirement for operative or other procedur al intervention to stop bleeding.   
 
Another potential complication of liver biopsy is a cholangitis, a clinical syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_411], abdominal pain, 
and abnormal liver tests.  The etiology of cholangitis occurring after liver biopsy is occult biliary stricture, a known l ong-
term complication after LT (Porrett PM, 2009) .  Biliary stasis resulting from biliary stricture can lead to bacterial 
colonization of the biliary tree.  Liver biopsy may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_693627]/or bacteremia producing the signs and symptoms delineated above. Treatment of cholangitis typi[INVESTIGATOR_693628] -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693629].  While diagnostic procedures including radiographic imaging are often undertaken, inter vention is typi[INVESTIGATOR_693630].    
 Other potentially serious risks associated with liver biopsy include pneumothorax or colonic perforation.  If either were to 
occur, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693631].  Finally, there is a very small risk  
of death after liver bio psy, estimated at 0.1 to 0.01 % (Rockey, 2009) . 
 Potential Benefits of darTregs  Infusion to Facilitate IS Minimization and/or Complete Withdrawal  
There might be no direct benefit to study participants undergoing IS withdrawal and/or receiving darTregs  infusion.  
 Autologous, ex vivo expanded darTregs  are administered  to a population of adult LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 2 -6 years after LT in an 
effort to facilitate IS minimization and induce tolerance earlier after transplantation.  It is anticipated that successful I S 
minimization and/or withdrawal may offer benefits by [CONTACT_693714][INVESTIGATOR_840].

If auto logous darTregs  demonstrate efficacy, allowing subjects [ADDRESS_940859] b een extensively described in the literature and summarized in Section 1.1.  
 
Although successful CNI dose reduction of 75% with discontinuation of a 2nd IS agent o r complete IS discontinuation of IS 
would likely offer the greatest benefit, attempted but failed withdrawal can provide valuable information as to the subject’s required IS dosing to prevent AR.  For example, if AR occurs late in the withdrawal algorithm,  when a subject is 
taking 14.3% (Step 6) or less, then the subject’s ultimate and long -term maintenance regimen, after treatment of AR and 
stabilization, may well be less than the dose at study entry.  As result, participation in this clinical trial may re duce the

Participants will be identified by [CONTACT_693715][INVESTIGATOR_693635] ( Section 4.2).  The potential participant will sign an informed consent form 
before undergoing any  screening or study procedures.  The LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693636] a buccal swab for HLA

importantly, the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_693639] [ADDRESS_940861] begin within 8 weeks of the screening biopsy.     
 Assessments during  IS Withdrawal  (High Frequency Schedule s) 
Participants undergoing withdrawal, both prior to and after darTregs  infusion will be assessed with liver tests (ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase, GGT, and total and direct bilirubin) once ev ery two weeks during withdrawal and for 12 weeks  after  
achieving 75% CNI reduction and, finally, for 12 weeks after successful complete withdrawal, as applicable ( Appendix 2.  
Study Entry and IS Withdrawal (High Freque ncy); Appendix 3.  Logistical Pause in Step 2 SOE , Appendix 4.  darTregs Infusion 
SOEAppendix 5.  IS Withdrawal after darTregs Infusion to Step 5/75% CNI Reduction (High Frequency)  or Appendix 6.  
Complete Immunosuppression Withdrawal  (High Frequency) ). During high frequency follow up , telephone consultations 
will collect medical history, concomitant medications, and AEs between transplant center visits. Transplant center visits 
with  phlebotomy for mechanistic studies will be requ ired every [ADDRESS_940862] leukapheresis or 450  mls of blood  drawn  for darTregs  manufacturing approximately 3 -5 weeks into 
the 2
nd step of CNI withdrawal.  Blood will be immediately processed to isolate circulating Tregs and placed into culture 
for darTregs  manufacturing.    If a logistical pause is used, blood draw or leukapheresis will be repeated (see Appendix 3).  
 The visit schedule  will com mence ev ery two weeks from the start of IS withdrawal (Appendix 2.  Study Entry and IS 
Withdrawal (High Frequency)  but will be interrupted by [CONTACT_693716].  The high frequency visit schedule will

withdrawal can resume as early as the next day, and no later than 14 days after darTregs  infusion.  The final determination 
regarding the resumption of IS withdrawal after darTregs  infusion should always be the clinical judgment of th e site 
principal investigator.  
 
Eligible subjects will be instructed on how to reduce their IS prior to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_693640].   
Subjects will be asked to return to the transpla nt center for a protocol biopsy 6 -10 days after darTregs  infusion  (Appendix 
3.  Logistical Pause in Step 2 SOE , Appendix 4.  darTregs Infusion SOE ).  
 Subjects with elevated liver tests after darTregs  infusion are ineligible to continue IS withdrawal until further eval uation .  
No changes in IS, including Prednisone or MMF, if applicable, should be made until liver tes ts are rechecked OR the 
protocol liver biopsy performed [ADDRESS_940866].  If liver tests 
improve and meet eligibility criteria OR liver biopsy does not show rejection, IS withdrawal can resume.   
 
All participants who receive darTregs  will be followed for a minimum of 52  weeks after the infusion.  The time on high or 
medium frequency assessment schedules will depend on whether IS withdrawal is continued (Step 6 -8) and the duration 
of IS withdrawal  (Appendix 5.  IS Withdrawal after darTregs Infusion to Step 5/75% CNI Reduction (High Frequency)  and 
Appendix 6.  Complete Immunosuppression Withdrawal  (High Frequency) ). All subjects, irrespective of outcome, will 
continue to follow -up with their transplant center according to center SOC indefinitely.      
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adjudication of Discrepant Pathology Readings for the Post -darTreg infusion (Day 7) Biopsy  
As described previously (Section 5.5), the local patho logy reading will guide clinical decision making.  However, discrepant 
reads where the central pathologist finds rejection on the day [ADDRESS_940867] 
entering the medium frequency schedule .  Reasons for leaving high frequency and entering medium frequency include 
failing IS withdrawal secondary to AR (biopsy -proven or clinical AR), elevated liver tests without diagnosis of AR, ineligibility 
to proceed with IS withdrawal after darTregs  infusion , or prolonged duration of pauses during IS withdrawal.  Subjects 
who fail IS withdrawal (with or without receiving darTregs) will utilize the medium frequency follow up schedule.  These subjects will enter the medium frequency schedule  four weeks after failing IS withdrawal and  continue on the schedule 
for 52 weeks.  A transplant center visit is required at the end of medium frequency follow -up and marks the end of study 
participation.   
 Subjects will also enter medium frequency after completing the requi site high frequency schedule required after 
successful  75% CNI dose reduction or successful discontinuation of IS altogether .  Subjects will continue with medium 
frequency visits (every 4 weeks) until [ADDRESS_940868] dose of IS, whichever is 
longer .  The visit at the end of medium frequency follow  up will be at the transplant center and marks the end of study 
participation.  For subjects who are completely off IS, a biopsy will be performed to adjudicate tolerance .

 Unscheduled Visits  
Additional visits for a liver biopsy will occur when there is  allograft dysfunction or at the discretion of the site investigator 
(Section 5.5 and 8.3.2  ) .  In addition to research specimens, l ocal pathology results generated with unscheduled visits will 
be collected for the study .

We plan  to label darTregs  with deuterium by [CONTACT_693717] 
2H label in the culture medium duri ng the entirety of the 
expansion phase in vitro  (day 0 to day 16 ) prior to infusion in the patient.  Based on data from in vitro  labeling studies, we 
expect the cells to be ~60% enrich ment  for 2H.  After infusion  of the deuterium -labelled investigational pr oduct , PBMC s 
will be isolated and cryopreserved  at time points stipulated  in the SOE .  Tregs will be sorted from the thawed PBMCs in 
batches and genomic DNA will be prepared from these samples for gas chromatography -mass spectrometry  analysis of 2H 
enrichment  as shown in Figure 2.  In addition, genomic DNA from subsets of peripheral blood CD4+ Tconv will be analyzed 
to determine if infused Tregs lose Treg marke rs after infusion.    Based on prior studies, we expect sensitivities in the range 
of 0.05 to 0.10% enrichment (which refers to the fraction of labeled molecules)  (Busch, 2007) (Macallan, 1998) .  Peripheral 
blood results from this analysis will be presented as number of infused darTregs  per ml of blood and % of darTregs  among 
all Tregs in circulation.   
 Treg TruCount Analysis  
Samples collected for this assay will be used directly for analysis without  cryopreservation.  B lood will be aliquoted into a 
TruCount tube, stained with fluorochrome -conjugated antibodies to CD4, CD45, CD25 and CD127, and analyzed on a flow 
cytometer to enumerate the numbers of Tregs.  This assay would allow us to obtain the abs olute Treg counts in one 
microliter of blood and establish the counts at baseline; and later determine if counts are altered by [CONTACT_693718].  
 MFC  Panels  
The MFC analysis is focused on defining leukocyte subsets, T cell activation/exhaustion status, and  CD4+ and CD8+ Treg 
frequencies.   Extensively validated MFC panels will be used to quantify changes in leukocyte populations in blood ( Table 
15) collected prior to dur ing and after IS withdrawal .  Blood will be collected at time points specified on the SOE.  The 
blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory for processing into PBMC and then cryopreserved.  Absolute counts 
of each cell subsets, percentages and pe rcent changed over baseline will be calculated. Changes in the values will be 
correlated with the level of IS, stage of IS withdrawal, Treg therapy, and the final outcome of IS withdrawal.

 Donor Specific Assays  
 Frequency of donor -reactive T cells  
We will use the assay described in Figure 6to determine the frequency of do nor-reactive CD4+ Tconvs, CD8+ T cells, and 
Tregs at time points indicated in the SOE. We expect to see an increase in darTregs shortly after infusion.  
 
Figure 6. Assay for measuring frequency of donor -reactive T cells  
 In vitro suppression 
We will assess suppression by [CONTACT_693719]. Pre - infusion PBMCs will 
be used as responders mixed with Tregs from various time points. Tregs will be sorted from frozen PBMCs based on the 
cell s urface phenotype of CD4+CD127lo/ -CD25+.  The cultures will be stimulated with irradiated donor PBMC to assess 
donor -specific suppression and with anti -CD3 and anti -CD28 to assess nonspecific suppression.  
 Alloantibodies  
HLA antibodies in general and DSAs  in specific have not been strongly implicated as a common risk factor for AR, CR, or 
graft loss in LT (Kaneku H. , 2010) . Nevertheless, their presence at baseline may preclude successful IS withdrawal. 
Moreover, increasing brea dth and/or strength of DSAs  during IS withdrawal is evidence  of an anti-donor immune 
response. The presence and strength of HLA antibodies/ DSA at baseline and longitudinally, will also be analyzed for 
correlations with histological findings ( C4d and MHC cl ass II staining patterns and intensities on protocol and indication 
liver biopsies ) (Feng, 2012) .  Finally, we will also plan to characterize the IgG subclass and the C1q activity of DSAs as these 
additional parameters are increasingly correlated to the fu nctional importance of DSA in  liver and/or kidney 
transplantation (Gao ZH, 2004)  (Lobashevsky A, 2010)  (Kaneku H, 2012)  (Sutherland SM, 2012)  (Freitas MC, 2013)  (Loupy

 Single Cell RNA+TCRseq of Infiltrates  
Phenotype and specificity of graft –infiltrating T cells may provide important clues to their long -term impact on graft 
outcomes and the e ffect of the novel study regimen.  While cells from biopsy offers most biologically relevant data 
obtained from the target tissue, the challenge in analyzing graft -infiltrating immune cells is their low number. With single 
cell RNAseq combined with TCRseq,  rich mechanistic data can be generated with limited samples.  Figure [ADDRESS_940874] CD4 and CD8 T cells, CD3 -NKG7+ NK cells, B cells, monocytes , and dendritic cells in kidney 
biopsies. From patients undergoing subclinical inflammation.  In addition, close to 2000 T cells with paired TCR were identified ( Figure 7B) and global gene expression profile of the expanded top clones can be obtained ( Figure 7C).  In the 
examples shown, the top clones in the first biopsy are CD8 c ytotoxic cells (clone1, highly expressed XCL2, GZMB, and GNLY) 
and effector cytokine producing cells (clone 2 and 3 highly express HSPA1B, LTB, IL -7R, and MTE), whereas the #1 top 
clone  in second biopsy are likely regulatory T cells that highly expressed IL10, CTLA -4, LAG3, PDCD1, HAVCR2 and low 
expression of all granzymes and top clones 2 and 3 are cytotoxic memory cells with higher expression of granzymes, GNLY, 
LTB, and CCL5.  Thus, single -cell RNA+TCRseq from biopsy is feasible and provides high dimens ion data for dissecting graft 
infiltrating immune cells.  In addition, tracking the infiltrating T cell clones using single cell TCRseq also digitizes the TCR 
so that the sequence may be used in follow -up analysis for specificities of the TCR if needed.   To do this, paired TCRab 
chains can be expressed in reporter cell lines to test donor or common pathogen specificity using assay established in Tang lab (Spence, 2018).

 Participant Completion 
After study completion, all subjects , whether or not on IS, will revert to SOC follow -up at the site investigator's transplant 
center .   
 Study  Completion  
Subjects who do not initiate IS withdrawal will discontinue study participation  without further study follow  up.  Subjects 
who fail IS withdrawal, whether  prior to or after receiving darTregs , will be followed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_940876] IS dose and, at the end of that follo w-up, will be assessed for tolerance (blood and 
biopsy) .   
 Participant Withdrawal Criteria  
Participants may be prematurely terminated from the study without any further follow -up for the following reasons:  
1. The participant elects to withdraw consent from all future study activities, including follow -up 
2. The participant is “lost to follow -up” (i.e., no further follow -up is possible because attempts to reestablish contact 
[CONTACT_73880])   
3. The participant dies  
4. If a participant prematurely terminates from the study because of graft loss or because of non -compliance with 
follow -up and/or study procedures   
5. If the principal investigator, site investigator, and/or medical monitor (MM) believe  study intervention  is no longer 
in the best interest of the participant.  
If a subject prematurely terminates from the trial, the subject’s IS regimen will be determined by [CONTACT_693722] e best interest of the subject.  
 Participant Replacement  
Any subject who r eceive s less than  100 x 106 darTregs  will be replaced.

standards set forth in the National Cancer Institute (NCI)  CTCAE, V ersion 4.0: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html . 
 Definitions  
 Adverse Event s (AEs)  
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or 
not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research (modified from the definition of AE s in the 1996 
International Confe rence on Harmonization E -6 Guideline s for Good Clinical Practice) (from OHRP "Guidance on Reviewing 
and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Other s and AE s (1/15/07)"  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q2  )  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is a ny AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational agent (Section 
6) caused the AE . For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug (i.e. darTregs ) and the AE . A susp ected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a drug (21 CFR 312.32(a)).  
 
Suspected adverse reactions associated with IS withdrawal, blood draw, or liver biopsy are collected  and reported to the 
sponsor.  The sponsor will relay any suspected adverse reactions to the DSMB, as appropriate.  
 Unexpected AEs  
For events assessed in association with the investigational agent  (darTregs ), an AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered  “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator’s brochure  or is not listed at the specificity, severity or rate 
of occurrence that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information describe d in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the study protocol .  
 “Unexpected” also refers to AE s or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator’s brochure  as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharm acological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation  (darTregs ) (21 CFR 312.32(a) . 
 
For events assessed in association with IS withdrawal or liver biopsy, an AE or suspected adverse  reaction is considered 
“unexpected” if it is not listed in the protocol or is not listed at the specificity, severity or rate of occurrence that has  been 
observed.  
 Serious Adverse Event s 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in t he view of either the investigator or Sponsor,  it results 
in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32(a)):  
1. Death.  
2. A life -threatening event: An AE  or suspected adverse reaction  is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or DAIT/NIAID , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
6. Important medical events that might  not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon medical judgment, they might  jeopardize the subject and might  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above . 
The events of interest below should be reported as a serious adverse event (within 24 hours of awareness) even if the 
event does not meet serious criteria:   
• Biopsy Proven or Clinical (Treated) AR  
• CR 
• Infusion Reactions CTCAE grade 2  or higher  
• Malignancy , PTLD  
• Infections study defined grade 3 or higher  
 
 Grading and Attribution of Adverse Events  
 Grading Criteria  
The study site will grade the severity of AE s experienced by [CONTACT_693723]’s CTCAE  – Version 4.0  for all AEs.  This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) 
provides a common language to describe levels of severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical 
significance of all AE s. The NCI -CTCAE has been reviewed by [CONTACT_693724] .  
 
AEs will be graded on a scale from 1 to 5 according to the follo wing standards in the NCI -CTCAE manua l: 
• Grade 1 = mild AE . 
• Grade 2 = moderate AE . 
• Grade 3 = severe and undesirable AE . 
• Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling AE. 
• Grade 5 = death.  
 For any AE of Infection, the following grading system will be used for study participants:  
• Grade 1 =  asymptomat ic; clinical or diagnostic observation only; intervention with oral antibiotic, antifungal, 
or antiviral agent  only; no invasive intervention required  
• Grade 2 =  symptomatic; intervention with intravenous antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral agent; invasiv e 
intervention may be required  
• Grade 3 =  any infection associated with hemodynamic compromise requiring pressors; any infection 
necessitating ICU level of care; any infection necessitating operative intervention; any infection involving the central nervo us system; any infection with a positive fungal blood culture; any proven or probable aspergillus 
infection; any tissue invasive fungal infection; any pneumocystis jiroveci infection  
• Grade 4 =  life-threatening infection  
• Grade 5 =  death  resulting from infection  
 Events, grade 2 or higher will be recorded on the appropriate AE case report form for this study.  
 For grading an abnormal value or result of  a clinical or laboratory evaluation (including, but not limited to, a radiograph, 
an ultrasound, an electrocardiogram  etc.), a treatment -emergent AE is define d as an increase in grade from b aseline or 
from the last post -baseline value that doesn’t meet grading criteria.  If a specific event or result from a given clinical or 
laboratory evaluation is not included in the NCI -CTCAE manual, then an abnormal result would be considered an AE  if 
changes in therapy or monitoring are implemented  as a result of the event/result .

 Attribution Definitions  
The relationship, or attribution, of an AE  to the study therapy regimen or study procedure(s) will initially be determined 
by [CONTACT_693725] a ppropriate AE/SAE form .  Final determination of attribution for safety 
reporting will be determined by [CONTACT_73884]/NIAID .  The relationship of an AE  to study therapy regimen or procedures will be 
determined using the descriptors and definitions provided in (Table 17).  For additional information and a printable version 
of the NCI -CTCAE manual, consult the NCI -CTCAE web site: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .

Unrelated Category  
1 Unrelated  The AE is clearly not related.  
Related Categories  
2 Possible  The AE has a reasonable possibility to be related; there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship.  
3 Related  The AE is clearly related.  
 
Attribution assessment for the following study interventions and procedures will be made when a SAE is reported :   
o IS withdrawal  
o darTregs  infusion  
o Blood draw  (Donor or Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841])  
o Leukapheresis  
o Liver biopsy  
 Collection and Recording of Adverse Events  
 Collection Period  
AEs will be collected from the time of study mandated liver biopsy procedure until a subject  completes study participation 
or until 30 days after he/she prematurely withdraws.    
 Collecting Adverse Events  
AEs (including S AEs) may be discovered through any of these methods:  
• Observing the subject  
• Interviewing the subject (e.g., using a checklist, structured questioning, diary, etc .) 
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the subject  
In addition, an abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE , as defined in 
Section 14.2.[ADDRESS_940878] AE s and S AEs as described previously on the appropriate AE/SAE form 
regardless of the relationship to study therapy regimen or study procedure.

end of study participation, or until [ADDRESS_940879] prematurely withdraws (without withdrawing consent)  /or is 
withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first.  
 Reporting of Serious Adver se Events  and Adverse Events  
 Reporting of S AEs to Sponsor  
This section describes the responsibilities of the site investigator to report serious AE s to the sponsor via the SACCC eCRF.  
Timely reporting of AEs is required by 21 CFR and ICH E6 guidelines.  
 
Site investigators will report all S AEs, regardless of relationship or expectedness to blood draw or liver biopsy with research 
specimen collection, IS withdrawal, or Treg infusion within 24 hours of discovering the event.  
 For SAEs, all requested information on the AE/ SAE form should  be provided.  However, unavailable details of the event 
will not delay submission of the known information.  As additional details become available, the AE /SAE should  be updated 
and submitted.  
 Reporting to Health Autho rity 
SAEs (Section 14.2.3  14.4.2  ) submitted by [CONTACT_693726]/NIAID  medical monitor.   
DAIT/NIAID will report the SAE to the appropriate health authorities  as follows : 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Annual Reporting  
DAIT/NIAID will  include in the annual study report to health authorities all AE s classified as:  
• Serious, expected, suspected a dverse reactions  
• Serious and not a suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions occurring prior to Treg infusion.  
Note that all AEs (not just those requiring 24 -hour reporting) will be reported in the An nual IND Report . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Expedited Safety Reporting  
DAIT/NIAID shall notify the FDA and all participating site investigators of expedited Safety Reports within 15 calendar days;  
unexpected fatal or immediately life -threatening suspected adverse reaction(s) shall be reported as soon as possible or 
within 7 calendar days.  
 Expedited reporting , with 2 possible categories, applies if the AE  is classified as one of the following:  
 Category 1 :  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction [S[LOCATION_003]R]  (Section [IP_ADDRESS], 14.2.3  and 21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)i).  The sponsor shall report any suspected adverse reaction that i s both serious , unexpected  and occurs after 
Treg infusion .  The sponsor shall report an AE  as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the AE , such as:  
1. A single occurrence of an even t that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., 
angioedema, hepatic injury, or Stevens -Johnson Syndrome);  
2. One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., tendon rupture);  
3. An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events that commonly occur in t he study population 
independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occ ur more frequently in the drug treatment group than 
in a concurrent or historical control group.  
 
Category 2: Any findings from studies that suggests a significant human risk  
The sponsor shall  report any findin gs from other epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], analyses of AEs within the current study or 
pooled analysis across clinical studies or animal or in vitro  testing (e.g. mutagenicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity) that

 Reporting of AEs to IRBs  
All investigators shall report AEs, including expedited reports, in a timely fashion to their respective IRBs/IECs in 
accordance with applicable regulations and guidelines.  All IND Safety Reports to the FDA  shall be distributed by 
[CONTACT_73884]/NIAID or designee t o all participating institutions for site IRB submission.  
 Pregnancy Reporting  
The investigator shall be informed immediately of any pregnancy in a study subject or a partner of a study subject.  A 
pregnant subject shall  be instructed to  not stop taking IS study medication unless directed by [CONTACT_5657]/her study physician.  The 
investigator shall counsel  the subject and discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on  
the fetus.  Monitoring of the pregnant subje ct shall continue until the conclusion of the  pregnancy.    
 
The investigator shall report to the SACCC  all pregnancies within [ADDRESS_940881].  
 Information requested about the delivery shall include:  
o Gestational age at delivery  
o Birth weight, length, and head circumference  
o Gender  
o Appearance, pulse, grimace, activity, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (APGAR) score at [ADDRESS_940882], an SAE shall be submitted to the SACCC  using the 
SAE reportin g procedures described above.  Pregnancies reported as SAE’s will be reported to the FDA as described above.  
 Reporting of Other Safety Information 
An investigator shall promptly notify the site IRB as well as the SACCC  using the AE/SAE form when an “unanticipated 
problem involving risks to subjects or others” is identified, which is not otherwise reportable as an AE . 
 Review of Safety Information  
The PI, the NIAID MM , and the NIAID /DAIT  Transplant DSMB will review safety data on an ongoing bas is. Enrollment and 
initiation of study treatment  may be suspended at any time if any of these reviews conclude there are significant safety 
concerns.   Study treatment includes first withdrawal attempt, darTregs  infusion, and continuation of IS  withdrawal.   
 MM  Review  
The NIAID MM shall receive monthly reports from the SACCC compi[INVESTIGATOR_689395](s)  on appropriate eCRFs . 
 
In addition, the MM  shall review and make decisions on the disposition of t he SAE reports (including any infusion related 
events) received from the site investigator via the SACCC in a real time manner .   
 DSMB Review  
The DSMB shall review safety data at least biannually during planned DSMB Data Review Meetings.  Data for the planned 
safety reviews will include, at a minimum, a listing of all reported AEs and SAEs.   
 The DSMB will be informed of an Expedited Safety Rep ort in a timely manner.

in Table 18.  Since the trial is small and the above events are of particular concern, a single occurrence of any e vent listed 
will require DSMB and/or MM review within 48 hours.   
 
In addition to AE’s described, f ailure to manufacture and supply the cellular product for [ADDRESS_940884] already 
received darTregs  will continue with the IS withdrawal algorithm.  If an y other stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4081], subjects will remain 
at their current IS dose without further dose reduction until the DSMB and/or NIAID MM authorizes the study to continue.  Any subject who has successfully completed IS withdrawal will remain off drug unles s clinical condition mandates 
otherwise.  In the event that darTregs  manufacturing for an eligible subject was already initiated every attempt will be 
made to expedite review such that a prompt decision is made regarding the appropriate management for thes e subjects.

the success  rate of IS minimization, complete  withdrawal, and/or operational tolerance.   
 
Previous IS withdrawal trials in adult liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693652] 1 –  [ADDRESS_940890] an approximate operationally tolerant success rate of 13%.  Moreover, in AWISH (NCT 00135694), among the 
44 subjects who tolerated a 25% decrease in their CNI dosing, 66% failed in that they were unable to tolerate 75% dose 
reduction.  We propose  that darTregs  infusion will increase the proportion of subjects able to tolerate a 75% CNI dose 
reduction along with, if applicable, complete discontinuation of either Prednisone or MMF for [ADDRESS_940891] 
selected to administer darTregs  to 9-11 subjects , who will comprise the ITT2 analysis sample .  If the actual failure rate is 
22% (2/9 subjects), then we will have 89% power at an alpha leve l of 0.05 to conclude that this failure rate differs from 
the baseline failure rate of 66% in the absence of darTregs using an exact one -sided binomial test.  Similarly, with eleven 
subjects, if the actual failure rate is 27% (3/11 subjects), then we will have 85% power at an alpha level of 0.05 to conclude 
that this failure rate differs from the baseline failure rate of 66% in the absence of darTregs using an exact one -sided 
binomial test.

Subjects who are  able to maintain stable liver tests for 12 weeks after 75% CNI reduction and discontinuation of 
Prednisone or MMF will be offered the opportunity to continue CNI withdrawal aiming to stop CNIs.  S ubjects will be 
considered to have successfully discontinue  all IS medications if they maintain stable liver tests for [ADDRESS_940892] 
IS / CNI dose.  Subjects will be considered to be operationally tolerant if they maintain stable liver tests and stable allog raft 
histology [ADDRESS_940893] IS / CNI  dose.  While not the primary endpoint of the study, this is an important secondary 
endpoint and thus warrants discussion.  Tables 22 Error! Reference source not found.  and 23  show that if 4 or more

 Protocol Deviation  Definitions  
Protocol Deviation  – The investigators and site staff will conduct the study in accordance to the protocol; no deviations 
from the protocol are permitted .  Any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures constitutes 
a protocol dev iation .  As a result of any deviation, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_48162].  
 
Major Protocol Deviation (Protocol Violation) -  A Protocol Violation is a deviation from the IRB approved protocol that 
may affect the subjec t's rights, safety, or wellbeing and/or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.   In 
addition, protocol violations include willful or knowing breach es of human subject protection regulations, or policies, any 
action that is inconsisten t with the NIH Human Research Protection Program’s research, medical, and ethical principles , 
and a serious or continuing noncompliance with federal, state, local or institutional human subject protection regulations, 
policies, or procedures .  
 Non -Major  Protocol Deviation  - A non-major protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study 
design or procedures of a research protocol that  does not  have a major impact on the subject's rights, safety or well- being, 
or the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the study data.  
 Reporting and Managing Protocol Deviations

Once the LT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_693657], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_693658] [ADDRESS_940895] participate in the consent process.   The prospective participant will be 
told that being in the trial is voluntary and that he or she may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason.  All participants will read, sign, and date a consent form before undergoing any study procedures.  Consent materials will be 
presented in participants’ primary language.  
 The consent process will be  ongoing; the consent form will be reviewed w ith each subject again prior to proceeding with 
complete IS withdrawal.  The consent form s will be revised when important new safety information is available, the 
protocol is amended, and/or new information becomes available that may affect participation in the study.   
The consent process must be appropriately documented in the subject’s records.  A copy of the signed consent forms 
should be given to each subject.  
 Privacy and Confidentiality  
A participant’s privacy and confidentiality will be respected throughout the study.  Each participant will be assigned a 
unique identification number and these numbers rather than names will be used to collect, store, and report participant

during ISW).  If the subject consents to continue withdrawal, instructions for next dose change should be given and Appendix [ADDRESS_940907] is maintaining at 75% IS, 
medium frequency visits (Appendix 7) should start 4 weeks after W24.IS Withdrawal: Maximum time allowed for withdrawal to Step 5 is 32 weeks Step 3 (6 weeks)
Local Laboratory Assessments± 3 days■ This schedule of events should be used after darTreg infusion, starting 2 weeks after resuming IS withdrawal.  There will be a day 7 transplant center visit (shown on the Treg SOE) before starting this SOE.  
The duration on this SOE will vary by [CONTACT_693736].  However, the maximum time allowed for withdrawal to Step 5 is 32 weeks, less if pauses were made previously.  
■ If a subject fails IS withdrawal at any time, the medium frequency schedule should be used (Appendix 7) until 52 weeks after date of darTregs infusion or date of rejection. ■ When CNI has been reduced by 75% (step 5) for 12 weeks, subjects will either 1) continue IS withdrawal on high frequency visits using Appendix 6, or 2) switch to medium frequency (Appendix 8) until 52 
weeks after darTregs.

in residu al diameter stenosis is greater than 20%, prior to any adjunctive 
therapy.

follow -up period, as adjudicated by [CONTACT_89705] (CEC):  
Unplanned ta rget limb amputation above the ankle  
Clinically Driven Target Lesion Revascularization (CD -TLR)  
Cardiovascular related deaths  
This endpoint will be met if the freedom from MAE rate is greater than 85%

Statistical Methodology   
Primary Effectiveness  The primary effectiveness endpoint is the reduction from baseline in residual 
diameter stenosis (measured in percent), prior to any adjunctive therapy, 
achieved by [CONTACT_941] B -LaserTM catheter, as assessed q uantitatively by [CONTACT_89711].  This study’s primary 
effectiveness endpoint will be met if the mean reduction in residual 
diameter stenosis is greater than 20%, prior to any adjunctive therapy.  
   Statistical Hyp othesis   The primary effectiveness hypothesis to be tested is:  
H0: µDS ≤ 20% vs.  H 1: µDS > 20%  
where µ DS is the mean reduction from baseline in residual diameter stenosis.   
   Statistical Test  The hypothesis will be tested using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)  
   Minimum Sample Size  97 treated subjects (assuming one lesion per subject)  
Primary Safety  The primary safety endpoint is the percent of subjects free of MAEs 
throughout the 30 -day follow -up period,  as adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741].   
   Statistical Hypothesis  The primary safety hypothesis to be tested is:  
  H0: πMAEF ≤ 85% vs.  H 1: πMAEF > 85%  
where π MAEF is the proportion of subjects free of MAEs throughout the [ADDRESS_98707] of male and female subjects eighteen (18) 
years of age or older, with symptomatic infrainguinal PAD, scheduled for 
endovascular intervention.  Subjects must also meet all other inclusion 
criteria and not meet any of the excl usion criteria described in Sections 5.3.[ADDRESS_98708] PSV that could be taken. The company will keep in house the records of the alternative 
determination of patency by [CONTACT_89712] s tenosis 
(further information can be found in section 3.1 of the study protocol, PAD diagnosis,  Duplex ultrasonography (DUS)).

Results  Primary Effectiveness Results  
At baseline, the mean (SD) percent stenosis at the target lesion was 85.7% 
(12.2%) . Post B -LaserTM prior to adjunctive therapy, the mean (SD) percent 
stenosis at the target lesion was 52.1% (14.9 %0.  This resulted in a crude 
mean (SD) reduction from baseline to post B -LaserTM of 33.6% (14.2%) . 
  
 Primary Safety Results  
 The freedom from MAE through the 30 -day follow -up period after 
intervention was 98.9%, with a lower limit of the one -sided 97.5% exact 
binomial confidence interval of 94.2%, which is greater than the pre -
specified threshold of 85%, so the success c riteria for this endpoint is met.  
Discussion and 
Conclusions  The aim of the study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the use of the 
Eximo Medical’s B -LaserTM catheter in subjects affected with infrainguinal 
PAD.  The study was designed to assess bo th safety and effectiveness of the 
device, and there were two hypotheses in this study.   
The primary effectiveness endpoint was the mean reduction from baseline in 
residual diameter stenosis (measured in percent), prior to any adjunctive 
therapy, achieved  by [CONTACT_941] B -LaserTM catheter, as assessed quantitatively by 
[CONTACT_89715].  Because the 
lower limit of the one -sided 97.5% confidence interval was greater than 
20%, we conclude that the mean reduction from baseline i n diameter 
stenosis is > 20% prior to any adjunctive therapy, and the success criterion 
for this endpoint is met.  
The primary safety endpoint is the percent of s ubjects free of MAEs 
throughout the 30 -day follow -up period, as adjudicated by [CONTACT_89716] (CEC).  This hypothesis was tested via the lower limit of 
the one -sided 97.5% exact binomial confidence interval.  Because the lower 
limit of the c onfidence interval was greater than 85%, this endpoint is met.  
Thus, the study is deemed successful as both null hypotheses (primary 
efficacy and primary safety endpoints) were rejected and the acceptance 
criteria were met.  It can be claimed that Eximo Me dical’s B -LaserTM device is 
safe and effective according to its intended use.  
The results found were quite robust.  There did not appear to be statistically 
significant differences in the primary effectiveness endpoint across centers 
(p=0.3071) and there w as only [ADDRESS_98712] has also rev iewed and 
evaluated the results and affirmed that based on the information that the 
committee was provided, the device is safe for its intended use.

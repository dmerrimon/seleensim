1. Describe the study hypothesis and/or research questions  
Cirrhosis affects more than [ADDRESS_755976] as patient -reported outcomes (PRO), which can independently 
predict hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165348]. Our group has studied the impact of these PRO extensive ly. With the increasing spread 
of health -related electronic devices, the relevance of health IT in the management of chronic diseases such as cirrhosis is paramount. The team 
has already developed and used several health IT advances to educate patients and  their caregivers in inpatient and outpatient settings. These 
tools include Patient Buddy to prevent avoidable readmissions and EncephalApp Stroop  to detect and guide therapy for cognitive dysfunction 
in cirrhosis. However the evaluation of these tools in a multi -center study that adapts to the status of the patients and their caregivers is required.  
 
The central hypothesis is that cirrhotic patients randomized to health IT interventions that elicit PROs in a structured outp atient setting will have 
a significantly greater reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576379].  
 
Patient Buddy ™ is an innovative application that is HIPAA compliant and adaptable to specific patient populations. It includes the ability t o 
securely integrate with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576380] a HIPAA compliant hosted environment with separate patient and care giver interfaces 
focused on several aspects that impact re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Specifically,  it has the ability to record vitals, cognitive performance, questionnaires, 
medication dosages and intake and can communicate with the clinicians and pharm acies. Patient Buddy has been developed by [CONTACT_576404], Creative Information Technology, Inc. (CITI).  
 
Given this immense gap in our knowledge regarding the use of patient and caregiver -centered interfaces in the prevention of re - hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
our hypothesis is that Patient Buddy, a mobile patient -caregiver -clinician interface, will effectively reduce r eadmissions in decompensated 
cirrhotic patients within [ADDRESS_755977] of care, using devices through which they can communica te with the clinical 
teams and using devices and structured follow -up over thirty days. Our aim is to develop these devices so as t o learn quickly about issues that 
patients and their caregivers are facing so that we can intervene to stop unnecessary and re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576381].  
 
2. Describe the study's specific aims or goals.  
Specific Aim 1: To evaluate in a multi -center, randomized trial the effectiveness of (patient reported outcomes) PROs elicited using 
PatientBuddy and EncephalApp Stroop  with and without scheduled outpatients return visits on the prevention of avoidable [ADDRESS_755978] of care.  
 
 
As part of this specific aim, we will include 450 total cirrhotic patients and 450 caregivers (150 patients and 150 caregiver s per center), who will 
be followed for [ADDRESS_755979] -discharge. The groups will be randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_755980] separate devices l inked to a device 
with the nurse coordinator through which daily communication will occur between patient/caregiv ers and the study team regarding previously 
identified risk factors associated with readmission. With this enhanced communication and educational value of the App, the s tudy team will 
have greater access to events at patients’ homes and the potential to pr event readmissions by [CONTACT_576405]. The team will also 
engage the end -users (patients, caregivers and the nurse coordinator) by [CONTACT_576406], user -
friendliness and impact of the App. A detailed analysis of 30 -day readmissions, including potential preventability with Patient Buddy will be 
performed. CITI will be responsible for establishing and monitoring the communication channels and implementation of the inte rfaces.  Page 55 of 66

 Specific aim 2: To incorporate the opi[INVESTIGATOR_576382] (patients, caregivers and nurse coordinators) towards improvin g the 
Patient Buddy App in the prevention of readmission in cirrhosis  
 
The input of patients, caregivers and nurse coordinator and analysis of potential preventability of readmissions in specific aim 1 will be used 
to enhance the Patient Buddy App.  
 
3. Describe the study's background and significance, including citations, or upload a citation list in document upload. Use lay 
language whenever possible.  
1. Significance of the problem of cirrhosis and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576383] 5 million patients in the [LOCATION_002]1. The natural history of cirrhosis involves a compensated  and a 
decompensated phase2. Decompensated patients develop complications of cirrhosis such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE), ascites , variceal 
bleeding, infections and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). These complications led to more than 1.[ADDRESS_755981] 
nearly $[ADDRESS_755982] shown a 
relentless increase in this rate4. The 30 -day readmission rate for cirrhotic patients is as high as 37% in prior NIH - sponsored studies from 
multiple centers in North America5 -7. This was associated with a significantly higher [ADDRESS_755983] concentrated on the individual patients’ understanding of their disease process and their medications , the role of the 
caregiver/companion during this process has not been well studied. The involvement of the caregiver is a critical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_576384]11. This can impact their da ily function, development of future complications and 
socio -economic status from an individual, family and societal basis12 -14. Therefore, caregivers are essential to the understanding of the 
disease complications, prevention of medication -associated issue s and to alerting relevant clinicians earlier to manage problems as an 
outpatient, which if neglected could lead to readmission. Studies have shown that caregivers of cirrhotic patients are deeply  affected by [CONTACT_576407] a psychosocial and financial perspective but they are often not involved while the disease severity, progression and complications 
are being explained to the  patients15 -17. 
The absence of caregiver involvement in the previous studies of readmission prevention is a major gap in our knowledge which requires 
investigation.  
 
5. Current methods of preventing readmissions are inadequate and are reactive instead of pro -active  
 
The current standard of care in cirrhosis at this time is to schedule appointment follow -up and occasional telephone calls to the patients 
directly5. There is little systematic investment into engaging the patient/caregiver dyad proactively and disseminati ng knowledge. The system 
thus is only geared towards evaluating patients when the problem requires emergent or urgent visits18. Therefore current know ledge that 
could prevent these readmissions is inadequately disseminated to the affected parties with the current standard of care.  
 
6. Mobile health applications are required to engage patients and caregivers with clinicians  
 
The rapid dissemination of multiple studies that clearly define preventable reasons for readmissions in cirrhosis requires di rect modes of 
communication between clinicians and the patient/caregiver dyads19. Mobile health apps which are able to communicate problems that can 
be handled before they need an emergent visit to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576385] a potential method to prevent these readmissions.  
 
7. The conclusion from the original proof -of-concept study : "patient buddy app for prevention of readmissions in cirrhosis patients", showed that 
the use of the Patient Buddy app is feasible in recently discharged patients with cirrhosis and their caregivers. Eight HE -related readmissions 
were potentially avoided after the use of the App. (Note abstract uploaded in documents section) Sta ndard of care follow -up post discharge is 
4 weeks (30 days) minimum and possibly [ADDRESS_755984] version of this study."  Page 56 of 66

4. * Describe the proposed research  (Figure below is the flow chart for the study design)  
 
Recruitment of Subjects and Informed Consent Process:  Subjects will be recruited from the Inpatient Service at V AMC . Each morning, 
the CITI -trained nurse coordinator (who will also act as the nurse coordinator) will check with the inpatient attending if cirrhotic s ubjects have 
been admitted. These subjects will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or co -investigators. If they app ear to be reasonable candidates, the coordinator 
and investigators will discuss the study with them and their caregivers. Sufficient opportun ity will be provided to them to have all their 
questions/concerns answered before consent will be obtained. If subjects and caregivers are agreeable, study activities will start at the day 
of discharge.  All female patients of reproductive age group will undergo a urine pregnancy test.  
After informed consent is obtained from both patient and the caregiver separately, we will administer the EncephalApp Stroop  to the patient.  
EncephalApp Stroop is a validated cognitive test that takes 5 -10 minuteto perform , which can give valuable information regarding the cognitive 
flexibility and psychomotor speed of the participant. This has an easier Off State and a more difficult On state. The ultimat e outcome is the time 
taken to complete both Off and On states in sec onds known as OffTime+OnTime. The EncephalApp Stroop will be administered by [CONTACT_576408] 1. For those randomized to group 2, it will be administered at baselin e to the patient by 
[CONTACT_576409]. Like in group 1, all patients will 
undergo this again at study end.  
 Training will be given to all patients and caregivers regarding  
(a) cirrhosis (b) hepatic encephalopathy (c) ascites and low -sodium diet and (d) individual medication evaluation, using printed 
standardized patient information handouts from UptoDate. We will answer all  questions raised by [CONTACT_576410].  
 
We will then proceed with 1:1:1 site -specific randomization in blocks of 4 using a random number generator overseen by [CONTACT_576411] . 
 
Group 1: Standard of care group:  
Dyads randomized to the control group will be discharged per local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576386]. They wi ll be given the 
contact [CONTACT_576412] [ADDRESS_755985] of care also depends on the acuity of the 
presentation and the ability of the patient to follow -up. For this study, we will require a 30 -day visit from the patient and caregiver.  
 
Group 2: Health -IT only group:  
Training at the time of discharge: The Patient Buddy app with preloaded caregiver and patient interfaces will be shown to the  subjects and 
caregivers with detailed instructions including: User Guide of Patient Buddy, Quick Reference Sheets for Case Coordinator to give the Patient 
and Caregiver with screenshots and tips and tricks for maneuvering around the modules, Powerpoint presentation that goes thro ugh the 
workflows for patients and caregivers, and one on one train ing for the Case Coordinator given by t he CITI Representative. In addition, 
administration of five orientation questions  (what is the date, what is the time, what is the year, who am I and where are you?)  and EncephalApp 
Stroop  will be taught to the caregiver. The call -in numbers for the nurse coordinator, GI physician on call and the contact [CONTACT_576413] 57 of 66

 principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_576387]. A detailed training session will be performed over the next hour by [CONTACT_576414] [INVESTIGATOR_576388]. This training will be tailored to the specific issues faced by [CONTACT_576415][INVESTIGATOR_057]. The individualized login and passwords for each patient and their caregiver will be established and given to them.  A copy will be 
kept with the nurse coordinator in case the subjects forget their codes. These wil l be reset upon return of the devices at the end of the study. 
The connectivity and messaging system in -built into the Patient Buddy App will then be checked and the control center of the CITI 
communications notified of this enrollment. This will also be checked by [CONTACT_576416] h the App to 
the coordinator and the PI (Figure 3 demonstrates th e data flow). In the health -IT only group, there will be daily contacts between patients, 
caregivers and the clinical teams via the App. The only visit scheduled for the study will be at day [ADDRESS_755986] of care in their clinics in between the 30 days unless specifically required by [CONTACT_576417]. If the patient requires readmission before day 30, their participation will end at that time.  
 
Group 3: Health -IT+Scheduled Follow -up Group:  
This group will undergo the training at discharge similar to what was performed in group 2 but we will also intersperse the 3 0 day follow up with 
one visit and 2 scheduled phone calls as below. Visit Scheduled: Patients and caregivers will be formally call ed at day [ADDRESS_755987] discharge 
by [CONTACT_576418]. We will also perform a study visit at day 15 and day 
30 with both patients and caregivers to define any new changes in the patient’s con dition, elicit feedback throughout the process and at the day 
[ADDRESS_755988] perform their daily app entries. (subject may document medications taken, abdominal girth m easurement, 
and daily weight. The caregiver may document medications, daily weight, abdominal girth, ori entation questions and stroop test) The study 
staff will offer guidance as needed to complete these tasks. If the patient has a >10lb weight gain from baseline, a >5 inch girth increase, and/ 
or is febrile, the study team will notify the hepatologist on se rvice and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_576389]. No blood will be collected for the study and/or tests 
run for study purposes at any time. However, if the subject is febrile, has overt encephalopathy, is bleeding, and/or is more  decompensated, 
the study team will alert the  medical team and coordinate care as needed. Any care performed as a result of the findings from this visit will be 
conducted per standard of care by [CONTACT_40730]."  
 
FOR GROUPS 2 AND 3: If the subject is re -admitted, they meet the endpoint and their participation will  
end. We will contact [CONTACT_576419] a return of the smartphones and end of study elements. We will also 
request a discharge summary from the outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576390] . If the patient 
is in-house, we will coordinate the end of study while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576391].  The phones distributed to the 
participants in groups [ADDRESS_755989] a restricted data plan  under CITI . Only 
data entered in the Patient Buddy App w ill be transmitted directly to the HIPAA -compliant CITI server. At the end of the 
study (at day 30 or readmission within 30 days ), the phones will be turned in and remotely wiped of any data. Therefore, 
any other data generated  (browsing, photographs etc) performed  by [CONTACT_102]/caregiver on their phones will be wiped 
without transmitting over to any other entity. Therefore, there are no privacy or confidentiality risks pertaining to this.  
 
Patient Buddy App  Use (for groups 2 and 3): The Patient Buddy App will be loaded onto the phones  given to the patients and caregivers by [CONTACT_576420] (Table 3)  
 
Contact [CONTACT_576421]  
- Daily contacts pertaining to adherence, cognition and measurements as needed (details below)  
Unscheduled contacts:  
- If nothing is entered in the Patient Buddy for>24 hours by [CONTACT_576422]  
- Depending on results of scheduled telephone calls  
- Admissions to McGuire VA medical center or after discharge from other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576392]  
- Telephone calls generated from patients/caregivers to the study  team  
 
"The study team will reach out to the patient with an open statement such as :"hello   we noticed you have  
not recorded anything today, is everything ok...any questions? ' The app will be checked by [CONTACT_576423]. Since the subjects h ave 
multiple medical problems and their questions are not uniform, the study team will not have a standardized set of responses; they will utilize 
their medical training to address questions appropriately and in the event of progressive decompensation, will alert the medi cal team and PI [INVESTIGATOR_576393]. Any care performed as a result of the findings from these communication s be conducted per standar d of care by [CONTACT_302090]." Subjects will also be given the number (as is standard of care) for the GI -physician on call and will also be able to call emergency 
services if they are not abl e to wait to use Patient Buddy. On the day of discharge, the study coordinator, patient, caregiver and the case 
coordinator will meet for the training and evaluation of the Patient Buddy App as well to check the connectivity.  
 
The following data will be collected and reiterated to the patient and the caregiver (Table 3).

substance abuse, >21 years of age, non -elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], will be discharged home, no dialysis) Also, if the patient is 
re-admitted, discharge summary will again be collected.  
 
Training and counseling at the time of discharge: The Patient Buddy app with preloaded caregiver and patient interfaces will be shown to the 
subjects and caregivers with detailed instructions. The call -in numbers for the nurse coordinator, GI physician on call and the contact [CONTACT_576425] [INVESTIGATOR_576394]. A detailed training session will be performed over the next  hour by [CONTACT_576426] [INVESTIGATOR_576388]. This training will be tailored to the specific issues f aced by [CONTACT_576427][INVESTIGATOR_057]. The individualized login and passwords for each patient and their caregiver will be established and given to them. A copy 
will be kept with the nurse coordinator in case the subjects forget their codes. The se will be reset upon return of the phones at the end of the 
study. The connectivity and messaging system in -built into the Patient Buddy App will then be checked and the control center of the CITI 
communications notified of this enrollment. This will also  be checked by [CONTACT_576428]/caregiver through the App to the 
coordinator and the PI.  
 
The Patient Buddy App will be loaded onto the Phones given to the patients and caregivers by [CONTACT_576429].  
The Patient and Caregiver Patient Buddy Initial Screens aft er Login are shown in Figure 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The caregivers and patients will independently log in and provide updates as needed on action items that lead from each icon.  All important 
items in the discharge counseling are in the home screen for patients and caregivers.  
Role of caregivers : 
Caregivers will be given instructions on cognitive testing and EncephalApp Stroop  testing and the use of the weighing machine and tape measure 
for measuring weight and abdominal girth respectively. Caregivers will be instructed to give the orientation questions and EncephalApp Stroop  
to the patient if they appear not behave normally or once per week after discharge.  
EncephalApp is a validated test of cognitive functioning in cirrhosis, which consists of an easier Off state and a harder On state. The respondents 
have to correctly identify the color red, green or blue in presented “#” symbols during the Off state while in the On state they still have to pi[INVESTIGATOR_576395] a discordant color. E.g. the word “GREEN” will be presented in a blue color and the  correct answer is 
blue not green. There are 2 training runs for each state and the patient  has to complete 5 complete runs in both states. The total time to complete 
5 runs in the Off and 5 runs in the On state is the “OffTime+OnTime” which is noted in the Patient Buddy App once this is pre sented to the 
patient every week by [CONTACT_18629].  
 
While we aim to prevent all readmissions, the focus is to disseminate information through Patient Buddy on three specific preventable areas 
that are responsible for a majority of readmissions:

 (A) Hepatic Encephalopathy, (B) Ascites and fluid/electrolyte management (C) Infections  
The following will be performed jointly between caregivers, patients and study team to prevent readmission. Prevention 
of recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_576396]:  
- Ensure patients are started on medications appropriately on discharge.  
- Involve the caregiver at all levels of care, including cognitive/orientation testing as needed  
- Ensure patients are taking the specific dose of medications (a) Reduce lactulose dose if patient is dehydrated (b) increase 
lactulose dose if patient is not clear  mentally.  
- Simple orientation questions and EncephalApp Stroop  to gauge changes in cognition.  
- Early clinic appointments to treat HE and prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576397].  
 
Management of ascites, fluid and electrolyte issues:  
- Reiterate the dosage schedule of diuretics at discharge and daily entry of diuretic doses, weight and abdominal girth (exampl e in 
figure 6 ) 
- 2gm Na diet if indicated and daily charting of the adherence  
- Stop diuretics and contact [CONTACT_576430]:  
- Adherence on antibiotics to complete therapy as needed and/or adherence on SBP prophylaxis  
- Education of caregivers that HE could indicate infection.  
- Call or alert team immediately if patient has fever, chills, nausea or abdominal  pain 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The nurse coordinator receives data continuously throughout the day, monitors all values from the patients and caregivers on their iPad. They 
will alert the patient/caregivers with alarm issues and contact [CONTACT_978]/ physician -on-call if urgent action is required.  On the weekends and after 
hours, there will be coverage of the iPad with [CONTACT_576440] and  [CONTACT_576441]. As mentioned above, subjects and caregivers will again be 
told about the need to communicate urgent issues with the GI fellow on call rather than waiting for a response in the App.  
 
The App gives caregivers and patients  
A.  An opportunity to directly communicate with the study team  
B. Guidance as to when to call emergency services  
 
No other medical information or advice is in -built in the App, but it largely forms a conduit between the study team and 
patient/caregivers.  
 
The nurse study coordinators will regularly provide feedback to the app developers regarding the app. This feedback will be informal and will 
occur on a rolling basis. The nurse study coordinators will not be surveyed or interviewed formally. Unlike with the formaliz ed patient feedback, 
we do not intend to generalize any findi ngs from the nurses' feedback, and will solely use the information they provide for quality improvement 
of the app."  
 
30 DAY VISIT FOR ALL GROUPS: All patients discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576398] a [ADDRESS_755990] labs, perform a physical exam, and provide routine care taylored to the individual patient and his/her medical 
issues on the day [ADDRESS_755991] of care and are not done solely for research purposes. The stud y team will also 
meet with the patient and his/her caregiver at this day [ADDRESS_755992] the patient and caregiver complete a survey regarding their experience with the app. The pt and caregiver will be togeth er. The questions 
to be asked are uploaded to this submission ." 
Decision regarding avoidable readmissions: This will be made by [CONTACT_576431][INVESTIGATOR_576399] (1 each from the 3 sites). The decis ion regarding avoidability 
is based on the question whether could a clinic visit or earlier communication/education with patient and caregiver prevented  this admission. 
Page [ADDRESS_755993] rule about which admissions are classified as one or the other, which is why a committee i s necessary. On 
the whole, admissions for elective paracentesis, thoracentesis, early stages of hepatic encephalopathy etc are usua lly avoidable but those 
related to infections, severe hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding etc are usually not considered avoidable. However, si nce each case is 
unique, all discharge summaries of patients admitted within 30 days will be sent to the co mmittee to review and vote. The committee will not be 
told about the assignment of the patients.  
SAEs: we do not anticipate SAEs i.e. re -admissions to be related to the App itself because that is what is the focus of the study. Therefore, 
SAEs simply associated with admissions will not be reported to the IRB. We do not expect other SAEs directly relat ed to the App to appear in 
this study.  
 
 
 
Active Data Collection  
1. * Describe the technology chosen for collecting the data and transmitting data securely over the internet. Give the rationale 
for selecting this technology:  
For groups 2 and 3, we will use the Patient buddy app. This has been described in great detail in the uploaded grant but the details are below.  
Patient Privacy and Security : The App is HIPAA compliant with federal regulations regarding Privacy andSecurity. Patient Buddy is 
considered a Business Associate under the terms of the final HIPAA Omnibus rule. The data  management of this study will operate using a 
secure hosted environment with a HIPAA compliant server and data storage network. Given the sensitivity and need for security  in managing 
and handling personal health information, Patient Buddy has developed its application such that n o data are  stored on either any of the 
distributed devices. Only after verification and authentication of login credentials is established with the server, is any d ata pushed out to the 
appropriate devices. All data are transmitted to the server where they are contr olled behind the network firewall.  
 
Patient Buddy Design to Protect PHI:  The Patient Buddy App will be hosted at a secure data center using a HIPAA compliant server. The 
data center provides several key security features that contribute to the safeguarding of PHI. These data safety and security  features include 
physical securi ty of the data center and infrastructure; perimeter security of IP reputation; network security for intrusion detection, fire wall and 
vulnerability; server security for OS, anti -virus and log management; along with proce dures and protocols for data backups, security audits, 
access control, change controls, and the maintenance of policies and procedures. From an application and program management s tandpoint, 
Patient Buddy offers further security safeguards to protect PHI t o include secure data deletion upon termination of services; administrative 
security that provides for secure access and two -factor authentication; program access control; security policies and procedures, incidence 
response protocols, and risk assessments  monitored and updated by [CONTACT_576432], as well as data management and 
application management processes. All Integration of exports from the EncephalApp Stroop test will be handled with the same security and 
privacy concerns. At no time will any PHI be disclosed and all data will be filtered through the HIPAA compliant servers. Dat a Integration: 
Regarding the architecture, Patient Buddy’s server applicatio n is responsible for the data interchange between the database and the mobile 
apps.  This can also serve as the integration point with EHR’s and third party vendors. The Database uses Microsoft SQL Standard Ent erprise 
version and it is hosted on virtual machines to reduce deployment time. CITI also uses caged physical servers deployed in geo redundant 
locations.  
 
2. * Describe how data will be linked or unlinked to identifiers including email addresses, names, and/or IP address. No 
identifiers are in the App or smartphones or iPads  
 
3. * Is there an alternative method for completion of the data collection other than the internet:  
No 
 
4. If yes, describe the alternative(s):  
The Health IT component is the entire focus of the study; inability or not wanting to use Apps are an exclusion  
 
5. * Describe how individuals will be able to skip or not answer particular questions. If any questions are mandatory,  provide 
justification:  
There are key questions related to  
a. Medication adherence  
b. New medications  
c. Vitals  
d. Cognitive testing  
 
Are all essential and will be queried if not entered. These are important because these are the leading causes of avoidable readmissions and 
are therefore mandatory.  
 
Data Confidentiality and Storage  
Confidentiality refers to the way private, identifiable information about a participant or defined community is maintained an d shared.  
 
1. * Specify where this study’s paper and electronic research data and/or physical specimens will be stored and how  they will be Page 61 of 66

 secured from improper use and disclosure:  
 
We will keep all data private by [CONTACT_576433]'s paper charts and also storing all information on a secure, password -
protected drive. The charts will be kept under lock and key in the offices of [CONTACT_576442] and [CONTACT_576443] and Yost which are only a ccessible to 
the study team. The password protected drives will only be accessible to the study t eam.  
 
Patient Privacy and Security : Patient Buddy ™ is HIPAA compliant with federal regulations regarding HIPAA Privacy and Security. Patient 
Buddy is considered a Business Associate under the terms of the final HIPAA Omnibus rule. The data management of this study  will operate 
using a secure hosted environment with a HIPAA compliant server and data storage network. Given the sensitivity and need for security in 
managing and handling personal health information (PHI), Patient Buddy has developed its application such that no data is sto red on either 
any of the distributed devi ces. Only after verification and authentic ation of login credentials is established with the server,is any data pushed 
out to the appropriate devices. All data is transmitted to the server where it is controlled behind the network firewall.  
Patient Buddy (App) Design and Implementation to Protect PHI:  The Patient Buddy App will be hosted at a secure data center using a 
HIPAA compliant server. The data center provides several key security features that contribute to the safeguarding of PHI. These da ta safety 
and security features include physical security of the data center and infrastructure; perimeter security of IP reputatio n; network security for 
intrusion detection, firewall and vulnerability; server security for OS, anti -virus and log man agement; along with procedures and protocols for 
data backups, security audits, access control, change controls, and the maintenance of policies and procedures. From an appli cation and 
program management standpoint, Patient Buddy offers further security sa feguards to protect PHI to include secure data deletion upon 
termination of services; administrative security that provides for secure access and two -factor authentication; program access control; security 
policies and procedures, incidence response protoc ols, and risk assessments monitored and updated by [CONTACT_576432], as 
well as data management and application management processes. All Integration of exports from the EncephalApp Stroop will be handled 
with the same security and privacy concerns. At no time will any PHI be disclosed and all data will be filtered through the HIPAA compliant 
servers.  
We will provide feedback on app usability with CITI quarterly by [CONTACT_225622] a de -identified spreadsheet with survey results.  
 
2. * Who will have access to study  data:  
Only the study team will have access to the data only  
 
3. * If the study will code (i.e. de -identify) the research data by [CONTACT_52744]’ names with assigned subject IDs, explain the 
following aspects of the coding process:  
 
The codes will be assigned with subject sequential number, date of enrollment and whether this is a patient or a caregiver. T he key will be 
kept on a secured hard drive accessible only to the study staff and will be destroyed after the minimum data retenti on period is over  
 
Non-VA Site Details * How will communication occur between sites for discussion of study conduct, unexpected problems, project 
modifications, and interim results:  
A hepatologist study investigator will be selected to represent each of the three study sites. A conference call will be held  quarterly and the [ADDRESS_755994] been prevented. As 
questions and issues occur, the same group will be the conduit to problem solve as a group and keep the study team informed.  
 
Study Population  
1. * Provide the total number of individuals at VAMC : [ADDRESS_755995], what is the total anticipated number of subjects across all sites: 900 
 
3. * Provide justification for the sample  size:  
Sample size: Prior studies and our cohort have shown a 30 -day readmission rate around 33% using current practice, and of which 20% were 
considered avoidable. Per our preliminary data, the rate of 30 -day avoidable readmission reduced to 5%. However, we will  be circumspect 
and increase this relative avoidable readmission rate to 9%. In order to determine a similar reduction at 80% power at an α =  0.05 level of 
significance we would require 45 patients in the Health -IT+scheduled visits, [ADDRESS_755996] 
of care group per site leading to a total of 135 patients per site or 405 total patients. This will also include 405 caregive rs. Allowing for a 10% 
dropout rate, we plan to we will enroll a total of 450 patients,  of which 150 will be randomized to health -IT+scheduled visits, [ADDRESS_755997] of care across all three sites. This will be accompanied by [CONTACT_576434] a ll three sites to 900.  
Therefore at McGuire VAMC  we will enroll 50 patients and 50 caregivers in each group for a total of 300 subjects (150 patients and 
150 caregivers).

Potential Subject Identification and Recruitment  
 
There will not be any special recruitment flyers since all patients will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576401].  
Subjects will be recruited from the Inpatient Service at VAMC. Each morning, the CITI -trained nurse coordinator (who will also act as the 
nurse coordinator) will check with the inpatient attending if cirrhotic subjects have been admitted. These subjects wi ll be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or co -investigators. If they appear to be reasonable candidates, the coordinator and investigators will discuss the study with them  and 
their caregivers. Sufficient opportunity will be provided to them to have all their questio ns/concerns answered before consent will be obtained. 
If subjects and caregivers are agreeable, study activities will start at the day of discharge  
Privacy  
Before approaching the patients and caregivers, the study team member will make sure that the conversation cannot be overhear d and will 
get a private setting in the inpatient unit. This maintenance of privacy will continue throughout the process of study c onduct and data 
dissemination and during the contact [CONTACT_576435] 30 -day follow -up period.  
Costs to Participants: no specific study related costs to the patients or caregivers.  
All medical care provided for the study participant will not be study related, but standard of care.  
The medical team following the study subject as a patient in clinic at week 2 (group 3) and day 30 (all groups) may perform t he following 
procedures as standard of care:vital signs to include BP, HR, Temperature, height, and weight. The medical team may al so send the following 
labs as standard of care: CBC with diff, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver panel and pt/inr. All of these procedures will not be covered by 
[CONTACT_576436]'s insurance company. Since the medical procedu res needed for pt care will be as standard of care,

 will be used.  
Compensation  
1. If the patients and caregiver dyad completes the study 30 -day follow -up (or are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576402], which will end their study participation), 
we will provide them a check for $100 for the patient and $75 for the companion for a total of $175 for the study participati on. 
 
2. If compensation will be pro -rated, explain the payment schedule: No pro -
rated compensation will be provided.  
 
Risks, Discomforts, Potential Harms and Benefits  
1. * Describe the risks of each research procedure to participants or others.  
1. Physical risks: none from the use of the app.  
 
2. Psychological/social risks: Very small risk of loss of confidentiality and privacy. They may feel anxious about completing  the 
cognitive tests especially if they notice a decline.  
3. Financial risks: since groups [ADDRESS_755998] with their care team, they may be referred to 
their medical team for treatment or medication changes (for example), which may result in unanticipated costs for the 
participant.  
 
2. * Describe how the risks / harms will be  minimized:  
 
1. Psychological/social risks: Very small risk of loss of confidentiality and privacy. Privacy and confidentiality will be maintained at all 
levels by [CONTACT_576437] a private setting even when hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576403]. Pati ent and caregivers 
will be  given separate smart phones with separate login information that does not contain any PHI. The login information copy will al so be 
kept with the nurse coordinator in case the patients/caregivers forget them and needs to ca ll the  coordinator.  
None of the devices has PHI stored in them and using the HIPAA -compliant servers, all data will be pushed onto the servers when entered. In 
case the smartphones are lost, misplaced or stolen, therefore there is no risk to PHI.  Important to note is that there is no PHI stored on the any 
devices and therefore misplacing a device will not compromise patient data integrity. All data is pushed out to the device on ce login has been 
authenticated. First login is established after a two -factor authentication challe nge is completed.  
Once done, the patient is able to set a user and password for subsequent logins. All data resides on a HIPAA compliant Patien t Buddy 
server which offers its own set of data security protections and backup. In the event a device is lost or stolen, no PHI da ta will be 
compromised. Our budget for PatientBuddy includes support for extra devices that will be made available to patients that lose  or break a 
device with minimal disruption expected to the study and replaced in an unscheduled visit. Breaches in data security, although not expected 
given that no PHI resides on the phone, will be reported to the patients and caregivers within 24 hours of us receiving any s uch information 
from CITI. This will also be reported to the IRB and an urgent conference between t he study team and CITI will occur to assess the root 
cause and prevent future epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].All data will be de -identified for analysis.  
They may feel anxious about completing the cognitive tests especially if they notice a decline. .Since hepatic encephalopathy is a major reason 
for admissions, this cognitive testing tool is a critical tool for the study. Therefore If we find a participant is unwilling  to use this app feature, 
they will be excluded.  
 
2. Financial risks: since groups [ADDRESS_755999] with their care team, they may be referred to 
their medical team for treatment or medication changes (for example), which may result in unanticipated costs  
for the participant. Although we will discuss these issues with our subjects at consent, we will also note being admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_94856] a larger cost that may be avoided.  
 
3. Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical, professional, or psychological intervention in the even t of 
adverse events to the subjects:  
The process for addressing any significant subject reported medical issues through the buddy app is as follows:  
The Buddy App will be checked throughout the day by [CONTACT_9137]. When a subject or caregiver notifies the study coo rdinator 
that he/she is having problems or questions, the coordinator will provide answers and support within his/her scope of prac tice. However, if 
the issues are more complex and need a physician's oversite, he/she will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the medical team for direction . The medical 
team may chose to call the subject/caregiver directly, or may give the coordinator instructions to give the subject/caregiver. The coordinator 
will then contact [CONTACT_423]/caregiver with this information (and will document the instructions) The coordinator will also follow -up later to 
check on the subject and determine if the issue is under control/res olved.  
If the issues are more complicated and the medical team wishes to examine the subject or feels the subject needs an outpatien t intervention 
such as a paracentesis, the coordinator will facilitate a clinic appointment with the medical team in clinic and wil l check on the patient/caregiver 
and update any changes in care and/or medications in the buddy app.  
In regards to answering your question re. what the medical team will do, this will be ta ilored to the needs of the patient/subject and will be 
different for each patient. Our hepatology patients with cirrhosis have many clinical problems and are frequently followed in  clinic for labs, 
ultrasounds, paracentesis, medication adjustments, etc.  
 
4. * Describe any potential for direct benefits to participants in this study:  
Patients with cirrhosis and their caregivers suffer from several issues that can lead to multiple readmissions. Most of these  issues are Page 64 of 66

 preventable by [CONTACT_576438]/caregivers and the clinicians through intuitive mobile health applic ations. 
Therefore the use of Patient Buddy app and its streamlining using the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] a critical step in empowering patients  and caregivers in 
communicating with the team and preventing expensive and often unnecessary readmissions. Therefore this research is very usef ul for 
patients, caregivers, health care workers and potentially for society.  
 
5. * Describe the scientific benefit or importance of the knowledge to be gained:  
Readmissions in decompensated cirrhosis are a significant unresolved burden that affects more than 1 million patients and car egivers 
throughout the US. Prior federally -funded research clearly shows preventable reasons for these readmissions that need to be  disseminated 
to the clinicians, patients and caregivers. Utilizing the secure Patient Buddy App to serve as a portal of communication and education between 
patients/caregivers and clinicians will serve as a platform for future research focused on preventi on of cirrhosis readmissions .Page 65 of 66

For Peer ReviewBuddy App Protocol changes  
 
Protocol Amendment 1  
Changes to exclusion criteria: edit existing criteria to allow alcohol use within one month provided 
subject has not had alcoholic hepatitis within 1 month; allow subjects on hemodialysis  
Justiﬁcation: To increase generalizability  
Protocol Amendment 2  
Due to COVID -19 related gap in enrollment, funding shortfalls, and low likelihood of us reaching the 
original study  goals, a re -evaluation of the data was done to see if we could combine the two health -IT 
groups. Avoidable readmissions were similar across the 2 health IT groups and therefore, instead of 1:1:1 randomization, this was changed to 1:1 randomization with a total of 464 subjects ( 232 patients and 232 
caregivers).  
Justiﬁcation: reduced enrolment requiring combination of the groups.  Page 66 of 66

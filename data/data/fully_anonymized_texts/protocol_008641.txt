1.1 SYNOPSIS   
 
Title:  Feasibility and acceptability of an adaptive treatment intervention for 
depression and engagement in HIV Care among Latinos living with HIV   
Grant Number:  K01MH113475  
Study Description : This is the evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of an adaptive 
intervention for depres sion and engagement in HIV care among Latinos 
living with HIV.  The adaptive intervention is the sequencing of two 
low-risk behavioral interventions with text -messaging support. The 
focus of the study is on the sequencing of the interventions.  
Objectives*: 
 Primary Objective:  Feasibility of the intervention (i.e., execution of 
enrollment and intervention session completion rates).  
Secondary Objectives:  Acceptability of the intervention (i.e., evaluation 
of engagement with intervention). Full details listed in the protocol.  
Endpoint s*: Primary Endpoint:  Half-way through active engagement with 
intervention ( 4 of 8 sessions completed) - this is the follow -up period 
dictating the sequencing decision.  
Secondary Endpoints:  12 weeks after enrollment - this is the final 
follow -up period.  
Study Population:  A total of 45 Latino(a)/ Hispanic adult patients (18 or older) that are 
English or Spanish speaking, are living with HIV, report a mild level of 
depressive symptoms, and receive care at San Francisco General 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291852] 86.  
Phase  or Stage:  Not applicable

 5 2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
Effective and efficacious treatments yield benefits to individuals, but the  magnitude of those benefits is  
not equal in size. This study is attempting to understand how to optimize the benefits of efficacious 
treatments by [CONTACT_291877] a daptive treatment intervention using a Sequential Multiple Assignment 
Randomized Trial (SMART) design . The process of an adaptive  intervention (i.e., specifically an Adaptive 
Treatment Strategy;  ATS) is similar to the process of a medical  diagnosis and treatment plan. A patient is 
diagnosed, a treatment is prescribed, and the patient is monitored. If  a patient gets better, their 
treatment is maintained, if they get worse, a provider makes a decision to switch to a  stronger 
treatment, hold off on a change, or add an additional treatment. Simila rly, an ATS is a set of decision 
rules that dictat e how to sequence treatments for depression;  which are “adaptive” because they are 
not delivered uniformly to all patients. Instead, treatments are sequenced based on a patient’s progress 
(e.g., get  better, worse, non -adherent to treatment) before deciding the next course of action (i.e., 
maintain, augment or  switch).  Because the impact (i.e., efficacy) of an intervention is not the same for 
each patient, SMARTs  individualize treatment interventions to optimize the efficacy that has already 
been demonstrate d. We are evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of an ATS.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_356113] not adequately addressed HIV -related health disparities among Latinos in the U.S. In 2012, only 
39% of Latinos diagnosed with HIV were estimated to have achieved viral suppression.   In 2013, Latinos 
accounted for nearly 23% of new HIV diagnoses in the U.S., yet  only made up 16% of the U.S. population 
(60% of Latinos newly diagnosed with HIV were foreign -born).   Moreover, national HIV surveillance data 
showed that Latinos were less likely to be retained (at least [ADDRESS_356114] year) or engaged in care 
(>[ADDRESS_356115] year) compared to Whites and African Americans.   However, once 
retained in HIV care, Latino HIV outcomes improve and are equal to their White counterparts.  Thus, the 
challenge is to develop a strategic response that overcomes the specific barriers to ca re affecting 
Latinos.  
Mental health problems among Latinos living with HIV are pervasive . The most rigorous and nationally 
representative study to date found that up to 48% of people living with HIV (PLWH) met criteria for a 
depressive or anxiety disorder, which was primarily major depression (33%). Recently, similar 
estimates of depression were found in a diverse c ohort of PLWH in the U.S.  And while estimates of 
depression among HIV+ Latinos are as high as national estimates, they are crude because Latinos 
have only made a smal l percent of the study samples (< 15%) and must have been able to speak 
English.  For context, nearly [ADDRESS_356116] of the “Treatment 
as Prevention” strategy will be limited if depression impedes on the behaviors that lead to achieving 
and sustaining viral suppression.  And among  Latinos, there is little use of mental health services for the 
treat ment of depression . For example, Latinos use general medical services at rates comparable to non -
Latino Whites,  but show less use of mental health services.  And even when formally diagnosed with 
depression, Latinos (not specific to HIV) were less likely to access treatment compared to non -Latinos 
Whites; a result exacerbated for those living in poverty.  In one systematic review, Latinos diagnosed 
with depression and prescribed antidepressant medication showed pervasive adherence problems. 
Therefore, poor de pression treatment outcomes abound.  
Cultural and language barriers are complex but need to be addressed in HIV and mental health research . 
Lower use of mental health services suggest that Latinos may have difficulty recognizing and/or 
reporting depressive symptoms because of language difficulties (i.e., poor communication with 
providers, inability to relay psychological distress) or cultura l reasons (i.e., attitudes towards mental 
health, psychotherapy and psychotropic treatment beliefs, familiarity with psychotherapy).  Other 
cultural barrier s to HIV and mental health care include concepts of mental illness, treatment readiness, 
and integration with the health care system. And since Spanish -speaking Latinos have also been 
underrepresented in trials to test interventions’ efficacy, use of “culturally blind” interventions for 
depression may have low acceptance and efficacy. Ongoing disparities in HIV, and in access and use of 
mental health services, make clear that the current health systems and approaches are inadequately 
suited to make strides in improving the health of HIV+ Latinos with depression.   
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_356117] a mild 
severity level of depression, and if enrolled, the possibility that the interventions may not work, which 
may lead participants to feel discouraged, upset or hopeless (i.e., worse depression ratings). There is a

benefit from mental health treatment programs.  
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS   
 
The primary objective is feasibility, which is defined as the measures “to determine whether an 
intervention [pi[INVESTIGATOR_291854]] is appropriate for further testing [and] to enable researchers to assess 
whether or not the ideas and  findings can be shaped to be relevant and sustainable.” The secondary 
objective is  acceptability, defined as the tolerability or appropriateness of the SMART being studied 
from participant and clinician perspectives.

4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
The study design is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_291855] (SMART).

No one treatment intervention equally benefits all persons. Thus, personalized/adaptive interventions 
may be one way to optimize the benefits people receive from treatment interventions. The goal of a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_291856] . These outcomes justify the decision rules 
that guided whether, when and how the intervention components (i.e., BAT, CBT and the text -
messaging support) are  adapted to a patient and informs the future full -scale SMART. It should also be 
noted that pi[INVESTIGATOR_291857],  which is already

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 9 Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study  but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Our study team is not going to 
reach out to i ndividuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because 
of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that are likely to change over time . Screen failures are 
documented in the patient demographic data file  at screening.  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
All participants will be recruited from the Salud Clinic and Women’s  Clinic  (housed within the Ward 86 
HIV clinic at SFGH). Protection of the Latino clientele is a priority and informs the recruitment and 
screening process. Because the Salud Clinic specifically serves monolingual and bilingual Latino clients, 
Spanish -language services are easily accessible and nearly all  providers and staff members are bilingual, 
including the PI [INVESTIGATOR_291859] K01 ([CONTACT_291897]) and the Salud Clinic Director ([CONTACT_291898]).   All 
recruitment processes will be in full collaboration with [CONTACT_142606] and the Ward 86 Medical Director 
([CONTACT_291899] a Gandhi) and take place during Salud Clinic  and Women’s  Clinic  hours .  
 
[CONTACT_291897] is in regular contact [CONTACT_265138]. Marquez and always ensure the privacy and protection of 
patients and that all services go uninterrupted. Therefore, all communication with patients will occur 
before or after their appointment.  
 
Our proposed recruit plan is based on the experience of conducting two previous studies with the 
same population at the study site, and after many discussions with clinic staff and the clinic direc t. 
 
Our process first begins with presentations about our study at the Salud Clinic monthly staff meetings. 
We will present on our scheduling plan and re -introduce the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This is to 
inform the study staff and providers that we ar e actively recruiting patients. The Salud Clinic staff and 
providers assign their patients to a panel, and thus, are familiar and discuss the circumstances of each 
patient and their care. The clinic director, [CONTACT_142606], prefers that all staff are aware o f the studies 
that are currently enrolling participants so that if that they can make informal assessments if their 
patients generally fits the inclusion criteria. At monthly clinic meetings, we announce  that we are 
recruiting from the waiting room on a set schedule and they can are free to walk over or refer patients 
to our clinical coordinator who can introduce the study. Importantly, no participants are ever enrolled 
the same day they are greeted or referred  to us in the waiting room.  
 
For direct referrals, we attend the Salud and Women’s Clinic services, which start each Wednesday at 
1:30PM. At 1PM, our clinical coordinator sets up in the waiting room and greets each staff member and 
provider, reminding them they are going to be in the waiting room. After each appointment, a provider 
or st aff may choose to walk over any patients that are interested to our clinical coordinator in the 
waiting room who can assess their pre -eligibility (i.e., assess if interested in learning more about the 
study and exchanging contact [CONTACT_3031]). Again, participants are never consented the day they are 
greeted. Further, there are also no incentives for providers or staff to recruit patients into our study, 
thus, patients should not feel coerced into seeking  to participate. The Salud clinic staff prefer this 
method of outreach because it minimizes disruptions in clinic service provision as all contact [CONTACT_291879] -between appointment activities.  
 
For self -referrals, we will post flyers in the waiting room and the exam rooms. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], when a patient 
shows interest in the study, they will call or text our study phone line. At this point, the eligible 
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. 4  
  6.01.21  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 10 participant will be directly contact[CONTACT_291880] (i.e., delayed recruitment) to re -introduce the 
study, review and confirm the eligibility criteria, and schedule a day to begin the informed consent 
process (described below). Because participants will  be recruited at their HIV care site, we have 
purposefully selected this delayed recruitment strategy to reduce any coercion to participate at the time 
they are introduced to the study. All communication and materials will be available in Spanish and 
Engli sh. 
 
At the onset of the COVID -[ADDRESS_356121] ran the communication 
plans to increase the  likelihood that the participant views the intervention and the study staff favorably, 
which will increase the likelihood of being retained over the follow -up period.   
At the baseline interview, all participants will be asked to complete a locator form, which includes the 
listing of a current home address, phone number, and text or email information (if available), and 
preferences for how they would like to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  The locator form also requests the names of three 
persons who they agree can be contact [CONTACT_291881]. The locator form also 
includes information we are allowed to relay over the phone or email (e.g., a participant may not mind 
that we state this is a call from the “Salud or Women’s Clinic” whereas another participant might prefer 
we state “UCSF”).  
For subsequent appointments, e ach participant is sent a text-message and asked to confirm their next 
appointment. If they do not respond to the text -message within [ADDRESS_356122] an 90% retention rate and have oversampled 
to ensure we have enough participants.  All partici pants will be reimbursed with $[ADDRESS_356123] of living in the San Francisco Bay Area of [LOCATION_004].

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 11 6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DESCRIPTION  
 
The intervention activities are peer -reviewed and published manualized non -invasive programs that 
are based on psychoeducation principles, cognitive theory, and behavioral theory for 
depression.  They are featured in Simoni, Wiebe, Sauceda (PI), et al., 2013, and from the manual 
titled  CBT for Depression and Adherence in Individuals with Chronic Illness: Client and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_291860] , Oxford University Press, 2007 .  
The intervention is comprised of three psychological theories to improving depression:  
1. Psychoeducation  is a standard educational approach to inform patients about the foundations of 
depression (i.e, what it is, what it looks like, how it affects people), and provides them with general 
knowledge around how to cope with and self -manage it. It is the foundati on of behavioral therapy 
and cognitive -behavioral therapy.  
2. Behavioral therapy  attempts to improve a person's depressed mood by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_291861]. When one engages in social or 
physical activities, they are inherently learning to associate the activity with feel ings of elevated 
mood, thus, reinforcing them to continue to engage in the activity. The goal of the brief intervention 
is to help patients systematically plan to be more active and social, and to track how these activities 
are associa ted with changes in mood. Cognitive -behavioral therapy takes it one step further, but all 
patients first start with the behavioral therapy component first . For this reason, we are starting with 
assignment to what is known as behavioral activation therapy (BAT) - a brief behavioral therapy .   
3. Cognitive therapy  attempts to improve a person's depressed mood by [CONTACT_291882] a 
person feels and behaves is a function of how they think about themselves and the world around 
them. The key feature of depression in cognitive theory is negative thinking. To remed y negative 
thinking requires specific skills to learn how to monitor one's thoughts, and then to use strategies to 
think more adaptively to counteract the negative thinking. In cognit ive therapy, by [CONTACT_291883]. Cogni tive theory requires more time and is a higher -
order approach, which is why all participants are not starting with it. The cognitive component in 
"cognitive -behavioral" therapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_291862]. For this reason, we are only randomizing participants to receive this 
more time -intense program if the behavioral therapy is  not sufficient to change depression ratings.  
Participants in this study will be HIV+ Latino/as receiving care at the Ward 86 Salud  or Women’s  
Clinic, a Latino -serving HIV clinic at ZSFG. The SMART trial has three components: 1) brief, Behavioral 
Activation Therapy (BAT) 2) cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT), and a text -messaging tool (mHealth).  
• Delivery Method -Texts and interventions sessions will be completed either in person or 
via secure video chat platforms hosted by [CONTACT_25999] (i.e., HIPAA -compliant Zoom Video Conference 
platform). All text -messages are sent on secured encrypted UCSF Apple iPhones and with text -
message platforms, such as Signal or Mosio.  
• Session Length - Each session will ideally last 50 -60 minutes.

brief assessment and to identify topi[INVESTIGATOR_291863]. The counselor 
and the participant will discuss pressing issues, ongoing concerns,  and areas identified as 
priorities by [CONTACT_2299].  
1. BAT is a brief, 8-session manualized intervention that teaches participants about depression, how 
depression affects one's behavior (activities) and vice versa - this is the psychoeducation feature. 
Then, the focus of the remainder of sessions are on an action plan to identify new activities, schedule 
new activities, evaluate their deve lopment, and how to overcome barriers to engaging in new 
activities. For example, BAT would help a patient who states they feel isolated learn to understand 
how depression reduces energy, which  is why they may not feel motiv ated to start their day. It 
woul d then help the patient create a plan to systematically schedule social activities (e.g., calling a 
friend to chat), how to make a plan for overcoming not feeling motivated, and then have them self -
monitor their activities and evaluate their own progress.  
Materials : Paper and pencil, calendars and monitoring forms, and mood rating scales. All 
documentation is stored in secured filing cabinets in badge -access only UCSF offices.  
• Session 1 (Building Trust and Introduction to BAT)  Introduce psycho -education about 
depression, the BAT rationale, daily monitoring forms and importance of engagement in HIV 
care.  
• Session 2 & 3 (Review and Introduce "High" value activities; Barriers to BAT): Review Session 1 
and introduce “high value” activity domains (i.e., activities key to relationships, mind - body 
health, spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824], and daily life), discuss barriers to activities and monitoring (e.g., rumination 
as a “covert” maladaptive behaviors), and  social “contracts” to engage network members (e.g., 
family) with scheduled activities, and discuss engagement in HIV care.  
• Session 4 & 5 (Review Progress, Challenges, & Maintenance Strategies): Review Sessions [ADDRESS_356124] -intervention (e.g., 
rank activities by [CONTACT_291884]), discuss communication with 
providers and the importance of engagement in HIV ca re. 
Materials : Paper and pencil, calendars and monitoring forms, and mood rating scales. All 
documentation is stored in secured filing cabinets in badge -access only UCSF offices.  
 
2. CBT combines BAT with cognitive therapy. CBT goes a step further in stating that negative thinking 
also affects behavior and emotions, and vice versa. It teaches patients how to "think about negative 
thinking," creates a plan to monitor their negative thoughts, and how to use specific strategies to 
think more adaptively. For example, a key feature of depression is use of cognitive dis tortions. In this 
example, patients may have the habit of using the distortion of "all -or-none" thinking, where if they 
feel they are not perfect then they have negative evaluations of themselves, rather than thinking 
more realistically that perfection is l ikely unattainable and that not reaching perfection does not 
equate to failure. In CBT, there are specific action plans to monitor how changes in thinking change 
are leading to changes in feelings and behaviors. CBT requires more time and more contact [CONTACT_291885]. Thus, we are starting with BAT and only sequenc ing CBT when patients are deemed 
to need it.

 13 • Session 1 (Building upon BAT & Introduce CBT Rationale): Review principles of BAT and 
psychoeducation about the cognitive component in CBT.   
• Session 2 -4 (Cognitive Restructuring): Introduce how to monitor negative thoughts, record 
thought patterns, learn to identify new strategies for managing negative thoughts.  
• Session 4 -6 (Problem -Solving): Review previous sessions and discuss barriers to activities and 
thought monitoring, and barriers to completing the activities discussed in the intervention.  
• Session 7 -8 (Relaxation Training & Maintenance): Discuss the rationale of progressive muscle 
relaxation and how negative thoughts and feelings can start from physical arousal. Introduce 
monitoring forms and strategies to practice relaxation plans.    
Participants will be identified as eligible by [CONTACT_291886] (ZSFG staff prefer a 
flexible approach), complete the informed consent process, and then randomized to either : 
(A1) BAT alone or (A2) BAT & mHealth text -messaging.   
Participants randomized to (A1) BAT alone will complete a total of five, [ADDRESS_356125] every two weeks. This intervention is 
publically available and manualized already. (Our prio r work has shown that the intervention can be 
delivered by a wide -range of clinic and research personnel, not just mental health professionals; 
Simoni et al., 2013).  
Conversely, participants randomized to the (A2) BAT & text -message support  will receive an identical 
BAT program with the addition of one and two -way personalized text messages that will be delivered 
twice a week to facilitate engagement with the intervention activities.  
Text -Messages  - One -way messages will be sent as appointment and BAT adherence reminders (e.g., 
"Please remember to fill out your social activity planner?", while two -way text messages will be sent 
as "check -ins" with participants in the form of a mobile interventionist ( e.g., "How is your activity 
planning going? If you need assistance, I can remind you of what activiti es you said you could do"). 
Participants will be asked to respond to these two way -text messages at their earliest convenience.   
After three sessions of the five planned sessions have been completed, an  assessment of the 
participants  depression will be made using a cutoff score on the Patient Health Questionnaire -9 
(PHQ -9), a self -reported rating scale for depression  (this is called a “primary tailoring variable”). This 
primary tailoring variable will dictate the second sequence. Based on their PHQ -9 score, participants 
are coded as a “responder” or “non -responder;” a code that dictates whether their initial 
randomizat ion assignment is  1) maintained , 2) augmented , or 3) switched to a second component 
(this  is the second randomization and "adaptive" component).  
Participants who  were randomized to  BAT alone and were coded as "non -responders" will be 
randomized to : 1. additionally receive  text-message support, or 2. switched to receive CBT & text -
message support. If switched to CBT & text -message support, participants will  complete a total of 
eight intervention sessions that can be re -arranged to fit patient needs. CBT sessions will be 
scheduled once a week for 60 minutes (as described above, CBT integrates cognitive theory 
principles with behavioral theory principl es, and thus, is more intensive). If participants randomized 
to BAT alone during their first stage of treatment and responded, they  continue with maintenance of 
their BAT sessions.   
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. 4  
  6.01.21  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 14 Participants who were randomized to BAT & text -message support and were coded  as "non -
responders" will be randomized to : 3. augment  BAT & text -message support treatment in the form 
of an extra booster session, or 4. similarly  switched to rec eive CBT and text -message support.  If 
participants who were randomized to  BAT & text -message were coded as "responders", they will 
continue with maintenance of their BAT & text -message support sessions.  
Participants will be asked to attend intervention sessions, respond to text messages, and participate 
in post -intervention exit interviews.  Research team staff will be responsible for recruiting eligible 
participants to the study, coordinating intervention sessions (including reimbursements), and 
coordinating the text -message support component. Bilingual and English -speaking licensed clinical 
psychologists will supervise the conduct of the interventions and discuss updates during weekly and bi -
weekly meetings.  
Text -Messaging  Protocol  - One-way messages will be sent as appointment and BAT adherence 
reminders.   Two -way messages will be sent during the protected time for “check -ins” with participants 
in the form of a “mobile therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].”  
 
Security  - All phones are reviewed and encrypted by [CONTACT_291887] . The protocol for text -messages  will be explained and demonstrations will be conducted in 
the first session to ensure participants comprehend the rationale. All study phone  hardware,  
authentication of hardware (log -in credentials), and transmission networks (cellular -data networks, Wi -
Fi) of  patient health in formation will be  protected through encryption software. We will show 
participants how to modify  their phone settings and install free applications (e.g., Signal,  TigerText) to 
encryp t the text -messages or have them delivered in discreet form (e.g., content not to appear on home 
screen).  
 
Data Collection  - All study phones will store text -message communication and will be downloaded from 
the smart phone into a Microsoft Word document. From this document, all responses are then pasted 
into a secure and password protected Microsoft Excel file. The excel fil e lists all  participant unique ID 
numbers, message history, and schedule preferences.  The file is stored on the UCSF Box cloud storage.  
 
One -way Messages  - One-way messages require no confirmation of receipt and are for the purposes of 
reminders. For example, for appointment reminders (in English), we will send the following reminder 
tailored to the participant - “Hi Lorena, this is [CONTACT_291897] reminding you of your appointment on 
Monday, June 1st at 11:30AM at the Salud or Women’s Clinic. To cancel or reschedule, please call  or text  
the study phone line @415 -476-6045 .” For a reminder to adhere to the intervention activities, we will 
send th e following - “Hi Lorena, this is [CONTACT_291897] reminding you to list your activities and rate  
how you feel afterwards ” 
Timing  - 1) Reminders will be sent  3 and 1 day  prior to the appointment date. 2) BAT activity reminders 
will be sent once a week during a set block of working hours, which will be determined after initial 
screening visit.  
Two -Way Messages  - All two -way messages will be initiated once a week during blocked hours of 
protected time (determined after screening). This will allow for messages  to be sent and responded to.  
If two -way messages are NOT  responded to during the blocked hour(s), a follow -up message will be sent 
to end the conversation: Example: " Hi Miguel, please respond at your earliest convenience. I will be

  6.01.21  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 15 available to respond again on Thursday from 9AM and 11AM ". We will minimize the risk for breaches of 
confidentially by [CONTACT_291888] -messages, such as “HIV” or 
“depression” and acting immediately on any emergencies. All conv ersations will end with “ If you have  
an emergency, please call 911. ” 
During the start of all intervention sessions that are face -to-face (in person or video conference), we 
always discuss the acceptability of the text -message protocol. This is to discuss challenges in responding 
and successes, and is part of the overall eva luation of acceptability.  
Content of Two -Way Messages  - During designated time, the interventionist will initiate text -message 
conversation with participants. This is because personalizing  BAT and CBT  support and advice  requires  
real-time problem -solving opportunities so participants can complete the program.  For this reason, 
standardized messaging is not recommended  as the purposes of the messaging is to continue the 
discussion around intervention activities that were discussed in session. Message content is derived 
from activities discussed in session and on file in the Microsoft Excel sheet.  
 
Standard mood ratings sent once per week : - 1) “Hi Miguel, this is [CONTACT_291897]. How is your mood today? 
Reply with a number from 1 (poor) to 5 (Excellent) when convenient .” “Thank you for the response. 
Remember, doing a social activity like talking to a friend can help you feel better.”  
 
Problem -Solving  Messages : “Hi Miguel, do you need any help remembering the activities you planned? 
Reply Y for Yes, N for No. ” “You replied Y. You mentioned wanting to call to chat with your  brother .” “Can 
you do that today? ” “How is your homework going? Can I help you in any way with the homework?”  
“Remember, rat e how you are feeling . Let me know if you need help  with the ratings .” “If you have an 
emergency, please call 911.”  
 
Data Collection  - All study phones will store text -message communication and will be downloaded from 
the smart phone into a Microsoft Word document. From this document, all responses are then pasted 
into a secure and password protected Microsoft Excel file. The excel fil e lists all participant unique I D 
numbers, message history , and schedule preferences . The file is stored on the UCSF Box cloud storage.  
 
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
We are taking a brief behavioral intervention for depression, a text -message support intervention, and a 
cognitive -behavioral intervention, and sequencing how each is rolled out based on how participants 
respond. In a traditio nal approach, we would be compa ring each component individually as standalone 
interventions compared to a control condition, and evaluating their effects. In a SMART, you start with 
the lowest burden/low dose intervention, and only increase as needed. This study is sole ly focused on 
feasibility  and acceptability.   
There are situations where multiple treatments are known to be effective, but what is unknown is 
whether every person benefits the same from all of them. In the depression field, we do not know how 
best to package what are considered efficacious inte rventions - 1) behavioral activ ation therapy, 2) 
cognitive -behavioral therapy, and 3) text -message support to treat depression and promote adherence 
to medication and clinic appointments. We will use a SMART design to evaluate if it is feasible and 
acceptable to  sequence these behavioral interventions for depression.  
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. 4  
  6.01.21  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 16 STARTING POINT : Patients are recruited and then randomized to one of two active arms. The first 
randomization is to one of two interventions (A1 and A2). Both A1 and A2 are an already -established 
efficacious brief behavioral intervention, the only difference is that one  will include a text -message 
support intervention (A1 versus A2 + Text -message support), which is the experimental factor we are 
testing, i.e., whether text -message support is the key factor between A1 and A2. At baseline, where 
participants are randomized, we will measure their depression using a standard rating scale.  
FIRST OPTION : All participants will complete [ADDRESS_356126] 
"assignment" (i.e., improved depression ratings) or did not respond well (i.e, no change in depress ion 
ratings or worse depression ratings). If the respond well, nothing changes and they proceed as normal 
through the 5 -session program. If they do not respond, i.e., show no improvement or show worse 
ratings, we "adapt" the intervention because we have evidence that the intervention is not currently 
relieving depressive symptoms.  
SECOND OPTION : If participants do not respond to their first assignment (e.g., no change in depression 
ratings or worse ratings), they are eligible to be randomized again to a second assignment (B1, B2, B3, or 
B4). This is why the term "sequential multiple assignment" is used because the goal is to identify how to 
start with A1 and "sequence" other intervention components through an "assignment" to "multiple" 
components (B1 -B4). 
Participants who did not respond to A1 or A2 (only difference is A2 has text -message support) have 
four options:  
1. If participants in the A1 arm DO NOT improve, they can be re -randomized to either B1 to receive the 
text-message support component; or  
2. B2 to switch to more intensive intervention, which is known as cognitive -behavioral therapy and text -
message support.  
3. If participants in the A2 arm DO NOT improve, they can be re -randomized to either B3 to receive one 
booster session of same program; or  
4. B4 and switch to more intensive intervention of cognitive -behavioral therapy & text -message support.  
The components are : 1) a brief Behavioral Activation Therapy (BAT),  2) cognitive -behavioral therapy 
(CBT),  and a text -messaging tool (mHealth).  
Patients ( N=45) will first be randomly assigned to the first intervention component of either: A1) BAT by 
[CONTACT_291889] A2) BAT & text -message support.  
DICTATING CHANGE : At the first  follow -up point, which is half -way through the first assignment, we will 
make an assessment of how they  responded to the first intervention. Our goal is to measure  changes in 
their  depression ratings  using a cut -off score on a clinical depression assessment tool. If their depression 
ratings have improved, they will maintain their initial treatment (Stay with A1 or A2), which is either: 
1) BAT by [CONTACT_291890] 2) BAT & text -message support.  
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. [ADDRESS_356127] not received: B1 -B4. 
To summarize : BAT and CBT and mHealth are efficacious approaches to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_291864] -manage 
their depression. However, rather than given all patients a complex package (CBT with mHealth), we are 
seeking to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of starting wi th a brief intervention, and then 
sequentially to add more intensive components only when needed.  
6.[ADDRESS_356128] will write Data -Assessment -Plan notes (DAP) for each 
session, which is  discussed in weekly team meetings and additional trainings are discussed if fidelity to 
the intervention is sub -optimal.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 
All randomization is done blinded. Prior to the start of the intervention, we will use the National Cancer 
Institutes Clinical Trial Randomization Tool stratified by [CONTACT_291891]. These randomizations will be 
relayed to the study coordinator who will inform the participant of their intervention starting point.  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE  
 
The acceptability outcomes are what is being evaluated to determine adherence to the intervention. 
Acceptability: 1) > 90% adherence to the BAT and CBT session schedule; 2) responsiveness to text 
messages as: a) >80% of all two -way messages replied to duri ng the set of blocked hours; b) >90% of 
participants reporting direct benefit from one -way text -messages; 3) positive responses coded from 
post -intervention exit interview transcripts; 4) limited number of barriers to participation reported in 
exit intervi ews; and 5) responses to a brief survey (to be developed) assessing clinic staff acceptability of 
the intervention. Given the focus on feasibility and acceptability, the focus remains on studying whether 
these adherence markers can be achieved.

for depression, with the only differentiating factor being t he use of text -messaging to support

 18 adherence to the intervention's protocol. It is only when a patient does not respond to their assigned 
treatment do we investigate the next course of action in the form of a second -stage treatment, which is 
adapted to their particular case. Furthermore, no  other services for depression, including 
pharmacotherapy, will be denied. For each patient, we are writing a formal letter to their HIV care 
provider to let them know that their patient is in this study because they reported mild to moderate 
depression severity and to continue to prescribe any treatment they deem appropriate. All together, we 
believe that our study design, and feature of not withholding any treatment, does not place any 
participant at greater risk than what they would encounter with any other services available for their 
depression.

7 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DISCONTINUATION  AND 
PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
All participants who wish to discontinue the study will be asked for the reasons for discontinuing. This is 
part of the evaluation. If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes 
from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or quali fied designee will determine if any change in 
participant management is needed.  This is part of the Data and Safety Plan that was submitted to the NIH 
and approved (This file is available upon request).  Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as 
an adverse event (AE) . 
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• The reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from the intervention, and methods for 
determining the need to discontinue . 
• If the participant is due to complete  the first  assessments within 2 weeks of being discontinued 
from the study intervention  (asking to stop with the intervention activities but willing to come in for the 
assessment) , those assessments will be administered at the time of discontinuation; if the next scheduled 
assessments are more than 2 weeks from the discontinuation date, the discontinued participant will wait 
for the next scheduled assessment (unless they wish to completely discontinue with all study acti vities).  
Thereafter, the participant will be included in all future scheduled assessments, even though not 
participating in the intervention.  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non-compliance , unless varying compliance is an aspect of the study 
objectives   
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. 4  
  6.01.21  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 19 • Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130] . 
• Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up 
study  data would not be in the best interest of the participant  or might require an additional 
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study . 
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation . 
 
The reason for participant discontinuation  or withdrawal from the study will be recorded. Subjects who 
sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be 
replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study 
intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the study .  
7.[ADDRESS_356130] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] , reschedule the missed visit within 1 week,  counsel 
the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3  text-messages and 2  telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods) . These contact [CONTACT_9145]’s medical 
record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary rea son o f lost to follow -up. 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
The focus of this study is on the feasibility of carrying out the assessment of a primary tailoring variable 
(PTV). A PTV is the cutoff score to decide whether a participant showed a clinically meaningful response 
to BAT or BAT & mHealth at a 1 -month follow -up point.  The preliminary cutoff score for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_291865] a decrease in a PHQ -9 score from the “moderate” to “mild” (or below) depression 
symptom severity category after 4 weeks (or after 4 of 8 sessions of BAT). The rationale for the foll ow-
up period is to identify early who is a “responder” or “non -responder” to a 1 st-stage treatment. The 
“responder/non -responder” decision is used to decide whether, when, and how to adapt a [ADDRESS_356131] of the study activities. While the risks of any adverse 
events are deemed to be extremely rare, we will follow the guidance in the following sections.   
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
An adverse event is serious when the patient outcome is death, life -threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
disability, or other serious and important medical events.  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
We will follow the Federal Guidance on this issue.  
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern. Moderate events may 
cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
intervention. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention , 
assessed  by [CONTACT_9152] -trained interventionist  and discussion in team meetings . The degree of 
certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. 4  
  6.01.21  
 
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  
 21 • Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study procedures  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
procedures  and the event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study procedures  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures  caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between the study procedures  and event onset , or an alternate 
etiology has been established.  
 
Our diverse team of psychologist and infectious disease and internal medicine physicians is sufficient to 
determine the relationship of the AE to the intervention activities.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_291866]. An AE will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information 
previously described for the study procedures . In this behavioral intervention, we expect no serious AEs.  
 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an AE or serious AE (SAE)  may come to the attention of study personnel during study 
visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for m edical care, or upon review during team 
meetings . 
 
All AEs , not otherwise precluded per the protocol,  will be captured following the Reporting Requirements 
Summary Sheet from the UCSF IRB  (Attached in the IRB application) . Information to be collected includes 
event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severit y, relationship to study procedures  
(assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of 
resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be documented appropriately 
regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_9111] . 
 
The interventionist  will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained.  At each study visit, the  interventionist  will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the 
last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization . This is 
determined during weekly team meetings for AEs, and immediate scheduling of meetings for SAEs.  
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. [ADDRESS_356132] will report any adverse events to the UCSF 
IRB within 5 working days should they be deemed  related to the study AND are considered serious 
(defined above) or unexpected  (i.e., an adverse event that exceeds the nature, severity or frequency 
described in the current IRB Application including the protocol and consent form)

This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by t he Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ). OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to  participant s or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the UCSF IRB approved research protocol

studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. ] 
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_356135]. Sauceda will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the UCSF IRB. The UP report will include the 
following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number . 
• A detailed description of the event, i ncident, experience, or outcome . 
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP. 
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB immediately and no later 
than 48 hours after the discovery was made that a UP occurred.   
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC /study sponsor /funding agency  within [ADDRESS_356136]. Sauceda  becoming aware of the problem  . 
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials ( UCSF IRB), the NIMH Program 
Officer, within five days of [CONTACT_291897] becoming aware of the problem.  
8.4.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
Unless  the risk/benefit ratio changes or there are risks to breaches of confidentiality for the participant, 
no UP will be reported to them. If an UP is deemed to directly affect a participant, they will be notified 
that a meeting is needed to discuss how the is sue will be resolved after discussion with the PI, primary 
mentor, and the UCSF IRB.  
[ADDRESS_356137], we propose six treatment sequences and a minimum of four  
participants to receive them (called “outcome groups” in Figure 1). Second, one must estimate from the  
literature the percentage of participants who will not show a clinically meaningful response (i.e., “non -
response  rate”) to a treatment they will be initially randomized to.  We used data from a non -inferiority 
trial o f cognitive  therapy versus a behavioral activation therapy in general population sa mple. This trial 
used clinician -administered  diagnostic tools, self -report ratings, fidelity monitoring, and had all 
interventions delivered by [CONTACT_291892].  Under these rigorous conditions, 50 -60% of 
participants with mild  depression at baseline (range based on self -report and clinician ratings) did not 
achieve a 50% reduction in  depressive symptoms at a 4 -month follow -up. Similar results were found for 
participants with a higher  severity of depression at baseline. This estimation tool yielded a total sample 
size of 45 participants if we  observe a non -response rate of 50 -60%,  a fixed probability of 80% 
(suggested by [CONTACT_231805]), a minimum of  four participants per “outcome group,” and a 10% attrition rate.

9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Basic demographic tables will be generated for all depression ratings from baseline through follow -up 
periods, as well as general measures of central tendency for each variable (e.g., Mean, SD), measured 
categorical and continuously, and highlighted by [CONTACT_291893]. For Feasibility, the following 
outcomes will be evaluated using descriptive statistics to identify:  1) the n umber of participants 
screened, eligible and enrolled; 2) at least 80% of all BAT and CBT sessions completed;  and 3) 80% 
reten tion in all  “outcome groups” (see attached figure in the IRB application).  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
The Microsoft Excel file will have all participant appointment attendance records and responses to 
schedule text -messages, which were downloaded to determine acceptability as: 1) > 90% adherence to 
the BAT and CBT session schedule; 2) responsiveness to text -messages as: a) >80% of all  two-way 
messages replied to during the set of blocked hours; b) >90% of participants reporting direct benefit 
from one -way text  messages;  3) positive responses coded from post -intervention exit interview 
transcripts  (to be det ermined at future date) ; 4) limited number of barriers to  participation reported  (to 
be determined at a future date).

[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will always be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_291868], the HIPAA authorization form, 
and the consent form, unless they verbally decline to accept them.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Behavioral Intervention for Depression among Latinos   Version 1. [ADDRESS_356141] involvement in research.  
The obtainment of consent will be guided by a written document and an interactive, ongoing 
conversation between the PI, a research assistant, or Salud and Women’s Clinic staff member and a 
participant.  All documentation and conversations are readily available in English or Spanish.  
The required eight elements of consent will be sectioned paragraph -by-paragraph in the informed 
consent document, which will be discussed in detail with a participant. At the start of the consent 
process, we will let the participant know that we prefer to have the consent form read out loud while 
they follow along. They will have the option to read the document by [CONTACT_1029], but we will strongly 
discourage this so as to ensure all elements of consent are fully acknowledged and comprehended.  
As the consent process starts, each participant must acknowledge that they understand and agree to 
each section before continuing on to the next section (i.e., element of consent). At each section, we will 
ask a participant if they understand that they hav e the right to refuse to participate and that there are 
no consequences of doing so. We will inquire about t heir understanding of the study 
procedures  (including the process of notifying their provider of their participation in the study), which 
include th e possibility of multiple treatment reassignments, participation over a three -month follow -up 
period, and all risks that may result from participating.

NIMH, and  will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Study participants will  be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.  
 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants ; 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ;    
• Insufficient compliance of study staff to the protocol   (ie, significant protocol violations) ; 
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable ; 
• Determination that  the primary endpoint has been met ; 
• Determination of futility ;

participating, participating and droppi[INVESTIGATOR_87020], or completing the study. There is the possible 
consequence of having others (e.g., family, friends, co -workers) find out about their participation.  To 
guard against any potential  consequences, we will collect our Certificate of Confidentially (CoC) from the 
NIH. The CoC is available to all NIH -funded research, but can only be collected after IRB approval has 
been received.  
The CoC information will also be specified on the consent form and described to each participant during 
the informed consent process. Only [CONTACT_291897], the faculty mentor, and research staff will have access 
to a participant’s contact [CONTACT_291895]. All data that will be shared with the mentoring team 
will be de -identified. For participants in the trial, we will create a case file that is denoted by [CONTACT_291896]. All intervention paper files wi ll be stored in an 
office space and locked inside a file drawer. All consent forms and tracking forms that have identifying 
information will be separated from all case files. All case files will be uploaded into a password 
protected file and stored on a UC SF secure server. All patient text -message conversations will be stored 
on encrypted study mobile phones before being downloaded into a password -protected and encrypted 
text or EML file and stored on UCSF’s secure severs.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
AIM: To test a pi[INVESTIGATOR_291875] a depression and mHealth treatment strategy 
among HIV+ Latinos for feasibility and acceptability.  
 
Analysis of the Primary Endpoint(s)  
Basic demographic tables will be generated for all depression ratings from baseline through follow -up periods, as well as 
general measures of central tendency for each variable (e.g., Mean, SD), measured categorical and continuously, and 
highlighted by [CONTACT_291893]. For Feasibility, the following outcomes will be evaluated using descriptive 
statistics to identify: 1) the number of participants screened, eligible and enrolled; 2) at least 80% of all BAT and CBT 
sessions completed; and 3) 80% reten tion in all “outcome groups” (see attached figure in  protocol ).  
 
Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s)  
The Microsoft Excel file will have all participant appointment attendance records and responses to schedule text -
messages, which were downloaded to determine acceptability as: 1) > 90% adherence to the BAT and CBT session 
schedule; 2) responsiveness to tex t-messages as: a) >80% of all two -way messages replied to during the set of blocked 
hours; b) >90% of participants reporting direct benefit from one -way text messages; 3) positive responses coded from 
post -intervention exit interview transcripts (to be det ermined at future date); 4) limited number of barriers to 
participation reported (to be determined at a future date).

Effects of Reading to Preterm Infants on Baby [CONTACT_42543]’ Well Being ID:  2014-1464 10/24/19 Study Protocol: Parents of infants born between 23 and 31weeks gestationalagewhowerebetween260/7and346/7weeks post menstrual age cared for in the NICU were approached for enrollment into the study. All infants were at least [ADDRESS_44739] as a requirement for participation in the study. Infants were excluded if:  they were considered too ill to participate by [CONTACT_42544], were on high frequency ventilation, were not expected to survive,  had chromosomal anomalies, had abnormalities of the midface, or had a family history of/suspected congenital hearing loss. The study was approved by [CONTACT_42545]. Of 21 sets of parents approached, 18 consented to participate. Two sets of parents decided to participate only with live reading and did not make a voice recording. Parents were given a children’ s book using a rhyming pattern of text to read, but other materials were allowed according to parental preference. Parents were asked to read or create a recordinglastingaminimumof15minbutupto60minof recorded reading. Mothers and fathers could read to their infants individually. Recordings were made using Garage Band® on a study computer and exported to bedside ipods®. Recording was played via humidity resistant Bluetooth enabled speakers in the incubator. Recorded reading was played for infants up to twice per day by [CONTACT_10327]. The primary care team could withhold any recorded or bedside reading exposure if an infant was deemed too unstable for that experience on any given day. Live and recorded reading could occur on the same day with the goal of at least [ADDRESS_44740] of reading on different days or time periods. All infants were being cared for in incubators on reading exposure days. For 2 infants, at one time period each, the infant was removed from the incubator and was being held for all comparison time points around that single reading exposure. Two infants had one day of data when the infant was held only during reading exposure. Data from those days were excluded from analysis. For all other live reading exposures, the infant was in the incubator with parents reading through the open portholes. Sound decibel levels were checked via a sound meter (Triplett SoniChek TSC-MC1 Mini Digital Sound Level meter) to ensure sound levels did not increase above baseline if above 45 decibels prior to reading exposure.  Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_42541], including heart rate (HR), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), oxygen saturation, apnea and bradycardia events, were continuously downloaded every 5 seconds directly from bedside GE monitors using BedMaster EX Software and exported to a spreadsheet for analysis. The data on mode of respi[INVESTIGATOR_42542]. Mean RR, HR, apnea and bradycardia epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], amount of supplemental oxygen needed, mode of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], if any, and number of periods with oxygen saturation <85% were compared to the reading period at 3 time points: [ADDRESS_44741] for categorical variables and student’s t test forcontinuous variables. P<0.05was considered as significant.

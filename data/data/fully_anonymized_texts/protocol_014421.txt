Clinical Trial Phase Ib/IIa
Background / Rationale The purpose of the trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of the human 
anti-CD38 antibody MOR202 (compound code MOR03087) in patients 
with anti-PLA2R antibody positive membranous nephropathy (aMN) 
eligible for immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or who have failed to 
respond to previous IST.
The main treatment rationale is the reduction of membranous 
nephropathy (MN) specific anti-PLA2R autoantibodies through 
MOR202 mediated targeted depletion of autoantibody producing 
plasma cells.
Autoantibodies binding to the PLA2R antigen are highly specific to 
primary MN. They are present in approximately 70% of patients 
diagnosed with this condition.
It is clinically observed that anti-PLA2R antibody titers correlate tightly 
with disease activity. Taken together with the fact that the disease 
defining glomerular basement changes contain both PLA2R protein as 
well as antibody complex deposits, indirect evidence is provided that 
indeed anti-PLA2R antibodies play a causative role in MN.
Patients diagnosed with MN and proteinuria >3.5 g per day initially 
receive supportive therapy with a combination of angiotensin 
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs), statins and diuretics as per current clinical standard. If not 
responding with a significant decrease of proteinuria within months, 
escalation to IST is indicated with usage of cyclophosphamide, 
calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), even 
though none of these drugs is approved for use in MN. Recently 
introduced off-label use therapy with anti-CD20 therapeutic antibody 
rituximab (RTX) allows for a more targeted IST approach by [CONTACT_263291] [ADDRESS_320237]

The purpose of the trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of the human 
anti-CD38 antibody MOR202 (compound code MOR03087) in patients 
with anti-PLA2R antibody positive membranous nephropathy (aMN) 
eligible for immunosuppressive therapy (1ST) or who have failed to 
respond to previous 1ST. 
The main treatment rationale is the reduction of membranous 
nephropathy (MN) specific anti-PLA2R autoantibodies through 
MOR202 mediated targeted depletion of autoantibody producing 
plasma cells. 
Autoantibodies binding to the PLA2R antigen are highly specific to 
primary MN. They are present in approximately 70% of patients 
diagnosed with this condition. 
It is clinically observed that anti-PLA2R antibody titers correlate tightly 
with disease activity. Taken together with the fact that the disease 
defining glomerular basement changes contain both PLA2R protein as 
well as antibody complex deposits, indirect evidence is provided that 
indeed anti-PLA2R antibodies play a causative role in MN. 
Patients diagnosed with MN and proteinuria >3.5 g per day initially

CTP v7.0, 01-Jul-2020 Protocol Number: MOR202C103 M-PLACE
B cell populations involved in producing autoantibodies. However, in 
MN patients with high anti-PLA2R antibody titers, response rates with 
RTX seem to be low. One reason could be that a substantial amount of 
anti-PLA2R antibodies are produced by a mature, long-lived plasma 
cell pool with a CD20 negative, but CD38 positive immuno-phenotype, 
potentially limiting the efficacy of an anti-CD20 therapeutic approach.
Thus, an anti-CD38 directed specific plasma cell depletion approach 
employing the monoclonal antibody MOR202 may provide a viable 
therapeutic option sparing patients of significant toxicity of broader 
acting immunosuppressive agents, and that is possibly effective in 
patients with limited benefits from anti-CD20 directed therapy.
Clinical Trial Objectives
(Key Primary and  
Secondary)PRIM ARY OBJECTIVE:
To assess the safety and tolerability of MOR202 treatment in subjects 
with aMN.
KEY SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:
To assess the effect of MOR202 on serum anti-PLA2R antibodies in 
subjects with aMN.
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:
1. To assess the immunogenicity of MOR202 (anti-MOR202 
antibody formation).
2. To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of MOR202.
3. To assess the safety in subjects with aMN after MOR202 
treatment and during the follow-up phase.
 
Clinical Trial Endpoints  
(Key Primary and  
Secondary)PRIM ARY ENDPOINT:
Incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). 
KEY SECONDARY ENDPOINT:
Best immunological response: rate of stringent immunological complete 
response (sICR), immunological complete response (ICR) and 
immunological partial response (IPR) based on reduction of serum 
anti-PLA2R antibody titer.

Safety run-in The safety run-in period consists of the following:
The first three subjects dosed in this trial (regardless of cohort) will be 
treated and observed until Cycle 2, Day 1 (C2D1) or until they 
demonstrate a toxicity leading to discontinuation of treatment, 
whichever is earlier.
Treatment initiation of further subjects will be paused and re-started 
after completion of the safety run-in period, unless any grade 4/5 
adverse drug reaction (ADR) (i.e. AE at least suspected to be possibly 
related to MOR202) occurs.
If a MOR202 related grade 4/[ADDRESS_320246] cycle as well as laboratory values (biochemistry and 
hematology). It will entail a recommendation either to keep the current 
dose of MOR202 or to adapt the dose for the remainder of the trial or 
to terminate the trial because of unacceptable toxicity. The evaluation 
will be performed within two weeks after completion of the safety 
run-in phase.
Statistical M ethods and  
Data AnalysisAll data in this Phase Ib/IIa trial will be summarized descriptively 
using appropriate tabular overviews. Summary statistics for continuous 
variables will include number of subjects, mean, median, Q1, Q3, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. For categorical 
variables, frequencies and percentages will be provided. When 
required for the analysis of a particular variable, the baseline value will 
be the last recorded value prior to first treatment. For trial endpoints 
point estimates and 95% confidence limits will be presented. 
Time-to-event endpoints will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier 
methodology. No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be 
performed.

4. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the trial is to assess safety and efficacy of the human anti-CD38 antibody MOR202 
(compound MOR03087) in subjects with anti-PLA2R antibody positive membranous nephropathy 
(aMN) eligible for immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or who have failed to respond to previous 
IST.
Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adults 
(Medawar et al 1990) .  About 80% of MN cases are idiopathic, 20% are related to other diseases 
or exposures (Couser et al 2017) .  The overall global incidence is estimated at 1.2 per 100,000 per 
year (Mc Grogan et al 2011) .
Although up to 30% of patients experience spontaneous remissions, and although the disease 
usually progresses slowly, approximately 30% to 40% of patients eventually develop end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) (Ruggenenti et al 2003, Troyanov et al 2004) .  Patients with MN remaining 
nephrotic are at increased risk for thromboembolic (Wagoner et al 1983)  and cardiovascular events 
(Lee et al 2016) .  Currently, there is no approved standard treatment for MN and there is no 
predictive test available that identifies patients who will undergo spontaneous remission. The 
current treatment regimen mainly comprises off-label use of various non-immunosuppressive and 
immunosuppressive drugs (Couser et al 2017, Bomback et al 2018) .
Commonly, patients presenting with proteinuria and an established (histological) diagnosis of MN 
receive supportive, non-immunosuppressive therapy. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this consists of a combination of 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 
statins and diuretics. Evidence of a direct therapeutic effect of ACEIs and/or ARBs either 
immunologically or on proteinuria directly is lacking, particularly in light of the aforementioned 
underlying rate of spontaneous remissions.
Should supportive therapy not lead to reduction of proteinuria within months, treatment is 
escalated by [CONTACT_263302], calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs: cyclosporine [CSA] or tacrolimus), 
mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) or rituximab (RTX). To a lesser extent, adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) has been used. Treatment effects of these combinations appear to be similar: 
remission of proteinuria can be expected in about 50 to 60% of patients in the first year and 70 to 
80% at 2 to 3 years (Couser et al 2017) .
Out of all patients with primary MN not receiving IST, 30% to 40% progress to ESRD in [ADDRESS_320271] reduces the progression rate to 10% or less (Bomback et al 2018) .  Relapses 
in proteinuria are seen in about 25% of patients previously treated with IST. The cases are usually 
re-treated with a different IST combinations (Couser et al 2017, Bomback et al 2018) .
Autoantibodies binding to the PLA2R antigen are highly specific to primary MN. They are present 
in approximately 70% of patients diagnosed with this condition (Beck et al 2009) .  It is clinically 
observed that anti-PLA2R antibody titers correlate tightly with disease activity (Bomback et al  
2018) .  Taken together with the fact that the disease defining glomerular basement changes contain 
both PLA2R protein as well as antibody complex deposits, indirect evidence is provided that

4. INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of the trial is to assess safety and efficacy of the human anti-CD38 antibody MOR202 
(compound MOR03087) in subjects with anti-PLA2R antibody positive membranous nephropathy 
(aMN) eligible for immunosuppressive therapy (1ST) or who have failed to respond to previous 
1ST. 
Membranous nephropathy (MN) is the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in adults 
(Medawar et al 1990 ). About 80% of MN cases are idiopathic, 20% are related to other diseases 
or exposures (Couser et al 2017 ). The overall global incidence is estimated at 1.2 per 100,000 per 
year (Mc Grogan et al 2011 ). 
Although up to 30% of patients experience spontaneous remissions, and although the disease 
usually progresses slowly, approximately 30% to 40% of patients eventually develop end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) (Ruggenenti et al 2003 , Troyanov et al 2004 ). Patients with MN remaining 
nephrotic are at increased risk for thromboembolic (Wagoner et al 1983 ) and cardiovascular events 
(Lee et al 2016 ). Currently, there is no approved standard treatment for MN and there is no 
predictive test available that identifies patients who will undergo spontaneous remission. The 
current treatment regimen mainly comprises off-label use of various non-immunosuppressive and 
immunosuppressive drugs (Couser et al 2017 , Bomback et al 2018 ). 
Commonly, patients presenting with proteinuria and an established (histological) diagnosis of MN 
receive supportive, non-immunosuppressive therapy. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], this consists of a combination of 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 
statins and diuretics. Evidence of a direct therapeutic effect of ACEis and/or ARBs either 
immunologically or on proteinuria directly is lacking, particularly in light of the aforementioned 
underlying rate of spontaneous remissions. 
Should supportive therapy not lead to reduction of proteinuria within months, treatment is 
escalated by [CONTACT_18120] 1ST with the most common 1ST regimens being cyclophosphamide 
combined with steroids, calcineurin inhibitors (CNis: cyclosporine [CSA] or tacrolimus), 
mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) or rituximab (RTX). To a lesser extent, adrenocorticotropic 
hormone (ACTH) has been used. Treatment effects of these combinations appear to be similar: 
remission of proteinuria can be expected in about 50 to 60% of patients in the first year and 70 to 
80% at 2 to 3 years (Couser et al 2017 ). 
Out of all patients with primary MN not receiving 1ST, 30% to 40% progress to ESRD in [ADDRESS_320272] reduces the progression rate to 10% or less (Bomback et al 2018 ). Relapses 
in proteinuria are seen in about 25% of patients previously treated with 1ST. The cases are usually 
re-treated with a different 1ST combination s (Couser et al 2017 , Bomback et al 2018 ). 
Autoantibodies binding to the PLA2R antigen are highly specific to primary MN. They are present 
in approximately 70% of patients diagnosed with this condition (Beck et al 2009 ). It is clinicall y 
observed that anti-PLA2R antibody titers correlate tightly with disease activity (Bomback et al 
2018 ). Taken together with the fact that the disease defining glomerular basement changes contain 
both PLA2R protein as well as antibody complex deposits, indirect evidence is provided that 
indeed anti-PLA2R antibodies play a causative role in MN. This in consequence currently leads 
to a change of previously established therapy algorithms, i.e. to an 1ST guided by [CONTACT_14181]-PLA2R 
titers in patients where these antibodies are detectable. Nowadays, patients with elevated

circulating levels of anti-PLA2R antibodies and proteinuria >3.[ADDRESS_320273] (Couser et al 2017, Bomback et al 2018, Vriese et al 2017) .
The above described ISTs exhibit considerable toxicity: 25% of patients treated with 
cyclophosphamide demonstrate adverse events (AEs) such as infections, infertility, hematologic 
toxicity and malignancy later in life (Couser et al 2017) .  Disadvantages of CNIs include long-term 
nephrotoxicity, the need to closely monitor drug levels and the increased risk for hypertension and 
diabetes. Relapse rates with CNIs seem to be higher than with cyclophosphamide [40 to 50 % 
versus 25%] (Cattran and Brenchley 2017, Tran et al 2015, van de Logt et al 2016) .
Therapy with RTX, an anti-CD20 therapeutic antibody, allows for a more targeted IST approach 
by [CONTACT_263303] B cell populations involved in producing autoantibodies. RTX response rates seem 
to be similar to alkylating agents and CNIs, whereas side effects seem to be less than for other 
drugs used in IST (Ruggenenti et al 2012, Fervenza et al 2017, Fervenza et al 2015) .  A prospective 
randomized trial testing RTX versus Cyclosporin A found RTX to be non-inferior (Fervenza et al  
2017) .
Interestingly, CD20 is not expressed on mature antibody producing plasma cells, the main source 
of endogenous immunoglobulins. Indeed, a variable but essential amount of the circulating 
antiPLA2R antibodies may be produced by a mature, long-lived plasma cell pool with a CD20 
negative but CD38 positive immunophenotype. Residual long-lived plasma cells could be a 
possible explanation for RTX non-responders as well as data indicating a trend towards lower 
response rate of RTX in MN for subjects with high anti-PLA2R antibody titers (Ruggenenti et al  
2012, van de Logt et al 2018) .
Thus, an anti-CD38 directed specific plasma cell depletion by [CONTACT_263304]202 may provide a viable 
emerging therapeutic option sparing patients of significant toxicity of broader acting 
immunosuppressive agents, possibly effective in patients with limited benefit of an anti-CD20 
directed therapy.

4.2. Background - clinical studies
To date, MOR202 has been administered in the first-in-human (FIH) study MOR202C101 in 
91 subjects with MM. This study is a combined dose escalation and dose confirmation study with 
a maximum dose of 16 mg/kg administered i.v. once weekly (including a loading dose on Cycle 
1, Day 4). MOR202 was applied either as a single agent or in combination with dexamethasone 
(DEX), lenalidomide (LEN)/DEX or pomalidomide (POM)/DEX. The overall treatment duration 
was based on clinical response with a continuous treatment for up to 3 years. The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached in this trial and the recommended dose was defined at 16 
mg/kg once weekly (i.e. the highest dose tested). As of 30-Nov-2019, 21 subjects were treated at 
this dose level for more than 6 months (13 subjects for more than 12 months and 9 subjects for 
more than 24 months) (Jarutat 2018, Raab et al 2020) .   
 
4.2.1. Clinical pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity
The PK of MOR202 administered i.v. to MM patients has been well characterized by a 
2-compartment population PK model. The volume of distribution was found to be increased at 
lower MOR202 doses most likely reflecting the impact of target-mediated drug disposition 
(TMDD) effects. So far, anti-drug antibody (ADA) samples from [ADDRESS_320275] commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in the FIH study 
(MOR202C101) in MM were hematological AEs, such as lymphocytopenia, leukocytopenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anemia.
The combination drugs for MM used in the FIH study are intrinsically myelosuppressive when 
administered as single agents. Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) may further deteriorate 
cytopenias induced by [CONTACT_263306]. Cytopenic effects are well known and 
manageable via treatment with colony stimulating factors and blood transfusions.
Non-hematological TEAEs related to MOR202 reported in more than 5% of subjects overall in the 
FIH study were fatigue, infusion-related reactions, respi[INVESTIGATOR_263270], diarrhea, 
nausea, hypokalemia, C-reactive protein increased, cough, constipation, hypophosphatemia, 
pyrexia, nasopharyngitis, and oral herpes.

6.1.1. Rationale for this Clinical Trial
This trial primarily seeks to assess the safety and tolerability of MOR202 therapy in aMN subjects. 
As a key further objective, the immunological response under MOR202 therapy will be assessed. 
Reduction in proteinuria as an early clinical efficacy parameter will be measured as well.
The monoclonal anti-CD38 antibody MOR202 selectively binds to the CD38 antigen and thereby 
[CONTACT_263307].
Plasma cells and plasmablasts are the source of pathogenic anti-PLA2R antibodies. Published 
evidence shows a tight correlation of the clinical course of MN with PLA2R autoantibody titers: 
high titers and sustained or re-emerging positivity of anti-PLA2R antibody titers during therapy 
have been demonstrated as negative predictors for outcome. Here, MOR202’s mode of action 
provides a compelling rationale for hard-to-treat aMN subjects, i.e. those presenting with high 
autoantibody titers, or subjects with insufficient immunological response to prior therapy.

performed by [CONTACT_263308] (Safety Review 
Panel) as defined in a respective charter. The safety review will be held after C2D I of the third 
subject. 
The outcome of this safety review will also provide a confirmation on the dose and dosing schedule 
for MQR202 or recommendation for an adapted dose and/or dosing schedule to be used in the 
following part of the trial or recommendation for termination of the trial because of unacceptable 
toxicity. Safety run-in subjects will continue the trial as per protocol during the safety review. 
Afterwards, their MQR202 dose may be altered as well. 
6.4. Screening Phase 
See Section 10.1 and Section 10.2. 
6.5. Treatment Phase 
All subjects enrolled in the trial will be treated for 24 weeks across six 28-day treatment cycles. 
In total, 9 doses ofMQR202 will be administered on the following treatment days: Cycle I Day 1, 
8, 15 and 22, and on Day I of Cycle 2 to 6 (for details see Figure I and Table 2). 
The Treatment Phase ends with the EQT visit, scheduled between [ADDRESS_320291] signing the 
informed consent form (ICF) until trial completion. 
Subjects will be on the clinical trial from signing of ICF until the EQS visit (i.e. a planned 
maximum time period of 58 weeks: up to 6-week screening phase, 24-week treatment phase and 
28-week follow-up phase). 
6.8. Risks and Benefits to Subjects 
Similar safety findings were also observed in the FiH trial MQR202Cl01 (see Section 4.2 and 
Section 6.1.2). In this trial administering MQR202 to MM subjects the most frequent MQR202 
related treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, 
lymphopenia, and infections. No ADAs were detected in this trial until the primary completion 
date (samples analyzed from 85 subjects treated for up to 29 months at a maximum) (Jarutat 2018).

MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 37 of 73CTP v7.0, 01-Jul-2020 Protocol Number: MOR202Cl03 M-PLACE 
It is expected that the potential risks as described above will be adequately controlled by [CONTACT_263309] (e.g. by [CONTACT_263310]) as well as by [CONTACT_263311]. Since a major pharmacological effect of MOR202 is depletion of plasma cells 
and plasmablasts, the risk for a potentially reduced function of the adaptive immune system was 
further addressed. This comprises monitoring and potential substitution of total serum 
immunoglobulin as well as vaccination before trial start (see Section 7.1 and Section 7.2). 
MOR202 offers a novel mechanism of action that may have the potential to emerge as an important 
treatment option for aMN patients compared to current ( off-label) treatment options. Particularly 
with calcineurin inhibitors (CNls) being intrinsically nephrotoxic and cyclophosphamide as an 
alkylating cytotoxic drug being associated with known hematotoxicity, risk of ovarian 
insufficiency and secondary malignancy, new therapeutic options are needed for the treatment of 
MN. Recent literature suggests that RTX, although more favorable in the safety profile compared 
to the aforementioned drugs, might have decreased activity in high antiPLA2R antibody titer 
subjects (Ruggenenti et al 2015). This patient population is specifically addressed by [CONTACT_133075] 1 of 
this trial. 
Non response to an immunosuppressive regimen may be caused by [CONTACT_263312]-lived plasma 
cells producing anti-PLA2R antibodies. These cells demonstrate a high expression of MOR202's 
target CD38. This patient population is specifically addressed by [CONTACT_133075] 2 of this trial. 
In this context and taking into account the existing clinical experience with MOR202, the overall 
risk/benefit ratio for the trial subjects is regarded as acceptable. 
7. SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 
All subjects must sign the ICF and must meet the following selection criteria at screening to 
participate in the trial. 
7.1. Inclusion Criteria 
Since deviations from inclusion criteria can have a negative impact on subject safety or the 
scientific integrity and regulatory acceptability of the clinical trial, the Sponsor will not provide 
waivers to them (parameters in italics will be tested at screening; parameters not in italics will be 
determined locally): 
Cohort 1 and 2: 
1. 18 to :S: 80 years (at date of signing ICF). 
2. Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of~ 3. 000 gig OR proteinuria 3.500 g/[ADDRESS_320293] according to the investigator's 
judgment. The diagnosis of MN should be histologically documented with a diagnostic 
biopsy; for this purpose, a biopsy at screening or an archival biopsy acquired within 5 years 
prior to screening is acceptable. 
4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 50 mL/min/1. 73 m2• Alternatively eGFR 
30 and< 50 mL/min/1. 73m2 and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) score< 
25% in a renal biopsy obtained within the last 6 months prior to start of screening (if not 
available, a biopsy should be performed at screening to obtain the IFTA assessment).

supportive care as per institutional guidelines. This may include medications such as diuretics, 
anti-lipid-medication, anti-hypertensive (e.g. ACEI), anticoagulation, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, 
anticholinergics, antispasmodics, antipyretics, antihistamines, analgesics, or antibiotics. The 
Investigator should instruct the subject not to take any additional medications (including over-the-
counter products) during the trial without prior consultation. 
Investigators should document all medication and other therapy (including non-drug procedure) 
taken by/administered to the subject during the entire course of the trial including the screening 
and the follow-up phase. The entry must include the dose, regimen, route of administration, 
indication, and dates of use (start, end). 
8.3.1 Management of Infusion Related Reactions (IRRs) 
If a subject presents with a grade 1 or 2 infusion reaction: 
• The infusion should be stopped immediately. 
• The subject should receive appropriate further treatment with an antihistamine, 
paracetamol (acetaminophen), and glucocorticoids as clinically indicated.

(acetaminophen), and glucocorticoids and, as necessary, further medications (i.e. 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilator).
• Only after the resolution of all symptoms to < grade 1, and after having received 
appropriate prophylactic medication(s) as described above, the infusion may be resumed 
at an infusion rate of 25% of the initial rate. If, after [ADDRESS_320301]’s symptoms do not 
return and vital signs are stable, the infusion rate may be increased to a maximum of 50% 
of the initial rate.
• If, after the resumption of the infusion, symptoms return (irrespective of grade), the 
infusion must be discontinued for that visit date and the infusion tubing should be 
disconnected. Based on the investigator’s decision, the subject may receive further 
MOR202 at the next scheduled visit provided clinically appropriate precautions were 
taken.
• If a subj ect who developed a grade [ADDRESS_320302] presents with a grade 4 IRR:
• The infusion must be discontinued immediately and the infusion tubing should be 
disconnected.
• The subject must receive appropriate treatment with an antihistamine, paracetamol 
(acetaminophen), and glucocorticoids and, if necessary, further medications (i.e. 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilator).
• The subject must not receive any further MOR202 infusion and must discontinue trial 
treatment, subject may enter the follow-up phase.

8.3.2 Infection Prophylaxis
The immunoglobulin level will be monitored throughout the trial. If this level drops below 4 g/L, 
initiating substitution therapy with a polyvalent immunoglobulin according to local institutional 
guidelines is advised. Generally, a trough level of at least 5 g/L shall be targeted, with a 
substitution of 0.2 g per kg body weight every 3 to 4 weeks.
Furthermore, investigators may follow institutional guidelines on infection prophylaxis for 
subjects regarded to be at high risk of infection.
8.4. Prohibited Therapy: Immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (IST)
The use of ISTs other than MOR202 is prohibited during the entire trial. This includes, but is not 
limited to ACTH, chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], immunotherapy, biological response modifiers, mAbs with or

10. CLINICAL TRIAL ASSESSMENTS
The Schedule of Assessments is presented in  Table 2.  All examinations or assessments to be 
performed at a specific visit are indicated with an X. Results obtained from these assessments need 
to be documented in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263273] a central 
laboratory.
Visits maybe postponed due to AEs as described above (see  Section 8.7) , but in all other situations 
conducting visits as scheduled is important.
Each treatment cycle (C) consist of 28 days (D). Allowed visit windows are
• ± 2 days for C1D8 to C2D1,
• ± 7 days for C3D1 to C6D1,
• + 14 days for EOT visit, and
• ± 14 days for FUV and EOS visit.
Further excursions from the timing of assessments will be considered protocol deviations and 
should be recorded in the source documents along with the reason.
The date of the next visit will always be recalculated based on the actual date of the previous IMP 
administration.
Subjects missing a treatment visit within the specified visit window for reasons other than toxicity 
will get the next dose at the next scheduled visit and thus receive less than the planned 9 MOR202 
applications.

10.1. Screening Phase 
All subjects must meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria listed in 
Section 7.[ADDRESS_320333] be obtained from all 
subjects prior to their entering the clinical trial. 
The Screening Phase begins on the date when the ICF is signed; it will last for up to 42 days and

• Lipid panel
• Urine analysis
• eGFR
• Liver function tests (AST, ALT, gamma-GT, bilirubin)
• 24 hour urine for urine protein, creatinine, and sodium
An abnormal laboratory value may be reanalyzed during the screening phase.
Substitution with immunoglobulins before or during screening is permitted. Data on immuno-
globulin administration should be entered in the eCRF as concomitant medication.
24 hour urine:
For screening, subjects will be given supplies for collection of 24-hour urine and will return the 
collected sample within the visit window. For visits C4D1, EOT, FUV, and EOS the sample will 
be collected prior to the visit. Subjects who forget to collect this sample prior to the visit, start a 
24-hour urine sample at the visit day and return it the next working day after completion. If the 
collected urine does not contain at least 5 mg creatinine/kg/day for females and 6 mg 
creatinine/kg/day for males, urine collection needs to be repeated immediately without undue 
delay.
Kidney biopsy
• Mandatory:
o For all subjects if not done within the last 5 years before start of screening.
o For subjects with eGFR < 50 mL/min/1.73m2  if not done within the last [ADDRESS_320334] 6 months 
before start of screening.
• Optional:
o For all other subjects.
The histological assessment of a fresh kidney biopsy obtained under this clinical trial protocol 
should include a confirmation of the diagnosis of MN as well as the grade of any existing 
interstitial fibrosis. Biopsies will further be subject to biomarker studies as outlined in the 
exploratory objectives, theses analyses will be retrospective in nature.
Females of child bearing potential (FCBP, for definition see above  Section 7.1)  will be tested for 
pregnancy (serum or urine analysis at different visits). Of note, in each case of delayed menstrual 
period (over one month between menstruations during the study) confirmation of absence of 
pregnancy with pregnancy test (urine or serum on discretion of investigator) is strongly 
recommended. This recommendation also applies to FCBP with infrequent or irregular menstrual 
cycles.
FCBPs and non-vasectomized males will be counselled for pregnancy risks.
The assessments performed during screening may substitute as baseline data if for any reason 
baseline values from the baseline period (Section 10.3 and Table 2)  are missing.

On a single occasion during screening, it is permitted to repeat the central laboratory assessments 
of serum chemistry and hematology if out-of-range laboratory results might have been caused by 
a transient, medically plausible event, e.g. dehydration. The repeat procedure and the rationale 
behind must be documented in the source data. Such repeated assessment will not be counted as 
“re screening” for that subject.
For all screening failure subjects data on demographics and inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
documented in the eCRF. Serious adverse events will be reported in accordance with 
Section 10.8.10.
For subjects requiring blood transfusions the presence of high levels of therapeutic anti-CD38 
antibodies in host serum like MOR202 most likely interferes with blood bank serologic tests, 
particularly the indirect Coombs test (Oostendorp et al 2015, Weinig 2017 [MOR202L069]).
Therefore, subjects must be typed and screened for the eventual presence of irregular antibodies 
before the first administration of MOR202. Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_263275]202 treatment as per local practice. Red blood cell genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_263276]38 
antibodies and may be performed at any time.
In the event of a planned transfusion blood transfusion centers should be notified of the 
interference with indirect antiglobulin tests.
If an emergency transfusion is required, non-cross-matched ABO/RhD-compatible RBCs can be 
given per local blood bank practices.
Further technical guidance to mitigate this interference is published in the AABB bulletin #16-02 
(AABB) , e.g. a baseline typi[INVESTIGATOR_263277]202 
treatment and/or the use of dithiothreitol (DTT)-treated cells for antibody detection (screening) 
and identification during MOR202 treatment as well as at least [ADDRESS_320336] MOR202 
administration (Chapuy et al 2016, Chapuy et al 2015) .
10.1.1. Screening Failures
Subjects who sign an informed consent but fail to start treatment for any reason will be considered 
a screen failure. Minimum data requirements for the eCRF are: the reason for not starting 
treatment, demographic information, and SAEs.
10.2. Re-screening Procedures
Subjects can be re-screened at the discretion of the investigator under certain circumstances. 
Rescreening is restricted to one attempt per subject and can only be performed if one of the 
following criteria is met:
• The subject has already consented and met all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria and his or her enrollment was delayed due to an unexpected change in the subject’s 
personal situation (e.g., family issues).
• The subject previously failed to be eligible due to a circumstance (e.g., planned surgery, 
pathological laboratory test result) that has resolved.
• The subject previously failed screening but has become eligible for the trial based on a 
change in the inclusion and exclusion criteria as a result of a protocol amendment.

• The subject was successfully screened but could not start treatment within the screening 
phase.
The following procedures apply:
• The subject must sign and date a new ICF as part of the rescreening procedure.
• The subject will receive a new unique identification number via the interactive response 
technology.
• A new electronic case report form (eCRF) should be completed.
• The subject will be documented as rescreened in the source documents.
• All screening procedures must be completed again.
A rescreened subject can be enrolled, if all of the inclusion criteria are met and none of the 
exclusion criteria are met.
10.3. Baseline -  Cycle 1  Day 1  immediate pre-dose assessments
Before administration of MOR202, any missing data from screening shall be obtained. For 
assessments refer to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) .  MOR202 may not be applied without 
baseline UPCR value from [ADDRESS_320340] treatment cycle MOR202 will be administered at 16 mg/kg once weekly (i.e. 4 doses 
for cycle 1  in total). In treatment cycle 2-6 MOR202 will be administered at 16 mg/kg once every 
[ADDRESS_320341] day of each cycle (i.e. C2D1, C3D1, ...; 5 doses for Cycle 2 to 6 in total). For 
assessments refer to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) .
Before each dose of MOR202, the complete blood count (CBC) needs to be determined at the 
local laboratory. The time window from blood draw to MOR 202 application should not exceed 
48 hours. The values need to be recorded in the eCRF.
10.5. Follow-up Phase
Safety measurements will be performed in the Follow-Up Phase which spans from the EOT Visit 
until the EOS Visit: EOT takes place [ADDRESS_320342] administration of MOR202. The
visit window is + [ADDRESS_320343] administration of MOR202. After the

The investigator needs to specify for any abnormal laboratory findings whether clinically relevant 
or not. If the finding is considered clinically relevant, it constitutes an AE and should be recorded 
as such in the eCRF. Additional diagnostic tests are at the discretion of the investigator. 
10.8.2. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be measured as described in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). Vital sign 
parameters include measurements of heart rate, body temperature, and systolic/diastolic BP. BP 
and heart rate are measured after a period of [ADDRESS_320349] 12-lead ECG will be obtained as described in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). 
All ECG recordings will be read at the site according to local practice. 
10.8.4. Physical Examination 
Physical examination (PE) will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 
2). A full PE will be performed at the screening, EQT and EOS visit. 
Full PE should include at least vital signs, general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat 
including Waldeyer lymphatic structures, lungs, breasts and axillae, lymph nodes, cardiovascular 
system, back and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], abdomen (if applicable including spleen size below the costal margin), 
extremities, infusion site, and a basic neurological examination (if any neurological abnormalities 
are noted, a full neurological examination will be performed). 
Limited PEs must include at least vital signs and general appearance and should be focused on 
clinical symptoms observed. If clinically indicated, a full PE must be performed at any trial visit.

10.8.5. Adverse Events (AEs)
Site personnel must remain vigilant for the occurrence of AEs. It is their responsibility to detect, 
document and report (S)AEs.
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether 
or not considered related to that product.
Generally, the diagnosis instead of the individual symptoms should be reported as the AE term. If 
a diagnosis has been reported as an AE, it is not necessary to report each individual sign and 
symptom of that AE as a separate AE. For example, if a febrile neutropenia is reported as an AE, 
there is no need to report neutrophil count decrease and fever above 38°C, or other related signs, 
symptoms, or laboratory values as separate AEs. However, if such events occur in isolation, and 
febrile neutropenia is not diagnosed, then each event should be reported as an AE.
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused 
the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Generally, only one such event should be reported.
AEs include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status after signing of 
the ICF. Also an increase in the frequency or intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_263278] (e.g. invasive procedures) fall under the 
definition of AE.
The following events do not meet the AE definition:
• Medical procedures will not be reported as AE. The underlying condition being the reason to 
perform the medical procedure will be reported as AE.
• Events without an untoward medical occurrence (e.g. planned surgery with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263279]).
• Progression of underlying disease will not be reported as AE.
• Pre-existing diseases or pre-existing medical conditions known or detected before ICF signature 
[CONTACT_263339].
All serious and non-serious AEs must be followed up for a final outcome until the end of the 
follow-up phase. Subjects prematurely withdrawn from the clinical trial will be followed up at 
least until [ADDRESS_320350] IMP treatment. A final outcome of “unknown” is not considered 
acceptable. A final outcome of “not yet resolved” is acceptable.
The subjects will be closely observed and questioned for any kind of AE during the clinical trial 
procedures and at follow-up appointments throughout the clinical trial period with non-leading 
questioning (e.g. “How do you feel?”). The subjects will be instructed to immediately report any 
symptoms and signs to the site personnel (i.e. between formal observations).

10.8.6. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)
An SAE is defined as any AE that:
• Results in death
• Is life threatening (immediate risk)
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263280]) unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263281]:
- Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with deterioration 
of symptoms related to aMN.
- Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to aMN and 
has not worsened since signing of the ICF.
- Social reason and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s general 
condition.
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.
• Is another important medical event. Based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above (e.g. emergency treatment at home).
NOTE: The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was, in the view of the 
reporting investigator, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Medical judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether an AE is serious in other situations: Important AEs that are not 
immediately life threatening or do not result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263282].
10.8.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
AEs of special interest (AESI) in this clinical trial should be reported along with their respective 
symptoms (e.g. hives, chills, and fever for infusion reaction) using the trial specific SAE report 
form.
AESIs include:
• Infusion related reactions to MOR202 > grade 3
• Cytokine release syndrome
• Allergic reactions to MOR202
• Infections > grade 3
• Neutropenia > grade 3 (< 1.0 x 109 /L)
• Thrombocytopenia > grade 3 (< 50.0 x 109 /L)
• Major bleeds (defined as critical organ bleed or hemoglobin decrease of more than 20 g/L 
within 24 h)

10.8.8. Pregnancy
All pregnancies detected during the clinical trial will be reported in the trial specific pregnancy 
form and will be followed up until delivery or abortion.
Each pregnancy of a clinical trial subject or a female partner of a male clinical trial subject must 
be reported within [ADDRESS_320352], this should be reported as a SAE of the child.
The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital 
abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. Every infant has to be followed up for 
3 months after delivery.
10.8.9. Assessment of AEs, SAEs and AESIs
As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine the following:
• Relationship to trial drug (suspected/not suspected).
• Duration (start and end date or if continuing at EOS).
• Intensity: The intensity of all AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following definitions:
o Mild: Tolerable
o Moderate: Interferes with normal activity
o Severe: Incapacitating (causes inability to perform usual activity or work).
• Toxicity grade (severity): The toxicity grade of AEs will be graded according to the 
NCI-CTCAE version 5.0 of November 27, 2017 using the following definitions:
o Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.
o Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non-invasive intervention indicated; limiting age- 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_263283], using the telephone, managing money, etc.)
o Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-
care activities of daily living.
o Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
o Grade 5: Death related to AE.

discontinued due to this AE; concomitant medication taken; non-drug therapy given; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).
10.8.10. Reporting of AEs, SAEs and AESIs
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the EOS visit. For screening 
failure patients only SAEs will be collected.
All SAEs and AESI must be reported to IQVIA Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness. The investigator will submit any updated (follow-up) SAE data within 24 hours of 
investigator awareness.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after conclusion of the study 
participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including AEs resulting in death, at 
any time after a participant has been discontinued from the study, and he/she considers the event 
to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must 
promptly notify IQVIA Pharmacovigilance.
All AEs, including SAEs will be reported in eCRF. SAEs and AESIs will automatically be 
transmitted to IQVIA Pharmacovigilance via the eCRF. If the eCRF is not available, a paper SAE 
Report Form should be sent to IQVIA Pharmacovigilance via email or fax or the Investigator 
should call the IQVIA SAE hotline within 24 hours of being made aware of the SAE/AESI. When 
the eCRF system becomes available again, the SAE/AESI information must be entered as soon as 
possible of the system becoming available. Refer for contact [CONTACT_263319].
The sponsor or designee will report all SAEs to local health authorities, Independent Ethics 
Committees (IECs) or Institutional/Independent Review Boards (IRBs) and investigators as 
required by [CONTACT_427].
10.9. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
Blood samples for pharmacokinetics (PK; MOR202) and Immunogenicity (ADA; antiMOR202) 
should be collected on the visits specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) .
The details of blood sample handling and shipment instructions will be provided in a separate 
laboratory manual.
The actual dates and times of PK and ADA blood sampling will be recorded in the eCRF.
10.10. Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers
Blood and urine samples for biomarkers should be collected on the visits specified in the Schedule 
of Assessments (Table 2) .
The details of sample handling and shipment instructions will be provided in a separate laboratory 
manual.
The actual dates and times of biomarker sampling will be recorded in the eCRF.
Due to the exploratory nature of some assays, the sponsor may decide at any point during the trial 
to terminate these assessments, in which case the sites will be informed accordingly.

11. DATA HANDLING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
11.1. Completing and Signing Case Report Forms 
Trained clinical trial site personnel will enter the data into the eCRF. For any missing data a reason 
should be given. Any errors should be corrected within the electronic system and source 
documents. The audit trail will record all changes made, the date and time of the correction, and 
the person correcting the error. 
11.2. Clinical Monitoring 
The Sponsor or designee will monitor the clinical trial conduct at the clinical trial sites to ensure 
data quality (accurate and complete data collection), and protection of subjects' safety and rights. 
11.3. Audit and Inspection 
The sponsor or regulatory authorities may audit the investigational site. The sponsor's or IQ VIA' s 
Quality Assurance Unit, independent of the Clinical Research and Development Department, is 
responsible for auditing the trial. 
The investigator(s) must accept that regulatory authorities conduct an inspection to verify 
compliance of the trial with GCP. 
11.4. Clinical Data Management 
The sponsor or designee will be responsible for processing and quality control of the data. The 
handling of data, including data quality control, will comply with all applicable regulatory 
guidelines. Adverse events and concomitant medication terms will be coded with the current 
MedDRA version and WHO medication dictionary. At the end of the trial all MedDRA codes will 
be updated to the newest versions. 
11.5. Archiving 
All trial documentation at the sites and Sponsor site will be archived in accordance with 
International Council for Harmonization (ICH) E6-Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the 
sponsor's quality standards and SOPs. 
12. STATISTICAL METHODS AND PLANNED ANALYSIS 
The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_23638]/or designated CRO. Any data analysis carried out 
independently by [CONTACT_263320]. 
It is planned that the data from participating centers in this protocol will be combined, so that an 
adequate number of subjects will be available for analysis.

of MOR202 (e.g. screening phase) will be classified as non-treatment emergent adverse events 
and will be presented in a separate AE listing.
Adverse events will be coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA), system organ class (SOC) and preferred term. Incidence and frequency of all AEs 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], preferred term, relationship to treatment, severity and seriousness.
An AE summary table will be presented showing the number of events, number of subjects and 
the percentage of subjects in each cohort and overall having:
• All TEAEs
• TEAEs by [CONTACT_764]
• SAEs
• Drug-related TEAEs
• Drug-related TEAEs in each severity/toxicity grading
• TEAEs that led to treatment discontinuation
• IRRs by [CONTACT_263328] (AESI) in this trial are:
• Infusion related reactions to MOR202 > grade 3
• Cytokine release syndrome
• Allergic reactions to MOR202
• Infections > grade 3
• Neutropenia > grade 3 (< 1.0 x 109 /L)
• Thrombocytopenia > grade 3 (< 50.0 x 109 /L)
• Major bleeds (defined as critical organ bleed or hemoglobin decrease of more than 20 g/L 
within 24 h)
The sponsor will describe AESI, in addition to those reported as SAEs. AESI tabulations will be 
analogous to the tabulation of TEAEs.
As part of one of the secondary endpoint, the sponsor will analyze the incidences and severity of 
AEs of MOR202 during the follow-up phase until EOS. Post-treatment AE tabulations will be 
analogous to the tabulation of TEAEs.
The sponsor will discuss other significant AEs as appropriate, e.g. laboratory abnormalities that 
qualify as AEs (other than those meeting the definition for serious) and any events that led to an 
intervention (including premature discontinuation of IMP, increase of dose interval, or significant 
additional concomitant therapy) in addition to those reported as SAEs.
12.12.2. New Abnormalities
The sponsor will internally evaluate each clinical laboratory result, vital sign result, and ECG 
result to assess if it reflects a new abnormality, and for numeric data, to assess if it reflects a 
significant worsening from baseline or an outlying result or extreme value. These terms are defined 
for clinical laboratory results, vital sign results, and ECG results as follows:
• A new abnormality will be any abnormal post baseline result for a subject whose baseline 
value was within normal limits.

• IRRs by [CONTACT_263329] (AESI) in this trial are: 
• Infusion related reactions to MOR202 2: grade 3 
• Cytokine release syndrome 
• Allergic reactions to MOR202 
• Infections 2: grade 3 
• Neutropenia 2: grade 3 (< 1.0 x 109/L) 
• Thrombocytopenia 2: grade 3 (< 50.0 x 109/L) 
• Maj or bleeds ( defined as critical organ bleed or hemoglobin decrease of more than 20 g/L 
within 24 h) 
The sponsor will describe AESI, in addition to those reported as SAEs. AESI tabulations will be 
analogous to the tabulation of TEAEs. 
As part of one of the secondary endpoint, the sponsor will analyze the incidences and severity of 
AEs of MOR202 during the follow-up phase until EOS. Post-treatment AE tabulations will be 
analogous to the tabulation of TEAEs. 
The sponsor will discuss other significant AEs as appropriate, e.g. laboratory abnormalities that 
qualify as AEs ( other than those meeting the definition for serious) and any events that led to an 
intervention (including premature discontinuation of IMP, increase of dose interval, or significant 
additional concomitant therapy) in addition to those reported as SAEs. 
12.12.2. New Abnormalities 
The sponsor will internally evaluate each clinical laboratory result, vital sign result, and ECG 
result to assess if it reflects a new abnormality, and for numeric data, to assess if it reflects a 
significant worsening from baseline or an outlying result or extreme value. These terms are defined 
for clinical laboratory results, vital sign results, and ECG results as follows: 
• A new abnormality will be any abnormal post baseline result for a subject whose baseline 
value was within normal limits. 
MorphoSys AG Confidential Page 66 of73 
CTP v7.0, 01-Jul-2020 Protocol Number: MOR202C103 M-PLACE
• A significant worsening will be any numeric clinical laboratory result, vital sign result, or 
ECG interval measurement that represents a change from baseline by >25% of the baseline 
value, in the direction away from normal (i.e., in the direction that is clinically significant).
• An outlying result for any numeric laboratory result, vital sign result, or ECG interval 
measurement will be any post-administration change from baseline that meets either of the 
following criteria:
< 25th Percentile (Q1) - 1.5 * (interquartile range) OR
> 75th Percentile (Q3) + 1.5 * (interquartile range).
• An extreme value for any numeric laboratory result, vital sign result, or ECG interval 
measurement will be any post-administration change from baseline that meets either of the 
following criteria:
< 25th Percentile (Q1) -  3 * (interquartile range) OR
> 75th Percentile (Q3) + 3 * (interquartile range).
Subjects who demonstrate new abnormal results will be noted in data listings and reviewed by [CONTACT_103]. All results showing a significant worsening will be noted in data listings and reviewed by 
[CONTACT_456]. Outlying results or extreme values will be identified and reviewed in the context of 
the subject’s other abnormal results.
12.12.3. Clinical Laboratory Evaluation
The analysis of central laboratory parameters for each treatment arm will be presented, separated 
into blood parameters (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation) and urine parameters 
(urinalysis). All data collected in the course of the trial will be listed.
The analyses will be performed on FAS. Further details will be specified in the SAP.
12.12.4. Vital Signs
Descriptive summaries of actual values and changes from baseline will be calculated for vital 
signs. These summaries will be presented for the FAS at all time points. Each abnormal value 
will be flagged to show whether it is a value below or above the normal limit.
12.12.5. Electrocardiograms
Summary ECG assessment (categories: ‘normal’; ‘abnormal’, ‘clinically significant’; ‘abnormal’, 
‘not clinically significant’) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_263330].
Each result of the 12-lead ECG (PR, QRS, RR and QT interval values) will be flagged to show 
whether it is a value below or above the normal limit.
Summary statistics for all time points will be displayed for QT and both QTc correction methods. 
The Bazett’s correction method for QTc (Bazett 1920)  will be applied as follows:
Bazett’s Correction (QTcB) = QT/RR1 2
The Fridericia correction method for QTc (Fridericia 1920)  will be applied as follows:
Fridericia’s Correction (QTcF) = QT/RR1 3  
where relative rate (RR) = 60/heart rate

• A significant worsening will be any numeric clinical laboratory result, vital sign result, or 
ECG interval measurement that represents a change from baseline by > 25% of the baseline 
value, in the direction away from normal (i.e., in the direction that is clinically significant). 
• An outlying result for any numeric laboratory result, vital sign result, or ECG interval 
measurement will be any post-administration change from baseline that meets either of the 
following criteria: 
< 25th Percentile (QI) -1.5 * (interquartile range) OR 
> 75th Percentile (Q3) + 1.5 * (interquartile range). 
• An extreme value for any numeric laboratory result, vital sign result, or ECG interval 
measurement will be any post-administration change from baseline that meets either of the 
following criteria: 
< 25th Percentile (QI) - 3 * (interquartile range) OR 
> 75th Percentile (Q3) + 3 * (interquartile range). 
Subjects who demonstrate new abnormal results will be noted in data listings and reviewed by [CONTACT_103]. All results showing a significant worsening will be noted in data listings and reviewed by 
[CONTACT_456]. Outlying results or extreme values will be identified and reviewed in the context of 
the subject's other abnormal results.

12.12.4. Vital Signs 
Descriptive summaries of actual values and changes from baseline will be calculated for vital 
signs. These summaries will be presented for the FAS at all time points. Each abnormal value 
will be flagged to show whether it is a value below or above the normal limit. 
12.12.5. Electrocardiograms 
Summary ECG assessment (categories: 'normal'; 'abnormal', 'clinically significant'; 'abnormal', 
'not clinically significant') will be tabulated by [CONTACT_263330]. 
Each result of the 12-lead ECG (PR, QRS, RR and QT interval values) will be flagged to show 
whether it is a value below or above the normal limit. 
Summary statistics for all time points will be displayed for QT and both QTc correction methods. 
The Bazett's correction method for QTc (Bazett 1920) will be applied as follows: 
Bazett's Correction (QTcB) = QT/RR11 2 
The Fridericia correction method for QTc (Fridericia 1920) will be applied as follows: 
Fridericia's Correction (QTcF) = QT/RR1'3 
where relative rate (RR) = 60/heart rate

authorized representative will be required to sign the ICF prior to any study-specific procedures 
being performed. The original ICF must be kept as part of the study records at the site, and a copy 
must be provided to the subjects or their legally authorized representative. Subjects must be re-
consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. The 
process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the subject's source documents. 
13.3.3. Direct Access to Source Data/Documents 
The investigator must give access to all relevant data and records to monitors, auditors, other 
designated agents of the sponsor, IEC/IRB, and regulatory authorities as required. Personal 
medical information will always be treated as confidential. If an inspection of the clinical site is 
requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform the sponsor immediately that this 
request has been made. 
13.3.4. Confidentiality 
Subjects will be assigned a unique identifier by [CONTACT_456]. The investigator must ensure that any 
subject's data that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject names or 
any information that would make the subject identifiable will not be transferred. 
13.4. Financial Disclosure 
Investigators and sub-investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial 
information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial 
certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators and 
sub-investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course 
of the study and for I year after completion of the study. 
13.5. Publication Policy 
Any presentation or publication of data from this trial will be intended as a joint publication by [CONTACT_1275](s)/appropriate trial site personnel and appropriate sponsor personnel. Authorship will 
follow the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors Uniform Requirements for 
Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals and will be defined prior to the first publication. 
For multicenter studies, it is mandatory that the first publication be based on data from all centers, 
and that the data are analyzed and submitted as stipulated in the protocol by a statistician assigned 
by [CONTACT_456]. 
Thus, no investigator or institution may publish any results of the trial conducted at their site, 
before such a first multi center publication is made which covers the data from all sites. The authors 
have the final responsibility for the decision to submit their manuscript and shall be given full 
access to the data resulting from the trial. 
The coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or authors shall coordinate any intended publication of trial 
results with the sponsor, to enable the sponsor to ensure that results are presented in a responsible 
and coherent manner. 
The sponsor reserves the right to review all manuscripts and abstracts at least [ADDRESS_320369] the confidentiality of information and to provide 
comments that may not yet be available to the investigator.

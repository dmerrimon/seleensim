1                 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Protocol Title: The effects of antipsychotic drugs on brain metabolism in healthy individuals  Protocol Version date: 4/5/[ADDRESS_993367] Öngür, MD, PhD  Phone: [PHONE_15114] Schizophrenia & Bipolar Disorder Program e-mail: [EMAIL_13876]  PROTOCOL TITLE The effects of antipsychotic drugs on brain metabolism in healthy individuals.BACKGROUND  Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder characterized by [CONTACT_727492]. It remains unclear yet whether some of these alterations may be related to pathophysiology of illness per se, or are the consequence of brain exposure to the effects of psychotropic drugs. In recent years evidence suggests that exposure to the effects of psychotropic drugs may contribute to some structural and other changes in brain. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of short-term antipsychotic medication use in healthy subjects on neuroimaging markers. We will also examine effects of antipsychotic exposure on neurocognitive performance.  The primary aim of this study is to investigate antipsychotic drug effects on brain energy metabolism in 30 healthy people by [CONTACT_727493][INVESTIGATOR_238285] 15 days and using 31P MRS imaging at 4 Tesla. Secondary aims include studying the effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727475]. We plan to study the levels of chemicals associated with cellular energy metabolism: kinetics of enzymes involved in cellular energy metabolisms in brains of healthy people before and after use of antipsychotic drug olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] [ADDRESS_993368] data on the structure of the gray matter and white matter; resting state functional brain activity; levels of brain chemicals including glutamate and GABA; white matter integrity; and neurocognition. We will collect whole brain data where possible and focus on the medial prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex as two regions of interest whenever whole-brain data collection is not possible due to technical limitations.   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  Enrollment: The study will enroll up to [ADDRESS_993369] recruitment based on sex, ethnic background or health status other than those mentioned below. Individuals who do not speak English will be excluded.  Inclusion Criteria 1. Age: 21-50 years old. 2. Male or female. 3. Without psychiatric diagnosis according to a structured psychiatric interview (SCID; First et al 1994). 4. Without history of a psychotic disorder among parents, siblings, or children. 
  4  Exclusion Criteria 1. Significant medical or neurological illness. 2. Unstable/active disease or potential contraindications. 3. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30. 4. Taking any other medications, including over the counter supplements, with the exception of oral contraceptives for women. 5. Pregnancy. Females of child-bearing age must be using an effective contraceptive method. 6. History of smoking, substance abuse or dependence. 7. Contraindication to MR scan, 8. Medical condition that would prevent blood draws.  This study will be comprised of three main parts. The subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time. Similarly, the investigators may decide to stop the study if the purposes of the study cannot be met. All participants will be asked not to use alcohol or any other substances and drugs during the study period.  1. Baseline Assessments: The first part of the study will be carried out within [ADDRESS_993370] of the following procedures: a. Consenting procedures (20 minutes) b. Clinical evaluation (120 minutes) c. Urine toxicology screen (5 minutes) and blood pregnancy test (5 minutes) d. MRI procedure: i. Common Anatomic Protocol (CAP) at 3T (MR Scan at 3T – 1) (45 minutes) ii. MRS protocol at 3T (MR Scan at 3T – 2) (30 minutes) iii. Phosphorous MRS/MT at 4T (MR Scan at 4T – 1) (90 minutes) iv. Diffusion Tensor Spectroscopy (DTS) at 4T (MR Scan at 4T – 2) (90 minutes) e. Fasting (12 hours) blood draw of 20 mL (10 minutes) f. Assessment of vital signs, weight, height, waist and hip circumference (5 minutes) g. ECG (10 minutes) h. Neuropsychiatric assessment (60-90 minutes) i. MATRICS Consensus i. 24-Hour food recall (Total Dietary Intake ASA24)    2. Study Visits: The second part of the study in which participants will take daily antipsychotic medication will be carried out within [ADDRESS_993371] day of medication each participant will take Zyprexa Zydis 2.5 mg/day PO. Dose will be increased in the second day and participants will be taking Zyprexa Zydis 5 mg/day, PO, for the following days.  
  [ADDRESS_993372] day  On the 2nd, 5th, and 10th days of medication we will administer LUNSERS (Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effect Rating Scale), ESRS (Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale) and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale to assess potential side effects better. Weight and vital signs assessment, random blood glucose test will be done and ECG will be taken in these visits. On 5th, 10th, and 14th days all participants will have blood drawn for assessment of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727476]. Each visit will take about 30 minutes to an hour.  Participants’ dietary intake will be assessed throughout the study using the 24-Hour Food Recall ASA24 at visits 3 and 8, and with the Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait-reduced (FCQ-T-r) at the 1st, 7th and 9th visits.   We will still complete the study with participants who miss up to 3 days of medication administration and qualify those participants as having received the intended course of medication (while recording their degree of noncompliance). Participants who miss more than 3 days of medication will be discontinued from the study.   3.  Endpoint Assessments: All participants will undergo final investigations on the 15th and 16th days of the medication follow up period. The participants will take their last olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727477] 15th day. They will not be asked to take it on the 16th day as we plan to finish all final assessments during daytime and they take their medications in the evening. Participants will undergo 4T MR scan and neurocognitive testing on the 16th day. All other assessment and 3T MR scans will be done on the 15th day. The third part of the study will consist of the following procedures: a. Clinical evaluation (60 minutes) b. Urine toxicology screen (5 minutes) and pregnancy test (5 minutes) c. MRI procedure: i. Common Anatomic Protocol (CAP) at 3T ii. MRS protocol to quantify Glu and GABA at 3T  iii. Phosphorous MRS/MT at 4T  iv. Diffusion Tensor Spectroscopy (DTS) at 4T  d. Fasting (12 hours) blood draw of 20 mL (10 minutes) e. Assessment of vital signs, weight, height, waist, and hip circumference (5 minutes) f. ECG (10 minutes) g. Neuropsychological Assessment (60-90 minutes) i. MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery h. 24-Hour food recall (Total Dietary Intake ASA24)  Medication: The half-life of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_53553] [ADDRESS_993373] duration of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727478] 
  6 volunteers has been 15 days. It is a randomized, PBO controlled, two- treatment (OLZ and PBO), crossover study in which the metabolic effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727479]. 30 healthy men aged between 18-49 years underwent 10 mg/d olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727480] 15 days (5 mg/d for 3 days, then 10 mg/d for 12 days) in this study 15. There are also some other multiple-dose studies in which the participants were given daily olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727481] 15 days 16, 17, 18 19. None of the participants in these studies had major, severe side effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Based on these studies we determined the duration of medication as 15 days in this study. We determined the daily olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727482] 5 mg in this study. We aimed to give healthy subjects only 5 mg/d olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], the lower limit of the optimal dose range (5 mg ± 2.5 mg/d), to mimic the therapeutic effect but also protect the participants from adverse effects of treatment.  To assess the potential side effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], we set up [ADDRESS_993374], 2nd, 5th, 10th, 14th days of medication period. A physician will be present to monitor all participants’ reactions to the medication and stop the medication if they are affected adversely.  MRI/MRS Scan: We have found that most subjects find that remaining in the scanner is somewhat uncomfortable but acceptable. An MRI technologist will be able to communicate with subjects at all times via intercom. Subjects are informed that they are free to stop at any point. Padding around the head will protect subjects from minor mechanical injuries and reduce head motion. Earplugs will be used to minimize the scanning noise of MR scanner. Women of childbearing potential must undergo a negative urine pregnancy test prior to completing the MR procedure on each day of MR scanning.   Women of childbearing age: Pregnant women and nursing mothers cannot participate to this study. If the participant is a woman of childbearing potential, she must be using a metal-free IUD, oral contraceptive, or barrier methods (for at least 3 months) or must be abstinent (for at least 1 month: time to get the most reliable result with pregnancy test) prior to this study. In addition, they must have a negative blood pregnancy test (instead of urine pregnancy test) at the beginning of the study.   Blood Draw: Subjects will be monitored for 15 minutes following the blood draw to ensure they are doing well. To minimize the possibility of bruising and infection from the blood draw, proper sterile phlebotomy techniques will be used.  Psychiatric Evaluation: Some subjects might feel uncomfortable answering questions during the psychiatric evaluation. They will not be forced to answer if they do not wish to answer any particular question.  Neuropsychiatric Assessment: Fatigue, frustration, or boredom may occur during the assessment; however, participants will be offered the option to discontinue testing or training sessions and resume at a later time in order to minimize these effects.  To minimize potential breach of confidentiality, subject data are coded with unique research numbers. The code linking the research number with personal identifiers is kept in binders separate from both clinical and imaging data and also in password- protected computer files on computers in a locked office at McLean. Subject interview records and imaging data are identified by [CONTACT_727494]-based application REDCap. The application complies 
 with HIPAA regulations and will store the information securely, protected by [CONTACT_727495], and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Dietary information captured from the ASA24 is stored in an NIH-designed database that is completely deidentified. The only document linking the participant’s username [CONTACT_530198] a password-protected computer file in a locked office at McLean. Statistical Analysis: There is no published literature on the effects of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727483]. Therefore, it is not possible to calculate a sample size that would detect a given between-group difference in this study. In fact, our hypothesis is that olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727484]. Therefore, we plan to recruit a sample that is large enough to establish the absence of a moderate or large effect. Our proposed sample size of [ADDRESS_993375] sizes of 0.45 or greater as significant at the p<0.05 level with 80% power. Note that effect sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_993376] small. We will examine deviations induced by [CONTACT_727496] t-tests for before and after measurements.  FORESEEABLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS In terms of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_99646], the medication may be unsafe for some people and cause some unwanted side effects (neurological, gastrointestinal, dermatological, ocular, musculoskeletal, hematologic, endocrine, metabolic, psychiatric).  Nervous system side effects have frequently included somnolence, tremor, insomnia, dizziness, speech disorder, abnormal gait, amnesia, paresthesia, apathy, confusion, tremor, akathisia, hypertonia, articulation impairment, incoordination, abnormal dreams, emotional lability, agitation, nervousness, and hostility. Akinesia, alcohol misuse, antisocial reaction, ataxia, CNS stimulation, cogwheel rigidity, delirium, dementia, depersonalization, dysarthria, facial paralysis, hypesthesia, hypokinesia, hypotonia, incoordination, stimulant misuse, stupor, stuttering, tardive dyskinesia, vertigo, and withdrawal syndrome have also been reported. Circumoral paresthesia, coma, encephalopathy, neuralgia, neuropathy, nystagmus, paralysis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, tobacco misuse, and sleep related eating disorder have been reported rarely 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Almost all antipsychotics have been associated with a risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_727485]. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727486]. However, in patients on olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_727487] a primary psychiatric disorder, clinical seizure is a rare occurrence. In most of these cases, a history of seizure or risk factors for seizures were reported.  All antipsychotics have been associated with the risk of sudden cardiac death due to an arrhythmia. In clinical trials, clinically meaningful QTc prolongations (Fridericia QT correction [QTcF] ≥ 500 milliseconds [msec] at any time post-baseline in patients with baseline QTcF < 500 msec) were uncommon (0.1% to 1%) in patients treated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], with no significant differences in associated cardiac events compared to placebo.  Metabolic side effects have frequently included weight gain. Binge eating and increases in food craving have been associated with olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Additional studies have confirmed that patients receiving atypi[INVESTIGATOR_727488]/or diabetes mellitus. 
  Hepatic side effects have rarely included hepatitis, liver fatty deposit, and cholestatic or mixed liver injury. Transient and moderate, asymptomatic elevations in liver function tests have been reported.   Gastrointestinal side effects have frequently included dry mouth, increased appetite, thirst, constipation, dyspepsia, increased salivation, vomiting, and flatulence. Dysphagia, esophagitis, fecal impaction, fecal incontinence, gastritis, gastroenteritis, gingivitis, melena, mouth ulceration, nausea and vomiting, oral moniliasis, periodontal abscess, rectal hemorrhage, stomatitis, tongue edema, taste perversion, and tooth caries have also been reported. Isolated cases of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-induced acute pancreatitis have been reported during post marketing use 33.  Musculoskeletal side effects have included extremity pain (other than joint pain) and joint pain in 5% of patients. Joint stiffness and twitching have been reported frequently. Arthritis, arthrosis, leg cramps, and myasthenia have also been reported. Bone pain, bursitis, myopathy, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and rhabdomyolysis have been reported rarely 34.  Hematologic side effects have rarely included anemia, leukocytosis, leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, thrombocytopenia, normocytic anemia, neutropenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, agranulocytosis, and thrombocythemia35, 36, 37, 38.  Ocular side effects have frequently included amblyopia, abnormal vision, and conjunctivitis. Abnormality of accommodation, blepharitis, cataract, diplopia, dry eyes, eye hemorrhage, eye inflammation, eye pain, ocular muscle abnormality have also been reported. Glaucoma, corneal lesion, keratoconjunctivitis, macular hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], miosis, mydriasis, esotropia, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_727489] 39, 40, 41.  Psychiatric side effects have frequently included depression, euphoria, delusions, manic, and psychotic symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms and suicide attempts have also been reported 42. One of the important side effects of antipsychotic drugs is neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare (incidence rates; range from 0.02 to 3 percent among patients taking neuroleptic agents) but life-threatening, idiosyncratic reaction to neuroleptic medications.   Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], like all other drugs, can cause hypersensitivity syndrome which is seen very rarely. Drug Hypersensitivity Syndrome (DHS) is unpredictable but potentially life- threatening with significant morbidity. This syndrome is a severe, idiosyncratic multi- system reaction defined by [CONTACT_727497], rash and internal organ involvement (e.g., hepatitis, myocarditis, nephritis or pneumonitis), which may occur [ADDRESS_993377] medicines, followed by [CONTACT_727498]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481911]. The mortality from drug hypersensitivity syndrome is estimated at around 8% 51.  In terms of the MRI and MRS scans, unlike X-rays or CAT scans, magnetic resonance (MR) technology does not use ionizing radiation. The MR system requires the use of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_727490], which conform to the guidelines established 
 by [CONTACT_727499]. This study uses a standard clinical MRI scanner (3 Tesla or 3T), as well as a high field (4 Tesla or 4T) MRI scanner. The 4T scanner is not used for routine clinical studies in children or adults, but the FDA has determined (July 14, 2003) that scanners with magnetic field strengths of less than 8 Tesla (double this scanner) or less do not represent a significant risk to adults, children, or infants aged more than [ADDRESS_993378] majority of subjects tolerate blood draws well.  In terms of the psychiatric evaluation, some subjects might feel uncomfortable answering questions, but they will not be forced to answer if they do not wish to do so.  In terms of the neuropsychiatric assessment, some participants may experience fatigue, frustration, or boredom; however, participants will be offered the option to discontinue testing or training sessions and resume at a later time in order to minimize these effects.

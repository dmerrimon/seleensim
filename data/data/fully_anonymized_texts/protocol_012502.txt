 1.1 SCLC General Background 
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is  an aggressive malignancy chara cterized by [CONTACT_854711], initial chemotherapy sensi tivity followe d almost unifor mly with rapid resistance and high 
genetic instability(1). The maj ority of patients present with e xtensive stage disease and platinum 
based chemotherapy remains the st andard first line treatment(2) . Chemo-sensitivity  is defined as 
a response to initial platinum t herapy that la sts ≥90 days. Che mo-resistance is defined as 
response to platinum therapy that lasts <90 days. Initial respo nse rates to platinum based 
chemotherapy in extensive stage  SCLC are 65-70%. Second line tr eatment options for SCLC 
include a number of chemothera py agents, all with response rate s of 20-30% and minimal 
survival benefit(3). Topotecan remains the only FDA approved se cond line therapy in SCLC 
with low response rates and minima l improvement in survival(4-6 ). Median survival of extensive 
stage SCLC patients therefore remains less than a year. SCLC ha s lagged behind many 
malignancies with limited impro vements in the development of no vel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].(7, 8)  
 The initial remarkable sensitivi ty of SCLC to platinum, includi ng complete responses in the 
extensive stage setting, suggests a potential role of platinum re-sensitization in the treatment of 
relapsed SCLC.  Platinum resis tance is a complex phenomenon wit h multiple key pathways 
involved including DNA repair path ways(9). Cisplatin exerts its  cytotoxicity through the 
formation of DNA adducts that inhi bit multiple fu ndamental cell ular processes including DNA 
replication and transcription(10) . Adducts lead to a cascade of  events that stimulate several 
signal transduction path ways culminating in a poptosis. Increase d repair rate of cisplatin induced 
adducts via the nucleotide excisi on repair and increased tolera nce of cisplatin induced adducts 
via the homologous recombinati on pathway have been tied to plat inum resistance(11).  In 
addition, epi[INVESTIGATOR_854692], histone modifications 
and nucleosome positioning have be en shown to be involved in th e development of platinum 
resistance in lung cancer a nd other malignancies(12, 13). Sever al epi[INVESTIGATOR_854693] d during the development of pla tinum resistance in ovarian 
cancer(14).  The exact mechanisms of platinum resistance in SCL C are not well defined. 
However, epi[INVESTIGATOR_854694] a role both in the dev elopment of SCLC and in its 
response to platinum based therapy. In fact, a very recent stud y showed smoking induces 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_854695] a nd are potentially the first s tep towards the development of lung 
cancer.  Chronic cigarette smoke i nduced chromatic changes that  later manifested as abnormal 
DNA methylation(15).   1.[ADDRESS_1190263], DNA 
methylation profiles in cancer c ells are unique from normal, di fferentiated cells (16).  In cancer 
cells, widespread methylation o ccurs throughout the genome and enriched hypermethylation is 
focused in CpG islands. CpG isla nds are located in the promoter s of tumor suppressor genes 
including some of the most common ly mutated genes in cancer in general and small cell lung 
cancer in particular such as ret inoblastoma (Rb) gene. In a stu dy of patients with small cell lung 
cancer, significant me thylation differences were noted at 62 Cp G sites in 52 independent genes 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN LUN17-302 
Version Date: 18MAR2020 Confidential Page 9 of 41 in the peripheral blood compared to case controls(17).  DNA met hylation patterns were 
evaluated in [ADDRESS_1190264] subtypes of  SCLC, yet all shared methylation 
of RB1 and TCF21. The chromatin m odifier EZH2 was among the mos t significantly 
overexpressed genes in SCLC, expressed >12 fold higher than in normal lung. EZH2, a histone 
methyltransferase component of  the PRC2 complex, has been impli cated in dysregulation of 
DNA methylation in cancer through i ts effects on histone methyl ation, particularly histone H3 
lysine 27 tri-methylation. EZH2  is a known target of E2F, whic h is activated in SCLC by [CONTACT_854712] f unction mutations in RB1, the gene encoding the E 2F repressor pRB(18). 
Pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 in a SCLC patient derived xeno graft using EPZ-[ADDRESS_1190265] activity in SCLC.  
 1.3 Hypomethylating Agents for Treatment of Cancer 
Re-expression of methylation silenc ed tumor suppressor genes by  [CONTACT_854713] (DNMT11, DNMT3, and DNMT3B) has emerged as a n effective strategy 
against cancer(19). The expressi on of DNA methyltransferase 1 ( DNMT1) being high in S phase 
of cell cycle makes it a specifi c target for methylation inhibi tion in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_854696]. 
The first compounds that demons trated DNA hypomethylation activ ity in cancer cells were 
cytidine analogs such as 5-Azacyidine which has activity in the  treatment of myelodysplastic 
syndrome and acute myelogenous l eukemia. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_854697]  5-azacytidine in hematologic 
malignancies multiple challenges  arise due to the instability o f the compound and it’s in vivo  
deamination by [CONTACT_854714] e deaminase(20). Thi s has led to the deve lopment of Guadecitabine. 
 
1.4 SGI-110 (Guadecitabine) and its ro le in platinum re-sensitizati on 
While the FDA-approved demethyla ting agent decitabine is prone to deamination by [CONTACT_482910], Guadecitabine (Aste x Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a dinuc leotide analogue of decitabine, 
is more stable, less toxic, and a  promising alternative to rest oring silenced tumor suppression 
genes (TSG) expression in cancer cells by [CONTACT_854715](21). Guad ecitabine is a 
dinucleotide combin ing 5-aza-dC and deoxyguanosine that has bee n shown to be more stable 
than 5-aza-dC making it an attrac tive alternative. Guadecitabin e is resistant to cytidine 
deaminase(22).  Guadecitabine i s currently under investigation in multiple clinical trials 
including high- risk myelodysplas tic syndrome and acute myeloge nous leukemia(23). In 
addition, preclinical data has de monstrated the combination of Guadecitabine wit h cisplatin in 
platinum resistant ovarian models  re-sensitized o varian cancer cells to platinum (24). This re-
sensitization was not a result  of inhibition of r epair of plati num induced DNA as originally 
thought. DNA damage induced by [CONTACT_854716]. A phase I trial of Guadecitabine and 
carboplatin in platinum resistant  recurrent ovarian cancer was recently completed (25). 
Guadecitabine was administere d once daily subcutaneously on day s 1-5 followed by [CONTACT_854717] 8 of every 28 days cycle. The  maximum tolerated dose of the combination was 
Guadecitabine at 30mg/m2 SQ days 1-5 in combination w ith carboplatin AUC 4 on day 8. Th e 
dose limiting toxiciti es were grade 4 neutropenia and grade 4 t hrombocytopenia. Common 
treatment related adverse events  were neutropenia, nausea, fati gue, anemia, injection site

HCRN LUN17-302 
Version Date: 18MAR2020 C onfidential Page 10 of 41 reaction, thrombocytopenia, le ukopenia and vomiting. The combin ation of Guadecitabine and 
platinum is currentl y being investigated in platinum refractory  testicular cancer and seems to be 
potentially promising with a res ponse rate of 35%(26). In SCLC,  re-sensitization of a platinum 
resistant SCLC was recently de monstrated using RRx-001, an agen t that epi[INVESTIGATOR_854698](27). This d ata provides proof of concept 
of the potential role of Guadeci tabine in platinum re-sensitiza tion in SCLC. A common 
characteristic between testicul ar cancer, ovarian cancer and sm all cell lung cancer is their initial 
exquisite sensitivity to platinum. Guadecitabine has been shown  to prime hepatocellular 
carcinoma cells to oxaliplatin in vitro(28) . Guadecitabine is currentl y under investigation in 
combination with durvalumab/trem elimumab in SCLC. This will be the first study combining 
Guadecitabine with platinum in S CLC. This study is unique as gu adecitabine has been mainly 
studied as a radio-sensitizer i n acquired platinum resistance. Some of the patients on this study 
will be platinum resistant and gua decitabine could re-sensitize  them to platinum. However, some 
of the patients will have low sensitivity to platinum and guade citabine could potentially serve as 
an “enhancer” rather than ‘re-s ensitizer” to plat inum sensitivi ty in these patients.  
 1.[ADDRESS_1190266] a potential role for hypo-
methylating agents in the trea tment of SCLC. EPZ-6438 (a histon e methyltransferase inhibitor) 
profoundly inhibited SCLC growth in vivo (18). Guadecitabine had single agent activity and 
reduced tumor burden by 35% in a no n-small cell lung cancer in an in vivo  model. In addition 
Guadecitabine induced genome wide  promoter region demethylation  and impacted the 
expression of a number of EZH2- target genes(29). This finding h as the potential to be pertinent 
in SCLC with overexpression of EZH2(30).  
 
The goal of this study i s to explore the poten tial for the epig enetic agent Guadecitabine in re-
sensitizing SCLC patients who ha ve progressed following a plati num based doublet regimen. 
Progression free surviv al will be the prima ry endpoint. A longe r PFS than noted with first line 
platinum doublet would suggest this combina tion is promising in  SCLC.  
 There are no optimal drugs for the treatment of recurrence SCLC . SCLC has been shown to 
respond to platinum re-challenge( 31). In fact, there have been at least two studies that compared 
platinum re-challenge in SCLC  to topotecan or Amrubicin. The re sponse rate to platinum re-
challenge was higher than topotec an and comparable to amrubicin . Re-challengi ng patients with 
platinum is therefore a reasona ble treatment for recurrent SCLC (32, 33).  Current evidence in 
ovarian cancer shows Guadecitabi ne re-sensitizes patients to pl atinum re-treatment. It is unclear 
if guadecitabine or hypomethylator s enhance the response to a s econd platinum exposure.  We 
will analyze that potential benefit in this study.

• Females of childbearing potential  who are sexually active with a non-sterilized male 
partner must use at least [ADDRESS_1190281] 
dose of durvalumab + guadecitabine . Non-sterilize d male partner s of a female patient 
must use male condom plus spermi cide throughout this period. Ce ssation of birth control 
after this point should be discu ssed with a responsible physici an. Not engaging in sexual 
activity for the total duration of  the drug treatment and the d rug washout period is an 
acceptable practice; however, periodi c abstinence, the rhythm m ethod, and the 
withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Female subjects should 
also refrain from breastfe eding throughout this period. 
 Male subjects with a female pa rtner of childbearing potential 
• Non-sterilized males who are sex ually active with a female part ner of childbearing 
potential must use a male condom pl us spermicide from screening  through 180 days after 
receipt of the final dose of dur valumab + guadecitabine or. Not  engaging in sexual 
activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstine nce, the rhythm method, 
and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contrac eption. Male subjects 
should refrain from sperm  donation throughout this period. 
• Female partners (of childbeari ng potential) of male subjects mu st also use a highly 
effective method of contraception throughout this period.  
 Females of childbearing potenti al are defined as those who are not surgically ster ile (i.e., bilateral 
tubal ligation, bilate ral oophorectomy, or com plete hysterectom y) or post-menopausal.  
 
Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amen orrheic for 12 months without 
an alternative medical cause. The  following age-specific requir ements apply:

Please refer to the Correlative La boratory Manual (CLM) for add itional details on studies 
outlined below.  8.1 Tissue 
 8.1.1 Archival Tissue Archival tissue is required if av ailable. Archival tissue shoul d be identifie d at screening, 
requested after registration a nd shipped by C2D1. If archival t issue is not available, subjects may 
still be eligible.  This tissue will be used to analyze EZH2 ex pression. 
 8.1.2 Fresh Biopsy Tissue 
For 15 patients with easily accessible disease, biopsies are re quired Cycle 1 Day 1 (regardless of 
archival tissue availability ) and Cycle 2 Day 5 to assess methy lation changes, EZH2 expression, 
and platinum-induced DNA adducts . A biopsy at progression is op tional for the same 15 patients 
and similar analysis  will be performed. 
 8.2 Peripheral Blood Samples  
 8.2.1 Somatic Baseline 
Whole blood will be collected for  somatic baseline prior to tre atment C1D1. This sample is 
required.  8.2.2 Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) 
Whole blood will be collected for  CTCs prior to treatment C1D1.  This sample is required and 
will be used to determine circul ating tumor cell (CTC) burden p rior to initiating treatment.

than 5 mm). At baseline and in f ollow-up, only the  short axis w ill be measured and followed. 
 9.2 Non-measurable Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesion s (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥  10 to <15 mm short axis), are c onsidered non-measurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, pleural /pericardial effusi ons, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammator y breast disease, and abdominal ma sses (not followed by [CONTACT_118445]), are considered as non-measurable.  NOTE:   Cystic lesions that meet the c riteria for radiographically de fined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesi ons (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cys tic lesions’ thought to represent  cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they m eet the definition of measurabi lity described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present i n the same subject, these are p referred for sele ction as target 
lesions.  9.3 Target Lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a  maximum of 2 lesions per organ a nd 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involve d organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be represent ative of all involved organs, bu t in addition should be those that

(longest for non-nodal lesions, shor t axis for nodal lesions) f or all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the ba seline sum diameters. If lymph  nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseli ne sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regressio n in the measurable dimension of 
the disease.  9.4 Non-target Lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of di sease) including any measurabl e lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_1190300] ed at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions a re not required, but the presenc e, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of eac h should be noted throughout foll ow-up. 
 9.5 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
NOTE:  In addition to the informatio n below, also see section 4.3.2 i n the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_676068] (R ECIST) Committee, version 
1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228-247)  for special notes on the ass essment of target lesions.  
 
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all target lesions. Any  pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axi s to 
<10 mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the  diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters 
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this in cludes 
the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition  to the 
relative increase of 20%, the s um must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance of o ne or 
more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for  PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m 
diameters while on study
 
 9.6 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete 
Response (CR) Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tu mor marker 
level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm  short axis) 
NOTE :  If tumor markers are initia lly above the upper normal limit,  they must 
normalize for a subject to be considered in complete clinical r esponse. 
Non-CR/ Non-
PD Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintena nce of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progre ssion of 
existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not  normally 
trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overal l disease status 
change, not a single lesion increase.

Subjects with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring  discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of dis ease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Eve ry effort should be made to doc ument the objective progression 
even after discontin uation of treatment. 
 In some circumstances, it may be  difficult to d istinguish resid ual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determ ination, it is r ecommended that

however, all changes from the ori ginal analysis plan will be do cumented in the final study report. 
The statistical analysis methods are outlined below.  12.1 Study Design 
This is a Phase II study evaluating the efficacy and safety of Guadecitabine in combination with 
carboplatin in Extensive Stage S mall Cell Lung Cancer. The stat istical analyses will be primarily 
in the chemotherapy-sensitive group. Chemotherapy-resistant pat ients will also be enrolled but 
will be described separately. Chemo -sensitivity is defined as a  response to initial platinum 
therapy that lasts ≥ 90 days. Chemo -resistance is defined as re sponse to platinum therapy that 
lasts < [ADDRESS_1190316] 1.1, MDA c riteria or death as a result  of any cause. 
 
12.2.2  Definition of Secondary Endpoints 
• Toxicities will be defined by [CONTACT_854724] 
(NCI CTCAE) v5. 
• Objective response rate (CR+PR ) will be assessed via RECIST 1.1  or MDA criteria. 
• Disease Control Rate (CR+PR+ SD > 8 weeks) will be assessed via RECIST 1.1 or MDA 
criteria. 
• Overall survival will be defin ed as the time from Day 1 of trea tment until death from any 
cause.

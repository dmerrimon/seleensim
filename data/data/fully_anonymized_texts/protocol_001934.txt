Protocol for 4 -arm study   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Version 3; 4/9/[ADDRESS_482510] colonoscopy for 
improving adenoma detection rates.  
Protocol:  
Introduction:  
ADR (Adenoma detection rate or percentage of patients with at least one adenoma among all 
colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_321368] a doctor) was first proposed as a quality indicator 12 years ago. It has now 
been validated as an excellent marker for the risk of interval colorectal cancer (cancer occu rring after 
colonoscopy). Although colonoscopy offers protection from colorectal cancer for at least a decade and 
more, this protection has been shown to vary depending on the location and type of pre -cancerous 
lesions and the training and skill of the doc tor performing the procedure. A recent large study of more 
than 200,000 colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_385686] 1% increase in ADR resulted in a decrease of interval CRC 
by 3% and fatal interval CRC by 5%. Although the increase was linear the effect was more pronou nced 
once the ADR reaches 28% and continued beyond till 52%.  
Measures to improve ADR are therefore a worthy goal to study. Recent studies indicate that continuing 
medical education, time of colonoscopy during the day, forced longer withdrawal time, use of high 
definition colonoscopes  all result in improving ADR although the gains have only been modest. To this 
end, adding novel devices to the tip of colonoscope  may improve the ability of doctors to perform a 
better procedure . We therefore propose to identif y the increase in ADR with [ADDRESS_482511] colonoscopy. Fuse c olonoscopy  (2 cameras embedded at the side of the 
colonoscope tip providing an increased angle of view), EndoC uff (a plastic cap to fit the tip with flexible 
arms which h old the mucosa back aiding in inspection), EndoRings (similar to EndoCuff but the arms are 
wider) have been shown in tandem colonoscopy studies to improve the adenoma miss rates to 7 -15% 
Protocol for 4 -arm study   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Version 3; 4/9/[ADDRESS_482512] colonoscopy which is usu ally about 40%.  All these devices 
are FDA approved  and are distributed in the [LOCATION_002] . 
Methods:  
Persons scheduled for a standard screening , surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopy at the Glen Lehman 
Endoscopy Suite will be invited to participate in th e study after a member of the research team explains 
the risks, benefits and the choice of not participating in research.  
If the patient qualifies after being screened for exclusion criteria as listed below , they  will be given an 
informed consent document and an authorized HiPAA form  to sign. Once both documents are signed, a 
copy will be provided to the patient and then the patient is randomized to underg o a standard 
colonoscopy, a Fuse  colonoscopy, colonoscopy with Endo Cuff or a colonoscopy with EndoR ings. 
Study procedures:  
Patients will undergo a split dose bowel preparation starting the evening before the procedure day and 
ending at least [ADDRESS_482513] 
inspection  time can be monitore d for all arms of the study.  
Protocol for 4 -arm study   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Version 3; 4/9/[ADDRESS_482514] from the patient to be withdrawn.  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
Screening colono scopy , Surveillance colonoscopy  or diagnostic colonoscopy  and >=50 years of age  
Exclusion criteria:  
Any personal h/o large bowel resection , inflammatory bowel disease , or polyposis  syndromes  
Any family h/o polyposis syndromes  
Referral for an incomplete exam or polyp clearance  
Referral for a FOBT+ testing in the last 6 months  
Anticipated difficult colonoscopy  
 
Statistical analyses:  
We will perform analyses on the data after randomization and prior to withdrawal (intention to treat ) 
and on data of patient s completing the study (excluding the withdrawal patients, per protocol).  
The primary aim of increased ADR detection will be tested using a chi -square test among the four 
groups.  
Protocol for 4 -arm study   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Version 3; 4/9/[ADDRESS_482515], and chi -square respectively.  
All analyses will be performe d on SPSS Version 20 (IBM, NY) . 
Sample size:  
The ADR of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_385687] 40% in published studies. We hope to achieve 
a 10% increase in the ADR with these newer devices when compared to standard colonoscopy.  
Using a [ADDRESS_482516] a 10% increase from a baseline of 40%, we require 388  patients in each 
arm at an ἀ level of 0.05 with 80% power (n=1552 ). To account for the withdrawals after randomization, 
which would amount to an average of 6% per our recent stu dies, we will n eed to enroll 412 patients in 
each arm (n=1648 ). 
Ethical considerations:  
 All protocols will be approved by [CONTACT_385688]. An informed consent 
document will be provided to each patient to review for participating in the study. An express 
authorization to review medical data for research purpos es will be obtained before randomizing any 
patient. All patients will be provided with a contact [CONTACT_385689].  
Adverse events:  
The primary investigator will monitor any adverse event  reported to the study staff and determine if it’s 
related to the study procedures including standard colonoscopy. All adverse events will be monitored 
until a satisfactory resolution and will be reported t o the IRB within 5 days of knowledge.  
Protocol for 4 -arm study   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Version 3; 4/9/2015  
 A table will  be maintained for the adverse events in each arm and in case of any statistically significant 
adverse event rate in any arm, the primary investigator will make the decision to remove the treatment 
arm or stop the study.  
 
Data integrity and safety:  
 All pa per charts pertaining to the patient will be kept under lock and key in coordinators office away 
from the endoscopy area. The data entry will be performed into an excel file which will be stored on an 
internal network drive with encryption and password sec urity . Only approved personnel by [CONTACT_385690]. This file will also not have any identifiable information (name, DOB  or 
mrn). A study log with the identifiable information will be kept in a separate folder (also encrypted) to 
enable the investigators to assist in any research audit. No procedural data except the date of 
examination will be entered into this log.

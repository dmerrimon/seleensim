2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory disease of the rectum and/or large intestine 
characterized by [CONTACT_599787].  The 
hallmark clinical symptoms include bloody diarrhea associated with rectal urgency and tenesmus.  The 
clinical course is marked by [CONTACT_599788].  Extraintestinal complications include arthritis, 
erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.  Conventional 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599761] 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA) derivatives, corticosteroids 
and the immunomodulatory agent cyclosporine.  5 -ASA derivatives as well as thiopurines are used for 
the maintenance of remission.1  The biological agents infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, 
and ustekinumab as well as the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib are indicated for the induction 
and maintenance of remission in subjects with moderate to severe UC.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_599762], currently approved UC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_563589]2-4and have a potential for significant 
safety events.5-[ADDRESS_794120] for the treatment of UC.
CD40 is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family member that plays an important role in 
lymphocyte activation and antigen presenting cell (APC) function.  CD40 expression on epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], 
leukocytes, and vascular endothelium is elevated in systemic inflammatory diseases (e. g., Crohn's 
disease [CD], UC, rheumatoid arthritis [RA], and systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]).  Ravagalimab is a 
proprietary monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is a potent CD40 antagonist with no evidence of agonist 
activity.
Evidence from in vitro studies, preclinical models, and human disease suggests that CD40 signaling is 
important in the pathogenesis of UC and inhibition of CD40 mediated signaling may be a potential 
treatment for patients with UC.9  For further details, please see ravagalimab Investigator's Brochure.10
Clinical Hypothesis
Ravagalimab is safe and well tolerated in subjects with moderate to severe UC and leads to endoscopic 
improvement at Week 8.
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_599763], including biologic and small molecule therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], many 
patients still do not respond adequately to the se treatments, gradually lose response over time or 
discontinue treatment due to significant adverse events (AEs).  Thus, there remains a large unmet 
medical need for additional therapeutic options in UC for patients with inadequate response or 
intolerance to available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Based on pre -clinical, clinical, and translational evidence, 
ravagalimab could potentially demonstrate efficacy with a favorable safety profile in the treatment of 
patients with moderately to severely active UC who have failed or have intolerance to approved 
biologics and/or tofacitinib.

potential for drug -induced liver injury (DILI) with ravagalimab, DILI is under constant surveillance by 
[CONTACT_599789], 
evaluation, and follow -up of laboratory parameters.  Local reactions to intravenous (IV) infusions or 
subcutaneous (SC) administered biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483082], and are usually limited to redness, 
swelling, or induration at injection site.  In Phase [ADDRESS_794122] on ravagalimab each experienced 
injection site reaction and injection site pain.  The aforementioned safety risks were taken into account 
with the establishment of the safety monitoring measures in the eligibility criteria for this study.  
Furthermore, an internal data monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor safety at regular intervals 
(Section 6.3).
Blood sampling, IV infusions, and subcutaneous SC injections can cause local bruising, inflammation, and 
pain.  The preparation for endoscopy, and the endoscopy an d biopsy procedure itself, although 
generally well tolerated, can be associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in more severe cases, 
perforation, bleeding, effects from anesthetic medications, and infection.

3.5 Safety Endpoints
Safety evaluations include AE monitoring, physical examinations, vital sign measurements, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) variables (as needed), and cl inical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, 
and urinalysis) as measures of safety and tolerability.  An internal DMC will monitor safety at regular 
intervals (Section 6.3).
3.6 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
Serum ravagalimab concentrations will be obtained at the visits indicated in Appendix Dand will be 
summarized at each sampling time point using descriptive statistics.  A nonlinear mixed -effects modeling 
approach may be used to estimate the population central value and the empi[INVESTIGATOR_599764] (CL/F) and volume of distribution at 
steady- state (Vss/F).  Ravagalimab anti -drug antibody (ADA) development will also be determined at 
specific visits during the study ( Appendix D) and will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Additional parameters and relationships (e.g., exposure -receptor occupancy, exposure -efficacy, or 
exposure -safety) may be evaluated if u seful for the interpretation of study results.
3.7 Biomarker Endpoints
Biospecimens (blood and tissue biopsy) will be collected at specified time points ( Appendix D) 
throughout the study to evaluate known and/or novel disease -related or drug -related biomarkers.  
Types of biomarkers may include nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and/or metabolites.  Biopsies for 
biomarker analysis will be done when performing endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Up to 4 biopsies will be taken from the 
site of general inflammation at each visit with an endoscopy for biomarker research as outlined in 
Appendix D:  1 biopsy for histologic assessment by [CONTACT_9559], 1 biopsy for gene expression analysis 
(including CD40 signature), and 2 biopsies for tissue RO (where applicable).  Biopsies for tissue RO will 
only be collected at sites located in the [LOCATION_002].  Additional biopsies may be collected at the 
Investigator's discretion to confirm disease diagnosis, and/or to rule out dysplasia, colon cancer and 
infection.

Blood samples may be used for exploratory research to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, 
pharmacodynamic, or surrogate biomarker signatures.  Mandatory intestinal biopsy tissue samples may 
also be u sed for exploratory research to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, pharmacodynamic, 
or surrogate biomarker signatures.  These assessments may be explored in the context of UC or related 
conditions and/or ravagalimab or drugs of similar classes.
The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with the clinical 
study report.  Biomarker samples will be collected and analyzed from all subjects, unless precluded by 
[CONTACT_318019].
4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
Study M15 -722 is a Phase 2a, multicenter, single arm, open -label (OL) study to investigate the efficacy 
and safety of ravagalimab in subjects with moderate to severe UC who failed prior therapy.  The study 
contains a [ADDRESS_794125] 
dose of study drug.  The induction period is an open -label 12 -week treatment period to evaluate the 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and RO of ravagalimab for inducing end oscopic improvement at Week 8.  
Subjects who achieve clinical response per Partial Adapted Mayo score at Week 12 may continue into 
the maintenance period.  The maintenance period is an OL 92 -week treatment period to assess efficacy 
and safety for maintenan ce of response with ravagalimab.
Prior to protocol version 4.0 the study had a double -blind (DB) placebo -controlled induction period.  
Ongoing subjects enrolled prior to version 4.0 continued their treatment as randomized during the 
induction period and, i n case of clinical response at Week 12, their OL treatment during the 
maintenance period.
Induction Period
Up to approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in the induction period to receive the following 
treatment:
Ravagalimab 600 mg intravenous (IV) Week 0; ravagalimab 300 mg subcutaneous (SC) Weeks 2, 
4, 6, 8, and 10.
Once the 30thsubject completes Week [ADDRESS_794126] been met. 
An endoscopy is required at Screening, and evaluation of endoscopic improvement will occur at Week 8.  
In order to explore the time -course of ravagalimab efficacy, subjects will continue through Week 12 and

Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose selection in this study is based on analysis of PK, pharmacodynamics, and safety data from 
Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers as well as safety data from pre -clinical animal studies.  The Phase 1 
ravagalimab single and multiple ascending dose s tudies, Study M15 -726 and Study M15 -730, evaluated 
ravagalimab single doses of 10 -300 mg SC and 100 -600 mg IV, and multiple doses of 50 and 150 mg SC 
weekly for 3 weeks following IV loading doses of 50 mg and 300 mg, respectively.  Partial peripheral 
blood B cell CD40 RO was achieved with SC doses of 10 and 30 mg; whereas full peripheral blood B cell 
CD40 RO (i.e., > 90%) was achieved with IV or SC doses ≥ [ADDRESS_794132] of ravagalimab on T helper dependent B cell responses following keyhole 
limpet hemocyanin (KLH) administration was evaluated.  Preliminary results from the study showed that 
a single 300 mg SC dose of ravagalimab achieved near full suppression of IgM and IgG response to KLH 
antigen.  On the other hand, a single 100 mg SC dose and multiple 100 mg SC doses given once every 
two weeks (total of three doses) resulted in minimal to no suppression of immune response to KLH, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_599766] B cell CD40 RO.

5.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Subjects taking oral aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, oral cortico steroids, and/or UC -related 
antibiotics at Baseline must continue their concomitant treatment for the duration of the induction 
period (through Week 12).  Initiating and/or increasing doses of oral aminosalicylates, 
immunomodulators, oral corticosteroids, and/or UC -related antibiotics during the study is prohibited 
through Week 12.  Decreasing doses of oral aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, oral corticosteroids, 
and/or UC -related antibiotics during the induction period is prohibited, except in the event o f 
moderate -to-severe treatment related toxicities and after discussion with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.  Starting 
at Week 12 (maintenance period), oral aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, and/or UC -related 
antibiotics may be decreased or discontinued at the discreti on of the Investigator.  Starting at Week 12, 
initiating and/or increasing doses of oral aminosalicylates, immunomodulators, oral corticosteroids, 
and/or UC -related antibiotics is permissible after discussion with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
During the maintenance p eriod, subjects can initiate an optional steroid taper at Week 12.  While 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_599769], increasing doses above the Baseline dose is permitted only after 
discussion with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.  Below is a suggested tapering schedule.

use of the product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse events on a 
routine basis throughout the study.  All adverse events will be followed to a sa tisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse 
event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the 
surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition 
deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the 
deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considere d 
an adverse event.
If an adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is 
to be reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or CRO (as appropriate) as a serious adverse event 
within 24 hours of the sit e being made aware of the serious adverse event (refer to Section 4.3 of the 
Operations Manual [ Appendix F] for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_71126]):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken.  This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and acciden tal trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persi stent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency ro om 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or

The investigators will rate AEs according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0, which can be accessed at:  
https://www.eortc.be/servic es/doc/ctc/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf.11
For AEs not captured by [CONTACT_12397] , the following should be used: 
Grade [ADDRESS_794163] (mild).
Grade [ADDRESS_794164]'s 
usual activities (moderate).
Grade 3/[ADDRESS_794165]'s usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening (severe). 
Grade [ADDRESS_794166] (severe).
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the 
use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an adverse event, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_794167] be discontinued (Section 5.5).  If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study 
subject, information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written informed consent 
from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information.  [COMPANY_013] will provide a 
separate consent form for this purpose.  Pregnancy in a subject's partners will be collected from the 
date of the first dose through [ADDRESS_794168] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.

STUDY M15 -722  |  Version 6.0 |EudraCT [ADDRESS_794169] consists of safety monitoring (review of 
AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safety issues by a DMC), interruption of study 
drug dosing with appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects 
from study drug.  There are no time limits for study drug interruption as long as no permanent study 
discontinuation crite ria have been met.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is 
described below.
For subjects who discontinue study drug but continue study participation and are on standard of care 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these toxicity management requirements do not a pply (including alerts from the central lab) 
and any intolerability to standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355243].
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of 
infecti on during and after treatment with study drug.  Study drug should be interrupted if a subject 
develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A subject who develops a new infection 
during treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an 
immunocompromised subject.  As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the 
subject should be closely monitored.  Study drug may be restarted once the infection has been 
successfully treated or resolved.  S ubjects who develop active TB or experience Hepatitis B reactivation 
must be discontinued from study drug.  For subjects who develop TB during the study, the supplemental 
eCRF should be completed.  
COVID -19:  Interrupt study drug in subjects with a confir med diagnosis of COVID -19.  Consider 
interrupting study drug in subjects with signs and/or symptoms and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_166489] -19.  The

Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cervix must 
be discontinued from study drug.  Information including histopatholo gical results should be queried for 
the confirmation of the diagnosis.  The supplemental eCRF should be completed.
ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be discontinued from study drug for an ECG change considered 
clinically significant and with reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug OR a confirmed 
absolute QTcF value > 500 msec.
Surgery:   Subjects who undergo emergency surgery should have study drug interrupted at the time of 
the surgery.  After emergency surgery, reintroduction of study drug is allowed once the physician has 
examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed an d there is no sign of infection.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:   For any given laboratory abnormality, the 
Investigator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment 
following any local guideline s.  Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values 
are described in Table 2and may require an appropriate supplemental eCRF be completed.  All

7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully doc umented in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the Week 12 database lock for the 
primary analysis.  The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina, [LOCATION_003]).
7.2 Definition for An alysis Populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of ravagalimab 
(including subjects randomized to ravagalimab prior to Version 4.0).  The FAS will be used for all efficacy 
and baseline analyses.
Subjects enrolled prior to version 4.[ADDRESS_794174] 1 dose of study drug.  Subjects 
randomized to the study prior to Version 4.0 will be analyzed along with subjects enrolled after 
Version 4.0 for safety analysis.  Subjects will be grouped based on the treatment received.
Depending on the magnitude of missing dat a due to COVID -19, additional appropriate analysis may be 
performed with details included in the SAP.
7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy
Primary Analysis
The primary analysis will be performed after all subjects completed the study induction period (i.e., 
completed Week 12 assessments).  The final analysis will be performed after all subjects completed the 
study maintenance period.  Additional analysis may be performed to support program development or 
health authority requests.  There will be no multiplicit y test alpha- adjustment for this proof of concept 
study.
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 8.  
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic 
improvement at Week 8 between ravagalimab treated subjects and historical placebo.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted on the FAS.  Comparison of the primary 
efficacy endpoint will be performed between the ravagalimab group and the hi storical placebo group 
using Bayesian approach with placebo distribution as  from historical data meta -analysis and 
prior for ravagalimab Beta (0.5, 0.5), the Jeffrey's prior for binomial distribution.  The placebo prior is 
determined based on available placebo data from similar trials and may be updated if new placebo data 
from similar trials become available before the primary analysis database lock.
Non -Responder Imputation while incorporating Multiple Imputation to handle missing data due to
COVID -19 (NRI -C) will be applied to the primary endpoint analysis.  
Details on the primary, secondary, and other efficacy analyses are provided in the SAP.
Interim Analysis
An interim efficacy analysis will be performed after approximately [ADDRESS_794175] been enrolled.
Sample Size Estimation and Decision Probability
The planned sample size is up to approximately 40 subjects.
Meta -analysis for historical placebo data from tofacitinib (OCTAVE1/2),4upadacitinib (Phase 2b; data on 
file) and ustekinumab (UNIFI)12studies gives  endos copic improvement rate at Week 8.  The matched 
prior distribution for placebo is  
.  The prior for ravagalimab treatment group will be set to Jeffreys prior Beta (0.5, 0.5) as 
non-informative.  The probability that the posterior probability of rate difference > 0 is larger than 90% 
is more than 90% if the endoscopic improvement rate difference is 25% between ravagalimab and 
historical placebo, given a sample size of 40 subjects fo r ravagalimab.  If ravagalimab has the same 
endoscopic improvement rate of  as historical placebo, that probability is approximately 3.1%.
7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety
Safety analysis will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set.  Incidence of AE s, changes in vital signs, 
physical examination results, ECGs, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed.  Treatment -emergent 
AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and by [CONTACT_10607] 
(MedDRA) preferred ter m (PT) for the treatment group.  Mean change from Baseline for laboratory and 
vital signs data will be summarized.  In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal 
values, whereby [CONTACT_599794].  Vital signs will be analyzed 
similarly.
Missing safety data will not be imputed.  Details for each safety endpoint analysis will be provided in the

clarify and update statistical methods, and incorporate necessary protocol modifications due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic as follows:
Synopsis –addition of Hungary to study country list
Rationale: to reflect addition of new study country.
Synopsis –addition of ustekinumab to approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_599772] a history of inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to one or more 
of the approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_154809]:   correcting omission of ustekinumab from synopsis in previous vers ion of the protocol.
Synopsis –removal of text from key eligibility criterion requiring OL use of tofacitinib if received 
in a clinical trial
Rationale:   To permit subject enrollment after inadequate response to, or intolerance of, 
tofacitinib received in a clinical trial in all scenarios where treatment allocation is known to have 
been tofacitinib.
Section 2.2–included a statement on the benefit and risk of ravagalimab for subjects 
participating in the study in light of the SARS -CoV-2 pandemic based on current knowledge 
Rationale:   To update the benefit -risk assessment of ravagalimab with regards to COVID -19 to 
clearly state that risk related to us e of this investigational drug on the course of COVID -19 is not 
currently known.
Section 3.3–clarified endpoint definitions
Rationale:   to provide clear definitions for each endpoint planned for evaluation
Section 3.4-in the list of additional efficacy endpoints to remove duplicate endpoints, revise 
endpoints for clarity, and remove endpoints which are not expected to be informative
Rationale:   The proportion of subjects with clinical response per Full Mayo score at Week 8 in 
subjects with a Full Mayo score of 6 to 12 at Baseline was removed as duplicative with an 
endpoint listed as a key secondary endpoint in Section 3.3.  The 2 endpoints related to

will be summarized over time, not only through Week 12.
Secti on 4.1–removed discussion of the data monitoring committee (DMC) from the study 
design 
Rationale:   DMC review of safety data is not a component o f the study design.  The use of an 
internal DMC that will review safety at regular intervals is discussed in Section 6.3.
Section 4.1-revise discussion of changes made in protocol version 4.0
Rationale:   To remove repetitive text to improve clarity and remove the obsolete text which 
stated the maintenance period continued until Week 52 as the study was previously extended to 
include a 92 -week OL treatment period
Section 4.1and Section 7.3-clarified text regarding primary and interim analysi s and the timing 
of termination of study enrollment, and explicitly permit additional statistical analysis if needed

sections of the protocol and operations manual.  It has been added here for clarity.
Section 4.1and Section 5.6, Appendix D, and Appendix F, Section 2.1 -Specified that a follow -up 
visit is preferred over a follow -up call and added collection of hematology and clinical chemistry 
at that visit
Rationale: As this is the initial p hase 2a study with ravagalimab it is preferred to have a follow -
up visit to ensure comprehensive capture of safety data including new or ongoing AEs and 
collection of hematology and clinical chemistry to ensure resolution/reversibility of any abnormal 
labo ratory data.  For subjects in which a visit is not possible, a phone call will be permitted. 
Section 4.1and Appendix D, footnote b– Remove text pertaining to subjects on protocol version 
5.0
Rationale:   This text is obsolete as all subjects, regardless of protocol amendment enrolled 
under, are to continue the visit schedule in the most current IRB/EC approved protocol, inclusive 
of all activities relative to their Baseline visit, are required to sign the most current IRB/EC 
approved informed consent form, and there is no enrolled subject at risk of experiencing a delay 
in dosing based on different protocol versions.

instructions for necessary changes to activities or procedures in the event of states of 
emergency or pandemic situations 
Rationale:   To provide flexibility during state -of emergency or pandemic situations to ensure the 
safety of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risk to the integrity of the study 
while trying to best manage continued care of study subjects. 
Section 5.5–clarified discontinuation of study drug as well as study participation. 
Rationale: To clarify that PD procedures apply to discontinuation from study a nd study drug.  To 
clarify handling of subject data accounting for situations when a subject withdraws consent from 
the clinical study or withdraws samples from research. 
Section 5.6–clarified discontinuation of study drug as well as study participation.  Also added 
text regarding collection of personal data and biomarker research in the event a subject 
withdraws consent .

clarify handling of subject data accounting for situations when a subject withdraws consent from 
the clinical study or withdraws samples from research.
Section 5.8–deleted the statement that IRT would assign a randomization number
Rationale: Not applicable to the open -label study.  All subjects are assigned a unique number at 
screening. 
Section 5.9–clarified that modifications to the protocol, including those due to cases of state of 
emergency or pandemic situations, are c onsidered deviations if not expressly outlined as 
permitted
Rationale: To clarify that unless necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects 
that no prospective protocol modifications are permitted, including those which may be related 
to cases of cases of state of emergency or pandemic situations.
Section 6.1, Appendix D-clarified that active TB is an adverse event of special interest
Rationale:   Active TB is a separate category from serious infections and opportunistic infections.
Section 6.2-clarified that there are no time limits for study drug interruption as long as no 
permanent study discontinuation criteria have been met and added guidance regarding study

Secti on 7.3-removed POC success criterion
Rationale:   To avoid a purely statistical criterion for POC success claim based on a single 
endpoint and permit more flexibility in the interpretation of the totality of the clinical data which 
is more in line with the exploratory nature and objectives of the POC st udy.
Section 7.3–updated external placebo data and related probabilities  
Rationale:   To update the external placebo data and related probabilitie s based on data which 
have become available from other studies during the conduct of this study and after re -
evaluation of existing data.  In addition, a clarification was made that future updates to the 
historical placebo data to be used in analyses may o ccur based on emerging clinical data prior to 
database lock.
Section 7.3–replaced use of NRI with an imputation method for the primary analysis wit h 
missing data handling due to COVID -19 (NRI -C)
Rationale:   To account for potential missing data due to a contemporary pandemic situation 
(COVID -19).
Section 7.3–removed sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint
Rationale:   Removed sensitivity analysis to avoid possible inconsistent results between Bayesian 
approach and frequentist approach.
Section 8.2–Specified that investigators must notify [COMPANY_013] if any urgent safety measures are 
taken due protect subjects from any immediate ha zard 
Rationale:   To ensure subject safety. 
Section 9–noted that remote monitoring may be employed as needed in cases of state of 
emergency or pandemic situations

3STUDY PROCEDURES
3.[ADDRESS_794208] Information and Informed Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the subject and answer 
all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study -related screening procedures being performed on 
the subject or any medications being discontinued by [CONTACT_17204], 
the informed consent statement will be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_423], th e person who 
administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy 
Page [ADDRESS_794209]'s medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to 
confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study -related procedures and that the subject 
received a signed copy.
Information regarding benefits for subjects and information regarding provi sions for treating and/or 
compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in 
the informed consent form.
In cases of state of emergency or pandemic situations, it is possible that additional protocol 
modifica tions not outlined in this protocol may become necessary.  If this situation arises, in addition to 
the study informed consent, additional verbal consent may be obtained prior to these adaptations or 
substantial changes in study conduct in accordance with local regulations.
3.2 Medical History and Prior/Concomitant Medications
A complete list of prior/concomitant medications and medical history including demographics, history of 
tobacco, alcohol, and drug use will be taken at screening.  The subject's prior/con comitant medications 
and medical history will be updated at the Study Day [ADDRESS_794210] screened/enrolled in this study.  Some of 
these data are being collected with an ePRO system called Trialmax, provided by [CONTACT_599797], PA, [LOCATION_003].  The ePRO system is in compliance with Title [ADDRESS_794211] will be entering the data on an electronic device; these data will be uploaded to a server.  
The data on the server will be considered source, and maintained and managed by C RF Health.  
Internet access to the ePRO data will be provided by [CONTACT_111014].  This 
access will be available for the duration of the study to the site Investigator, as well as delegated 
personnel.  Such access will be removed from Investigator sites following the receipt of the study 
archive.  Data from the ePRO system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD -ROM, etc.) and 
provided to the Investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data.  It will be possible 
for the Investigator to make paper printouts from that media.

willing to give written informed consent and to comply with the requirements of this s tudy protocol.
Diary Based
The ePRO data (stool information, use of medications used for endoscopy preparation, abdominal pain, 
anti- diarrheal medication, and general well -being) will be collected electronically via a handheld device 
into which the subject will record the required p ieces of information on a daily basis.  The electronic 
device will be programmed to allow data entry once per day.  All data entered on the device will be 
immediately stored to the device itself and manually/automatically uploaded to a central server 
admin istrated by [CONTACT_51070].  The investigational site staff will be able to access all uploaded subject 
entered data via a password protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation of the 
study archive.  Completion will be reinforced during study visits as necessary. 
Stool frequency for SFS
The stool frequency is captured by [CONTACT_599798] 
24hours throughout the trial (range 0 -99).  The SFS is calculated by [CONTACT_599799] a referen ce number.  The reference number is the number of stools per day 
(24hours) that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_599777]/her UC is not active and needs to be 
designated once prior to enrollment.  The reference number should represent a full number of 
at least 1.  A higher score indicates higher stool frequency.
Rectal bleeding for RBS
The RBS is based on diary entries of subjects recording the most severe category that describes 
the amount of blood they had in their stools for a given day (0 = No blood seen, 1 = blood seen 
in fewer than half of the stools, 2 = blood seen in half or more of the stools, 3 = only blood 
without any stool).  A higher score indicates a higher degree of rectal bleeding.
Abdominal Pain
The abdominal pain score is captured from diary ent ries of subjects recording the level of worst 
abdominal pain experienced over 24 hours using a numeric rating scale (range 0 to 10; 0 = No 
pain and 10 = worst possible abdominal pain).  A higher score indicates a higher level of 
abdominal pain.
Bowel Urgen cy
Bowel urgency is captured from diary entries of subjects recording the presence (yes/no) of 
bowel urgency over [ADDRESS_794213] will directly enter the 
required p ieces of information while at the site.  The electronic device will be programmed to allow data 
entry for only the visits specified in the protocol and will not allow for subjects to complete more than 
one of the same assessment at any one visit.  All data entered on the device will be immediately stored 
to the device itself and (manually/automatically) uploaded to a central server administrated by [CONTACT_599800] [ADDRESS_794214] protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation of the study archive.
IBDQ
The IBDQ is a widely used questionnaire for health -related quality of life (QoL) assessment in 
patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).  It consis ts of 32 items categories into 
4dimensions:  "bowel symptoms," "systemic symptoms," "social function," and "emotional 
function."  Item responses are graded on a [ADDRESS_794215] severe and 
7being no problem at all.  A higher score indicates a better health status.
3.5 Pharmacokinetic Sampling
On the day of the study visit, subjects will be administered the ravagalimab intravenous (IV) or 
subcutaneous (SC) dose and blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) and ADA assessments should be 
collected at the specified time points at each visit as follows:
For PK samples:
At Baseline (Week 0) at the end of the ravagalimab IV infusion
At Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 52 prior to administration of ravagalimab SC dose
At Week 104 or in the event of PD at any time during the visit.
For ADA and nAb samples:
At Baseline (Week 0) at any time during the visit 
At Weeks 4, 12, and 52 prior to administration of ravagalimab SC dose
At Week 104 or in the event of PD at any time during the visit.
The date and time of sample collection will be captured on the electronic case report form (eCRF).
3.6 Biomarker Sampling
Blood samples will be collected for biomarker research at the designated study visits as specified in 
Section 2.1.  Biopsies for biomarker analysis will be done when performing endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Up to 
4biopsies will be taken at each visit with endoscopy for biomarker research; 1 biopsy for histologic 
assess ment by [CONTACT_9559], 1 biopsy for gene expression analysis (including CD40 signature), 
2biopsies for tissue RO (where applicable).  Collection of biomarker samples should occur prior to 
administration of drug on treatment days when applicable.  Whole b lood for CD40 RO and/or analysis of 
T cells, NK cells and B cell subsets (including plasmablasts) will be collected prior to drug administration 
at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12; and at any time during the visit at Week 52 or in the event 
of PD pri or to Week 52.  All biomarker samples should be collected, labeled, and shipped as outlined in 
the study -specific laboratory manual.  [COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store 
Page [ADDRESS_794216] confidentiality.  The 
samples may be retained while research on ravagalimab (or drugs of this class) or UC and related 
conditions continues, but for no longer than [ADDRESS_794217] a repeat ECG at any time during the 
study as warranted based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].  The ECG should be pe rformed prior to 
blood collection.
The ECGs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_41596] ("local reader").  The local 
reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a 
writte n comment on the tracing using the following categories:
Normal ECG
Abnormal ECG –not clinically significant
Abnormal ECG –clinically significant
Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source 
folder.  The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine -generated measurements and interpretation that 
are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected.
ECGs with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's correction formula (QTcF ) should be 
reported (or calculated) and documented in the source documents and later transcribed on to the 
appropriate eCRF if QTcF prolongation is observed.
A valid QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have a pacemaker or supraventricular or ventric ular 
conduction abnormalities.  In cases of QTcF prolongation, the baseline QTcF will need to be entered into 
the appropriate eCRF for comparison as well.  In addition, any clinically significant findings will be 
documented in the source documents and late r transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF.  Each signed 
original ECG will be monitored by [CONTACT_599801]'s source 
documents onsite.
3.[ADDRESS_794218]'s medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
At any time, a symptom -directed phy sical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
3.[ADDRESS_794219] needs to be neg ative prior to receiving study drug.  The site will be 
provided administration instructions.  Study drug will be administered to subjects beginning at baseline 
(Day 1) and as specified in Section 2.1.  Administration of drug will be performed after all assessments 
and examinations scheduled for that day have been completed.  At the visits specified in Section 2.1, the 
site personnel will review and retain a copy of the subject diary, review returned study drug kits, and 
empty study drug packaging to verify compliance.  A separate study drug administration guideline will 
be provided as well.

A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects of childbearing potential during 
Screening.  Pregnancy testing should not be performed for postmenopausal women. Determination of 
postmenopausal status will be made during the Screening period based on the subject's history or FSH 
testing.
A quantitative serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine pregnancy test will be 
performed at baseline for all female subjects of childbearing potential.  The serum pregnancy test will be 
sent to and performed by [CONTACT_2237].  If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is 
considered a screen failure.  If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥[ADDRESS_794223] is:
Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
Still borderline ≥ 3 days later (considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result), 
the subject can be enrolled into the study (unless prohibited per local requirements) in the 
absence of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_276024].
Additional urine pregnancy tests will be performed at visits indicated in Section 2.1.
More frequent pregnancy tests can be performed throughout the study at the investigator's discretion 
or if required per local/country requirements.  
If the baseline urine pregnancy test is negative, then dosing with study drug may begin.  
If the baseline or post -baseline urine pregnancy test is positive, dosing with study drug must be 
withheld and a serum pregnancy test is required (as stated above).
Clinical Chemistry
For serum chemistry tests, it is preferred that the subject has fasted (8 hours, excep t for water) prior to 
sample collection, however it is not required.  It must be recorded whether the subject has fasted or not 
at the time of collection in the laboratory request, source document, and eCRF.
Urinalysis
Dipstick urinalysis will be provided by [CONTACT_599802].  If the dipstick urinalysis is abnormal, then a microscopic analysis will be sent to the 
central laboratory in the event the dipstick results show protein, ketones or blood other than negative 
or glucose greater than normal.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Tuberculosis (TB) Testing/TB Prophylaxis
All subjects must be evaluated for TB at Screening and annually.  The TB screening tests provide 
diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the s ubject's epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], history, exam 
findings, etc., and it is the responsibility of the Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, active, 
or latent TB.  Expert consultation for the evaluation and/or management of TB may be considered per 
Invest igator discretion.
At screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment form 
(Appendix C) and test ed for TB infection by [CONTACT_82736]- TB Gold test or purified protein derivative 
([COMPANY_003]) test.  The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into the 
appropriate eCRF.  The TB risk assessment questionnaire will be completed annua lly (Part I only) for all 
subjects, regardless of TB test results.
If a subject had a negative purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) test within [ADDRESS_794224]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA 
MD.  The results of the TB test (s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. 
Subjects with a negative TB test may be enrolled.  Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for 
evidence of active TB versus latent TB, including signs and symptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or 
symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis.  
Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.
Any positive TB test after a subject with a negative test at Baseline ha s started the study should be 
reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable). 
If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110957]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test, the case (inc luding the TB test results) must be 
discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
TB Test
Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test (or 
equivalent) and/or [COMPANY_003] test are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the 
study and should be considered positive. 
For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] a nd QuantiFERON -TB Gold testing, both will be performed.  If 
either [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON -TB Gold are positive, the TB test is considered positive.
The [COMPANY_003] Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) should be utilized only when a 
QuantiFERON -TB G old Test is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per 
local guidelines).  
If subjects require repeat TB testing during the trial, the TB test used for repeat testing should 
be the same as the test used during Screening.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Subjects with out a history of active or latent TB and who have a negative TB test result at 
Screening or the most recent evaluation will undergo annual TB testing by [CONTACT_82736] -TBGold 
Test and/or [COMPANY_003] skin test.
If a subject enters the study with a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test alone, then the subject should 
have their annual TB test performed with a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test.  Similarly, if only a [COMPANY_003] is 
placed at Screening, then the TB test to be used for the remainder of the study for that subject 
is the [COMPANY_003].
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test and 
the [COMPANY_003] are required per local guidelines) the [COMPANY_003] will be performed.  The [COMPANY_003] should be read 
by a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_794225].  The 
reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is 
considered a positive reaction.  The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not 
"negative."  Subjects who have an ulcerating reaction to the [COMPANY_003] in the past should not be re -
exposed and the [COMPANY_003] should be considered positive.
If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator should perform a local 
QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or through the central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out 
a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is 
considered to be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the testing result is negative, then the 
subject is considered to be negative.
If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_599778]'s medical history to warrant investigation and a repeat test befo re the next 
scheduled annual TB retest, the case (including the TB test results) should be discussed with the 
[COMPANY_013] TA MD.
If TB testing is done for subjects with a prior positive TB test at the annual evaluation, repeated 
TB prophylaxis is not required for a positive result unless indicated by [CONTACT_423]'s medical 
history.
TB Prophylaxis
At screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection, prophylactic treatment must be initiated 
at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer).  At 
least [ADDRESS_794226]'s medical history 
Page [ADDRESS_794227] 6 months of prophylaxis.  TB pro phylaxis should 
be initiated and study drug(s) should not be withheld.  The subject should be re -evaluated (unscheduled 
visit) for signs and symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis [ADDRESS_794228] X -ray (posterior -anterior and lateral views) is required for all subjects at Screening who have a 
positive QuantiFERON -Gold TB and/or [COMPANY_003] test.  Subjects can have a CXR at any time during the study as 
warranted based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].  A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform and 
document an assessment of the CXR.  The Investigator will indicate the clinical significance of any 
findings and will sign an d date the report. 
A CXR is required annually for subjects with a newly positive [COMPANY_003] and/or QuantiFERON -TB Gold test after 
Baseline or a positive response to the TB risk questionnaire Part I questions.
In the assessment of the CXR, if possible per local / site guidelines, the Investigator or their delegate 
must indicate the presence or absence of calcified granulomas, pleural scarring/thickening, and signs of 
active TB.  If the CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fib rotic 
scar, api[INVESTIGATOR_110962]) or other findings that are clinically significant, the Investigator 
should contact [CONTACT_599803].
Hepatitis B Testing
All subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at s creening using the following tests:
HBs Ag (Hepatitis B surface antigen)
HBc Ab/anti- HBc (Hepatitis B core antibody)
HBs Ab/anti- HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody)
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary.
A negative result for HBs Ag will trigge r automatic reflex testing for core antibodies (HBc Ab) and surface 
antibodies (HBs Ab).
A negative test result for HBc Ab does not require HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing and the 
subject may be enrolled ( Figure 1, Scenarios A and B).  
For a subject who has had a HBV vaccination (should document in the medical history), a 
positive test result for HBs Ab is expected, the HBV DNA PCR qualitative testing i s not required 
and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 1, Scenario B*).

Hepatitis C Testing
All subjects will be tested for the presence of the hepatitis C Virus (HCV) antibody at Screening.  Subjects 
with positive HCV antibody will have a HCV RNA test.  If the HCV RNA is positive, then the subject w ill be 
excluded.
HIV Testing
Subjects with a known history of HIV infection are excluded from study participation.  HIV testing will be 
conducted as part of the infection screening at the Screening visit.  The Investigator must discuss any 
local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject.  The site will report these results 
to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the 
Investigator must discuss with the subject the potent ial implications to the subject's health and subjects 
should be referred for clinical care promptly.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test 
results indicate a positive HIV infection.  [COMPANY_013] will not receive results from the testin g and will not be 
made aware of any positive result.  This testing is to be done at the central lab.
Stool Sample Testing
If the investigator has a reasonable suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a gastrointestinal infection they should ensure this has 
been excluded prior to scre ening the subject. 
FCP
Fecal calprotectin will be performed at the study visits indicated in Section 2.1.  If subjects are unable to 
provide a sam ple at the site visit, subjects will be sent home with a stool sample supply kit and the site 
will give instructions to assist with collection procedures.  If the FCP sample is collected during the 
Screening period, it may be used as the Baseline.  All stool samples should be collected before any bowel 
preparation for endoscopy is started and returned to the site within [ADDRESS_794231] be shipped to the central laboratory using dry ice.

In the event of a suspected anaphylaxis, a PK, ADA, and nAb sample should be collected once within 
24hours of the reaction.  In addition to PK, ADA, and nAb assays, blood tests to be conducted in the 
event of a suspected anaphylaxis are: 
Serum tryptase:  Optimally, measurement needs to be obtained from 15 minutes to 3 hours of 
symptom onset, and no later than 6 hours (as tryptase may remain elevated for 6 or more hours 
after the onset and therefore may still be informative if obtained after 3 ho urs); it is also 
recommended requested to collect a follow -up tryptase level that can be collected a minimum 
of 2 weeks after the recorded event or at the next study visit, and within 2 months of the 
reaction.
Plasma histamine:  Optimally, within 5 to 15 m inutes of the onset of symptoms, and no later 
than 1 hour.

condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the 
investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue 
participation in the study.
If a subject withdraws from the main study, biomarker research samples will continue to be s tored and 
analyzed.  A subject must contact [CONTACT_599805].  Once [COMPANY_013] is notified, no new information will be collected, no new analysis will be started, 
and the samples will be destroyed unless a regulatory authority requires [COMPANY_013] to keep them.  
However, if [COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) collected any information or did any 
testing before withdrawal, [COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will still use and

3.15 Additional Assessments
Endoscopy
Endoscopy at/during Screening or within 45 days of the Baseline visit will be required to calculate the 
Mayo endoscopy subscore (confirmed by a central reader) at Baseline.  Endoscopic evaluations using 
Mayo endoscopic score confirmed by [CONTACT_599807], Week 8, Week 52, and 
Week 104/PD.
The same endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541], where possible, should perform all endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In addition, where possible, the 
Investigator or sub -Investigator should be the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355239].  It is expected that all subjects 
who remain in the study through at least Week [ADDRESS_794235] a Week 8/PD endoscopy. 
An endoscopy performed before the Screening visit, independently of the study, may be used as the 
Screening endoscopy, with the approval of the [COMPANY_013] TA MD, if the following conditions are met:
Biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis is available according to section "Intestinal Biopsy" below, 
as applicable.
The endoscopy took place within 45 days prior to Baseline visit.

Stool Frequency Subscore
The stool frequency subscore is calculated by [CONTACT_599812] a reference 
number.  The reference number is the number of stools per day (24 hours) that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_599784] a flare and needs to be designated once 
prior to enrollment.  The reference number should represent a full number of at least 1.
Subjects will record the daily number of stools throughout the trial.  Using these numbers, the 
Stool Frequency subscore will be assessed for each study day as follows: 
A number of bowel movements lower than or equal to the reference number of bowel 
movements should be scored as 0 = Normal.
One or 2 bowel movements more than the reference number of bowel movements should 
be scored as 1.
Three or 4 bowel movements more than the reference number of bowel movements should 
be scored as 2.
Five or more bowel movements more than the reference number of bowel movements 
should be scored a s 3.
The Stool Frequency subscores based on 3 days prior to each study visit will be averaged and 
used for the Stool Frequency subscore for each study visit.  
The Stool Frequency subscore during days which the subject received anti- diarrheal medication 
will be scored as a 3.
Diary entries for stool frequency should not be included in the 3 days prior to the visit that are 
evaluated for the Stool Frequency subscore for the following days:  (1) the day the subject 
received medication for bowel preparation pr ior to endoscopy, (2) the day the subject 
underwent an endoscopy, and (3) [ADDRESS_794241] recent data for 3 days prior to the respective

Rectal Bleed ing Subscore
Subjects will be assigned a daily rectal bleeding subscore value as follows:
No visible blood with stool during the respective day should be scored as 0.
Visible blood with stool less than half the time during the respective day should be scor ed as 
1.
Visible blood with stool at least half the time during the respective day should be scored as 
2.
A score of [ADDRESS_794242] 50% of bowel movements 
accompanied by [CONTACT_599813].
The score entries into subject's diary based on 3 days prior to each study visit will be averaged 
and used for the Rectal Bleeding subscore for each study visit.  
Diary entries for rectal bleeding should not be included in the 3 days prior to the visit that are 
evaluated for the Rectal Bleeding subscore for the following days:  (1) the day the subject

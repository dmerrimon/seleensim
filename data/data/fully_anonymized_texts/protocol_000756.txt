10 1. Introduction - Background and Rationale  
1.1 Mesothelioma – Disease Overview  
Mesothelioma is a malignant tumor of mesothelial surfaces primarily arising in the thoracic 
pleura and is estimated to cause 43,000 deaths worldwide each year with over 3300 cases occurring annually in the [LOCATION_002]  [1, 2]. Approximately 80% of cases of mesothelioma 
are due to inflammation induced by [CONTACT_428903] a lead time from exposure to development of cancer of 20- 30 years  [1]. It is predicted that the incidence of 
mesothelioma due to previous exposure will rise significantly in many countries over the next two decades particularly in Europe, China, Russia and Japan [3, 4]. The median survival for all patients diagnosed with mesothelioma is extremely poor at 6- [ADDRESS_542661] majority of patients will relapse after surgical resection or present with unresectable 
disease [ 5, 6]. The known role of asbestos and chronic inflammation in the etiology of 
mesothelioma has led to the discovery of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_428885] [7]. Immunotherapy is one of the most promising 
avenues of clinical investigation in mesothelioma at present and several clinical trials are 
evaluating immune modulating agents [8]. 
1.2 Background/Rationale  
1.2.[ADDRESS_542662] tumors are one of the body’s natural defenses against the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. However, over time and under pressure from immune attack, cancers develop strategies to evade immune-mediated killing allowing them to develop unchecked. One such mechanism involves upregulation of surface proteins that deliver inhibitory signals to cytotoxic T cells. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) is one such protein, and is 
upregulated in a broad range of cancers with a high frequency, with up to 88% expression in some tumor types. In a number of these cancers, including lung [9], 
renal [10, 11, 12] , pancreatic [13, 14, 15] , ovaria n cancer [16], and hematolo gic 
malignancies [17, 18]  tumor cell expression of PD -L1 is associated with reduced 
survival and an unfavourable prognosis.  
Programmed cell death ligand [ADDRESS_542663] immune system tumor response. 
In the lymph nodes, PD -L1 on antigen- presenting cells binds to PD -1 or CD80 on 
activated T cells and delivers an inhibitory signal to the T cell [19, 20]. This results in reduced T -cell activation and fewer activated T cells in circulation. In the tumor 
microenvironment, PD -L1 expressed on tumor cells binds to PD -1 and CD80 on 
activated T cells reaching the tumor. This delivers an inhibitory signal to those T cells, preventing them from killing target cancer cells and protecting the tumor from immune elimination [21] . 
1.2.2  PD-L1 is H ighly Expressed in Mesothelioma 
Preclinical data suggests that one of two ligands of PD -1, programmed death- ligand 
1 (PD -L1) is highly expressed in mesothelioma tumor cells  [22]. PD -L1 is a putative 
predictive marker for response to PD -L1- and PD -1-directed therapeutics in multiple 
tumor types across multiple  early and late phase studies [23- 25]. 
We have recently performed PD -L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) testing, using the 
murine anti -human PD -L1 monoclonal antibody 5H1, on standard formalin- fixed 
paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tissue sections of large biopsy or resection specimens 
from 25  pleural (17 epi[INVESTIGATOR_337883], 7 biphasic & 1 sarcomatoid) and 8 peritoneal 
mesotheliomas. Based on earlier published studies tumor cells or tumor infiltrating 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0505 
Confidential  
Date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_542664] 5% exhibited membranous staining  
[23]. The mesothelioma tumor cells in the analyzed cohort demonstrated high levels 
of PD -L1 expression, 17 of 33 tumors (52%) were PD -L1 positive and high level 
expression (>50% staining) was present in 14 of 33 tumors (42%). Another group 
has recently reported similar findings from 224 patient cases analyzed 
retrospectively using the 5H1 antibody  [26]. Using a 5% cutoff for positivity, 40% of 
mesothelioma tumors expressed PD -L1 (89/224). PD -L1 expression was 
associated with worse overall survival (6 months vs. 14 months, p<0.0001) even when adjusted for age, gender, lymphocytic infiltration and therapeutic surgery 
(p<0.0002).  
Recent analysis of gene expression suggests high levels of CD8 infiltration in 32% 
of mesotheliomas and high level PD -L1 expression in 12 of 44 tumors (27%) 
providing a further rationale for PD1/PD -L1-directed therapy in mesothelioma [27]. 
In addition recent data from a mesothelioma cohort enrolled in a phase Ib clinical trial of the anti -PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, were highly promising with 28% 
(7/25) of chemo- refractory patients have an objective response by [CONTACT_428904]  (RECIST ) for mesothelioma and a 
further 48% (12/25) having prolonged stable disease  [28]. This has led to a phase 
II single arm clinical trial of pembrolizumab in the second- and third- line setting [29]. 
1.3 Study Drug - Durvalumab [30]  
1.3.1  Description of Durvalumab (MEDI4736)  
Durvalumab is briefly described below. Investigators should refer  to the current 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for details.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_542665] Derivation  
Durvalumab is being developed as a potential anticancer therapy for the treatment of multiple tumor types. Durvalumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa 
(IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody (MAb) that blocks the interaction o f PD-L1 (but not 
programmed cell death ligand -2) with PD -1 on T -lympho cyte (T -cell) and, cluster of 
differentiation on CD80 (B7 -1) on immune cells  and is engineered to reduce 
antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  
  
 
 
 
1.3.3  Non Clinical Safety Profile  
The non- clinical experience is fully described in the current version of the 
durvalumab IB.  
Durvalumab binds with high affinity and specificity to human PD -L1 and blocks its 
interaction with PD -1 and CD80  (B7-1).

15 1.3.7  Dose Rationale  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Fixed Dosing  
A two compartment population PK model was developed for 
durvalumab using monotherapy data from  Study  CD-ON-MEDI4736-
[ADDRESS_542667] of body weight  on 
PK of durvalumab (coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body weight -
based (10 mg/kg Q2W  or 20 mg/kg Q4W) and fixed dosing (750 mg 
Q2W  or 1500 mg Q4W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_428905] ( AUC ss,0-28, C max,ss, and Cmin,ss ) using 
the population PK model. A fixed dose of 750 mg Q2W was selected to 
approximate 10 mg/kg Q2W and a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W  was 
selected to approximate 20 mg/kg Q4W (based on median body weight  
of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 patients were simulated using body weight  
distribution of 40–11 0 kg. Simulation results demonstrate that body 
weight -based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing regimens  (750 mg 
Q2W)  yield similar median steady state exposures  and associated  
variability,  supporting the potential  switch  of durvalumab from weight -
based to fixed  dose. Similar  considerations  hold for the Q4W  dosing  
regimens  (20 mg/kg  Q4W  versus  1500 mg Q4W).  Based on an average 
body weight of 75 kg, fixed doses of 1120 m g q3w (equivalent to 15 
mg/kg q3w) of durvalumab are chosen for this study . 
Similar findings have been reported by [CONTACT_2312] [31- 35]. Wang and 
colleagues investigated 12 monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed 
and body size- based dosing perform similarly, with fixed dosing being 
better for 7 of 12 antibodies [32 ]. In addition, they investigated 18 
therapeutic proteins and peptides . 
1.4 Study Drugs – Pemetrexed  and Cisplatin or C arboplatin 
1.4.1  Pemetrexed 
Pemetrexed is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor indicated for the treatment of 
mesothelioma in combination with cisplatin. Pemetrexed is administered 
intravenously  at a dose of 500 mg/ m² on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle. Cisplatin 
should be administered 30 minutes after pemetrexed infusion ends at a dose of 75 
mg/m². The premedication regimen for pemetrexed includes folic acid and vitamin 
B12 as well as dexamethasone or equivalent to reduce cutaneous  reactions. 
Subjects receiving pemetrexed should be monitored prior to each dose using 
complete blood count ( CBC) and renal function tests. If marrow suppression is 
noted, dose modifications are noted in Section 6.3.2, Table 6-3. For renal toxicity, 
pemetrexed should be held  when the creatinine clearance ( CrCl) <45 mL/minute. 
Caution should be used among subjects who are receiving nonsteroidal  anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and who have mild to moderate renal insufficiency  
(CrCl between 45 and 79 mL/minute). Caution should also be used when 
nephrotoxic drugs are  administered with pemetrexed. For preparation and storage, 
please consult the prescribing information for Alimta® [36].

16 1.4.2  Cisplatin  
Cisplatin is a platinum -based drug that is used in mesothelioma. Cisplatin is 
administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/ m² starting [ADDRESS_542668] be observed in the case of nausea, vomiting and dehydration. Dose 
modifications according to toxicities are noted in Section  6.3.2, Table 6-3 . For 
preparation and storage, please consult the prescribing information for Cisplatin  
[37]. 
1.4.3  Carboplatin  
Carboplatin is a platinum -based drug that is used in the treatment of mesothelioma 
in the setting where cisplatin is contraindicated. Carboplatin is administered  
intravenously at a dose of AUC 5 mg/mL*min (per Calvert formula) starting [ADDRESS_542669] be monitored for  myelosuppression and anaphylaxis. Dose modifications 
according to toxicities are noted in  Section  6.3.2, Table 6-3 . For preparation and 
storage, please consult the prescribing information for Paraplatin [38]. 
1.5 Summary of Rationale for Proposed Study  
1.5.1  R ationale for the Study D esign and Treatment P lan 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Current Standard of Care in Mesothelioma and Role for Maintenance 
Therapy  
Subjects enrolled on this study will have unresectable mesothelioma 
for which they have not received prior systemic therapy. The standard first-line therapy for mesothelioma consists of 4-6 cycles of combinat ion 
chemotherapy with pemetrexed/cisplatin, this has been shown to 
extend survival  when compared with cisplatin alone and is associated 
with a median OS of 12.1 months  [39]. The benefit of second- line 
chemotherapy has not been clearly established [ 40]. 
No more than [ADDRESS_542670] -line platinum -based combination 
chemotherapy are generally recommended for patients with advanced disease. Therefore, after 4 to 6 cycles of treatment, non- progressing 
patients enter a “watch- and-wait” period with periodic review until 
progression.  Trials are ongoing evaluating the role of maintenance 
single agent pemetrexed after initial platinum doublet chemotherapy  
[41]. Further investigation would be advantageous to provide these 
patients  with a regimen that could  augment and then maintain the 
disease control achieved by [CONTACT_22705] -line therapy. Similar approaches in 
NSCLC have led to the approval of both erlotinib and pemetrexed as 
maintenance treatment in patients who are not progressing following first-line platinum -based treatment, on the basis of an observed benefit 
in both median progression- free survival (PFS) and median OS. 
Currently there are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_428886] -line treatment 
for malignant pleural mesothelioma, and there are limited data in the maintenance setting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Combination of Chemotherapy and D urvalumab 
The interaction of a tumor with the immune system is complex. Tumors 
and the tumor  microenvironment are known to express a variety of 
factors that impede a robust immune response from eliminating the 
tumor.  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0505

Date: 3/19/2018  
 
17 Cancer therapeutics such as chemotherapy may modulate 
tumor/immune- system interactions in favor of the immune system. 
Chemotherapy can result in tumor cell death with a resultant  increase 
in tumor antigen delivery to antigen- presenting cells. Tumor cell death 
may also lead to  a reduction in soluble and mem brane- bound factors 
inhibiting tumor -infiltrating T -cells.  Chemotherapy may also disrupt 
immune system regulatory networks by [CONTACT_104115]  T-
regulatory cells.  
In previously untreated mesothelioma, chemotherapy has the potential 
to prime the immune system through tumor destruction and consequent 
antigen expression. The addition of durvalumab to chemotherapy is 
expected to be synergistic in this regard. Several studies are exploring the combination of chemotherapy with anti-PD-L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_428887].  
1.6 Synopsis of Study Design  
1.6.1  Initial Enrollment and Evaluation for S afety  (Safety Run-I n Period)  
As durvalumab has not been previously combined with pemetrexed platinum  
doublet chemotherapy the study will commence with an initial enrollment of 6 
patients who will receive the combination of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) and cisplatin 
(75 mg/m2) with durvalumab (1120 mg) for up to 6 cycles.  Pemetrexed/ carboplatin  
is associated with fewer toxicities than pemetrexed/ cisplatin  therefore both in the 
initial 6 patient cohort and in the later expansion, substitution of carboplatin (AUC 
5) for cisplatin will be permitted specifically as outlined in the eligibility.  After  up to 
[ADDRESS_542671] a PR or 
SD will continue on durvalumab until disease progression (maximum duration of 
durvalumab treatment is 12 months starting from Cycle 1 of concurrent treatment (inclusive of any treatment delays or missed treatments ). In this initial safety  run-in 
period subjects will be monitored for safety.  The combination wi ll be declared 
intolerable if ≥ 2 of the initial 6 patients experience a dose- limiting toxicity ( DLT) as 
defined in the protocol and occurring during the first [ADDRESS_542672] been monitored 
for safety the study  will proceed with enrollment for  a total of 55 patients  (including

2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this phase II study is to demonstrate improved overall survival  (OS)  
compared to a historic control with the addition of concurrent and maintenance durvalumab 
to standard chemotherapy for unresectable pleural mesothelioma.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
1) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of durvalumab and durvalumab in combination 
with chemotherapy  in subjects with malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
2) Percentage of patients progression- free at [ADDRESS_542675] 1.1 criteria.  
3) Progression- free survival  (PFS) will be measured from the time of study registration  until 
radiologic  progression,  clinical progression or death.  
4) Time to progression on durvalumab will be measured from the time concurrent  
treatment with chemotherapy/durvalumab begins until radiologic or clinical progression is noted.  
5) Best Objective Response Rate (ORR)  evaluation will continue up to [ADDRESS_542676] Version 1.1 criteria for 
mesothelioma. 
2.3 Exploratory Objectives 
2.3.1  Laboratory Correlates of R esponse (depending on sample availability)  
1) Assessment of tumor baseline PD -L1 expression may be performed.  
2) Assessment of the genomic and neoantigen landscape of baseline tumors may be performed.  
3) Assessment of dynamics of circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) may be performed.

24 5. Study Design 
5.1 Overview  
This is a single arm, unblinded, open- label phase 2 study of durvalumab administered 
concurrently with pemetrexed/cisplatin chemotherapy as first -line treatment for 
unresectable pleural mesothelioma. The first six patients enrolled will be monitored f or 
safety of the combination. A  maximum of 55 patients  (50 patients to be treated with expected 
ineligibility rate of 10%)  will be enrolled and will receive up to 6 three week cycles of 
concurrent durvalumab with chemotherapy . Patients with responding or stable disease after  
six cycles of concurrent  treatment will continue on durvalumab as a single agent 
admi nistered once every 3 weeks . Maximum duration of durvalumab treatment is 12 months 
(inclusive of any treatment delays or missed treatments ) starting from Cycle 1 of concurrent  
treatment . 
Carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin in patients with a documented contraindication 
(e.g., ototoxicity, renal function) to the use of cisplatin . These patients must otherwise fulfill 
the eligibility criteria  (Section 3) . In addition, for patients who receive cisplatin, c arboplatin 
may also be substituted after Cycle 1 for cisplatin related toxicity (e. g., grade 3 ototoxicity, 
grade 3 nausea) at the investigator’s discretion. Once carboplatin is substituted for  cisplatin, 
patients cannot change back to cisplatin.  
The study will be conducted at up to [ADDRESS_542697] guidelines V ersion 1.1 [42] with modific ations for pleural mesothelioma. All subjects 
will be followed for survival until the end of study (Section 7.2 ). AEs and SAEs will be 
followed as per Section 8. The objectives  are described in Section 2. 
5.2 Initial Enrollment of Six Patients with Safety Monitoring  
As durvalumab has not been previously combined with pemetrexed platinum chemotherapy 
the study will commence with an initial enrollment of 6 patients who will receive pemetrexed 
and cisplatin  (or carboplatin described in S ection 3 and Section 5.1) c ombined with 
durvalumab for up to [ADDRESS_542698] a PR or SD  will continue on 
durvalumab until disease progression. In this initial run- in period subjects will be monitored 
for safety. The combination will be declared intolerable  if ≥ [ADDRESS_542699] 15 patients who completed two cycles of therapy was 
also completed w ithout suspension to accrual  (Section 12.2.5 for details)  and no safety 
concerns noted . It is expected that 50 of the 55 patients  enrolled  will receive treat ment 
(ineligibility rate of 10%). Carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin for patients with a documented contraindication (e.g., ototoxicity, renal function) to use of cisplatin and these 
patients must otherwise ful fill the eligibility criteria  as not ed in Section [ADDRESS_542700] for clinical progression will be at the discretion of the 
Investigator.  If a patient is deriving clinical benefit they may continue durvalumab (either

25 concurrent or single agent) until a repeat scan at least 4 weeks later  (Section 9.1.5) . 
Response assessments will be performed every [ADDRESS_542701] 18 weeks. After 18  
weeks of treatment, response assessments will be performed every 9 weeks. The same 
method of assessment should be used throughout the study.  
Followin g documentation of non- fatal confirmed disease progression, all subjects will be 
followed for survival (either routine clinic visit or telephone contact) every 3  months until 
death or the close of the study.

26 6. Treatment Plan  
6.1 Overview  
This is a single arm , open -label phase 2 study of durvalumab administered concurrently with 
pemetrexed/ cisplatin (carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin o nly as outlined in Section 
3 and Section 5.1) chemotherapy as first -line treatment for unresectable pleural 
mesothelioma. The first six patients enrolled will be monitored for safety of the combination. 
A maximum of 55 patients will be enrolled and will receive up to six 3 week cycles of 
concurrent  durvalumab with chemotherapy. Patients with responding or stable disease aft er 
6 cycles of concurrent treatment will continue on durvalumab as a single agent administered 
once every 3 weeks. Maximum duration of durvalumab treatment is 12 months  (inclusive of 
any treatment delays or missed treatments)  starting from Cycle 1 of concurrent  treatment . 
6.1.1  Durvalumab Administration  
Durvalumab will be administered before pemetrexed and cisplatin chemotherapy. 
Durvalumab 112 0 mg will be administered by  [CONTACT_428909] 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22- μm in -line filter. 
Less than [ADDRESS_542702] infusion time is 1 hour. However, if there are interruptions during infusion, 
the total allo wed time should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature. Please refer 
to Section 11.1 and guidelines in  Section 11.1.7  and Table 11- 1. 
6.1.2  Pemetrexed/Cisplatin Administration  
The recommended dose of pemetrexed is 500 mg/m2 administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 10 minutes  (or per investigator discretion and local 
standard- of-care)  on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle.  
During concurrent  treatment days, pemetrexed infusion will begin approximately 30 
minutes after the infusion of durvalumab has finished (or per inv estigator discretion 
and local standard- of-care) . 
The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 infused over 2 hours beginning 
approximately 30 minutes after the end of pemetrexed administration (or per 
investigator discretion and local standard- of-care) . Patients should receive 
appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin.  Hydration may 
commence prior to or concurrently with durvalumab.  
If carboplatin is substituted for cisplatin per Section 3.9  and Section 5.1, the 
recommended dose of carboplatin is AUC 5 infused over 30 minutes beginning approximately 15- 30 minutes after the end of the pemetrexed administration ( or per 
investigator discretion and local standard- of-care) . 
CALVERT  FORMULA  FOR  CARBOPLATIN  DOSING  
Total  Dose (mg) = (target  AUC)  x (CrCL by [CONTACT_3158] -Gault [Appendix II]  + 25)

[IP_ADDRESS]  Antiemetics  for use with Pemetrexed/Cisplatin (Carboplatin)  
Antiemetic premedication will be administered according to local standards. Recommended antiemetic treatments are dexamethasone (dosing according to local standards ; an equivalent dose of another 
corticosteroid may be substituted) and a 5- HT3 receptor antagonist 
(type per investigator discretion and local standard- of-care). Additional 
use of antiemetic premedications may be employed at the discretion of the Investigator.  
6.1.3  Pemetrexed/ Cisplatin ( or Carboplatin) Re- Treatment  
Prior to each treatment with pemetrexed/cisplatin (carboplatin) , the following 
conditions must be met.  
• ANC  must be ≥ 1500/mm
3 and platelets ≥  100,000/mm3 prior to the start of each 
cycle. Growth factor support is permitted, and should be administered per  
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidel ine. 
• Pemetrexed: CrCL ≥ 45.  
• Cisplatin: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 or CrCL ≥ 50. 
o Carboplatin may be substituted for cisplatin in  patients with ≤ Grade 2 renal 
function at the investigator’s discretion. Once carboplatin is substituted for cisplatin, patients cannot change back to cisplatin.  
• Carboplatin:  CrCL ≥ 45. 
• All other drug -related non- hematologic toxicities must have improved to 
baseline or ≤ Grade 2. Exceptions to this criterion include alopecia and other 
toxicities of non- vital organs.  
Treatment may be delayed for up to 3 weeks to allow sufficient time for recovery from treatment -related toxicities. If a delay greater than 3 weeks is required, the 
Investigator should confer with PrECOG to determine the appropriateness of continued treatment. In the event of a treatment delay, subsequent cycles should 
occur relative to the delayed cycle (maintaining a 3- week cycle interval). In other 
words, subsequent cycles should not be shortened to “make- up” for any delays.

• Any Grade 4 immune- mediat ed adverse event  (imAE) 
• Any ≥ Grade 3 colitis  
• Any Grade 3 or 4 non-infectious  pneumonitis irrespective of duration  
• Any Grade 2 pneumonitis that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 3 days of the initiation of maximal supportive care  
• Any Grade 3 i mAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis, that does not downgrade to Grade 
2 within 3 days  after onset of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_178507] ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days  
• Liver transaminase elevation >8x ULN or total bilirubin >5x ULN 
The definition excludes the following conditions : 
• Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days  
• Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], and/or adrenal insufficiency) that is managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and/or hormone replacement 
therapy and the subject is asymptomatic 
• Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local antitumor response (e.g. , 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc .) 
• Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade  
• Grade 3 infusion- related reaction (first occurrence and  in the absence of steroid 
prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management  
• Grade [ADDRESS_542709] 1 grade within 3 days. Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia will 
be a DLT regardless of duration or reversibility . 
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia  
• Grade [ADDRESS_542710] 1 grade within 3 days  
• Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities  not associated with cl inical signs or 
symptoms and reversed with appropriate maximal medical intervention within 3 days  
Immune- mediat ed AEs are defined as AEs of an immune nature (i .e., inflammatory) in the 
absence of a clear alternative etiology. In the absence of a clinically significant abnormality, 
repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior to 
designation as a DLT.  
6.2.1  DLT Assessment  – Initial Enrollment of Six P atients  
For the purposes of safety decision making during the initial enrollment of six patients, DLTs will be evaluated for the first 2 cycle s (2 doses) of concurrent  therapy 
with durval umab, pemetrexed and cisplatin. DLTs occurring beyond t his window will 
be taken into account when determining whether to proceed to enroll the full planned cohort of 55. DLTs will be monitored for the first  2 cycle s (42 days) of 
concurrent  therapy.  Depending on the rate of accrual and review of the data 
pertai ning to DLT evaluation, accrual may be halted to ensure it is safe to continue 
patient enrollment.

29 6.2.2  Phase II Treatment Administration  
During the total enrollment of 55 patients (50 expected to commence therapy) , 
toxicity will con tinue to be closely monitored. Because this is the first time that 
durvalumab is being combined with pemetrexed/ cisplatin  in this setting, close 
monitoring of toxicity is an important endpoint of the trial. We will also collect data 
and conduct an interim safety analysis among the first [ADDRESS_542711] 2 cycle s (6 weeks)  of concurrent  therapy without suspension to 
accrual. The safety analysis will be done based on the electronic case report form  
(eCRF)  database. This preliminary toxicity analysis will occur in addition to the twice 
yearly monitoring for toxicity for the purposes of interim reporting.  
Interim analysis on first [ADDRESS_542712] 2 cycles of concurrent therapy showed no safety concerns.  
6.3 Dose Delays & Modifications  
All toxicities should be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE V4.0 3). A copy 
of the CTCAE  V4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://www.ctep.cancer.gov ). 
A 3 day window is allowed for scheduled therapy, tests  and/or results  except as noted below 
for CBC with differential and platelet count. Delays due to holidays, weekends, bad weather or other unforeseen  circumstances will be permitted. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_542713] partly due to administration of durvalumab, the 
following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:  
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding the 
agent suspected of causing the toxicity where required).  
• If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be 
given to continuing the same dose of durvalumab along with appropri ate 
continuing supportive care.  If medically appropriate, dose modifications are 
permitted for durvalumab (Table 6- 1 and 6-2 ). 
• All dose modifications should be documented with clear reasoning and documentation of the approach taken.  
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab should be perm anently discontinued.  
Following the first dose of durvalumab, subsequent administration of durvalumab can be modified based on toxicities observed  (Table 6-1 and 6-2). Dose reductions 
are not permitted for durvalumab. 
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab leading to T -cell activation and 
proliferation, there is the possibility of observing immune mediated Adverse Events 
(imAEs) dur ing the conduct of this study.  Potential i mAEs include immune- mediated 
enterocoli tis, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies. Subjects should be

Immune -Mediat ed 
Adverse Events  
(Overall Management 
For toxicities not noted 
below)  Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be made 
to manage potential immune- mediat ed AEs based on severity of treatment -
emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE V 4.03.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/regimen 
based on CTC grade/severity (table below ), permanent ly discontinue study 
drug/study regimen for  the following conditions:  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤ 10 mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_542715] dose of study drug/regimen . 
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE 
following resumption of dosing.  It is recommended that management of immune -mediated 
adverse events ( imAEs) follow  the guidelines presented in this 
table : 
- It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune 
mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all organs, 
some of them not noted specifically in these guidelines.  
- Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or 
laboratory indication of such events) are noted in these 
guidelines or not, patients should be thoroughly evaluated 
to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease 
progression, concomitant medications, infections, etc.)  to a 
possible immune-mediated event . In the absence of a clear 
alternative etiology, all such events should be managed as 
if they were immune related.  
General Recommendations:  
- Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_27549]-grade (Grade 1 or 2, unl ess otherwise specified) 
events . 
- For persistent  (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe 
(Grade ≥  3) events  promptly start prednisone 1-2 
mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent . 
- Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or 
mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if 
they are not currently noted in the guidelines – should 
progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_428889] 
(methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the event 
is Grade 2, and if clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_27551]/or there has 
been clinical confirmation. Consider, as necessary, 
discussing with the study physician, and promptly pursue 
specialist consultat ion. 
- If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of taper), increase the corti
costeroid dose 
(prednisone dose [e.g. up to 2 -4 mg/kg/day PO or IV 
equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of 
symptoms, then resume corticosteroid  tapering at a slower 
rate (> 28 days of taper) . Grade 1  No dose modification  
Grade 2  Hold study  drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to 
≤ Grade 1. 
• If toxicity worsens then treat  as Grade 3 or Grade 4. 
- Study drug/study treatment can be resumed once event 
stabilizes to Grade ≤ 1 after completion of steroid taper.  
- Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study drug/study regimen on the following conditions:  
1) Event stabilizes and is controlled  
2) Patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating physician’s clinical judgement, and  
3) Doses of prednisone are ≤ 10 mg/day or equivalent.  
Grade 3  Depending on the individual toxicity, may permanently discontinue study drug/  study regimen. Please refer to guidelines below .

    Grade 4  Permanently discontinue study drug/  study regimen.  
NOTE : For Grade 3 and above asymptomatic amylase or lipase 
levels hold study drug/regimen and if complete work up 
shows no evidence of pancreatitis, may continue or 
resume study drug/regimen. 
NOTE:  Study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 3 events with high likelihood for 
morbidity and/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or other 
similar events even if they are not currently noted in the 
guidelines. Similarly, consider whether study drug/study 
regimen should be permanently discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or other similar events even if they 
are not currently noted in the guidelines – when they do 
not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27552] <1 upon treatment with 
systemic steroids and following full taper. 
NOTE:  There are some exceptions to permanent di scontinuation 
of study drug for Grade 4 events (i.e., hypo or hyper -
thyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus)  - More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF  inhibitors 
(e.g., infliximab)  - (also refer to individual sections of  the 
imAE for specific type of immunosuppressive) should be 
considered for events not responding to systemic steroids.  
Progression to use of more potent immunosuppressives 
should proceed more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_428890]/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or other 
similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines – 
when these events are not responding to

- With long -term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, 
consider need for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, 
formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) 
prophylaxis, gastroint estinal protection, and glucose 
monitoring.  
- Discontinuation of study drug is not mandated for Grade 3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumo r 
response (e.g. inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic 
disease, lymph nodes etc.). Continuation of study drug in 
this situation should be based upon a benefit /risk analysis 
for that patient .

7.1 Study Duration  
Patients will receive protocol therapy unless:  
1. Disease progression per modified RECIST Version.1.1 guidelines  (notwithstanding the 
specific criteria for treatment beyond progression outlined in Section 9.1.5) or clinical 
progression.  
2. Toxicities considered unacceptable by [CONTACT_12692], despi[INVESTIGATOR_12657] . 
3. Development of an inter -current illness that prevents further administration of study 
treatment . 
4. Extraordinary Medical Circumstances: If at any time the constraints of this protocol are 
detrimental to the patient's health, protocol treatment should be discontinued.  
5. Patient withdraws consent  or is unable to comply with study procedures . 
7.[ADDRESS_542735] dose of durvalumab 
or until initiation of alternative anticancer therapy . 
If a patient  is removed from treatment for reason(s) other than progression, follow with 
regular tumor assessments per standard of care until progression or start of new treatment.  
Following documentation of non- fatal confirmed disease progression, all subjects will be 
followed f or survival (either routine clinic visit or telephone contact)  every 3 months until 
death or the close of the study . 
For patients who are registered but do not receive any protocol therapy, baseline and follow -
up information per Section 10 will be collected.  
7.3 Criteria for Removal from Study Treatment   
A genuine effort will be made to determine the reason(s) why a patient fails to return for the necessary visits or is discontinued from the trial, should this occur. It will be documented whether or not each patient completed the clinical study. If for any patient study treatment or observations were disc ontinued , the reason will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
Reasons that a patient may discontinue treatment  in a clinical study are considered to 
constitute one of the following:  
1. Recurrence of disease or documented progression of disease  (unless continued 
treatment with study drug is deemed appropriate at the discretion of the investigator) . 
2. Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment per investigator discretion.  
3. Dose- limiting toxicity ( Section 6.2 for definition of DLT) . 
4. Any AE that meets criteria for discontinuation as defined in Section 6.3.1, Table 6- 1 and  
Table 6- 2. 
5. Unacceptable adverse events.  
6. Grade ≥ 3 infusion reaction to durvalumab 
7. Treatment interruption of more than 6 weeks  after a scheduled treatment day . 
8. Investigator discontinues treatment . 
9. Initiation of alternative anticancer therapy including another investigational agent . 
10. Pregnancy  or intent to become pregnant .

carcinoma in- situ) that requires treatment, which would interfere with this study . 
12. The patient may choose to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
13. General or specific changes  in the patient's condition that render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
14. S evere non- compliance to protocol as judged by [CONTACT_093].  
15. Lost to follow -up. 
16. Death.  
17. Closure of study by [CONTACT_12694].  
Any patient who receives at least one dose of study drug, durvalumab,  will be included in 
the safety analysis. Patients who discontinue study treatment early should be followed for 
response assessments , if possible. Follow -up will continue per Section 10, as applicable.

55 8. Adverse Event Reporting 
8.1 Collection of Safety Information  
Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of 
a pre- existing medical condition in a patient administered a medicinal product in a clinical 
investigation and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a product 
(investigational or marketed), whether or not considered related to the product 
(investigational or marketed).  
After informed consent, but prior to initiation of study treatment ( pemetrexed, cisplatin [or 
carboplatin],  and/or durvalumab), only AEs/SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated 
intervention will be collected (e.g., SAEs related to invasive procedures such as biopsies). After the initiation of study treatment, all identified AEs and SAEs must be recorded and 
described on the appropriate page of the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). If known, 
the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than individual symptoms. The following information should be documented for all AEs: date of onset and resolution, severity of the event; the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_12658] (see definitions below); treatment required for the AE treatment 
required for the AE; cause of the event (if known); and information regarding 
resolution/outcome.  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the  eCRF (e.g., abnormalities that require  study drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more- frequent follow -up assessments, 
further diagnostic investigation, etc.).  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5x the ULN associated with cholecystitis), only the 
diagnosis (e.g., cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be 
recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia” . 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the eCRF unless  their severity, 
seriousness, or etiology changes.  
Severity 
The categories and definitions of severity used for clinical trials AEs are defined in the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) V4.0 3 (http://ctep.canc er.gov/
). 
Attribution  
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship or attribution to study drug should be used to assess Adverse Events:  
• Definite: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event. The event response to withdrawal of study drug (dechallenge) and recurs with rechallenge, if clinically feasible.  
• Probable: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
event. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not required. 
• Possible: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the event. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear.  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0505 
Confidential  
Date: 3/19/2018  
 
56 • Unlikely: There is doubtful causal relationship between the study drug and the event.  
• Unrelated: There is clearly not  a causal relationship between the study drug and the 
event or there is a causal relationship between another drug, concurrent disease, or 
circumstances and the event.  
Categories ‘definite’, ‘probable’ and ‘possible’ are considered study drug related. Categories 
‘unlikely’ and ‘unrelated’ are considered not study drug- related.  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an AE. New cancers are those 
that are not the primary reason for administration of study treatment and have been identified after  inclusion of the patient into the clinical study.  
AEs related to pemetrexed and/or cisplatin (or carboplati n) should be followed for [ADDRESS_542736] dose of study therapy  or until the initiation of alternative anticancer 
therapy  until ≤ grade [ADDRESS_542737] dose of 
durvalumab or until the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy  until ≤ grade 1 or 
stabilization, and reported as SAEs if they become serious.  
Any AE’s (seriou s or not) that occur after the above time periods but are deemed to 
be at least possibly related to study therapy shall be reported.  
8.[ADDRESS_542738] (AESI)  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the Investigational Product and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_428912] . An AESI may be serious or  non-serious. 
The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to 
characterize and understand them in association with the use of this investigational product.  
AESIs for durvalumab include but are not limited to events with a potential inflammatory or 
immune- mediated mechanism and which may require more frequent monitoring and/or 
interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormone replacement therapy. 
These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies with durvalumab monotherapy 
and combination therapy. An immune- mediated adverse event (i mAE) is defined as an 
adverse event that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism of action and where there is no clear alternate etiology. Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, 
metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic causes of the i mAE.  
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an i mAE, 
the Investigator should promptly contact [CONTACT_38234].  
AESIs observed with durvalumab include:  
• Colitis  
• Pneumonitis /Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)  
• ALT/AST increases/hepatitis/hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy/ neuromuscular toxicity (i.e. events of encephalitis, peripheral motor and 
sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy (i.e. events of hypophysitis /hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] , Type I diabet es mellitus, 
adrenal insufficiency, and hyper - and hypothyroidism)  
• Dermatitis /Rash/Pruritis  
• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis (or labs suggestive of pancreatitis - increased serum lipase, increased 
serum amylase)

57 • Myocarditis  
• Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic Reactions  
Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the durvalumab Investigator Brochure.  
8.2.1  Gastrointestinal Disorders  
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commonly observed treatment emergent SAE when 
tremelimumab is used as monotherapy. In rare cases, colon perforation may occur that requires surgery (colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly managed.  
Guidelines on management of diarrhea and colitis in patients receiving durvalumab are provided in Section 6.3.1, Table 6- 1. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_542739] as pneumonitis has been reported with anti -PD-1 MAbs [47]. Initial work -up should include high- resolution CT scan, 
ruling out infection, and pulse oximetry. Pulmonary consultation is highly recommended.  
Guidelines for the management of subjects with immune- mediated events including 
pneumonitis are outlined in Section 6.3.1, Table 6- 1. 
8.2.3  Hepatic Function Abnormalities (H epatotoxicity)  
Increased transaminases have been reported during treatment with anti -PD-
L1/anti -PD-1 antibodies [48 ]. Inflammatory hepatitis has been reported in 3% to 9% 
of subjects treated with anti CTLA- 4 monoclonal antibodies (e.g., ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The 
clinical manifestations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_43844]-treated subjects included general weakness, 
fatigue, nausea and/or mild fever and increased liver function tests such as AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and/or total bilirubin.  
Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3x ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than 2x ULN. Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or from separate 
blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. Follow -up investigations and 
inquiries  will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_83762]/or whether there is objective evidence that clearly 
supports causation by a disease (e.g., cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product.  
Guidelines for management of subjects with hepatic function abnormality are 
outlined in Section 6.3.1, Table 6- 1. 
Cases where a subject shows an AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN or  total bilirubin ≥ 2x  ULN 
may need to be reported as SAEs. These cases should be reported as SAEs if, 
after evaluation they meet the criteria for a Hy’s Law case or if any of the individual liver test parameters fulfill any of the SAE criteria.  
Criteria for Hy’s Law (FDA G uidance 2009)  
• The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a higher incidence 
of 3- fold or greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the 
(non- hepatotoxic) control drug or placebo. 
• Among trial subjects showing such aminotransferase elevations, often with 
aminotransferases  much greater than 3x ULN, one or more also show elevation  
of serum total bilirubin to >2x ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis 
(elevated serum alkaline phosphatase) .

58 • No other reason can be found to explain the combination of increased 
aminotransferases and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre-
existing or acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the observed injury . 
8.2.4  Neurotoxicity  
Immune- mediated nervous system events include encephalitis, peripheral motor 
and sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis.  
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune- mediated neurotoxic 
events are provided in Section 6.3.1, Table 6- 1. 
8.2.5  Endocrine Disorders  
Immun e-mediated endocrinopathies include hypophysitis /hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297] , Type I 
diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper - and hypothyroidism.  
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune- mediated endocrine 
events are provided in Section 6.3.1,  Table 6- 1. 
8.2.[ADDRESS_542740]. Monitor for signs and symptoms that may be related to changes in renal function (e.g. routine urinalysis, elevated serum BUN and creatinine, decreased creatinine clearance, electrolyte imbalance, decrease in urine output, proteinuria, etc.).  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, infections etc.).  
Steroids should be considered in the absence of clear alternative etiology even for low grad e events (Grade 2), in order to prevent potential progression to higher 
grade event.  
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune- mediated neurotoxic 
events are provided in Section 6.3.1, Table 6- 1. 
8.2.7  Pancreatic Disorders  
Immune- mediated pancreatitis includes autoimmune pancreatitis, and lipase and 
amylase elevation.  
Guidelines for the management of patients with immune- mediated pancreatic 
disorders are provided in Section 6.3.1, Table 6- 1. 
8.2.8  Myocarditis  
Immune -mediated myocarditis  includes  decreased ejection fraction,  arrhythmias, 
and in particular occurrences of atrioventricular block.  
For patients with suspected myocarditis,  investigators should obtain a cardiology  
consult and institute  full diagnostic work -up (that includes  exclusion of other 
alternate causes such as  infection) and the appropriate management that includes  
discontinuing drug (permanently  if biopsy -proven immune- mediated myocarditis) 
and the prompt use of steroids or other immunosuppressives.  Patients with pre-
existing  cardiac disorders should be closely  monitored for deterioration in their 
cardiac condition, which could suggest new onset myocarditis.

• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_428893]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above).  
Examples of  such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
8.4 SAE Reporting Requirements  
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above. The investigator should inform PrECOG of any SAE within [ADDRESS_542743] be completed and supplied to Pr ECOG within 24 hours/[ADDRESS_542744] be as complete as possible, including details 
of the current illness and (serious) adverse event, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the investigational product(s). Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values 
received after the report) must be documented on a follow -up PrECOG SAE report form. A 
final report to document resolution of the SAE is required. The investigator is responsible 
for following all SAEs until resolution, until the subject returns to baseline status, or until the 
condition has stabilized with the expectation that it will remain chronic, even if this extends beyond study participation.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SAE report to 
PrECOG should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient records.

as discussed above. Relevant follow -up information will be provided to [COMPANY_008]  as soon 
as it becomes available.  
Investigators should also report event(s) to their IRB as required.  
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Full 
descriptions of each event will be followed. Thus, follow -up information which becomes 
available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_428894]), should be collected subsequently, if not available at the 
time of the initial report, and immediately sent using the same procedure as the initial SAE report.  
All SA Es, regardless of causality (Section 8.4.1 for additional information for hepatic function 
abnormal ity) must be collected which occur within [ADDRESS_542747] dose of durvalumab, unless related to progression of disease (disease progression 
will be documented, but not reported as an SAE) . After [ADDRESS_542748] .

8.4.1  Hepatic Function A bnormality  
Hepatic function abnormality (as defined in Section 8.2.3)  in a study subject, with 
or without associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic

61 • If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established 
and is unrelated to investigational product, the decision to continue dosing of 
the study subject will be based on the clinical judgment of the investigator.  
• If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, dosing of the study subject must be interrupted immediately. Follow -up investigations 
and inquiries must be initiated by [CONTACT_38238].  
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_428913].

sent, if available.  
NOTE : Once data regarding survival and remission status are no longer required by [CONTACT_12695], no follow -up data should be submitted.  
8.6 Procedures in Case of Pregnancy  
Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and male patients with 
a female partner of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unint entional 
pregnancy, documented in the informed consent.

Congenital abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.
 The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, 
elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from 
the study.  
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel should inform PrECOG  within [ADDRESS_542751] dose of durvalumab.

Overdose does not automatically make an AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are serious, for example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is serious and must be recorded and reported as an SAE (Section 8.4). There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an

9.1 Solid Tumor Response Criteria (RECIST Version 1.1)  
9.1.1 Malignant Disease Evaluation  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) guideline Version 1.[ADDRESS_542756] modifications used in the evaluation 
of mesothelioma [ 42, 49-50]. Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in RECIST.  
To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline to which subsequent measurements will be compared. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155].  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by [CONTACT_2363] a ruler or calipers. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow -up. All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than four weeks before registration.  
The term evaluable in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
At baseline, tumor lesions will be characterized as either measurable or non-
measurable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Measurable  
Measura ble tumor lesions are those that can be accurately measured 
in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of 
measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• ≥ [ADDRESS_542757] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI ( no 
less than double the slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm) 
• ≥ 10 mm caliper measurement by c linical exam (when superficial)  
• ≥ [ADDRESS_542758] x -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by 
[CONTACT_6776])  
If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic 
nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignant Lymph Nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis (perpendicular to longest diameter) 
when assessed by [CONTACT_3610].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non- Measurable  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions not 
meeting the criteria in [IP_ADDRESS]  and 9 .1.1.2, are considered non-
measurable lesions. This includes lymph nodes measured at  ≥ 10 to 
<15 mm in the short axis. NOTE:  Lymph  nodes measured at <10 mm 
in the short axis are considered normal.  
Lesions considered to be non- measurable include the following: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of the skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by

64 physical exam that is not measurable by [CONTACT_428914].  
NOTE:  ‘Cystic lesions’ that meet the criteria for radiographically 
defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant 
lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Lytic bone lesions, with an identifiable soft tissue component, evaluated by [CONTACT_462], can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component otherwise meets the definition of measurability in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Blastic bone lesions are non- measurable.  
Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco- regional therapy, are usually not 
considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
9.1.2 Definitions of Response  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum  of 2 lesions per organ and 5  
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameters), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
The sum of the target lesions (longest diameter for non- nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum of the diameters/axes will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Complete Response (CR)  
The disappearance of all target lesions. A ny pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if there are target nodes). To be 
assigned a status of complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_428915] ≥ [ADDRESS_542759] met.  
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters/axes of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameter s/axes . To be 
assigned a status  of partial response, changes in tumor measurements

Date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_542760] be confirmed by [CONTACT_428915] ≥ 4 weeks  after 
the criteria for response is met.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters/axes of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes 
the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm over the nadir. ( NOTE : the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progression).  
Please refer to Section 9.1.5 for Immune- Related Response for 
guidance.  
Stable Disease (SD)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diam eters/axes 
while on study. ( NOTE : a change of 20% or more that does not 
increase the sum of the diameters by 5 mm or more is coded as stable disease).  
To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must  have 
met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entr y at a 
minimum interval of ≥ 4 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-T arget Lesions  
All other lesions or sites of disease including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions and lymph nodes measured at ≥ 10 
to <15 mm in the short axis should be identified as non-target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up. 
Complete Response (CR)  
The disappearance of all non- target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker levels, if applicable. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis). To be assigned a status of complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_428915] ≥ [ADDRESS_542761] met.  
NOTE:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, 
they must normalize for a patient to be considered in 
complete clinical response.  
Non- CR/Non- PD 
The persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/ or the 
maintenance of tumor marker levels above the normal limits. To be assigned a status of Non- CR/Non -PD, measurements must have met 
the Non- CR/Non -PD criteria at least once after study entr y at a 
minimum interval of ≥ 4 weeks.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  
The appearance of one or more new lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. Unequivocal progression  
should not normally trump target lesion status. It must be 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0505 
Confidential  
Date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_542762] “increase” in the size of one or more non- target lesions is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-
target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore 
be extremely rare.  
When the patient only has non- measurable disease, the increase in 
overall disease burden should be comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e., an increase in tumor burden from “trace” to “large”, an increase in 
nodal disease from “localized”  to “widespread”, or an increase sufficient 
to require a change in therapy.  
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional,

Please refer to Section 9.1.5 for Immune- Related Response for 
guidance.  
9.1.3 Evaluation of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions constitutes Progressive Disease (PD)  however this 
should lead to clinical  evaluation as guided by [CONTACT_8985] 9.1.5 below . 
9.1.4 Symptomatic Deterioration  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
9.1.5  Immune-R elated Response  
The response to immunotherapy may differ from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_428895] [51 , 52]: 
• Response to immunotherapy m ay be delayed . 
• Response to immunotherapy may occur after PD by [CONTACT_428916]. 
• The appearance of new lesions may not represent PD with immunotherapy . 
• SD while on immunotherapy may be durable and represent clinical benefit.  
Based on the above- described unique response to immunotherapy and based on 
guidelines from regulatory agencies, e.g., European Medicines Agency’s “Guideline 
on the evaluation of anti- cancer medicinal products in man” 
(EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4)  [53] for immune modulating a nti-cancer compounds, 
the study will implement the following in addition to standard RECIST 1.1 criteria:  
• RECIST will be modified so that PD must be confirmed at the next scheduled visit, preferably, and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD 
in the absence of clinically significant deterioration. Treatment with durvalumab 
would continue between the initial assessment of progression and confirmation for progression.  
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0505 
Confidential  
Date: 3/19/2018  
 
67 • In addition, subjects may continue to receive durvalumab beyond confirmed PD 
in the absence of clinically significant deterioration and if investigators consider that subjects continue to receive benefit from treat ment.  
Modification of RECIST as described may discourage the earl y discontinuation of 
durvalumab and provide a more complete evaluation of its anti- tumor activity than 
would be seen with conventional response criteria. Nonetheless, the efficacy analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_428917] 1.1 criteria modified for mesothelioma.  
Of note, clinically significant deterioration is considered to be a rapid tumor 
progression that necessitates treatment with anti- cancer therapy other than 
durvalumab or with symptomatic progression that requires urgent medical 
intervention ( e.g., symptomatic central nervous system metastasis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_428896], spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]).  
9.2 Evaluation of Patient’s Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
confirmed disease progression or non- protocol therapy (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). Assessment of 
best overall response should allow for immune- related response patterns as described in 
Section 9.1.5. The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of 
both measurement and confirmation criteria (Table 9-1). 
To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_428915] ≥ [ADDRESS_542763] once after study entry  at a minimum interval  of ≥ 4 weeks .

9.2.1 Methods of Measurement  
Imaging based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_12148]. The 
same imaging modality should be used throughout the study to measure disease (preferred but not mandated).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm 
in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CXR 
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable 
lesions when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. 
However, CT is preferable.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CT and MRI  
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_542764] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also 
acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is 
performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up 
should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques, if possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PET-CT 
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for 
use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnosti c CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0505 
Confidential  
Date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_542765] int roduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Ultrasound  
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be 
used as a method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot 
be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified b y ultrasound in 
the course of the study, confirmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Endoscopy, Lapar oscopy  
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine 
relapse in trials where recurrence following CR  or surgical resection is 
an endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Markers  
Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cytology, Histology  
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR  in 
rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appear s or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has 
met criteria for response or SD  is mandatory to differentiate between 
response or SD  (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and 
PD.

of durvalumab (i .e., 15.0 mL for 750 mg or  30.0 mL for 1500 mg of durvalumab) is 
added to the IV bag such that final concentration is within 1 to 20 mg/mL (IV bag 
volumes 100 to 1000 mL). Mix the bag by [CONTACT_428920].  
11.1.7  Route of Administration  
Durvalumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C ) by 
[CONTACT_377282] a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of durvalumab, the entire contents of the IV bag should be administered 
as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2, or 0.22 -μm 
in-line filter. Less than 55 minutes is considered a deviation.  
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV solution (0.9% [w/v] saline) equal to the priming volume of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the 
full dose is administered and document if the line was not flushed.  
Standard infusion time is 1 hour.  However, i f there are interruptions during infusion, the 
total allowed time should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature. The table below 
summarizes time allowances and temperatures.

11.1.8  Monitoring of Dose A dministration  
Subjects will be monitored before, during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs at the times specifi ed in Section 10. Subjects are monitored (pulse rate, 
blood pressure) every 30 minutes during the infusion period (including times where infusion rate is slowed or temporarily stopped).  
11.1.9  Management of Infusion R eaction  
In the event of a ≤  Grade 2 infusion- related reaction, the infusion rate of study drug 
may be decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and re- initiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion . For subjects 
with a ≤  Grade 2 infusion related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered 
at 50% of the initial rate.  Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (e.g., 
diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be admini stered at the discretion of the investigator.  Steroids should not be used for 
routine premedication of ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_542786] infusion time is one hour, however if there are interruptions during 
infusion, the total allowed time from infusion start to completion of infusion should not

81 12. Statistical Considerations 
12.1 Study Design & Sample Size Considerations  – Safety Run- In 
12.1.1  Study Design and Objectives – Initial Six Patients Enrolled  
It is planned to enroll a total of 55 patients (50 expected to receive treatment) on this 
study, the first six patients enrolled will be monitored for safety of the combinatio n of 
durvalumab with pemetrexed/ cisplatin (or carboplatin) . Standard induction with 
pemetrexed/cisplatin  (or carboplatin)  will be given for six 3- week cycles with the 
addition of concurrent durvalumab dosed at [ADDRESS_542794] for malignant mesothelioma will continue on single agent durvalumab at the same dose every 3 weeks until disease progression or a maximum  
duration of 12 months of durvalumab starting from Cycle 1 of concurrent treatment . 
The initial 6 patients completed 2 cycles of concurrent therapy with no DLTs.  
12.1.2  Statistical Analysis Plan for Safety  
This study will initially enroll 6 patients (from the total of 50 patients expected to enroll and receive treatment) to the combination of pemetrexed/ cisplatin (or carboplatin)  with 
durvalumab. The combination wi ll be declared intolerable if ≥ 2 of the 6 patients 
experience a DLT (defined as in Section 6.2) during the first 2 cycles of concurrent  
therapy. The table below summarizes the probability of declaring this combination safe for range of true but unknown DLT rates:  
True DLT rate  10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 
Probability of < 2 DLTs 
among 6 patients  0.89 0.66 0.42 0.23 0.11 
Upon completion of the trial, we will summarize the total number of patients enrolled 
on the study, and provide summaries of toxicity rates. We will also review and tabulate the DLTs.  
12.1.3  Sample Size C onsiderations  
The study will proceed to enroll a total of  55 patients if 
<[ADDRESS_542795].  
12.2 Expansion P hase 
12.2.1  Expansion Study Design and Objectives  
The initial six patien ts were  monitored for safety, without suspension to accrual and,  
the study will proceed with enrollment of a total of 55 patients of whom it is expected 50 patients will receive treatment (ineligibility rate of 10%). This is a single arm phase II study evaluating the benefit of durvalumab in combination with pemetrexed/ cisplatin  
(or carboplatin)  for the treatment of first -line unresectable pleural mesothelioma. 
Durvalumab will be administered concurrently with C ycle [ADDRESS_542796] line pemetrexed 
and cisplatin (or carboplatin)  followed by [CONTACT_428923] a maxi mum duration of 12 months of durvalumab starting from Cycle 1 
of concurrent treatment. The primary objective of this phase II study is overall survival. 
PrECOG Protocol Number: PrE0505 
Confidential  
Date: 3/19/2018  
 
82 Secondary objectives include progression- free survival, objective response, im mune -
related response, toxicity, and correlatives which will include association of PD -L1 
expression with clinical  outcomes.  
12.2.2  Phase II  Endpoints  
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death from any 
cause. Patients that have not had an event reported at analysis will be censored at their date of last follow -up. 
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to 
documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Patients  who have not experienced an event of interest by [CONTACT_428924]- free. 
Best objective response will be evaluated via RECIST Version 1.1 criteria modified for 
mesothelioma, as described in the Section 9.  
Immune- related response will be evaluated using t he Wolchok criteria [ 51]. 
Toxicity will be de termined using the CTCAE Version 4.[ADDRESS_542797] for the log failure 
rate parameter and tested at a one- sided type I error rate of 10%. Any comparisons of 
subgroups will be made using the logrank test and Cox modeling.  
If toxicity rates are compared between subgroups, Fisher’s exact tests with a one-sided type I error rate of 10% will be used; multivariable logistic regression modeling 
will be used to adjust for the effect of any covariates that are associated with thes e 
categorical outcomes.  
Point estimates of all endpoints will be accompanied by [CONTACT_428925] 95% confidence intervals.  
In the event that there are missing data, no imputation of the missing data will be conducted. We will assume that data are  missing at random and will conduct all 
analyses as originally planned because we do not anticipate an excess of missing 
data.  
Subset analyses are planned for known prognostic factors such as performance 
status, age, gender, etc. Subset analyses  of all variables, including correlatives, are 
considered to be exploratory in nature.  
12.2.4  Phase II Sample Size Considerations  
The primary comparison will include all eligible patients who started protocol 
treatment, of whom 50 will be accrued. After inflating for an ineli gibility rate of 10%, 
the total planned accrual is 55 patients. Based on the randomized phase III trial 
conducted by [CONTACT_428926] [39], we assume that the null hypothesis is that 
the median OS is 12 months with pemetrexed/cisplatin  alone  (refer to Section 1.  for 
additional historical background information) . Using a one- sided 0.[ADDRESS_542798] 90% power to detect a 37% reduction in the OS hazard rate of 0.058 to 0.037 
(with an accrual period of 24 months for the 50 patients in the primary analysis, and 
an additional 18 months for treatment and follow -up); assuming exponential survival, 
this corresponds to a 58% improvement in the median OS of 12 months to 19 months.

Date: 3/19/[ADDRESS_542799] time that durvalumab is being combined with pemetrexed/ 
cisplatin  (or carboplatin)  in this setting, close monitoring of toxicity is an important 
endpoint of the trial. We will collect data and conduct an interim safety analysis among the first [ADDRESS_542800] two cycles of tri- modal therapy 
without suspension to accrual. The safety analysis will be done based on the eCRF . 
This preliminary toxicity analysis will occur in addition to the twice yearly monitoring for toxicity for the purposes of interim reporting. The probability that 5 or more Grade 
4/[ADDRESS_542801] 15 patients is 0.03 if the true Grade 4/5 non-hematologic toxicity rate is 12% as expect ed based on trials of pemetrexed/cisplatin  
in lung cancer and mesothelioma. This probability increases to 0.88 if the true rate of Grade 4/[ADDRESS_542802] 5 G rade 4/[ADDRESS_542803] two cycl es of tri -modal therapy with no safety concerns  noted. 
12.2.6  Phase II  Projected Accrual  
It is estimated that the total accrual goal of 55 patients will be reached in approximately 24 months, with a treatment and follow -up period of approximately 18 months, making 
the entire study duration (including safety and efficacy assessments) approximately 
50 months.

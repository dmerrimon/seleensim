from the UNC Breast Clinic for participation in the study. The primary objective of this single arm study is to compare the sensitivity and 
specificity of a coustic angiography  with traditional b- mode  ultrasound in 
the distinction of malignant vers us benign breast lesions .  Secondary 
objectives include a comparison of area under the curve (AUC) for 
acoustic angiography versus b- mode ultrasound, and comparison of 
radiologist preference for the two imaging techniques  for each of [ADDRESS_737149] common cancer type among women. Approximately 10% of women in the [LOCATION_002] develop breast cancer during their lifetime and 30% to 40% of these patients will die from it.[33, 34] Mammography is an effective tool for the early detection of breast cancer  in the majority of women .[35] However , for women with dense 
breast tissue (considered an independent risk factor for breast cancer) and younger women, mammography performs poorly  due to lower 
sensitivity and specificity in these groups.[37] For young women with heritable mutations who wish to begin screening at a younger age, these limitations are especially problematic.[38] Additionally, mammography is less sensi tive in  women who have undergone breast augmentation. Given 
these limitations , most of these women may  undergo additional imaging 
with breast ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).  
 MRI is time consuming, extraordinarily costly, and has limited availability, 
especially among rural and underserved populations . Another screening 
option, breast ultrasound (without contrast) , is widely used when additional 
imaging beyond mammogram is required due to its real -time imaging 
capability (>30 images per second), portability, safety (does not involve radiation), and relatively low cost compared to breast MRI.  Unfortunately, 
while breast ultrasound is highly sensitive (96%), it is less specific (70%), 
LCCC 1748   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_560971] 8, [ADDRESS_737150] reported an association between microvessel density and poorer recurrence- free, cancer -specific 
and overall survival.[39 -46]. Furthermore, both microvessel density and 
microvessel morphology have been reported to be associated with the clinical response to chemotherapy.[16, 47- 49] However, no current clinical 
imaging modality can directly evaluate the microvasculature associated 
with suspected breast tumors.[50] Histological techniques based on core needle biopsy or surgical biopsy may evaluate only a small portion of a lesion, and require additional invasive procedures. Thus, direct non-invasive evaluation of the tumor micro- vasculature may provide a powerful 
prognostic tool for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and also provide a potential tool for treatment evaluation.  
1.3.1  Screening Based on Angiogene sis-Acoustic An giography  
Acoustic angiography allows for the viewing of vessel shape and delineation of ‘tortuosity,’ which can indicate the presence and progression of cancer. This ability to image the microvasculature depends on the use of a multi (high) frequency ultrasound scanner in addition to a traditional 
single -frequency pulse -echo ultrasound scanner (b- mode ultrasound), the 
latter to ensure accurate anatomical location of the lesion.  Because of this dependence on pulse- echo, the technique is referred to as “acoustic” 
angiography  [62].   
 Acoustic angiography also depends on use of an ultrasound contrast agent. Contrast enhanced ultrasound imaging has been used for nearly two decades for clinical cardiology in the [LOCATION_002] (and is currently routinely used in UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560972]), and is much more 
widely used in Europe and Asia for visualization of blood perfusion in organs, tissues, and tumors.[51] Early concerns about the safety of ultrasound contrast (specifically with the contrast agent (perflu tren lipid; 
Definity®)  due to events in a clinical trial have been resolved; the overwhelming amount of more recent evidence from large clinical studies has shown that contrast ultrasound is very safe.[52- 54] In fact ,it is much 
safer than other commonly used techniques, such as coronary angiography, exercise ECG, or myocardial scintigraphy.[55] Furthermore, it does not have the risks of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis associated with gadolinium based MRI contrast agents when used in renally compromised patients. On October 27, 2011, the FDA eliminated the requirement for

1.4 Perflutren Lipid  Background and Known Toxicities  
See http://www.definityimaging.com/pdf/DEFINITY_US_PI_515987-
0117.pdf  for full prescribing information on perflutren when used according 
to its FDA -approved indication.  Also see section 6.1.5 . 
1.4.1  Background and Current Indications  
Definity® (perflutren lipid) is an FDA -approved lipid- shell microbubble 
ultrasound (US) contrast agent that may be administered by [CONTACT_501347] (IV) bolus or infusion. Currently, this contrast agent is approved for use in patients with suboptimal echocardiograms to opacify the left ventricular chamber and to improve delineation of the left ventricular endocardial border. It is not approved as a contrast agent for acoustic angiography in the breast.  
 When used according to its approved indication, the maximum dose of 
perflutren is administered as either two bolus doses or one single intravenous infusion.  
For our study, perflutren lipid will be administered intravenously by a nurse 
or trained medical personnel  (see section 4.3 ). 
1.4.2  Associated Toxicities  
In pre- market clinical trials 1716 subjects were evaluated with activated 
perflutren lipid. Of the 1716 subjects, 144 subjects (8.4%) had at least one 
treatment -related adverse reaction. There were 26 serious adverse events 
and 15 (0.9%) subjects discontinued because of an adverse event. Nineteen subjects (1.1%) suffered serious cardiopulmonary adverse events including eight deaths. The deaths occurred several days after activated perflutren lipid administration and appear to be related to the course of underlying disease. Of the [ADDRESS_737152] pain, dyspnea or back pain. Adverse events (AEs) appeared within 1 – 15 minutes of the drug 
LCCC 1748   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_560971] 8, [ADDRESS_737153] common events were (% of patients experiencing): headache (2.3%), back and renal pain (1.2%), flushing (1.1%) and nausea (1.0%).  
 Cardiopulmonary Reactions  
In 2007, in response to post -marketing reports of 4 deaths and 190 
serious cardiopulmonary reactions, the FDA issued a black box warning for both Definity® and Optison® adding disease state contraindications and a mandatory [ADDRESS_737154] agents. In all those studies a composite rate of serious adverse events was calculated to be 1 – 3 in 
10,000,[22] compared to gadolinium -based MRI contrast which has an 
incidence of NSF of 2 – 5 in 100 patients with chronic kidney disease.[23]  
 Following a meeting of the FDA Cardio- renal Advisory Committee in 2008, 
the black box warning was revised. The revisions shortened the contraindications to include cardiac shunts and hypersensitivity to perflutren, and mandated the [ADDRESS_737155] included anaphylactoid events and other serious but non- fatal 
adverse reactions, typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 30 minutes of drug administration (see 
the package insert, and section 6.1.5  for additional information. In order to 
avoid a potentially fatal event, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_294366]® (epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) injections will be kept near the US machine for all patients.

5 High Ultrasound Mechanical Index (MI)  
High ultrasound MI values may cause microsphere cavitation or rupture 
and lead to ventricular arrhythmias. In addition, end- systolic triggering with 
high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias.  
 Use in Patients with Known Br east Lesions  
US contrast agents including perflutren should carry no additional risks in patients with a known breast lesions, as they are cleared by [CONTACT_55964]. The phospholipid component of perflutren lipid microspheres are thought to be metabolized to free fatty acids, while the octafluoropropane (OFP), as a stable gas, is not metabolized. In a small (n=8) pharmacokinetic study in healthy subjects, OFP was undetectable after [ADDRESS_737156] subjects either in the blood or expi[INVESTIGATOR_5103], with a mean half -life of 1.3

specificity of conventional ultrasound in women scheduled to undergo a biopsy based on pre-study imaging results.  The gold standard for 
sensitivity and specificity, then, will be based on pathological results. The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) is used by [CONTACT_560983], ultrasounds and MRIs to indicate their level of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_560973]. Scores range from [ADDRESS_737158] cancer. This study is limited to women with a score of 4- 5 based on pre- study imaging.

administered as a bolus, the package insert recommends 10 uL/kg patient weight administered within 30- 60 seconds, followed by a 10mL saline 
flush with a second dose of 10 uL/kg patient weight [ADDRESS_737167] -
perflutren administration by [CONTACT_560987].  
Monitoring will include taking vitals  (O

trained medical personnel will be available as needed.  
 We will infuse via hand bolus injection for a "precision controlled bolus".    
4.3.2  Acoustic Angiography  Imaging Procedures  
Acoustic angiography imaging involves a research ultrasound scanner 
(Verasonics Vantage 256; see section  5.0) as well as  conventional b -
mode ultrasound to guide the location of the imaging.  The conventional 
ultrasound will be conducted just prior to the acoustic angiography for localization.  Imaging will be performed within the package insert 
guidelines for ultrasound system mechanical index (a measurement of output power) when imaging perflutren contrast agent (less than 0.8).  
 Acoustic angiography imaging will be performed by a trained medical personnel using mild compression to eliminate motion. Total imaging time is estimated to be less than [ADDRESS_737168] Abstraction  
The primary  objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and 
specificity of  acoustic angiography imaging. In order to meet  this objective , 
we will review each patient’s clinical records, including their pathology 
LCCC 1748   CONFIDENTIAL

4.6 Reader Study    
A total of five readers (radiologists trained in breast imaging) will be 
recruited to participate in evaluation of all imaging performed under 
LCCC1748.     
In the reader preference study, each reader will be asked to compare the 
acoustic angiography case to the conventional b- mode ultrasound case to 
evaluate the imaging characteristics based on the BIRADS ultrasound lexicon (http://www.acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PDF/QualitySafety /Resourc
es/BIRADS/USLexiconClass.pdf). Specifically the relative ability to evaluate shape, margins and vascularity will be evaluated using a seven-point scale ( -3 to +3) for the paired modality comparisons for each of the 
[ADDRESS_737169] modality presented for the specimen will be considered the primary and the second modality presented will be considered the secondary for the survey instrument.  
After a washout period of four weeks, the modalities will be presented in reverse.  
 The data collection form for the reader study portion is given in Appendix 
A, section 13.1.  
 
The readers will be asked to assign a subjective malignancy score ( -2 
(highly not malignant) to +2  (highly malignant) ) and their confidence for 
each lesion for each modality (0 to 100%). These will also be documented on the form in Appendix A.   These scores will be used combined for a 
binary analysis.  Malignancy scores of +1 and +2 will be considered 
malignant.  Scores of - 2, -1, and 0 will be considered not malignant.  
The confidence of malignancy will be used independently in the analysis.  
5.0 Research Ultrasound Scanner: Verasonics Vantage 256  
The device used for this study will be a programmable research ultrasound scanner (Vantage 256, Verasonics, Inc., Kirkland, WA, [LOCATION_003]) and a unique probe developed in conjunction with the research lab run by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Stuart Foster (Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada) and VisualSonics (FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada).    The ultrasound probe developed is a modification of a preclinical high frequency transducer, modified to house a dual -frequency linear array.   
 The Vantage 256 is  a programmable research ultrasound system .  It is 
marketed commercially by [CONTACT_560989], Inc.  For this study, two Vantage 256 platforms will be used.  Each system will be programmed for

using a designated b- mode program on one Vantage [ADDRESS_737171] mode, the low frequency element s transmit 
ultrasound and the high frequency elements receive the signal.   To do so, 
one Vantage 256 controls the low frequency elements, and a second Vantage 256 controls the high frequency element s.  Operation of the 
systems is synchronized and controlled by [CONTACT_560991] -frequency 
program.  It should be noted that only one Vantage system will be 
transmitting at any given time. The center frequency is 2 MHz for the low frequency elements and 20 MHz for the high frequency elements.

12 5.1 Expected Risks  
5.1.1  Verasonics Vantage 256  
This research protocol presents minimal risk to participants, investigators 
and study personnel. Our preliminary experimental and theoretical data show that the proposed stack  design does effectively preserve excellent 
independent transmission of the two beams from the same aperture. Additional FEM modeling will be conducted to look at minimizing HF pulse distortion by [CONTACT_560992].  The 
LF device will be designed to produce pulses with a mechanical index below the FDA limit of 1.9. Materials and processes will be adjusted to ensure that the probe temperature does not increase more than  6°C, as stated by [CONTACT_1556].
52 Thermal effects will also be modeled using finite element methods 
(PZFlex). Analysis of the low frequency beam will be performed to optimize the number and lateral extent of low frequency elements. The current transducer design contains [ADDRESS_737172] to its use in preclinical VisualSonics systems, the dual -frequency variant and effects of 
the various polymer and metal layers within flex circuits required for element connectivity will need to be included within the acoustic modeling of the transducer stack.

In postmarketing use, serious hypersensitivity reactions were observed during or shortly following perﬂ utren- containing microsphere administration 
including: Shock, bronchospasm, throat tightness, angioedema, edema (pharyngeal, palatal, mouth, peripheral, localized), swelling (face, eye, lip, 
tongue, upper airway), facial hypoesthesia, rash, urticaria, pruritus, ﬂ ushing, and erythema have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to perﬂ utren- containing microsphere products.  Always have cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation personnel and equipment readily available prior to DEFINITY administration and monitor all patients for hypersensitivity reactions.  Systemic Embolization of Perflutren in Patients with Cardiac Shunts:  
When administering DEFINITY to patients with a cardiac shunt, the microspheres can by[CONTACT_6476] ﬁ ltering by [CONTACT_560994].  Assess patients with shunts for embolic phenomena following DEFINITY administration.   DEFINITY is only for  intravenous administration; 
do not administer DEFINITY by [CONTACT_90169]- arterial injection.   
Ventricular Arrhythmia Related to High Mechanical Index :  
High ultrasound mechanical index values may cause microsphere cavitation or rupture and lead to ventricular arrhythmias.  Additionally, end-systolic triggering with high mechanical indices has been reported to cause ventricular arrhythmias.  DEFINITY is not recommended for use at mechanical indices greater than 0.8. .

7.0 ADVERSE EXPERIENCES- DRUGS  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.   
 
LCCC 1748   CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_560971] 8, 2018  
15 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560976] (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be 
considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by 
[CONTACT_353202].  
7.1.2  Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the drug is the cause.   Reasonable possibility  
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatment, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions.  Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE:  
• Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
• One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e.g., tendon rupture); often more than once oc currence from one 
or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility  that the drug caused 
the event.   
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group  
7.1.[ADDRESS_737175] information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for an unapproved investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product).  Unexpected  
also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_560971] 8, 2018  
16 7.1.4  Serious AE or SAR  
An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal  life functions;  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or su bject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_560977], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.

Collected information should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Forms (e -CRF) for that patient.  Please include a description of the event, 
its severity or toxicity grade, onset and resolved dates (if applicable), and the relationship to the study drug.    Documentation should occur at least monthly.  
7.3 SAEs or Serious SARs  
7.3.1  Timing  
After informed consent but prior to initiation of study medications, only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. 
SAEs  related to invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication 
washout, or no treatment run- in).

is discontinued.  
7.3.2  Documentation and Notification 
These events (SAEs or Serious SARs) must be recorded for that patient 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
7.3.3  Reporting  
IRB Reporting R equirements:  
• UNC will submit an aggregated list of all SAEs to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal according to the UNC IRB policies and procedures.  
• The UNC- IRB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an 
Unanticipated Problem as per the UNC IRB Policies using the IRB’s web-based reporting system (see section  8.2 ) within 7 days of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the problem.   
Pregnancy  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study should be recorded as SAEs.  The patient is to be discontinued immediately from the study. The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician- gynecologist, preferably one experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
 The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome). If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Inves tigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.  
8.[ADDRESS_737178] (UADE)  
The investigational device exemption (IDE) regulations define an unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of  subjects” (21 CFR

As defined by [CONTACT_11604]’s IRB, unanticipated problems involving risks to study 
subjects refers to any incident, experience, or outcome that:  
• Is unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Is related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.

These meetings will include the investigators as well as protocol nurses, clinical research associates, regulatory associates, data managers, biostatisticians, and any other relevant personnel the principal investigators may deem appropriate.  At these meetings, the research team will discuss all issues relevant to study progress, including enrollme nt, safety, regulatory, data 
collection, etc.  
 The team will produce summaries or minutes of these meetings. These summaries will be available for inspection when requested by [CONTACT_87227], but not limited to, the oversight (Office of 
Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB, the Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) or the North Carolina TraCS Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).   
 The UNC LCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the study on a regular (quarterly to annually) basis, with the frequency of review based on risk and complexity as determined by [CONTACT_87228].  The UNC PI [INVESTIGATOR_548816] r

the reference standard. With [ADDRESS_737185] larger than 90% is 88% 
(the variance of the estimated specificity is calculated to be less than 
0.6*0.25/30) at the significance level 0.[ADDRESS_737186].  Although 
we will study both sensitivity and specificity, our power calculation is based on specificity.  
10.1.2  Secondary Analysis  
Sixty (60) women scheduled to undergo breast biopsy based on an abnormal ultrasound finding will be enrolled . We assume the AUC for the 
b-mode ultrasound images is 60%  with range 60%~80%, and AUC 
difference of 10%. Assuming that the prevalence of noncancerous lesions in the sample population will be approximately 50%, the study will be powered at least at 80% with [ADDRESS_737187] error of the average sensitivity and 
specificity estimate will be calculated using the bootstrap method, where each patient is treated as independent unit with 5 ratings. The confidence interval of the final estimate will be provided using the normality assumption.  
 Furthermore, we will estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the b -mode 
ultrasound in this study and compare it with the sensitivity and specificity 
estimate of the acoustic angiography device using the bootstrap approach and the confidence interval of their differences will be provided using the 
normality assumption.   
 Malignancy scores of +1 and +2 will be considered malignant.  Scores of -2, -1, and 0 will be considered not malignant.  The confidence of 
malignancy will be u sed independently

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_560971] 8, [ADDRESS_737188] Preference  
The secondary analysis will be to estimate the receiver operating 
characteristic (sensitivity and specificity) curve for the acoustic angiography system, with an additional aim of evaluating reader preference for specific breast lesion characteristics.  Specifically, to compare the diagnostic performance, we will non- parametrically calculate 
the area under the ROC curve for each reader and each modality, where the ROC curve is derived using the different cut -off of the probability 
scores across [ADDRESS_737189] whether the acoustic 
angiograph has a significant larger AUC than the conventional b- mode 
ultrasound (with significance level  0.05).  
 To assess the reader preference for modality for each characteristic including shape, margins and vascularity , we will fit a random effect model 
with only intercept and random terms for patients and readers while the outcomes are the confidence scores  (-3 to +3) . By [CONTACT_560995], we will conclude that the new modality provides more confidence for readers than the conventional one.

It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations.  The IRB should approve the consent form and protocol.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
   Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_44316].

• Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
• Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or the value of the data collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of  
the investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation if the variance:  
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study. 
• Resul ts from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, State laws, or University policies.  
 If a deviation or violation occurs without prior approval from the Principal Investigator, please follow the guidelines below:  
 
Protocol Deviations: UNC personnel will keep a log of any protocol 
deviations and report them to the study sponsor or data and safety monitoring committee in accordance with their policies.  Deviations should be summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.

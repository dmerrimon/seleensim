Title: Cannabidiol Eﬀects on Blood Alcohol Level and IntoxicaMon  
Sta$s$cal Analysis Plan  
Prior to hypothesis tes,ng, we will conduct data wrangling and visualiza,ons on the raw data for 
all outcomes using the R programming language and packages included in ,dyverse (Team 2013; 
Wickham et al. 2019)  (e.g., ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) ). To examine changes over ,me in BrAC, alcohol 
craving, aﬀect, seda,on, and s,mula,on during the descending limb of the BrAC curve (T2 – T8, see 
Figure 1) and to compare these changes by [CONTACT_664302],on, we will run a series of Mul,level Structural 
Equa,on Models (MSEM; (Mehta and Neale 2005)  using Mplus 8 (Muthén and Muthen 2017) . Due to the 
research design, where each par,cipant completed each condi,on (placebo, 30mg CBD and 200mg CBD) 
and within each condi,on there were [ADDRESS_897258] 
were taken at ,mepoints T2 -T8, which represent the descending limb of the BrAC curve. We will focus  
on the descending limb because evidence suggests that some subjec,ve eﬀects of alcohol may be 
par,cularly prominent during the descending limb (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_664288]. 2003; Brick 2006) . In addi,on, prior 
medica,on studies have demonstrated that notable medica,on eﬀects such as reduc,on in craving and 
s,mula,on are observed in both the descending and ascending limb (Ray and Hutchison 2007) , but 
some unique eﬀects such as increased tension may be speciﬁc to the descending limb (Ray et al. 2008) . 
Another advantage of focusing on the descending limb is that changes during this ,me are expected to 
be approximately linear (e.g., BrAC decreases linearly (Posey and Mozayani 2007) ), which supports a 
more straigh_orward interpreta,on of model results. Note that T2= 90 minutes aaer the start of the 
alcohol administra,on session and T8=4.[ADDRESS_897259] with placebo as the referent group (i.e., comparing placebo to 30mg CBD and placebo 
to 200mg of CBD) and then again with 30mg CBD as the referent group (i.e., to get the comparison of 
30mg CBD to 200mg CBD). To determine if sex moderate s the condi,on àchange rela,onship we will 
create  a random slope of condi,on predic,ng the latent slope variable and then regressed that random 
slope on the between -person binary sex variable. This is referred to as the random coeﬃcient predic,on 
meth od (Preacher et al. 2010, 2016) . We will also use this method to determine if the overall change 
over ,me is moderated by [CONTACT_664303] -person 
sex variable. The MSEM approach allows paths that include within -level eﬀects to have random 
intercepts and allows for the crea,on of Bayesian credible intervals for  assessing signiﬁcance of eﬀects. 
Bayesian credible intervals provide a robust test of direct and modera,on eﬀects, are computa,onally 
eﬃcient, and are amenable to a variet y of variable characteris,cs (e.g., hierarchical –nested and non -
normal data; (Gelman et al. 2004; Muthén and Asparouhov 2012) .

annabidiol, or CBD, is commonly found in the cannabis plant and has shown promise in treating alcohol used
isorders (AUD). Several rodent studies show that CBD decreases alcohol intake. However, only three humans
tudies have ever been conducted on this topic. These studies showed conYicting results regarding the impact ofC
BD on intoxication and blood-alcohol level. Importantly, existing studies have used synthetic CBD, which isd
issimilar from the plant-based CBD products popular in the U.S. Thus, the conclusions that can be drawn fromt
he existing work are limited, and tightly controlled human studies of the effects of plant-based CBD on blooda
lcohol level, psychomotor intoxication and subjective intoxication following acute alcohol consumption aren
eeded. In this study, we will explore the effects of two doses of plant-based CBD (compared to placebo CBD) onb
lood alcohol level, motor and balance impairment as craving/desire for alcohol over the course 4 hours afters
ubjects consume a standardized dose of alcohol. We hypothesize that in the CBD condition, blood alcohol level(
estimated using a breathalyzer) will be lower, cognitive and motor/balance performance will be better and cravingw
ill be lower for all timepoints. These outcomes have implications for understanding the potential of CBD as anAU
D treatment.De
scribe the purpose for the proposed project.T
he purpose of the project is to improve our understanding of how plant-based CBD products may impact alcoholu
se among individuals who regularly use alcohol. Since alcohol and cannabis co-use is common in the U.S., CBDis c
ommonly found in recreational and medical cannabis products, and animal research suggests that CBD mayd
ecrease alcohol intake, it is important to determine whether CBD have applications for reducing drinking inh
umans. Ultimately, this could have implications regarding the use of CBD as a potential treatment for alcohol used
isorders. Primary objectives are to explore how CBD impacts blood alcohol level, as well as cognitive and motorp
erformance during an acute alcohol administration session. Specihc Aims are described in detail below: Aim 1.A
ssess effects of CBD+alcohol vs. placebo+alcohol on breath alcohol level (BrAC). Hypothesis 1. After consumingC
BD, subjects will have lower BrAC throughout the 4-hour period compared to when they consume placebo CBD.A
im 2. Assess effects of CBD+alcohol vs. placebo+alcohol on subjective intoxication. Hypothesis 2a. Afterc
onsuming CBD, subjects will experience decreased alcohol craving across all timepoints post-alcoholc
onsumption compared to when they consume placebo CBD. Hypothesis 2b. Differences in self-reportedstim
ulation and sedation effects will emerge in the CBD condition compared to the placebo condition across allp
ost-alcohol consumption timepoints. We lack sujcient prior evidence to predict the direction of these effects.A
im 3. Assess effects of CBD+alcohol vs. placebo+alcohol on psychomotor intoxication. Hypothesis 3a. CBD willb
e associated with better performance on an inhibitory control task compared to placebo across all timepoints.Hy
pothesis 3b. CBD will also be associated with better balance/motor performance at all timepoints after alcoholconsum
ption compared to placebo.Protocolsht tps://colostate.kuali.co/protocols/protocols/6152325798638a0038ea60...15 of

e hope to gain a better understanding of the impact of CBD on blood alcohol level. We also hope to betteru
nderstand whether CBD impacts levels of acute alcohol intoxication (specihcally as regards craving, subjectivee
ffects of alcohol and cognitive and motor impairment). This has implications regarding CBD's potential as at
reatment for alcohol use disorder.De
scribe how sharing results of this study could influence behavior, practice, theory, future research designs. Specifically, how will studyre
sults apply to a larger population than the studied participants?T
he results from this research will be disseminated as publications (estimated at least 3-4 papers total spanninga
ll three main study aims) and as symposia/presentations and posters at national and international conferences.

ncreases in alcohol consumption, high risk drinking and AUD constitute a public health crisis in the U.S.(Grant eta
l., 2017). Although decades of preclinical and clinical research have shed light on risk factors associated with thee
tiology and maintenance of AUD, currently available interventions demonstrate only modest ejcacy (Dutra et al.,2
008; Jonas et al., 2014). Thus, there is increasing interest in exploring alternative AUD treatments targeting novelb
iological systems. Notably, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has emerged in recent years as a potentialt
reatment target for AUD (Sloan et al., 2017). In particular, the non-psychoactive cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD)h
as shown preclinical promise in ameliorating numerous clinical symptoms of AUD. Specihcally, CBD reduces ther
einforcing properties of alcohol and decreases drinking motivation and consumption in mice (Viudez-Martínez,G
arcía-Gutiérrez, et al., 2018; Viudez-Martínez, García-Gutiérrez, et al., 2018) and attenuates cue-induced andstr
ess-induced alcohol-seeking, reinstatement, anxiety, and impulsivity in a rat model of AUD (Gonzalez-Cuevas eta
l., 2018). Although we lack a complete understanding of the mechanism(s) through which CBD may reducea
lcohol consumption and/or ameliorate the clinical symptoms of AUD, CBD is known to modulate several neuralp
athways implicated in AUD. For example, in one rodent study, administration of CBD during ethanol self-a
dministration was associated with decreased expression of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_664290]1 gene, the GPR55 gene,a
nd the CB1 gene (all of which code for proteins associated with AUD and the reward response to alcohol (Maguea
nd Blendy, 2010; Musella et al., 2017; Parsons and Hurd, 2015), and increased expression of the CB2 gene in then
ucelus accumbens (NAcc). This study also found that CBD was associated with decreased expression of thet
yrosine hydroxylase gene (TH; an enzyme critical for regulation of dopamine synthesis, and which inYuencesd
opamine levels after alcohol administration) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Given that the dopaminergics
ignaling from the VTA to the NAcc is responsible for mediating the rewarding effects of alcohol (Koob, 1992;S
panagel and Weiss, 1999), and that increased TH expression is observed in association with acute and chronica
lcohol (Lee et al., 2005; Oliva et al., 2008; Ortiz et al., 1995), it is possible that modulation of reward-related genesi
n the VTA and NAcc could contribute to the ejcacy of CBD in decreasing alcohol consumption. In another study,C
BD administered with the opi[INVESTIGATOR_664291] a greater extent than either CBD or naltrexone alone (Viudez-Martínez et al., 2018a). Thiss
tudy also found that serotonin 1A (5HT1A) receptor expression was reduced in the dorsal raphe nucleus afterC
BD+naltrexone treatment. The serotonergic pathway projecting from the dorsal raphe to the NAcc is activatedd
uring reward-associated tasks in mice (Liu et al., 2014). Given that chronic alcohol exposure is associated withi
ncreased 5HT1A receptor sensitivity and increased ethanol drinking in mice (Kelaï et al., 2006), these studiess
uggest that reduction of 5HT1A receptor expression in the dorsal raphe may be one mechanism through whichC
BD reduces the rewarding properties of alcohol. In sum, CBD modulates several neural pathways implicated inA
UD, and the next logical step is to explore the effects of CBD on alcohol consumption and other AUD phenotypesi
n heavy drinking human subjects, as is proposed in this study.Pl

ill complete informed consent and a demographics form and several questionnaires on psychologicalf
unctioning and substance use. Subjects will then consume their their CBD (30 mg or 200 mg) or placebo.A
lcohol administration (up to .8g/kg) will occur about [ADDRESS_897267] occurs in the blood after 45 minutes (Williams et al 2021) Also, peak BrACo
ccurs for the alcohol dose we are administering (up to .8g/kg) approx. 1 hour after alcohol ingestion. The ordero
f study visits (CBD 30 mg vs. CBD 200 mg vs. placebo) will be counterbalanced across participants, such thatp
articipants will be randomly assigned to complete each the three visits in different orders. Also note that ther
esearch assistants running the study will also be blinded to participant condition (and a non-blinded graduates
tudent will prepare the CBD product for the subjects before the session). The three study visits will occur 1w
eek apart. There will also be 3 venous blood draws for Blood Cannabinoids at both visits. Blood draws willo
ccur before CBD/placebo ingestion (to verify no CBD use prior to experiment), before alcohol consumption and6

Procedure DescriptionLa
boratory Sessions (CBD 30 mg Session, CBD 200 mg Session and Placebo-CBD Session). At each subject’sh
rst session, they will arrive at the lab at approximately 11:15am, undergo informed consent procedures with at
rained research assistant, undergo urine pregnancy and drug screening and receive a breathalyzer test. We willu
se the Intoximeter Alcosensor IV Breathalyzer, which is the gold standard for alcohol research studies. Urined
rug screening will test for the presence of illicit drugs (besides cannabis). If urine drug or pregnancy tests arep
ositive, participants will be disqualihed from participation. If BrAC is above 0.000, participants will ber
escheduled. If all tests are negative, participants will complete a brief demographics form and psychologicalf
uctioning/substance use questionnaires. Next, they do the hrst blood draw and will then be given either 30 or2
00mg CBD dissolved in water or plain water (as the placebo CBD condition). They will then be asked to wait for2
[ADDRESS_897269] their blood drawn and will complete measures of balance/motorp
erformance, inhibitory control, alcohol craving, stimulation and sedation. Specihcally, the following measureswi
ll be administered to measure alcohol craving, stimulation and sedation: The Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale(
BAES) is a self-report rating scale measuring stimulant and sedative effects of alcohol. It has shown goodr
eliability and validity in AUD. The Subjective High Assessment Scale (SHAS) is a standard self-report measureu
sed to assess subjective responses to alcohol. The Alcohol Urge Questionnaire (AUQ) is a well-establishedm
easure of alcohol craving and desire to drink that is commonly used in the context of acute alcohola
dministration. To test balance/motor function we will use a psychomotor battery designed to capturem
easures of cognitive and motor impairment in divided attention, decision making, reaction time, motor trackinga
nd balance movements following the intake of drugs or alcohol and designed to be administered repeatedly ina
 single session to assess changes in impairment without being susceptible to practice effects. Finally, to testi
nhibitory control we will use the The Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Task, which requires participants tof
ocus on a stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli Yanking it. These measures will be administered on ani
pad. Next, participants will consume up to .8g/kg of vodka mixed with orange juice, following procedures fromp
revious alcohol and cannabis co-administration studies. The dose will be reduced 8% for females to adjust fore
xpected BrAC differences between males and females. An .8g/kg dose should produce a peak BrAC of no moret

epartment of Agriculture (CDA) and CSU regulations, the 30 mg and 200 mg CBD products will be sourced byC
aliper Foods (https://www.caliperfoods.life/), which is a CDA compliant product containing <.3%THC (thusq
ualifying as hemp rather than cannabis, which means it is allowed on CSU’s campus). Subjects will consumeC
aliper's 5% CBD concentrate liquid in water on the day of their CBD study appointment, and they will consumep
lain water with no CBD on the day of their placebo-CBD appointment. Caliper's CBD readily solubilizes intow

articipants will not be able to tell whether they are consuming water containing CBD or plain water. Note thatIndi

ymptoms of severe depression or suicidality, or those that determine that they do need to seek alcoholt

ge criteria minimizes noise and reduces the impact of age-related differences on biological and behavioralo

reviously approved by [CONTACT_1201] (Protocol # 20=10213H). Because the primary aims of the study involve exploringt
he effects of legal-market cannabis on alcohol consumption and involve an alcohol and CBD administration, wen
eed to recruit heavy alcohol users. Heavy drinking criteria is consistent with The Substance Abuse and MentalHe
alth Service Administration dehnition. We will recruit individuals who are not regular or recent cannabis users toe

hey have a medical condition, have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) or another substance use disorder (SUD), arec
urrent in treatment for or seeking treatment for AUD or another SUD, or have a medical condition that that mayc

oadly, the hndings of this investigation will increase the body of knowledge about the effects of CBD on alcoholc

nd has has largely used either animal models with extracted synthetic CBD (which differs considerably from thep
lant-based cannabis used by [CONTACT_1978]). Data are therefore lacking in terms of the effects of plant-based CBD ona
lcohol consumption. Thus, the proposed study will ultimately add critical information to the knowledge baser
egarding alcohol and CBD. These results may inform public policy approaches to harm reduction, which is muchn
eeded in states that are legalizing cannabis use. In addition, the proposed study will provide an evidence-baset

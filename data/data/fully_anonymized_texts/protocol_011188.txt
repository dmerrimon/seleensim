You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are  pregnant and  you smoke 
cigarettes. Research studies are voluntary and include only  people who choose to take part.  Please read  
this consent  form carefully and take your time making your decision.  As the study staff member 
discusses this consent  form  with  you, please ask her  to explain  any words or information that you do not  
clearly understand.  We encourage you to talk with your family and friends before  you decide  to take 
part in this research study.   The nature of the study, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other 
important information about the study are listed below.
A grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) will sponsor this study. Portions of Drs. Kathryn 
Pollak, Laura Fish,  Geeta Swamy, and Bercedis Peterson’s salaries will be paid by [CONTACT_68793].
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY  BEING DONE?
The purpose  of this  study is to evaluate a program to help  women attempt to quit smoking during 
pregnancy. If our program is effective, we can help women quit smoking during their  pregnancy.
HOW MANY  PEOPLE WILL TAKE  PART IN THIS STUDY?
Up to 700 women  will be enrolled into this study from various  sites,  including Duke University 
affiliated clinics, various North Carolina  County Health Departments, and Womack Army Medical 
Center in Fayetteville, NC.
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
If this study is right for  you and you agree  to be in this study, you will be asked to meet in a private and  
convenient location to read and sign this consent  form and then complete a survey about yourself and 
your smoking. We will then ask to meet  with you twice more - once during the late third trimester of 
your pregnancy and once approximately 3 months  after your baby [CONTACT_160751]  – to complete two more  
surveys. The first meeting will take about [ADDRESS_186655]  survey, you will be randomly assigned (like  the flip of a  coin) to either a 
texting program  that sends messages to a  cell phone that support you as you attempt to  quit smoking 
(Group A) or a texting program  that includes the same messages plus smoking reduction text messages 
(Group B).  These smoking reduction  messages  help change patterns  of smoking.  Specifically, the 
program will send an “alert text”  at times the program has you scheduled to  smoke.   These  alert texts 
will be reduced  over three to five weeks. You will be  offered a cell phone with  unlimited texting in the 
study, or you may choose to  use your personal  cell phone.
If you are assigned to Group A, you will begin  receiving support text messages  during the first week  
after you complete the first survey.  You will receive  text messages  each  day for the first [ADDRESS_186656]  to respond to these  messages.

Reference Date:  3/24/[ADDRESS_186657] week, you will be asked to  text each time you smoke.  Then  
starting in the 2nd week, you will receive the “alert texts” that let  you know  when to  smoke.   This  
program will gradually reduce  the number of cigarettes you smoke  each  week  over three to five  weeks 
until you get to zero.   After you receive an alert text, we ask that you text  back  within [ADDRESS_186658] your ability  to participate in this study. 
If you decide to use a  cell phone provided by [CONTACT_1758], the study staff may provide this phone number 
to your prenatal  care provider so that they  can text you for care-related  issues if needed.
 
Please initial  one of the following statements:
 
______ I agree to have my study cell  phone  number  provided to  my prenatal care provider
______ I do not agree to have my study cell phone  number provided to  my prenatal care  provider
 
You will also be  asked to  give two saliva samples  at the time of the first and second  surveys. You  may 
also be asked  to give two saliva samples  at the time of the third survey. One saliva sample will be  used 
to look at your nicotine (main chemical in cigarettes) levels to  see how much  smoke  you have been  
exposed to. The second  sample  will serve  as back-up in the  event  that we are unable to get a  proper 
reading from the first  saliva sample. The saliva  sample involves spi[INVESTIGATOR_160744] a small  plastic  
tube. 
Additionally, you may  be asked to have up to 20ccs (approximately 4 teaspoons) of your blood  drawn 
from a vein in  your  arm at  the time of your first and  second surveys.  This blood  will be tested  for how 
your genes and DNA improve as a  result of your reducing or quitting smoking.  Your  genes are made up 
of DNA, which is short for deoxyribonucleic  acid.  A gene, or DNA, contains  information that 
determines in  part the  traits, such as eye  color,  height,  or disease risk, that  are passed on from parent  to 
child.

Reference Date:  3/24/[ADDRESS_186659] access  to the blood sample  once  it is obtained.  
These samples are unavailable for clinical (diagnostic) purposes. Therefore, if  you need  any future 
diagnostic testing,  a new sample will be  obtained from you. Blood samples collected as part  of this study 
may be valuable for scientific, research, or teaching purposes or for the development  of a new  medical 
product. DUHS and/or the developers will assert all  rights  of ownership  in the samples and all  rights 
arising from use of  the samples. There  is no plan  to compensate you for any use of the samples.
Trained staff  members will draw the blood and  will seek verbal permission to  do so  at the times of the 
surveys. You have the right to refuse to have  your blood drawn, and it will not impact your ability to 
participate in this study.
Please initial  one of the following statements:
 
______ I agree to have my blood drawn as  part of this study
______ I do not agree to have my blood drawn as  part of this study
As part of the  study, you may also be asked  to have your pi[INVESTIGATOR_160745] 2nd survey. 
These pi[INVESTIGATOR_160746] 3rd survey and will serve as a  
pregnancy keepsake. We will  seek  verbal  permission from you take your pi[INVESTIGATOR_160747]. If you do not wish to have your pi[INVESTIGATOR_160748], you can refuse this  offer,  and it will not impact  
your ability to  participate in this study. 
Lastly, study staff will access your and your baby’s  medical records at the time of delivery  to get 
information about  the baby’s birth, such as  your baby’s gender, gestational age, birth weight,  and any 
medical complications  associated with your baby’s birth. You  may be asked  to sign a  separate form to  
permit your information to be sent from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_160749].
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?
If you agree  to participate, you will be in the  study until approximately 3 months  after your baby [CONTACT_50835]. 
Depending on when you enroll in the study, this is a total of approximately four to nine months. 
Your participation is voluntary. You can  choose  to stop participating  at any time without penalty or  loss 
of any benefits to which you are entitled.

WHAT ARE  THE  RISKS OF THE STUDY?
Quitting smoking may cause nicotine withdrawal that  may  lead  to headaches, irritability, weight gain, 
difficulty concentrating, poor sleep,  increased appetite, anxious or depressed mood,  and craving for 
cigarettes.  The counseling provided via text message is designed to help  you deal  with many of these 
issues. Risks associated with drawing  blood from your arm include momentary discomfort  and/or  
bruising.  Infection,  excess bleeding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although very  unlikely.  The 
genetic information obtained as a result of your  blood  draw  will not be included in your medical  record.   
The Genetic  Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) is a Federal law that  will protect you in the 
following ways:
Health insurance companies and  group plans may not request genetic information from this research;
Health insurance companies and  group plans may not use your genetic information when making 
decisions regarding  your  eligibility  or premiums;
Employers  with 15 or more employees  may  not use  your genetic information when making a  
decision to hire, promote, or fire  you or when setting the terms of your  employment;
GINA does not protect you against genetic discrimination by [CONTACT_160752],  
disability insurance,  or long-term care insurance.  GINA also  does  not protect you against 
discrimination based on an already-diagnosed genetic condition or disease.
There is also  the potential risk of loss of confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to  keep your 
information confidential;  however, this cannot  be guaranteed.  Some of the questions we will ask you as 
part of this  study may  make you feel uncomfortable.  You may refuse to  answer any of the questions  and 
you may take  a break at any time during the  surveys.  You may  stop your participation  in this study at 
any time.
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE  STUDY?
If you agree  to participate in this study, there may be a direct medical benefit  to you and/or your baby 
[CONTACT_160753]. What  we learn  from you and the other women in the study 
will help us develop programs that will be useful  for other women and  their families in the future.  
WILL MY  INFORMATION BE KEPT  CONFIDENTIAL?
Study records, audio  recordings, photographs,  and saliva and blood samples that identify you will be 
kept confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Federal Privacy Regulations provide safeguards  for privacy, 
security, and authorized access. Except  when required by [CONTACT_156816], you will not be identified 
by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, address,  telephone number, or any  other  direct personal identifier in  
study records disclosed outside of Duke University  Health System (DUHS). For  records disclosed 
outside of  DUHS, you will be assigned  a unique code number.  In  addition, all  saliva and blood samples 
and photographs will be  marked with your  unique code number for storage at DUHS in  accordance with 
Duke’s Institutional Review Board guidelines and  policies. 
The information that links you to the unique code identification number will be kept in  a password-
protected and access-restricted database that  is stored  on a secure server  at Duke and  is accessible  only

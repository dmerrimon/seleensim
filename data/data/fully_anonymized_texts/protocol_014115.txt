3.1. Provide scientific background and rationale for study.  Includ ing summary of gaps in 
current knowledge, relevant data, and how the study will add to existing knowledge.    
                Lung  cancer  is a significant  health  issue,  and especially  so within  the Veteran  population.  
Lung  cancer  is the top cause  of cancer -related  deaths,  and this risk is higher  for Veterans  because  of 
age and smoking  history  [1]. The majority  of lung cancer  prevention  has focused  on ending  smoking,  but 
a recent  study  that compared  low dose  computerized  tomography  scans  (LDCT)  to simple  chest -x-ray 
scans  saw a 20% decrease  in cancer  specific  mortality  rates  [2]. Following  additional  evidence  [3], the 
US Preventive  Services  Task  Force  and American  Cancer  Society,  along  with a number  of other  cancer

APPROVED by [CONTACT_599616] 03/28/2021  preventative  organizations,  issued  guidelines  in favor  of annual  lung cancer  screenings  for older  people  
with a history  of smoking  [4-6]. However,  there  are concerns  that with more  screenings  an increase  in 
false  positives  and over diagnosis  will occur.  The effectiveness  of lung cancer  screening  may also vary 
by [CONTACT_547],  and initial  data suggests  some  Veterans  are reluctant  to enter  an intensive  screening  
process  [7]. As the Department  of Veteran  Affairs  expands  the paradigm  of lung cancer  control  to 
include  lung cancer  screening,  it is critical  to develop  and test decision  support  tools  that 1) educate  
Veterans  regarding  expected  outcomes,  2) incorporate  Veteran  preferences  and values  into the 
decision -making  process,  and 3) encourage  shared  decision -making  between  Veterans  and providers  
 
The VA method  of lung cancer  screening  is unique  in that it is designed  to increase  assessment  rates  
and support  among  Veterans.  Lung  canc er screening  criteria  includes  age and the modifiable  behavior  
of smoking.  As stated  before,  the high rate of false  positives  negatively  impacts  screening  participation,  
so the assessment  of patient  preferences  will inform  participants  of strategies  to encourage  adherence  
to the program  [8]. Comorbidity  must  also be taken  into account,  as the target  screening  population  is 
older  [9], and at a higher  risk for vascular  diseases  than younger  people.  A successful  paradigm  will 
include  these  concerns.  The unique  aspects  of the lung cancer  screening  paradigm  increase  the 
importance  of preference  assessment  as part of an informed  decision -making  process.  
 
A recent  Cochrane  meta -analysis  found  that decision  aids such  as conjoint  analysis  and best-worse  
scaling  (comm only called  discrete  choice  experiments)  can improve  receptiveness  to lung cancer  
screening  methods  [10]. However,  these  tools  have  not been  widely  used  in clinical  practice,  and these  
assessment  methods  would  have  to be geared  towards  Veteran  population  and require  systems  to 
integrate  decision  support  with clinical  practice.  This proposal  will address  these  gaps  by [CONTACT_599618] a lung cancer  
screening  decision  support  tool (LCSDecTool)  designed  for Veterans.  
 
Significance  
Veterans  are at higher  risk of lung cancer  due to their increased  smoking  rate when  compared  to the 
general  population,  both when  active  and following  service  time [1]. Eight  VA Medical  Centers  have  
recentl y completed  studies  that demonstrate  the need  for effective  screening  tactics.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_599594]  (Schapi[INVESTIGATOR_20116])  has completed  pi[INVESTIGATOR_599595]&D  Research  in this area.  and the demonstration  
projects  across  8 sites in the VA health  care system  found  that 56% of the Veterans  offered  screening  
agreed  to the tests.  Before  expanding  further,  it is imperative  that decision -support  tools  are present  to 
encourage  participation  in lung cancer  screening  programs.  By [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_599596],  patient  
prefe rences  can be accounted  for in the study  guidelines.  (Figure  1). 
 
 
 
This research  is based  on the theoretical  frameworks  of shared  decision -making  (SDM),  implementation  
science,  and technology  adoption.  SDM  incorporates  normative  and dual process  reasonin g theories.  
Dual process  theory  recognizes  the role of systematic  reasoning,  which  is thought  to lead to decisions  
that people  are more  likely  to follow  through  with [11]. Implementing  a decision  support  tool that

resulting  from false  positives.  Fifty-one percent  (51%)  of study  participants  were  African  American,  86% 
were  current  smokers,  and 47% had at least  30 pack  years  of smoking  (this means  1 pack  per day for 
30 years  or 2 packs  a day for 15 years).  Participants  were  asked  to choose  the attributes  most  and least  
important  to them  regarding  lung cancer  screening  from groups  of three.  Linear  regression  was used  to 
determine  the association  between  race and other  factors  via importance  weights  [20, 21]. (Figure  3).

linkages  to outcomes  are described  in the table  below  (Table  2). 
 
 
The decision  regret  scale  was adapted  to lung cancer  screening  Data  Collection  Instrument ). Anxiety,  as 
measured  by [CONTACT_38772],  and cancer  worry  have  been  used  as patient -centered  outcomes  among  lung 
cancer  screening  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  [12, 85, 86]. A systematic  review  reports  short -term psychological  
discomfort  among  many  lung cancer  screening  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_599605] -term increases  in distress  among  
those  with false -positive  results  [87]. The lung cancer  worry  scale  is adapted  from a measure  of breast  
cancer  worry  after mammography  screening  [88]. A post-visit provider  survey  will assess  whether  lung 
cance r screening  was discussed  at the visit, if a recommendation  was made,  and if a test ordered . 
 
The following  objectives  were  completed  in Phase  1 and 2. 
Phase  1: To elicit stakeholder  input  to inform  the development  of a lung cancer  screening  
decisio n tool (LCSDecTool).  In this Phase  we use structured  interview  and focus  groups  among  
patients,  providers,  and clinical  leaders.  Findings  from Phase  1 were  used  to develop  the 
LCSDecTool  in Phase  2. 
Phase  2: To develop  a web based  LCSDecTool  that will expand existing  materials  available  for 
Veterans  through  a Web application  that can be used  on a desktop,  laptop,  tablet,  or mobile  
phone.  Outcomes  will include  measures  of feasibility,  perceived  utility,  patient  engagement,  and

the expertise  of a transdisciplinary  research  team  culminating  in a randomized  trial to evaluate  
the efficacy  of the LCSDecTool  as well as feasibility  and process  outcomes  to support  future  
wide spread  implementation.  As a new paradigm  of lung cancer  control  is emerging  that 
incorporates  both lung cancer  screening  and smoking  cessation,  it is imperative  to develop  a 
patient  centered  strategy  that incorporates  Veterans’  values  into lung cancer  screening  decisions  
that can be integrated  into the clinical  setting.  The proposal  provides  a mechanism  to accomplish  
these  goals  and fills a gap in currently  available  decision  support  tools  for Veterans.  The 
proposed  research  will augment  ongoing  efforts  by [CONTACT_599620]  a patient  centered  approach  to lung cancer  
screening.

A pi[INVESTIGATOR_599607] (RCT) will be conducted  to compare  the efficacy  of the 
LCSDecTool  to a control  intervention  among  with respect  to decision  process  outcomes,  clinical  
outcomes,  and health  related  quality  of life. 
 
Eligible  patients  will be identified  through  VA Corporate  Data  Warehouse  (CDW ), flyers  in 
primary  care/pulmona ry clinics  and the use of a study  team  consult  that will allow  providers  to 
refer eligible  patients  to the study  team.  When  a potential  participant  is identified,  the study  team  
will send  the patient  an invitation  letter to join the study.  Use of the CDW  database  will support  
this approach,  as the dates  of scheduled  visits  are included  in the CDW  database  and updated  
daily.  Efforts  will be made  to recruit  at least  40% African  American,  5% Hispanic,  and 10% 
female  patients.  Eligibility  will be determined  by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-person  or telephone  interviews.

will be enrolled  prior to upcoming  appointments  in primary  care/pulmonary  clinics  to ensure  an 
opportunity  for shared  decision-making  following  the intervention   
 
All primary  care providers  in the PACT  at the respective  VA centers  will be sent a description  of 
the overall  study  through  email  and/or office  mail.  Providers  will be able to opt out of the study,  in 
which  case  their patients  will not be approached  regarding  study  enrollment . For providers  who 
agree  to participate,  their patients  will be approached  regarding  study  enrollment  if they meet  
inclusion  and exclusion  criteria . A provider  information  page  will be sent to all participating  
providers  which  will include  information  about  the LCSDecTool  and example  of the LCSDecTool  
summary  sheet . This may include  the same  providers  that participated  in Phase  1 and Phase  2. 
 
The LCSDecTool  will be programmed  to randomly  assign  the participant  to 1 of 2 viewing  
experiences  (Experimental  vs. Control).  The study  visit will occur  either  in-person  or by 
[CONTACT_756].   The in-person  study  visit will be in a quiet,  private  room.  Telephone  visits  will be 
arranged  so that coordinators  and participants  will both be in a quiet,  private  setting.  After  
completing  informed  consent  and HIPAA  Authorization  (for baseline  in-person  visit), the patient  
will sign on to the study  site, complete  baseline  assessments,  and be randomly  assigned  to the 
Experimental  or Control  intervention.  Randomization  will occur  at the patient  level.  A research  
assistant  will be available  to answer  questions  for participants  during  the study  visit. The visit 
may be observed  by a member  of the web development  team  to better  understand  how the tool 
functions.  
 
Experimental  Intervention : Participants  randomized  to the experimental  intervention  will 
receive  a message  on the screen  that they are now going  to view the LCSDecTool.  At the end of 
the tool experience,  they will be given  the option  to print out a summary  sheet.  Participants  will 
complete  the immediate  post-intervention  assessments  (T1) on a computer  interface.   
 
Control  Intervention : Participants  will view screen  content  that that provides  general  information  
on health  promotion  and disease  prevention  unrelated  to lung cancer  screening.  No printout  is 
given  to subjects  in this arm. The control  intervention  will have  the same  number  of screens  to 
review  as the LCSDecTool.  Participants  will complete  the immediate  post-intervention

Amendment  September  2020  
Due to COVID -19 and the increasing  amounts  of primary  care telehealth  appointments  we are 
modifying  our protocol  to include  telephone  baseline  visits  to meet  our recruitment  goals . 
In addition,  we are modifying  our protocol  to increase  compensation  for follow -up telephone  visits  
for participants  at the Philadelphia  site. The reasons  for increased  compensation  are to increase  
follow -up participation  and to properly  compensate  Veterans  for their time spent  answering  
survey  questions  for the study  as follow -up calls are taking  up to sixty minutes  to complete.  
Currently,  we provide  Veterans  with a $25 stipend  after completion  of both 1- and 3-month  
follow -ups. In this modification , we will provide  Veterans  with $25 stipends  for each  of the 
telephone  visits.  With the modification,  the total amount  participants  receive  will incre ase from

with the research : 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Physical  (Physical risks include physical discomfort, pain, injury, illness or 
disease brought about by [CONTACT_599625]. A 
physical risk may result from the involvement of  physical stimuli such as 
noise, electric shock, heat, cold, electric magnetic or gravitational fields, etc. 
Engaging a subject in a social situation which could involve violence may 
also create a physical risk .) 
                 NA 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Psychologica l (Psychological risks include the production of negative 
affective states such as anxiety, depression, guilt, shock and loss of self -
esteem and altered behavior. Sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, use of 
hypnosi s, deception or mental stress are  examples  of psychological risks.)  
The Veteran  subjects  may risk distress  from considering  the topic  of lung 
cancer.  Veterans  in the study  will be at increased  risk for lung cancer  due to 
the smoking  exposure  eligibility  requirements.  Therefore,  it is possible  that a 
discussion  of lung cancer  screening  may lead to anxiety  or distress.  
Subjects  with anxiety  or concerns  will be referred  to their primary  care 
physician  as all subjects  are enrolled  in a primary  care clinic  as it is an 
inclusion  criterion  for the study.  The primary  care physician  will be able to 
evaluate  Veteran’s  level of anxiety/distress  and refer them  to mental  
counseling  if needed . 
 
Provider  and clinical  leader  participants  may risk anxiety  regarding  the 
potential  implementation  of a new clinical  procedure  (Lung  cancer  screening  
shared  decision -making ) in a busy  clinical  practice . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Social /Economic  (Social/Economic risks include alterations in relationships 
with others that are to the disadvantage of the subject, including 
embarrassment, loss of respect of others, labeling a subject in a way that will 
have negative consequences, or in some way diminishing those 
opportunities and powers a person has by [CONTACT_599626]. 
Economic risks include payment by [CONTACT_599627] t otherwise 
required, loss of wages or other income and any other financial costs, such 
as damage to a subject's employability, as a consequence of participation in 
the research. ) 
                 NA                
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Legal  (Legal risks exist when the research methods are such that the 
subject or others will be liable for a violation of the law, either by [CONTACT_599628], or will engage , in conduct for which 
the subject or others may be crimin ally or civilly liable, or by [CONTACT_599629].)  
                 NA

confidentiality of identifiable information is presumed and must be 
maintained unless the investigator obtains the express permission of the

APPROVED by [CONTACT_599616] 03/28/[ADDRESS_793825]. In addition, if an investigator 
wishes to use data for a purpose other than  the one for which it was 
originally collected,  and the data are still identifiable (e.g. , a code list for the 
data still exists), the investigator may need to obtain consent from the 
subjects for the new use of the data.)  
There  is some  risk of confidentia lity. Efforts  will be made  to minimize  this 
risk by [CONTACT_599630].  
Veteran's  protected  health  and personally  identifiable  information  will be

[IP_ADDRESS].  Assess the likelihood and seriousness of such risks . 
The risk of Veterans  feeling  distress  about  discussing  cancer  screening  is 
not likely  to be serious  since  this targeted  group  would  have  most  likely  
discussed  lung cancer  screening  with their providers.  The risk of

5.7. Data Monitoring  (Monitoring plans describe how study records are inspected to ensure the study 
is adhering to the study protocol and applicable research regulations and CMCVAMC  requirements.  
Monitoring plans do not necessarily require the use of an independent Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB).  Such independent boards are usually reserved for high -risk phase I studies, or 
large, multi -center phase III trials.  Federally funded studies may require the use of an independent 
DSMB .)

Unanticipated /Unexpected Problems  
5.8.1.  Include procedures for reporting these events to the CMCVAMC  IRB and 
sponsor .  NOTE : Except for AEs, all other events must be reported to the CMCVAMC  
IRB within 5 business days of discover y. Use the CMCVAMC  Serious -Adverse Event 
form for reporting SAEs, UADEs , and unanticipated/unexpected problems .  Use the 
CMCVAMC  Protocol  Deviation form for reporting protocol deviations.  On-site AEs 
should be reported at the time of continuing review.)  
Protocol  deviations,  unanticipated/unexpected  problems  will be reported  to the IRB 
within  5 business  days  of discovery.  Since  this study  involves  interviews,  survey  
assessments,  and obtaining  feedback  for the LCSDecTool,  we do not anticipate  any 
adverse  events  or serious  adverse  events.  However,  any serious  adverse  event  
relate d to this study  would  be reported  to the IRB within  5 business  days  of 
discovery.  Any adverse  event  would  be reported  to the IRB at continuing  review

Specific  Aim [ADDRESS_793833] the efficacy  of the LCSDecTool  compared  to usual  care on decision  
process,  psychosocial,  and behavioral  outcomes.  We hypothesize  that Veterans  randomized  to 
the LCSDecTool  compared  to the control  intervention  will demonstrate  the following:  
• H1: Decreased  decisional  regret  and decisional  conflict  at T2 (1 month  after the 
intervention)  
• H2: [Decreased  overall  anxiety  and lung cancer  worry  at T2 (1 month  after the 
intervention)]  
• H3: Lower  rates  of lung cancer  screening  at T3 (3 months  after the interve ntion)  
 
Descriptive  Analysis  - Descriptive  statistics  will include  frequencies  and percentages  for 
categorical  variables,  and either  mean  and standard  deviation  or median  and interquartile  range  
for continuous  variables,  as appropriate  based  on distributional  characteristics.  We will compare  
baseline  characteristics  between  groups  to assess  the adequacy  of randomization,  using  t-tests  
to compare  continuous  variables  and chi-square  tests  for categorical  variables.  Characteristics

Statistical  Analysis  for H2 - Our analysis  for H2 outcomes  will be intention  to treat,  including  all 
patients  as randomized  in the analysis,  using  linear  regression  to test whether  STAI  and lung 
cancer  worry  differ  between  interventions  at T2 after adjustment  for base line characteristics  and 
study  site. The approach  de-scribed  above  for H1 will be used,  with outcomes  defined  as STAI  
and lung cancer  worry  at T2. Standard  regression  diagnostics  will be performed  and robustness  
of results  to analy sis assump tions  will be assessed  in sensitivity  analyses.  Tests  will be 
conducted  at the two-sided  α=0.025  level so that the overall  type 1 error  rate is controlled  at the 
0.05 level (Bonferroni  adjustment).  
 
Statistical  Analysis  for H3 - For H3, we hypothesize  that the LCSDecTool  intervention,  
compared  to usual  care,  will result  in lower  rates  of lung cancer  screening  assessed  at [ADDRESS_793835]  of the LCSDecTool  intervention  compared  to usual  care on completion  of 
lung cancer  screening  will be assessed.  Our analysis for H3 will be intention  to treat,  including  all 
patients  as randomized  in the analysis  using  logistic  regression  adjusted  for study  site. The 
dependent  variable  will be receipt  of lung cancer  screening  within  3 months  of the index  visit; the 
primary  independent  variable  will be intervention  group,  and study  site will also be included  as a 
covariate  in all analyses.  Analyses  will also be adjusted  for characteristics  not balanced  by 
[CONTACT_599634].  Because  H3 tests  only one outcome,  tests will be conducted  
at the two-sided  α=0.05  level

• H1: We conducted  our power  analysis  comparing  the LCSDecTool  to usual  care with respect  to 
the two primary  outcomes,  Decisional  Regret  and Decisional  Conflict,  assessed  at T2 (1-month  
post-intervention).  Assuming  SD = 16.6 [95]. For the Decisional  Conflict  outcome,  we will have  
96% power  to detect  a medium -sized  standardized  effect  size of 0.5, corresponding  to a 
difference  of 2.0 points  between  groups  assuming  SD = 3.9. In exploratory  analyses  of Africa.  We 
will conclude  that the intervention  was superior  if we reject  the null hypothesis  of no difference  for 
either  or both of these  outcomes.  Tests  will be two-sided  and will be conducted  using  α=0.025  to 
control  the family -wise type I error  rate at 0.05.  Assuming  10% loss to follow -up at one-month

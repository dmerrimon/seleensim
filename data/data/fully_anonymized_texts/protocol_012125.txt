Reflow Medical Wingman Catheter Wing-IT Clinical Trial
RFM-CTO-[ZIP_CODE]
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Document Date: 20-MAY-[ADDRESS_277471] endovascular devices and fluoroscopic guidance.   
 
1.1 Design, Treatments and Visits  
 
This is a prospective, multi -center, non- randomized single arm study of the Wingman Catheter to 
cross a single infrainguinal peripheral chronic total occlusion.  This study will be conducted at up to 
twelve (12) investigational sites in North America and three (3) centers in Europe. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated during the index procedure through 30- day follow -up. The primary 
endpoint of this study is to assess crossing success with the Wingman device identified as confirmation of guidewire placement in the distal true lumen. The primary safety endpoint of this 
study will evaluate in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 30- day MAEs and clinically significant perforations.  Secondary 
endpoints include the lesion (<50% final residual stenosis and grade ‘C’ or greater dissections 
created during the procedure that is not resolved by [CONTACT_13729]) procedural success and 
safety rates; and the evaluation of procedural and fluoroscopic time/contrast volume.  Patient follow -up will be recorded through [ADDRESS_277472] procedure.  
 
1.2 Objectives  
 
The Wingman device received FDA 510(k) clearance in August 2011 and February 2012 for use as 
a guidewire support device.  Since then the device has been used in approximatel y two thousand 
five hundred (2500) commercial cases across centers within the US and globally to access discrete regions in the peripheral vasculature. This clinical study has been designed to assess the ability of 
the Wingman Catheter to facilitate crossing of CTOs in infrainguinal peripheral arteries.  The 
Wingman’s ability to access and facilitate crossing of CTOs is an important first step towards gaining access to treat these difficult lesions and securing guidewire positioning for therapeutic treatment.

 5) A maximum of [ADDRESS_277475] occluded infrainguinal arteries that are 99- 100% stenosed and no flow is observed in the 
distal lesion except the flow from collateral circulation.  
6) Target lesion is ≥ 1 cm  and ≤  30 cm  in length by  [CONTACT_13729].  
7) Target vessel is ≥ 2.0 mm in diameter.  
8) Patient has Rutherford Classification of 2- 5. 
9) Lesion cannot be crossed by [CONTACT_230545].  
10) Reconstitution of vessel at least 2cm above bifurcation/trifurcation.  
11) Occlusion can be within previously implanted stent.  
 
Patients will be excluded from this trial if any  of the following criteria are met:  
1) Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to contrast materials that cannot be adequately pr e-
treated.  
2) Patient has a known sensitivity or allergy to all anti -platelet medications.  
3) Patient is pregnant or lactating.   
4) Patient has a co- existing disease or medical condition contraindicating percutaneous 
intervention.   
5) Target lesion is in a by[CONTACT_9292].  
6) Patient has had a failed crossing attempt without an intervening intervention on the target limb within the past 14 days.   
7) Patient has a planned surgical or interventional procedure within [ADDRESS_277476] binomial distribution is used for calculation of the sample size. The hypotheses and 
sample size calculations provided in the clinical study protocol are as follows . 
 The null and alternative hypotheses of the primary efficacy endpoint are:  
 H
0:  πWingman_efficacy  ≤ πPG_efficacy  – δefficacy  
 H A: πWingman_efficacy  > πPG_efficacy  – δefficacy   
 where,  
πPG_efficacy  = PG  success rate   
πWingman_efficacy  = Wingman device success rate  
 
Literature Review1-11 indicates that the average success  rate of several CTO catheter device types  
is 83.2%. Using this rate as the historical control and using a non- inferiority margin ( δefficacy ) of 
12.5% the hypotheses of the primary efficacy endpoint can be rewritten as:  
 
 H0:  πWingman_efficacy  ≤ 70. 7% 
 H A: πWingman_efficacy  > 70. 7%  
 
The null and alternative hypotheses of the safety endpoint are:  
 H0:  πWingman_safety  ≥ πPG_safety  + δsafety   
  
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
Confidential  v3.0 20- May-2019   Page 8 of 14 
 
  H A:  πWingman_safety  < πPG_safety  + δsafety  
  where,  
πPG_safety = PG  major adverse event rate  
πWingman_safety = Wingman device major adverse event rate  
 
Literature Review1-11 indicates that the average rate of  major adverse events, perforations, grade C 
or higher dissections and embolizations is 5.0%. Using this rate as the historical control, and using 
a delta of non- inferiority margin ( δsafety) 8% for the safety endpoints, the hypotheses can be rewritten 
as: 
 
H0:  πWingman_safety  ≥ 13.0% 
HA: πWingman_safety  < 13.0% 
 
Assume that the Wingman device has the same success rate and the major adverse event rate as the historical control and further assume that the one- sided type I error rates for the ef ficacy and 
safety endpoints are both 0.05.  An effective sample size of [ADDRESS_277477] 80%  for the efficacy and safety endpoint s.  To account for  a loss of follow up rate of 
approximately 5%, total enrollment of 85 subjec ts is required.  
 
1.5 Randomization 
 
This is a non- randomized study.  
 
2 ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS  
 
2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 
Successful CTO Crossing – While using the Wingman device, successful CTO crossing is identified 
by [CONTACT_230546] . 
 All of  the angiographic films obtained from this study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_50305].  
Information from their angiographic review will be recorded on CRFs and tabulated for endpoint analysis. Angiographic review will include assessments of: lesions  lengths, occlusion lengths, 
reference vessel diameter, calcification severity, successful CTO crossing, perforation and dissection.  
 In the event angiographic films are unavailable for assessment by [CONTACT_50338],  site-reported visual 
assessment s will be u sed for analysis.  
 
2.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
 
  
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
Confidential  v3.0 20- May-2019   Page 9 of 14 
 
 • Lesion success, defined as attainment of <50% final residual stenosis of the target lesion using 
any percutaneous method.   
• Procedure success, defined as device success and the absence of in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_230540], clinically 
significant perforation, clinically significant embolization or Grade C or greater dissection not 
resolved by [CONTACT_13729].  
• Evaluation of total procedural and fluoroscopic time and contrast volume.  
• Evaluation of procedure time associated with use of the investigational device.  
• Evaluation of utility of ancillary device in addition to investigational device.  
 
The angiographic elements of secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed by [CONTACT_230547] . In the event 
angiogra phic films are unavailable for assessment by [CONTACT_50338], site -reported visual assessment 
will be used for analysis.  
 
2.3 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
 
There are no exploratory efficacy endpoints.  
 
2.4 Safety Endpoints  
 
Primary Safety – No evidence of significant in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6879] 30- day MAEs.  No evidence of clinically 
significant perforation1, clinically significant embolization or ≥ Grade C dissection1 after Wingman 
CTO crossing after Wingman CTO crossing and prior to adjunctive interventions , confirmed by 
[CONTACT_89320].  
The components of the composite primary safety endpoint include:  
• Major Adverse Events (MAEs) defined as death, unplanned target limb major amputation, and 
emergent target vessel revascularization.  
• Clinically significant perforation defined as all perforations requiring intervention (e.g., covered 
stent, by[CONTACT_230548]).   
• Clinically significant embolization defined as those events that result in distal ischemia (e.g., 
occlusion of run- off vessel resulting in pain or foot discoloration) and/or requires rescue 
intervention.  
• Grade C Dissection or greater with a minimum of a dissection protruding outside the lumen of the 
vessel persisting after passage of the contrast material.  
 
The components of the primary  safety endpoint s will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_230549] .

4.2 Efficacy Analyses  
 
  
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
Confidential  v3.0 20- May-2019   Page 12 of 14 
 
 Descriptive statistics of the primary efficacy endpoint (total number of CTOs, number and percentage of successful CTO crossings, one- sided 95% CI of the percentage) will be presented. 
The lower bound of the one -sided 95% CI will be compared to the performance goal of 70.7%.   
 
Summary statistics will be presented for procedural and fluoroscopic time and contrast volume and 
other secondary endpoints. The summary will include number, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, maximum, as well as the two- sided 95% CI of the mean and box plots for non- normally 
distributed data. 
 
4.3 Safety Analyses  
 
Number and percentage of in- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491] 30- day major adverse event and the one- sided 95% CI 
will be presented. The upper bound of the one- sided 95% CI will be compared to the performance 
goal of 13.0%.  
Number and percentage of subject s having 30- day MAEs, device successes, lesion successes, 
procedure successes and subject s having clinically significant perforation, and the corresponding 
two-sided 95% CIs will be presented.  
 
4.4 Poolability  Analyses  
 
Poolability of data across clinical study sites is justified on a clinical basis (i.e. all study sites use the 
same protocol) the sponsor monitors the site for protocol compliance, and the data gathering 
instruments are identical. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also requires a statistical 
assessment of poolability. This is done by [CONTACT_230551]. For categorical baseline variables, such as sex, a generalized Fisher’s exact test or equivalent test will be used and for quantitative variables, parametric or non- parametric analysis of 
variance (general linear models or an equivalent procedure) will be used.  
The above statistical analyses do not result in an impediment to pooling, but rather assess the balance of baseline covariates across study sites. If any baseline covariate is found to be statistically significant by [CONTACT_223810], multivariate analyses will be done to determine if imbalance affected study outcome. This is done by [CONTACT_230552].  
It may be necessary to combine two or more low enrolling study sites into pseudo- sites to allow 
these analyses. Sites with fewer than [ADDRESS_277482] enrollment equal to or greater than 6 subjects. This will be done in a manner to preserve the 
structure of the study and prevents bias.  
Baseline characteristics to be considered as possible covariates are as following:  
• Age 
  
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
Confidential  v3.0 20- May-2019   Page 13 of 14 
 
 • Gender  
• Coronary artery disease  
• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] 
• Cerebrovascular accident  
• Hypertension  
• Diabetes  mellitus  
• History of tobacco use  
• History of peripheral vascular disease  
• Rutherford Category  
• ABI/TBI  
If there are relatively few missing data points (e.g., <10%) for a given variable, a simple sex -specific 
imputation using the mean (for continuous variables) or median (for dichotomous or categorical 
variables) of the non- missing values will be done. If the re are >10% missing, the variable will be 
excluded from the imputation analysis.  
Poolability analysis will also be performed on the primary endpoints comparing across sites after adjusting for covariates difference. Logistic regression models will be utilized to include unbalanced 
covariates and site as an independent variable and the study outcome as dependent variable to 
assess outcome difference. If the p- value of site effect is less than 0.10, further analyses will be 
undertaken to investigate the imbalance of the study outcome.  
 
4.5 Subgroup Analyses  
 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for gender  and diabetes mellitus status. Subgroup analyses 
of various endpoints such as crossing success, perforation, dissection and other adverse events 
may also be conducted. Analysis groups may include: guidewire tip load; access site; lesion calcification; lesion length and type of proximal stump.  
 
4.6 Missing or Incomplete Data  
 
Missing endpoint data will not be imputed. However, a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_230542].

Summary of Visit 
Schedule:Visit 1 (Day -14 to Day -1): Screening
Visit 2 (Day 1): Eligibility Confirmation and 
Randomization/Treatment
Visits 3-5 (Days 2 [+2 days], 14 [±2 days], 30 [±3 days]) 
and Visits 6-11 (Day 60 to Day 270 [±7 days]): 
Follow-up Period
Visit 12 (Day 360 [±7]): Exit Visit
Measures Taken to 
Reduce Bias:Stratified randomization will be used to avoid bias in the 
assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase the 
likelihood that known and unknow n subject attributes 
(eg, demographics and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, to reduce the possible influence of covari ates on the drug evaluation, 
and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons 
across treatment groups. Masked  treatment will be used 
to reduce the potential of bias  during data collection and 
evaluation of clinical endpoi nts. The subject, the masked 
Evaluating Investigator (Princip al investigator or his/her 
designees), the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)technician, the photographer, and any other site staff 
involved in performing visit assessments are masked to the study treatment.

General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses
Sample Size Calculation
This is an exploratory study and there is no formal sample size evaluation. For Part 1, 
approximately [ADDRESS_1139231] ug administration. Gi ven a drop-out rate 
of 10%, approximately 22 subjects in each group will be enrolled. A total of 
approximately 66 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of  3 different strengths of 
TLC399 (ProDex).
Based on the SMC recommendation, following review of data for 31 subjects from 
Part 1 (10, 10, and 11 in Groups 1, 2, and 3, re spectively), up to 30 additional subjects 
will be randomly assigned in Part 2 to one of 2 different strengths of TLC399 
(ProDex).
General Statistical Considerations
All efficacy and safety variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics and 
presented by [CONTACT_6660]. Continuous va riables will be presented as number of 
Confidential Page 8 of 90
TLC399 (ProDex) Taiwan Liposome Company, Ltd.
Clinical Trial Protocol: TLC399A2002 [ADDRESS_1139232] deviation, median, minimum, and maximum, as well as 
number of missing data (if relevant); while categorical variables will be presented as number of observations, count, percentage, and number of missing data (if relevant) in 
a frequency table. In general, missing values will remain as missing. Specific rules for 
handling missing efficacy data are described in Efficacy Analysis.
Analysis Population
The populations for analysis applied in  this study are defined as follows: 
Safety population : All randomized subjects who receive any dose of study drug 
administration.
Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population : A subset of the safety population 
comprised of subjects who have at leas t [ADDRESS_1139233]-treatment efficacy evaluation.
Per protocol (PP) population : A subset of the mITT population comprised of subjects 
who complete the study without an y major protocol violations.
Efficacy Analysis
The efficacy data will be descriptively summarized with the mITT and PP analysis 
populations and presented by [CONTACT_16051] a nd treatment group. Data for the Group 3 dose 
in both study parts will be pooled and summarized as well.
The mITT analysis will be considered primary and the PP supportive.
For all analyses of BCVA data, missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation 
methods. Patients who receive rescue medica tion/procedures within [ADDRESS_1139234] observation prior to rescue medicationadministration.
Sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint will be performed as follows:
1) On observed data only, with subjects requiring rescue medications prior to 
Month 6 included as treatment failures (mITT and PP populations)
2) Imputing missing data using the last observation carried forward, with subjects 
requiring rescue medications prior to Month 6 included as treatment failures 
(mITT population)
3) On observed data only, with subjects w ho require rescue medications prior to 
Month 6 using their Month 6 data (mITT population)
The same approach to missing data as described for BCVA data will apply to CST 
data.
The time to achieve a treatment  response of gain of 15 or  more letters from baseline 
BCVA will be analyzed using the Kaplan-Mei er method. Survival plots will be created 
and the survival time will be presented as mean, median, 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the median, and the range.
Change from baseline in number of letters read correctly (using BCVA) and change 
from baseline of retinal CST (by [CONTACT_821887]-OCT scan) in the study eye during the 12-month period will be summarized by [CONTACT_821888].
Additionally, 95% CIs for the treatment estimates in changes from baseline will be 
constructed.
Subgroup Analysis
Subgroup analyses will be performed for th e primary efficacy endpoint and selected

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be listed and categorized by [CONTACT_634236], stop date, seriousness, severity, relationship to IP, action taken, and outcome . TEAEs with a missing relationship to 
study treatment will assume greatest relationship to study treatment. TEAEs with missing severity grades will be categorized as “missing” for tabulation of TEAEs by [CONTACT_926]. Summary tables will display the total number of TEAEs and the number of subjects with each TEAE by [CONTACT_6660]. TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_436441] (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred term for all TEAEs, serious adve rse events (SAEs), and TEAEs leading to 
study withdrawal. In addition, TEAEs will be  summarized by [CONTACT_821889].
Safety data including physic al examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory data, IOP 
assessments, SLB, indirect  ophthalmology, FA, and FP evaluations will be 
descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_1570].
Continuous safety data will be  summarized by [CONTACT_821890].
Continuous data will also be converted to cat egorical values where possible (ie, below,
within, and above normal ra nges) and summarized in shift from baseline tables. 
Categorical safety data collected by [CONTACT_821891] s howing the counts and 
percentages in each category at each visit, as well as shifts from baseline.
Interim Analysis
An interim analysis for the primary effica cy evaluation was pla nned to be conducted 
after all subjects have completed at least 6 months in the study or had been withdrawn. 
For this Phase 2 trial, efficacy and safety evaluation beyond Month 6 will be 
considered exploratory.
Safety monitoring committee (SMC) reviews will be performed throughout the study.
The unmasked SMC reviewed unmasked listings for 31 subjects on 29 March 2018 
(data cutoff 09 March 2018), and requested that recruitment be temporarily paused pending further data analysis. Additional de scriptive efficacy summaries were provided 
to the SMC for a review meeting on [ADDRESS_1139236] 2018 
(data cutoff [ADDRESS_1139237] 2018). Following this meeting, the SMC approved the sponsor’s proposal to enroll additional subjects treat ed with the Group 3 dose and a new Group 4 
dose (containing a greater  volume of the same formulation of Group 3).
As of Protocol Amendment 3 (v4), data from Part 1 (31 subjects) will be unmasked. 
Given that, as of protocol preparation, 1)  all [ADDRESS_1139238] been withdrawn (and evaluations 
beyond 6 months were considered explorator y); 2) no formal statistical comparisons 
will be made between th e groups in Part 1 or Part 2; and 3) the selection of dose to 
carry forward from Part 1 has already been  decided, it was deemed that minimal bias 
will be introduced by [CONTACT_821892] . The sponsor intends to disclose key 
unmasked efficacy and safety data from Part 1 with the investigators and other 
stakeholders so that they can adequately unde rstand the benefits and risks of the study 
treatment.

 Background Information  
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide.   
Treatment options for COPD patients consist of medications, such as bronchodilators 
and anti -inflammatory drugs, pulmon ary rehabilitation, long term oxygen therapy 
(LTOT), lung volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation.  Studies have shown 
that bronchodilators and anti -inflammatory drugs show minor or no benefit on long term 
outcomes but rather are used mainly for symptomatic relief.1  Pulmonary rehabilitation 
has been demonstrated to improve functional status and symptoms but there is lacking 
evidence on long term outcomes of this therapy. 2   Lung volume reduction surgery and 
lung transplantation is only appropria te for a small number of patients; therefore, there 
is no demonstration of improved long -term survival rate.3, [ADDRESS_175384] been shown to significantly improve long term 
patient outcomes.  For the severe COPD patient, LTOT is th e only treatment that 
demonstrated prolonged survival in controlled studies. 5, 6   But, despi[INVESTIGATOR_152195], COPD is still characterized by a high morbidity and mortality rate.   
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is one therap y that may prove 
beneficial to stable COPD patients.  NPPV is the use of positive pressure ventilation 
administered via a nasal or full face mask (that covers both the nose and mouth).  This 
type of ventilation has become a well-established  and increasingl y used therapeutic 
option for patients with hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] (HRF) due to COPD.[ADDRESS_175385] bronchodilator 
FEV1 <80% of the predicted value in combination with an FEV1 / FV C <70%.  This 
would confirm that there is a presence of airflow limitatio n that is not fully reversible.  
The presence of airflow limitation has been identified as one of the main causes of 
dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( 1).  Expi[INVESTIGATOR_152196] (EFL) occurs when the airways become compressed which usually results

Early detection of EFL consisted of either invasive  esophageal  balloon or relatively 
complex plethysmographic techniques.  An alternative approach, and one that will be  
used in this study, involves the Force d Oscillation Technique (FOT).  
In [ADDRESS_175387] frequency. Since the quiet breathing signal can interfere with the

Protocol # SRC -HRC -Vector ENG -[ADDRESS_175389] has incorporated this method as a new feature into the Philips 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_152198] (K121623) . The device has been 
designed to produce a [ADDRESS_175390] with peak to peak amplitude of approximately 2 
cmH 2O superimposed upon the pressure and flow generated by [CONTACT_8121]. The 
resultant feedback waveform is then filtered and analyzed to measure reacta nce 
(deltaX)  and thus determine if EFL is present . Subsequently the EPAP (and 
concurrently and proportionally the IPAP) is increased until the EFL is essentially 
abolished (falls below the predetermined EFL threshold). Since this reactance is 
analyzed cont inuously (breath by [CONTACT_42787]) during both inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32715], it is 
relatively immune to external factors such as modest leaks o r coughing / swallowing . 
Description of the Intervention Studied  
The Vector ventilator is intended to provide non -invasiv e ventilatory support to treat 
adult patients with Respi[INVESTIGATOR_152199] .  It is 
intended to be used within the home, institutional/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and diagnostic laboratory 
environments. This device is not intended for life  support. It can be used to screen for 
the presence, and abolishment of Expi[INVESTIGATOR_152187].  
The Vector ventilation method auto -titrates PEEP or EPAP on a breath by [CONTACT_152233].   
Vector is a new noninvasive method to continuously detect EFL durin g spontaneous 
breathing  and minimizing it using EPAP.  
The device has been designed to produce a [ADDRESS_175391] the change of a reactance ( ΔXrs ). Subsequently the EPAP (and concurrently 
and proportionally the IPAP) is increased until the EFL is essentially abolished (falls 
below the predetermined EFL threshold). Since thi s reactance is analyzed continuously 
(breath by [CONTACT_42787]) during both inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32715], it is relatively immune to 
external factors such as modest leaks or coughing /swallowing. Given that forced 
oscillation technique can be easily applied during no ninvasive nasal ventilatory support, 
it could be used during routine noninvasive ventilation.  
This Vector screening mode is an automated five -minute screening test can be done in 
a clinical environment under supervision  to determine if EFL is present.  
The screening test will have built in logic that determines the test’s validity during the 
screening, as well as, the conclusion of the test.  The screening test will be at a 
relatively fixed pressure (typi[INVESTIGATOR_32270] 3-4 cmH2O) that will remain constant 
throughout the session.  The screening session results, which will consist of near real -
time pulmonary mechanic information will be kept on a display until the next session is 
enabled.

 Schedule of Events:  
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_152235]. Participants may be pre -screened over the phone to determine eligibility.  
Participants that are inte rested will be scheduled for the screening visit  at the clinical 
office.  
Potential participants may be also be found by a local marketing company. This 
marketing company will utilize their local database to find potential participants in the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA  area.  These participants will undergo a brief online and/or over the 
phone screening by [CONTACT_152236].  If they are found to be potentially eligible, 
Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_152200].  A more thorough phone 
scree n will be conducted by [CONTACT_152237][INVESTIGATOR_152201].  If the person is still 
found to be potentially eligible for the study and is interested they will either be 
scheduled by [CONTACT_152237][INVESTIGATOR_152202] .  A waiver of informed consent for screening will be submitted 
to the IRB for contact[CONTACT_152238].  
Study Visit 1 (screening)   
Once th e participant arrives , the study will be explained in full detail.  If the participant 
agrees, he/she will be consented into the study and the participant will be given a copy 
of the informed consent.  
Once consent is obtained and eligibility is confirmed , the following study related 
procedures will be conducted:  
• Demographics:  gender, age, ethnicity, height and weight will be collected.  
• Current Medications:  all current medications will be collected.  
• Medical History Assessment: information will be co llected regarding historical 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_44049], COPD history and other relevant medical history including the 
diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing.  
• Physical examination with vital signs to include HR, BP, RR, S pO2 maintained at 
least 88%, and chest ausc ultation.  
• Administration of CAT and EFL Indication questionnaire s 
• Mask Fitting:  Participants will have a mask fitting in order to determine the best 
possible provided mask while using the Vector NIV device  during the screening for EFL.

  • For the EFL Screening/Determination and EPAP Titration procedure, the study 
device will be set up in fixed pressure mode (Appendix  A) for EFL.  
• EFL Determination: The participant will be asked to breath e quietly into th e 
Vector device using the selected mask for [ADDRESS_175394] EFL 
after 5 minutes by [CONTACT_152239], the participant will not continue in the 
study.  
• EPAP Titration: if it is determined by [CONTACT_152240], the Vector NIV device will be changed from screening m ode to therapy mode 
to delivery BiPAP therapy.  The participant may be changed to a new mask at this time. 
The participants will then breathe on the Vector NIV device in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_152203] 20 minutes. During the additional 20 minutes of breathing, 
the device will automatically increase the EPAP (and concurrently and proportionally the 
IPAP) until the EFL is abolished ( or falls below the predetermined EFL threshold).  
• While the automatic EPAP Titration is being performed , all participants’ SpO 2 will 
be monitored via finger pulse oximetry. If the SpO 2 persistently falls below 88% during 
the titration, the participant will not be scheduled for study visit 2.  
• Patient must stay awake during the EPAP Titration. If the patient,  falls asleep, 
they will be woken by [CONTACT_464].  
• The Final EPAP that is determined to abolish the participants EFL will be 
recorded. If the determined EPAP pressure is 6cmH2O or higher, the participant may

muscle, to measure leg movements  
 
Prior to the sleep study with the NIV device , the trained technologists will verify mask 
size, fit, and adjustme nt that was determined at study visit 1. Patients will be asked to 
bring their previously fitted mask from the study visit 1.  Once the sleep testing has 
started, technologists will have a 2 hour window from sleep onset to make any 
additional mask changes o r adjustments.   
During the Sleep study, the Vector NIV device will be connected to a laptop computer 
where all Ventilator related parameters collected by [CONTACT_152241][INVESTIGATOR_152205]. These outputs 
include the device IPAP and EPAP pressures, EFL value, patient flow, mask leak, 
minute ventilation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697].  A flexible finger sensor will be placed on the 
finger in order to measure and monitor oxygen saturation

periods with both fixed pressure support as well Average Volume Assured Pressure 
Support during the night. In the event that the study participant presents with any 
obstructive or res pi[INVESTIGATOR_152206], the trained sleep technician will be able to make manual adjustments to the 
device pressure settings in order to address the issue (Appendix  A). 
In the event that manual titration wa s unsuccessful, the trained sleep technologist will 
refer to standard of care procedures including, but not limited to, switching to a backup 
device that the sleep lab has available.

Risk and Benefit Analysis  
 
Potential Risks and Discomforts  
 
This is a minimal risk study .  Potential risks are detailed below and will be listed in the 
ICF and discussed during the consenting process.  
 
The risks of providing noninvasive ventilation with the Vector NIV device are no greater 
than the risks encountered with other assisted positive airway pressure (PAP) devices. 
There are  no significant risks will be posed to the participants participating in this 
protocol, as the device is a non -significant risk  device and the study is non -invasive and 
will be conducted in a sleep lab and monitored by a trained clinical staff as well as 
Philips Respi[INVESTIGATOR_152205]. The equipment has been tested to ensure safety. Should 
the equipment not perform as designed, ther apy could increase and / or decrease more 
than desired. This affect could be uncomfortable or awaken the participant.

A trained clinician will be present monitoring the participant while the device is in use 
the sleep lab. The clinician will intervene sh ould any problems be identified. One 
possible intervention could be for the clinician to stop the study in the event that 
participant’s oxygen saturation ( SpO 2) falls below 88%. The participant can also easily 
remove their interface device should it become  uncomfortable or make breathing 
difficult. Other potential side effects of PAP therapy may include: ear discomfort, 
conjunctivitis, skin abrasions due to non -invasive interfaces and gastric distension 
(aerophagia), all of which are quite uncommon. Thus, w e believe that the ri sks and 
discomfort are minimal.  All masks used for this study are commercially available 
products.  
Oxygen saturations ( SpO 2) will be monitored throughout the duration of the nocturnal 
study.  
The patient may sleep poorly during the no cturnal sleep study and thus may be sleepy 
the next day. If the patient is too sleepy to drive home, other forms of transportation will 
be utilized.  
Should any problems be identified during the [ADDRESS_175407] ivities that they complete. Participants’  payment 
will be made d according to the following schedule.

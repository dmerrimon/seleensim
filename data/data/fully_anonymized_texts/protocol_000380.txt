1.1 Purpose/  Objectives.
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_386756] 
(PAD)-related brachial artery flow mediated dilation and reduce inflammation.  
Ghrelin is a peptide and hormone that is primarily produced by P/D1 cells of the 
gastric fundus and circulates in both acylated and unacylated forms.  Acylated 
ghrelin acts on the Growth Hormone Secretagogue Receptor (GHSR), increasing 
growth hormone levels, appetite, and insulin resistance (1-4).   Unacylated ghrelin 
was originally thought to be an inactive metabolite.  However, recent evidence 
shows that unacylated ghrelin promotes skeletal muscle cell regeneration, 
improves mitochondrial function, and increases skeletal muscle capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168] 
(5-7).  Unacylated ghrelin also improves brachial artery flow-mediated dilation in 
humans (8).   Unacylated ghrelin has been studied in more than 70 healthy 
humans without adverse effects (4,8-14).  Unacylated ghrelin does not act on 
GHSR and does not increase appetite, or cause insulin resistance (4,8-14).  
However, unacylated ghrelin has never been studied in people with PAD.  In 
addition, unacylated ghrelin has never been administered in a subcutaneous form 
to humans.
The pi[INVESTIGATOR_386757]. The 
results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_386758] a randomized trial of unacylated 
ghrelin, in subsequent study, to improve functioning and prevent mobility loss in 
older people with PAD.  
Specific Aim.  Because subcutaneously administered unacylated ghrelin has not 
been studied in humans, we will establish the association of increasing doses of 
subcutaneous unacylated ghrelin with circulating levels of unacylated ghrelin and 
brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and levels of circulating 
inflammatory biomarkers.  To achieve this aim, six PAD participants age 55 and 
older will receive a single subcutaneous injection of unacylated ghrelin at doses of 
10 ug/kg, 20 ug/kg, and 40 ug/kg, respectively, on three separate days at least one 
week apart.  Unacylated ghrelin levels will be measured at baseline and at defined 
intervals after each subcutaneous injection (30 minutes, 60 minutes, 1.5 hours, 3 
hours, 6 hours, 8 to 12 hours and 24 hours).  Brachial artery FMD will be 
measured at baseline, before the unacylated ghrelin injection, approximately six to 
eight hours, and 24 hours after each unacylated ghrelin injection (8).  Circulating 
levels of inflammatory biomarkers will be measured at baseline and at six hours, 
8-[ADDRESS_484618] dose of subcutaneously delivered unacylated ghrelin that maximizes 
brachial artery FMD, maximizes levels of unacylated ghrelin, and minimizes 
circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers will be used in future study.

Trial
Page 4 of 32Specific Aim 2. We will assess the safety of increasing doses of unacylated 
ghrelin in six patients with PAD age 55 and older. 
1.2 Hypotheses.
We hypothesize that unacylated ghrelin, administered subcutaneously, will 
increase brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and reduce circulating 
levels of inflammatory biomarkers and that higher doses of subcutaneously 
administered unacylated ghrelin will be associated with greater increases in 
brachial artery FMD and lower circulating levels of inflammatory biomarkers.  
2.0 Background
2.1 Relevant experience.
A. Lower  extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 10-15% of 
community dwelling men and women age 65 and older (15-17) and will be 
increasingly prevalent as the U.S. population survives longer with chronic 
disease.  Our prior work demonstrates that men and women with PAD have 
greater functional impairment and more rapid functional decline than those 
without PAD (15,18-24).  The functional impairment documented in PAD is 
associated with loss of independence, increased mortality, and poor quality of 
life (22,25-27).  Recent evidence shows that chronic disability, such as that 
associated with PAD, accounts for more than half of [LOCATION_002] health 
burden (28). Furthermore, therapeutic advances have not kept pace with the 
growing burden of disability from chronic disease (28).  Only two 
medications, pentoxifylline and cilostazol, are FDA-approved for treating 
PAD-associated walking impairment.  Of these, pentoxifylline is usually 
ineffective and benefits from cilostazol are modest (29-32).  New therapi[INVESTIGATOR_386759].  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_386760]. 
B. Calf  skeletal muscle fibers in PAD are damaged.  Electron microscopy 
demonstrates pathologic changes in myofibrils, mitochondria, nuclei, and 
sarcolemma of calf muscle myofibers in patients with PAD (33).  In 34 
participants with PAD and 21 without PAD who underwent calf muscle 
biopsy, PAD participants had 30% higher protein carbonyl content (P<0.001) 
and 40% higher 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) levels (P<.001), indicating 
higher calf muscle oxidative stress levels in the PAD participants (33).  More 
severe calf muscle oxidative stress was associated with more severe myofiber 
damage and fewer myofibers (33).  Unacylated ghrelin has the potential to 
promote healthy calf muscle fibers in patients with PAD.

Page 5 of 32C. Calf  muscle mitochondria are damaged in PAD.  Skeletal muscle 
mitochondria from PAD patients also demonstrate a quantitative mitochondria 
dysfunction, with reduced energy production (34-36).  One study used 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy to compare the efficiency of mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation in 12 men with PAD and 14 without PAD who 
engaged in submaximal plantarflexion exercise.  After submaximal exercise, 
and controlling for blood flow, the PAD participants had poorer 
phosphocreatine recovery (137 seconds + 41 vs. 44 seconds + 3, P=0.02) and 
poorer adenosine triphosphate (ATP) recovery (60 seconds + 10 vs. 29 
seconds + 2, P=0.02) than patients without PAD (36).  These and other results 
(34,35) demonstrate an intrinsic defect in calf muscle mitochondrial function 
in patients with PAD.  Unacylated ghrelin has the potential to promote 
improved calf muscle mitochondrial function in patients with PAD.
2.2 Significance of the research.
A.Overview  of ghrelin.  Ghrelin is a peptide and hormone that circulates in 
acylated and unacylated forms.  Unlike acylated ghrelin (1,3,), unacylated 
ghrelin does not bind to GHSR1a and does not increase appetite or cause 
insulin resistance (4,9,11).  In studies of humans and animals, unacylated 
ghrelin improves endothelial function, regenerates skeletal muscle cells, 
improves mitochondrial function, and increases capi[INVESTIGATOR_95168] (37-42).  In 
summary, unacylated ghrelin has therapeutic effects on skeletal muscle and 
the vasculature without promoting insulin resistance or weight gain. 
B.In  a mouse model of hind-limb ischemia, unacylated ghrelin increased 
skeletal muscle regeneration, angiogenesis, and limb strength.  Togliatto 
and colleagues induced hindlimb ischemia in 81 mice and randomized them to 
intra-peritoneal injections of unacylated ghrelin, acylated ghrelin, or saline for 
21 days (37).   Mice who received unacylated ghrelin had significantly more 
skeletal muscle satellite cells (measured by [CONTACT_386774]7/MyoD markers), 
significantly more regenerating skeletal muscle fibers, and significantly better 
plantarflexion function in the ischemic limb than mice who received acylated 
ghrelin or saline.  Mice who received unacylated ghrelin had greater increases 
in capi[INVESTIGATOR_386761], compared to 
the other two groups.  Greater increases in satellite cell number in mice who 
received unacylated ghrelin were mediated by P38/MAPK activation (37), 
consistent with previous reports that satellite cell proliferation depends on 
P38/MAPK protein activation.  If these actions occur in humans with PAD, 
results will have major therapeutic implications for PAD patients.  The 
purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_386762].

Trial
Page [ADDRESS_484619].  
In a separate in vitro study, unacylated ghrelin induced differentiation of 
proliferating skeletal myoblasts and promoted their fusion into multi-
nucleated syncytia (7).  A high affinity binding site for deacylated ghrelin was 
identified on C2C12 myoblasts that is distinct from the (GHSR)-1a receptor 
that causes insulin resistance and increased appetite (7).  In summary, 
preliminary evidence from in vitro  and animal studies supports our hypothesis 
that unacylated ghrelin may improve functioning by [CONTACT_386775]-
related ischemia-reperfusion injury.  
D.Unacylated  ghrelin and mitochondrial function.  In the hind limb ischemia 
mouse model by [CONTACT_386776] (37), unacylated ghrelin reduced oxidative 
stress in ischemic muscle, by [CONTACT_386777], 
superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2), suggesting improved mitochondrial 
function.  In a rat model of chronic kidney disease, Barazzoni and colleagues 
administered acylated ghrelin or saline subcutaneously to healthy mice for 
four days.  As compared to saline, acylated ghrelin significantly improved 
oxidative metabolism and increased activity of the mitochondrial enzymes 
citrate synthase and COX enzyme (38).  These favorable changes in 
mitochondrial function were not related to increases in appetite, suggesting 
that this beneficial effect may be distinct from the GHSR-1a receptor.  Thus, 
we hypothesize that unacylated ghrelin will improve mitochondrial oxidative 
metabolism in PAD participants. 
E.Unacylated  ghrelin improves endothelial function. In vitro study shows that 
unacylated ghrelin inhibits apoptosis of endothelial cells (41).  In rats, 
unacylated ghrelin causes endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the 
mesenteric vascular bed (42). In 12 humans with metabolic syndrome, 
intravenously administered unacylated ghrelin significantly improved 
endothelium-dependent brachial artery FMD within one hour after ghrelin 
infusion (8).  Patients with PAD have significantly impaired brachial artery 
FMD compared to individuals without PAD (43).  Thus, we expect that 
subcutaneously administered unacylated ghrelin will improve FMD in PAD 
patients.

7.0 Study Timelines
Each participant’s part in this study will last up to approximately six months. 
Visit 1.
The initial visit will last approximately 2 hours. Informed consent will be 
provided and an ankle brachial index (ABI) measurement will be obtained to 
ascertain eligibility. Questionnaires will be administered to obtain information 
about their health and medical history. The six-minute walk test and the four-
meter walking velocity at usual and fastest pace may be obtained. An 
electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed and a blood sample will be obtained. 
Blood will be tested for liver and kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete 
blood count (CBC). A physical exam will be performed and medical history will 
be obtained. Height and weight will be measured. Vitals may be obtained. Vitals 
include blood pressure, heartrate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and oxygen level.

**The FMD will be performed at either [ADDRESS_484627] doses of 10 ug/kg, 20 ug/kg, and 40 ug/kg of unacylated ghrelin on 
three separate days for each participant.  These doses were selected based on 
published literature and the experience of our consultants [CONTACT_386794], who 
has an ongoing study of intravenously administered unacylated ghrelin in healthy 
people (R01-DK097550) and [CONTACT_386795], who has an ongoing study of 
subcutaneously administered acylated ghrelin in older frail people without PAD 
(R21-AG040488).  
Justification for proposed doses of unacylated ghrelin.  Unacylated ghrelin is a 
synthetic
 28 amino-acid protein.  The ½ life of intravenously administered 
unacylated ghrelin is 30-34 minutes, which is comparable to but slightly longer 
than the ½ life of insulin and glucagon (9).  In comparison, the ½ life of 
intravenously administered acylated ghrelin is 9 to 11 minutes (9).  A portion of 
intravenously administered acylated ghrelin is converted to unacylated ghrelin (9).  
In contrast, unacylated ghrelin is not converted to acylated ghrelin (9). In healthy 
people, circulating levels of unacylated ghrelin are higher than those of acylated 
ghrelin, in a ratio that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 4:1 but ranges from 2:1 to 9:1 (9,11,48). In a 
study of healthy people, a 4X higher dose of intravenously administered 
unacylated ghrelin achieved a CMax that was twelve times higher than that for 
intravenously administered acylated ghrelin (9). Because of the longer ½ life of 
unacylated ghrelin and the substantially greater CMax achieved with unacylated 
ghrelin as compared to acylated ghrelin, we will begin with a subcutaneous 
unacylated ghrelin (10 ug/kg) dose that is comparable to that selected by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Cappola for her study of subcutaneously administered acylated ghrelin.  Next, we 
will test a subcutaneous dose of unacylated ghrelin that is 2X the starting dose (20 
ug/kg).  Finally, we will test a subcutaneous dose of unacylated ghrelin that is 4X 
times the starting dose (40 ug/kg).  Four times the starting dose was selected as 
the maximal dose to test because circulating levels of unacylated ghrelin are 
approximately four times higher than circulating levels of acylated ghrelin and 
because of the higher CMax of unacylated as compared to acylated ghrelin 
(9,11,48).  Although the GIFT Trial will administer unacylated ghrelin 
subcutaneously, we anticipate that, similar to intravenous administration, the 
maximum concentration of unacylated ghrelin will be greater than that for 
acylated ghrelin.

8.0 Study Endpoints
8.1 Primary  and secondary study endpoints.
We selected brachial artery FMD as an endpoint because unacylated ghrelin 
increases brachial artery FMD within hours of intravenously administered 
unacylated ghrelin (8). This immediate effect on brachial artery FMD provides a 
short-term therapeutic endpoint for identifying an optimal unacylated ghrelin 
dose.  The brachial artery FMD will be measured at baseline and at six or 8-12 
hours after each dose of unacylated ghrelin is administered.
Additional endpoints for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_101656] a) circulating levels of 
unacylated ghrelin; b) levels of acylated ghrelin; c) biomarkers of inflammation.
8.2 Primary  or secondary safety endpoints.
Unacylated ghrelin has been administered intravenously to more than 70 humans 
without any serious adverse effects (4,8-14).  Two participants in one study 
experienced mild facial swelling after receiving unacylated ghrelin intravenously 
(14). Symptoms resolved within hours (14).  Dizziness was reported in one study 
in which intravenous acylated and unacylated ghrelin were administered 
simultaneously over the short term (12).  However, this adverse effect was not 
observed when unacylated ghrelin was administered alone (12).  We will monitor 
participants for symptoms of facial swelling and dizziness.  We will monitor 
participants for blood pressure and signs of facial swelling. An electrocardiogram 
will be obtained at visit 1 and before the 20 ug/kg and 40 ug/kg injections and 24 
hours after each injection. Renal function, liver function, electrolytes, and CBC 
will be obtained at baseline, before the 20 ug/kg and 40 ug/kg injections, and 
approximately [ADDRESS_484628] subcutaneous dose of 
unacylated ghrelin that maximizes brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD).  
These PAD participants will receive three different subcutaneous doses of 
unacylated ghrelin on three different days and will undergo measurement of 
unacylated ghrelin levels prior to the injection and at specified time intervals. 
Each dose will be separated by a wash-out period of > one week.  Data will be 
obtained for all six participants at each dose before moving to the next dose.
We will test doses of 10 ug/kg, 20 ug/kg, and 40 ug/kg of unacylated ghrelin on 
three separate days for each participant.  These doses were selected based on 
published literature and the experience of our consultants [CONTACT_386794], who 
has an ongoing study of intravenously administered unacylated ghrelin in healthy

substantially greater CMax achieved with unacylated ghrelin as compared to 
acylated ghrelin, we will begin with a subcutaneous unacylated ghrelin (10 ug/kg) 
dose that is comparable to that selected by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cappola for her study of 
subcutaneously administered acylated ghrelin.  Next, we will test a subcutaneous 
dose of unacylated ghrelin that is 2X the starting dose (20 ug/kg).  Finally, we 
will test a subcutaneous dose of unacylated ghrelin that is 4X times the starting 
dose (40 ug/kg).  Four times the starting dose was selected as the maximal dose to 
test because circulating levels of unacylated ghrelin are approximately four times 
higher than circulating levels of acylated ghrelin and because of the higher CMax 
of unacylated as compared to acylated ghrelin (9,11,48).  Although the GIFT Trial 
will administer unacylated ghrelin subcutaneously, we anticipate that, similar to 
intravenous administration, the maximum concentration of unacylated ghrelin will 
be greater than that for acylated ghrelin.    
Preparation of subcutaneous unacylated ghrelin.  Synthetic unacylated ghrelin 
powder will be supplied by [CONTACT_386780][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s pharmacy for subcutaneous injection, using methods successfully 
implemented by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cappola for subcutaneously administered acylated ghrelin.  
Selecting the dose of unacylated ghrelin for future study.  We will select the 
lowest subcutaneous dose of unacylated ghrelin that maximizes brachial artery 
FMD and minimizes circulating levels of oxidative stress.  We will also use 
unacylated ghrelin levels to select the unacylated ghrelin dose.  In selecting the 
dose, greater increases in brachial artery FMD and lower levels of oxidative stress 
will be prioritized over the level of unacylated ghrelin. For example, if the dose of 
40 ug/kg results in substantially higher levels of unacylated ghrelin compared to 
the dose of 20 ug/kg, but improvement in brachial artery FMD is similar between 
the 20 ug/kg and the 40 ug/kg doses, then we will select a dose of 20 ug/kg for 
use in a possible future trial of unacylated ghrelin in PAD patients.

Please see sections 7.0, 8.1, 8.2, and 9.1 above.
Ankle Brachial Index (ABI).   After the participant rests supi[INVESTIGATOR_140476], 
the right brachial, dorsalis pedis (DP), posterior tibial (PT) and left DP, PT, and 
brachial artery pressures are measured using a hand-held Doppler probe. 
Pressures are measured twice. The ABI is calculated for each leg by [CONTACT_386781].  
Questionnaire Administration .   Participants will be administered study 
questionnaires by a trained and certified health interviewer.
Brachial Artery Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD).   Brachial artery imaging will 
be
 performed by a Registered Diagnostic Cardiac Sonographer according to 
established protocol (44,45).  Changes in FMD will be read by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. James Stein’s 
University of Wisconsin Atherosclerosis Imaging Research Program Core 
Laboratory by a single reader blinded to participant characteristics.  We have 
more than a decade of experience working with [CONTACT_192093]’s reading center 
(44,47,48).  Measurement reproducibility in [CONTACT_192093]’s laboratory has a median 
FMD difference of 0.02% (inter-quartile range: -0.03 to 0.04).  
Six-minute walk.  Participants will be asked to walk back and forth along a 100-
foot hallway for six minutes.  They will be instructed that the purpose of the six-
minute walk test is to measure how long a distance they can walk in six-minutes.  
A script will be read to describe the study procedure.  Participants will be asked 
whether they feel the test is safe to try and whether they have any questions. The 
six-minute walk is a well validated measure of walking endurance that predicts 
mobility loss and mortality in PAD populations (19,22,49,50) and improves in 
response to therapeutic interventions in older people with PAD (49-53).  The 
intra-class correlation coefficient for the test-retest reliability of the six-minute 
walk test among 156 PAD participants in our SILC exercise trial was 0.90 
(p<0.001) when two six-minute walks were completed 1-2 weeks apart (51,54).  
Participants may be asked to perform the six-minute walk at baseline and may be 
asked to repeat it approximately four-eight hours after each subcutaneous ghrelin 
injection.
Four-Meter Walk. Participants are timed walking a four-meter distance in a 
corridor at their usual and fastest pace.  Because of a learning effect, the four-
meter walk is performed twice, and the fastest walk in each set is used in 
analyses.  Participants are read a script by [CONTACT_9137], describing the 
test.  The test is demonstrated for the participant by [CONTACT_9137]- both at 
usual and at fastest pace.  Participants may be asked to perform the four-meter 
walk at baseline and may be asked to repeat it approximately four-eight hours 
after each subcutaneous ghrelin injection.

Minimizing risk related to baseline and follow-up testing.  All study coordinators 
undergo baseline training and are certified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. McDermott before beginning 
data collection.  Training and certification involves ensuring that coordinators are 
trained in methods to help minimize falls.  Dr. McDermott re-certifies 
coordinators every six months to ensure continued adherence to study protocol.  
Those who are not adhering to protocol undergo additional training followed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_1312]-certification.    
Minimizing risk related to loss of confidentiality .  The following methods will be 
employed to maintain confidentiality of participants.  First, study recruitment 
letters will be mailed, using IRB-approved methods, only after receiving written 
permission from the participant’s physician.  The personal physician of each study 
participant will have the option of not allowing investigators to contact [CONTACT_94635].  Lists of potentially eligible participants will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_386783].  Recruitment letters for potential participants identified from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_386763].  These research staff members have 
completed training in the ethical conduct of human subject research, including 
maintaining participant confidentiality.  Recruitment letters to potential 
participants identified from medical center lists are mailed in sealed envelopes 
and addressed to the potential participant.  All potential participants who receive 
mailed information about the study after the approval from their physician will 
have the opportunity to call a voice-mail system to ask not to be further contact[CONTACT_386784].  Secondly, only study investigators and key research staff will 
have access to the study database.  Third, participants will be assigned a unique 
study identifier.  Individual names will ultimately be removed from the study 
database and only the unique study identifier will be used to distinguish 
participants in the database.  Fourth, collected data will be maintained in locked 
computer files and file cabinets to which only study investigators have access.  
Collected data will be used only for research purposes.  Any published data will 
not contain any individual identifiers.

recognized experts to serve on the DSMB.  
Power Estimates.  The primary aim of the GIFT Trial is to obtain preliminary 
data that will allow us to determine whether there is sufficient ‘signal’ from 
unacylated ghrelin to warrant additional study of unacylated ghrelin in older 
patients with PAD.  In addition, the GIFT Trial will allow us to obtain an estimate 
of effect size and standard deviation of change in our study outcomes when 
unacylated ghrelin is administered to older PAD participants.  Finally, the GIFT 
Trial will allow us to determine the feasibility of administering unacylated ghrelin 
to older patients with PAD.   Because this is a preliminary study, no power 
calculations were performed.
Statistical Analyses. Simple statistics will be performed to assess changes in 
brachial artery FMD over time in response to each unacylated ghrelin injection.  
Simple statistics will also be performed to analyze changes in levels of unacylated 
ghrelin and acylated ghrelin and circulating levels of oxidative stress after each 
subcutaneous injection of unacylated ghrelin.

evaluated for adherence to protocol, prior to beginning data collection and every 
six months after initial certification.  
12.0 Provisions  to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects
Serious adverse events will be reported to the DSMB within seven days of 
each serious adverse event.  Adverse event data will be reported to the 
DSMB every six months during the study, and/or as requested by [CONTACT_40746].  The DSMB will have the ability to stop the study at any time if 
there are concerns about safety.
13.0 Withdrawal  of Subjects*
Subjects may withdraw from the research at any time. If they decide to leave the 
research, they should contact [CONTACT_093], [CONTACT_140528] McDermott.
If they  stop being in the research, already collected data may not be removed from 
the study database. They will be asked whether the investigator can collect data 
from their routine medical care. If the subject agrees, this data will be handled the 
same as research data.
Subjects who withdraw from the study will be replaced by [CONTACT_386786](s)
 who meets eligibility criteria.  The newly enrolled PAD participants 
will begin the study at the dose at which the withdrawn participant would have 
received next, if they had not withdrawn.

Page 20 of 32dose finding study, in which participants will receive three different doses of 
unacylated ghrelin (10 ug/kg, 20 ug/kg, and 40 ug/kg) on three different days.  
Each dose will be separated by [CONTACT_386787].  Based on our previous work 
involving older participants with PAD, we anticipate that the average age will be 
approximately [ADDRESS_484638] 33% of participants will be minorities, and 
that approximately 50% will be women.  For example, in our recently completed 
SILC randomized controlled clinical trial of exercise in patients with PAD 
participants included 52% women and 45% African-Americans (39).  In general, 
older patients with PAD have a high prevalence of comorbid diseases, particularly 
coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and 
pulmonary disease.  Thus the patient population is likely to be of generally poorer 
health than that of older men and women without PAD in the general population.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in section 3.2.  
Sources of material.  We will collect data on levels of circulating unacylated 
ghrelin at multiple defined time points within a 24-hour period after three 
increasing doses of subcutaneously injected unacylated ghrelin. We will also 
measure brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) at baseline and  at six or 8-

unacylated ghrelin to use in future trials.
Potential Risks.  
Risks associated with unacylated ghrelin.  As described in section 8.2 above, 
unacylated ghrelin has been administered intravenously to more than 70 humans 
without any serious adverse effects (4,8-14).  Two participants in one study 
experienced mild facial swelling after receiving unacylated ghrelin intravenously 
(14). Symptoms resolved within hours (14).  Dizziness was reported in one study 
in which intravenous acylated and unacylated ghrelin were administered 
simultaneously over the short term (12).  However, this adverse effect was not 
observed when unacylated ghrelin was administered alone (12).   A participant

Page [ADDRESS_484641] these data has been 
trained to prevent falling.  The risk of a fracture secondary to a fall during the 
walking tests is less than 1 in 7,000.
Risks associated with ankle brachial index (ABI) measurement.  The ABI 
measurement consists of measuring systolic blood pressure in each extremity 
using a hand-held Doppler.  The ABI is non-invasive, safe and does not have any 
known lasting side effects.  During the ABI test, participants may experience 
discomfort from the inflated blood pressure cuff.  However, this discomfort 
resolves immediately when the cuff is released.
Risks associated with blood draws.  The potential risks of drawing blood 
include a bruise at the site of vein puncture, inflammation of the vein, and 
infection.  Participants may experience lightheadedness or dizziness or fainting 
after injections. Care will be taken to avoid these complications.  
Risks associated with holding medications for study testing.  Participants may 
be asked to take their medications in the evening rather than in the morning on the 
day of study drug injections.  This change in medication dosing may result in 
higher levels of blood pressure during the day with potentially adverse 
consequences, including increased risk of stroke or need for evaluation in the 
Emergency Department.  However, participants will be carefully monitored for 
their blood pressure level throughout the day.  
Risks associated with questionnaire administration.  Participation includes a 
risk of loss of confidentiality regarding personal health information.  However, all 
research staff has undergone formal human subjects training.  They are trained to 
protect the privacy of research subject participants.   
In addition, administration of unacylated ghrelin may have risks to the subjects 
that are currently unforeseeable.

 (9,10).   The number of older people with PAD is expected to increase as 
the U.S. population lives to older ages and survives longer with chronic disease.  
Our prior work and that of others shows that patients with PAD have greater 
functional impairment, increased rates of functional decline, and increased 
mobility loss compared to persons without PAD (15,18-24).  Recent evidence 
shows that chronic disability, such as that associated with PAD, accounts for more 
than half of [LOCATION_002] health burden (28). Furthermore, therapeutic advances 
have not kept pace with the growing burden of disability from chronic disease

Participants will receive results of their ankle brachial index (ABI) test results 
immediately after this testing is completed.  They will be provided with a “result 
letter” at the end of their baseline visit.  They will not be provided with other 
study results, because these results are not clinically relevant at this time (i.e. 
levels of unacylated ghrelin are not clinically relevant.  Short term changes in 
brachial artery FMD are not clinically relevant, and the clinical significance of 
short term changes in measures of oxidative stress are unclear).

2. BACKGROUND AND SCIENTIFIC  RATIONALE  
There are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus disease (COVID -19), 
which is caused by [CONTACT_129721][INVESTIGATOR_7531] 2 (SARS -CoV -2). 
Human convalescent plasma has been successfully used for prevention and treatment of 
other infections and thus may provide an option for treatment of COVID -[ADDRESS_146487] to treat certain infectious diseases prior to 
the development  of antimicrobial  therapy  in the 1940s1, 2. Experience  from  prior  outbreaks 
with other coronaviruses, such as SARS -CoV -1 shows that convalescent plasma contains 
neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus3. In the case of SARS -CoV -2, the anticipated 
mechanism of action by [CONTACT_129722]. However, other mechanisms may be possible, such as antibody dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocyt osis. Convalescent serum was also used in the [ADDRESS_146488] be 
administered.  When  given  to a susceptible  person,  this antibody  will circulate  in the blood, 
reach tissues and provide viral neutralization. Depending on the antibody amount  and 
Version 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -[ADDRESS_146489] study involved the treatment of 80 patients in Hong 
Kong with SARS7. Patients treated before day 14 had improved prognosis defined by 
[CONTACT_129723][INVESTIGATOR_129648]  22, consistent with the notion that earlier 
administration is more likely to be effective. In addition, those who were PCR positive 
and seronegative for coronavirus at the time of therapy had improved prognosis. The case 
fatality rate was 12% (n=80) with convalescent plasma and 17% (n=1755) without 
convalescent plasma in historic controls*. There is also some anecdotal information on 
the use of convalescent plasma in seriously ill individuals. Three patients with SARS in 
Taiwan were treated with [ADDRESS_146490] high titers of neutralizing 
antibody10. Consistent with this point, an analysis of 99 samples of convalescent sera 
from patients with MERS  showed that 87 had neutralizing antibody with a geometric 
mean titer of 1:61. This suggests that antibody declines with time and/or that few patients 
make high titer  responses.  
 
With Polio in the 1950s gamma globulin provided 80% protection from acquiring polio 
virus for 5 weeks11. In Argentine hemorrhagic fever the Case fatality rate was 1% (n=91) 
with convalescent plasma and 16% (n=97) without convalescent plasma12. During the 
Spanish flu 1918 pandemic the case fatality rate was 16% (n=336) with convalescent 
plasma and 37% (n=1219) without convalescent plasma13. For the H1N1 influenza in 
2009 the severe disease case fatality rate was 20% (n=20) with convalescent plasma and 
54% (n =73) without convalescent plasma14. 
It is also possible that other types of non -neutralizing antibodies are made that contribute 
to protection and recovery as described for other viral diseases15, 16. There are reports that 
convalescent plasma was used for  therapy of patients with COVID -19 in China during the 
current outbreak ( http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020 -02/28/c_138828177.htm).  
Although few details are available from t he Chinese experience and published studies 
involved small numbers of patients, the available information suggests that convalescent 
plasma administration reduces viral load and was safe.  
2.[ADDRESS_146491] responders, in combination with the high mortality of COVID -19, 
particularly in elderly and vulnerable persons, strongly argue that the benefits of

convalescent serum outweigh its possible risks in high risk exposed individuals and/or 
those with early disease. However, for all cases where convalescent plasma 
administration is consi dered, a risk -benefit assessment must be conducted to assess 
individual variables.  
The theoretical risk involves the phenomenon of antibody -mediated enhancement of 
infection (ADE). ADE can occur for several viral diseases and involves an enhancement 
of dis ease in the presence of certain antibodies. For coronaviruses, several mechanisms 
for ADE have been described and there is the theoretical concern that antibodies to one 
type of coronavirus could enhance infection to another viral strain17. It may be possi ble to 
predict the risk of ADE of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_146492] the same virus, SARS2 - 
CoV-2, ADE may be unlikely. The available evidence from the use of convalescent 
plasma in patients with SARS -COV -1 and MERS18, and anecdotal evidence of its use in 
patients with COVID -19 (http://www.x inhuanet.com/english/2020 - 
02/28/c_138828177.htm), suggest it is safe. Nevertheless, caution and vigilance will be 
required in for any evidence of enhanced infection.  
Another theoretical risk is that antibody administration to those exposed to SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_146493], there is a very small risk of 
allergy/anaphylaxis, transfusion related acute lung injur y (TRALI), transfusion associated 
circulatory overload (TACO), passive transfer of potential unknown infectious agents or 
infections, or accidental receipt of an incompatible blood product. Most adverse effects 
are mild and transient including headaches, f lushing, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, 
diarrhea, blood pressure changes and tachycardia. Late adverse events are rare and 
include acute renal failure and thromboembolic events.  
2.3 Known Potential  Benefits  
A potential benefit is societal: If the time to viral clearance is faster, the risk of further 
transmission (R naught) might be reduced and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_129649]. Convalescent plasma 
can be administered to those with clinical disease in an effort to reduce t heir symptoms 
and mortality. Based on the historical experience with antibody administration, it can be

be contact[CONTACT_38435]. CCDA r esults may be used to send MyChart (or 
equivalent EHR -based communication) notifications to adult persons matching CCDA 
search criteria. Participants may also be recruited via other EHR systems (ex. CRISP) as 
per IRB approved IRB Waiver of HIPAA Privacy Au thorization (Form 4). Participating 
study sites may use similar EHR -based recruitment methods in compliance with local 
regulations and practices regarding use and deployment as established by [CONTACT_129729] . Recruitment letters, sample text, and other materials will all be approved by

Direct Physician Referral  
To reach additional COVID -19 positive patients who may be tested at community testing 
centers (ex. VEIP stations, pharmacy parking lots, Urgent Care centers, etc) and not h ave 
available test results in EHR system, we plan to reach out to referring physicians directly 
to request that they share study information with their patients. We have created “Dear 
Doctor” letters which describe the study and will accompany study flyers  or brochures.  
These materials will be emailed to local physicians who treat or refer patients for 
COVID -19 testing (ex. Primary care physicians, internists, pulmonologists, ENTs, 
geriatric specialists, etc) with a request to share forward the information to any patients 
who may be interested in and eligible for the study. Participating study sites will be

Social and Community Network Recruitment  
Social Media outreach, such as Facebook, Twitter, CraigsList, etc., in our experience has 
proven to be an effective method of research recruitment. We propose several different 
iterations of a social media posting a nd/or paid ad, including photographs. Our social 
media outreach will include, but not be limited to Facebook and Twitter. A script has 
been developed for the videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_129652]. David Sullivan describing the study; the video

to be considered in the future. All such media adv ertisements will be approved by [CONTACT_129732]/or Communications 
team to ensure compliance with institutional  guidelines.  
Survey  
To supplement the need for a call center, yet capture participant contact [CONTACT_129733], we are utilizing a HIPAA -compliant survey tool . The 
survey link will appear on our web page: www.CovidPlasmaTrial.org.  Survey text is 
included in the IRB application. In addition to participant contact [CONTACT_3031], the survey 
solicits basic COVID -[ADDRESS_146510] of participating study sites and their addresses, so that the participant may choose at

the [LOCATION_002]. Control arm plasma from collections prior to 1 January 2020 will not  
be tested for SARS -CoV -2 antibodies. Plasma collected after December 31, 2019 will be 
confirmed as SARS -CoV -2 seronegative. Fresh frozen plasma is safely stored for more 
than a year. We will secure sources for the ~750 doses necessary study at the outset.  
3.4.4 Rationale for  Dosing  
Dose calculation is based on 1 unit (200 -250 mL) of plasma with anti -SARS -CoV -19 
titers of >1:[ADDRESS_146518] control plasma. For the purposes of the proposed 
trial, we required titers ≥1:320. The current FDA Guidance (Apri l 2020) recommends 
neutralizing antibody titers ≥ 1:160. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_129657] (39/40) 
convalescent donors had titers ≥1:160 (Duan K, et al.medRxiv.  
2020:2020.03.16.20036145). On March 9, 2021 the FDA issued a new EUA for use of 
convalescent p lasma for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129658] 3.5 as well as more than a dozen other tests 
(https:// www.fda.gov/media/141477/download). In Apr il 2021, serial communication 10 (CRMTS 
[ZIP_CODE]). The FDA agreed that the new high titer standard with a EUROIMMUN ratio greater than  
3.[ADDRESS_146519].  
A plasma dose of 200 mLs is 7% of the total plasma volume for a 6 0kg individual with 
titer reduction to about 1:15 after dilution into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  
Study Drug Administration  
 Plasma will be administered within 24 hours of  enrollment.  
 Transfusions will be performed by [CONTACT_3784]/skilled personnel in settings equipped to 
handle potential complications of transfusion. We have planned to administer 
transfusion of convalescent plasma in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129659].  
 Transfusion ra te  500 mL/hour  
 Medicines  to minimize  mild transfusion  reactions  during  occurrence  (e.g. 
acetaminophen, diphenhydramine) may be given at the discretion of the  investigator.  
 If an AE develops during transfusion, the transfusion may be slowed or stopped as  per

investigator’s decision.  
 Management of transfusion -associated AE will follow AABB guidelines; anything 
more than a simple allergic transfusion reaction, the transfusion will be discontinued 
and investigated appropriately (i.e. per standa rd practice  guidelines).  
 
 
4. STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
4.1 Sample Size and Power  Considerations  
The planned sample size for the trial is a total of 1344 (1280*1.05 to allow a 5% 
oversample) subjects with a target goal (but not binding) of at least an equal numb er 
among those <65 and ≥ 65 years of age (n=672) or a slight bias towards those ≥65 years 
of age (no more than 40%:60% ratio), randomized in a 1:1 ratio to HCIP vs SARS -CoV -2 
non-immune control plasma.  
To evaluate the power of the study, the following assu mptions were made:  
1. The primary analysis will compare the efficacy of convalescent plasma in reducing 
the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . We assume a one -sided Type I error rate (alpha) of 0.05 as 
we are interested in superiority and Type II error rate (beta) of 0.2. We also present  in 
Table 1 below the sample size needed under 90%  power.  
2. We assumed that the probability of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129660] <65 years of age is 0.15 
and for those ≥65 years of age is 0.30 (data from CDC MMWR21). We then allowed 
the sample to be equally weighted among young to old (i.e., 50:50) as well as 40:60, 
30:70, and 20:80. Therefore, we weighted the age specific risk for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129661] a. We want to 
ensure that there are both younger and older individuals represented in the trial so we 
can assess effect heterogeneity by [CONTACT_129737] a tertiary  objective.  
3. It is anticipated that very few of these subjects will be randomized and not st art study 
plasma transfusion (and so be excluded from the primary analysis) or be lost to 
follow -up prior to resolution of symptoms (and so have missing data for the primary 
endpoint).  
4. Furthermore, we assume that the treatment effect of HCIP will be a redu ction in risk 
between 15% and 60%. To estimate the sample size, we used the weighted age 
stratified risks and assumed this risk was by [CONTACT_4475] 15 (such that the cumulative 
incidence for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129662]) for the controls and the treated group was the control risk reduced 
between 15 to 75%. Using these assumptions and data, we used an exponential  model 
to identify the lambda parameter and the package ‘powerSurvEpi’ for the R statistical 
software was  then used to calculate the sample sizes for these  scenarios.  
5. In Table 1 below, we provide the total sample size according to three of the 
recruitment ratios of <65:≥65 years of age, 80 or 90% power, and three effect sizes of 
25%, 30% and 35% as percent re duction in the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. In Figure 1 
below we provide under 80% power, the sample sizes needed to detect the treatment 
effect between 15 and 60% reduction in risk and according to different age 
recruitment ratios. In table 2 with inclusion o f 268 (~300) subjects with a target of a 
minimum ratio of 50:50 for <65:≥[ADDRESS_146520] a  50% 
Version 10.0

20  
  
reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129663] 80% power. This is a 20% hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129664] 10% in convalescent plasma  treated. If the effect size in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129665] 
40% than a sample size of 455 will be needed. An overall reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129666] 20% to 10% necessitates a sample size of 268 with 80% power. 85 subjects will 
be the sample size for a red uction rate from 20% to 5%.  
 
6. Therefore, with a sample size of 1344 (1280*1.05 to allow for potential losses) with a 
target of a minimum ratio of 50:50 for <65:≥[ADDRESS_146521] a 25% reduction in the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129667] 80% power and a 30% 
reduction in rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] 90% power. From the curve in Figure 1, an 
overall reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129668] 20% to 10% necessitates a sample size of 268 
with 80% power. Eighty -five subjects will be the sample size fo r a reduction rate 
from 20% to  5%.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of AE  Data  
All subjects who received any amount of study drug will be included in the safety 
population. A summary of all adverse events that were reported will be presented by 
[CONTACT_10607]® (MedDRA®-version 23.0 or higher, March 
2020) coded (System Organ Class and Preferred Term) by [CONTACT_49241]. There will be 
one report by [CONTACT_129739]. Relationship to 
study treatment, action taken, event, and event ou tcome will be summarized within and 
across dosing groups. AE will be compared between randomized arms using Fisher’s 
Exact Test.  
Serious adverse events will be described in narratives that include subject demographics, 
treatment date, event, date of onset,  relationship to study treatment and the descriptions of 
actions and outcomes during the event. Any deaths occurring in the study will be 
summarized in narrative with the demographics, treatment duration, cause of death, date 
of death and additional inform ation surrounding that serious adverse event. Deaths, 
SAEs, and events resulting in study discontinuation will also be  tabulated.  
Safety laboratory data will be transformed prior to analysis as defined in the SAP. 
Summaries and changes from baseline will b e presented for each evaluation time point. 
Changes from baseline will also be presented using shift tables for selected laboratory 
parameters.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Final Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP)  
A final SAP for the analysis and presentation of data from this study will  be prepared 
before database lock. The following is an overview of planned analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of Planned  Analyses  
Primary endpoint: Our primary hypothesis is that by [CONTACT_129740] -SARS -CoV -2 
plasma, the cumulative incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129673] 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -[ADDRESS_146528] estimator based upon targeted minimum 
loss based estimator as described by [CONTACT_129741] (2019). Results of the analysis for the 
primary endpoint will be presented both as una djusted (crude) and adjusted for 
covariates. By [CONTACT_129742], we 
increase precision. This TMLE based approach was shown to increase precision by 
[CONTACT_129743] 10% to 20% over an inverse probability weighted or augmented inverse 
probability weighted estimator [Diaz  2019].  
Variables chosen for adjustment are specifically for increasing precision in estimates of 
treatment efficacy and thus must be predictive of disease outcome [Diaz et al, Lifetime 
Data Anal (2019) :25]. To identify the adjustment variables, we will utilize a hybrid 
approach of pre -specifying some variables and using an algorithmic approach to identify 
variables to adjust for among pre -specified candidate variables. Variables that we are near 
certain  to be predictive of outcome will be adjusted for. Age has been consistently related 
to worse outcomes for COVID -19 and therefore will be included in analyses for 
adjustment. Other pre -specified variables that will be candidates for inclusion in primary 
analysis will be determined via an algorithmic approach and these variables will include: 
clinical site, race, ethnicity, sex, category of exposure, hematology factors and other 
laboratory markers (i.e., CBC and metabolic panels), body mass index, ABO blood 
group, targeted physical exam, time between SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_146529] specifically been associated with worse COVID -19 
outcomes including: asthma, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease (COPD, 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis), diabetes, hemoglobin disorders 
(thalassemia, sick le cell disease), immunocompromised (cancer, HIV, organ 
transplantation, prolonged use of corticosteroids), chronic liver disease, hypertension, and 
serious heart conditions (heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, 
pulmonary hypertension) , smoking status, dementia, down syndrome, pregnancy, 
stroke/cerebrovascular disease, and substance use disorder [updated to reflect CDC 
website revised on 5/4/2021 and Guan et al Eur Respir J. 2020 May;  55(5)].  
To determine which of these pre -specified ca ndidate variables to be included, we will 
conduct variable selection by [CONTACT_129744] (i.e., not 
including an indicator term for treatment arm) and blinded to treatment allocation. The 
variable importance and 95% confidence in tervals [Ishwaran et al Statistics in Medicine. 
2019;38] shall be used to identify predictive variables for the outcome and included in 
analytical models. Specifically, variables in which the 95% CI for the variable 
importance from the random forest does n ot contain [ADDRESS_146530] correlation with the ou tcome in order to maximize precision. This hybrid approach

24  
  
will be done on the full sample and not include the treatment arm (i.e., among entire 
sample without controlling for convalescent or control plasma) in order to identify the 
prognostic baseline variables for entire sample.  
 
Intention -to-Treat Approach. All analyses will be conducted with a modified intention - 
to-treat approach, which excludes randomized subjects who do not initiate infusion 
transfusion of the study plasma. Furthermore, because this is essentially non -adherence to 
the randomization process, we will use inverse probability of selection weights to account 
for the individuals who do not initiate the treatment to which they were randomized26-28. 
Finally, statistical inference will use a one -sided Type 1 error rate of 0.05 and 95% 
confidence inter vals (see below under section 8.[ADDRESS_146531] of 
interim analyses).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Anti -SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_146532] these distributions. Therefore, we will use quantile regression in order to 
describe whether there  is a shift or change in the titer distribution between randomized 
arms 29. Quantile regression does not require the assumption of a parametric or any other 
type of distribution as it identifies the titer at each percentile (e.g., what is the 10th, the 
15th, …, 50th [the median], …, 90th percentiles of anti -SARS -CoV -2 titers). Given that 
this is a repeated measurement at days -1 or0, 14 and 28, we will account for the 
correlation within individuals using a cluster bootstrap in order to properly estimate the  p- 
value and 95% confidence  intervals.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analysis of rates and duration of SARS -CoV -2 PCR Positivity 
Analysis of the rate and duration of SARS -CoV -2 PCR positivity between the  
randomized arms will primarily be descriptive examining proportion posit ive at days ( -1 
or 0), 14,[ADDRESS_146533] day that an individual becomes negative is not 
known since SARS -CoV -2 PCR positivity will only b e acquired at days ( -1 or 0), [ADDRESS_146534] negative at day 3 after positive on day 1, 
then we know that this individual became negative between day 1 and 3. Across all 
individuals we can describe the duration of positivity either using a non -parametric  
Version 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -[ADDRESS_146535] model, we will use Akaike’s 
Information Criterion (AIC ) to choose the best model fit. However, if the sample that 
becomes positive is really small, then we will only be able to describe the observations 
without a formal statistical model.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of SARS -CoV -2 RNA  levels  
Similar to the secondary aim of comparing the anti -SARS -CoV -2 antibody titers, the goal 
of this secondary aim is to describe the distribution of SARS -CoV -2 RNA between 
randomized arms. Therefore, we will use the same approach as above of applying 
quantile  regression.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis of Disease  Severity  
A secondary hypothesis is that individuals receiving anti -SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_146536] less disease severity than control. Our primary endpoint 
examines time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], for this we will  examine our clinical event scale for 
disease severity at the 28th day visit (allowing for visit window). The event scale is:  
1. Death  
2. Requiring mechanical ventilation and/or in  ICU 
3. non-ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requiring supplemental  oxygen;  
4. non-ICU hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], not requiring supplemental oxygen 
or 
a stay of >24 hours for observation in an ED, field hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or other healthcare unit* 
or 
any receipt of O2 for >24 hours, outside of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]*  
5. Not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], but with clinical and laborator y evidence1 of COVID -19 infection 
(symptomatic  infection)  
The analysis for this will the doubly robust estimator that will be used is that as outlined by 
[CONTACT_129745]. (2020) based upon a non -parametric extension of the log -odds ratio by [CONTACT_129741]. 
(2016).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rate of Participant Reported Secondary Infection of  Housemates  
Participants will be assessed for the number of individuals that live in the same house as 
well as by [CONTACT_129746] -up the number of individuals that became sick during their 
convalescence. Therefore, in order to estimate whether anti -SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_146537] on secondary infections, we will use a binomial model in which each individual 
living in the house is a Bernoulli trial. We will account for clustering by [CONTACT_129747].

Participants will self -assess their oxygen saturation levels using home pulse oximetry, 
when available. Therefore, we will compare the oxygen saturation levels between 
treatment arms during follow -up using quantile regression similar to above analyses.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Time to Resolution of COVID -[ADDRESS_146538] -acute sequelae of SARS -CoV -2. Our 
approach will be to estimate the cumulative incidence using a non -parame tric estimator 
for competing risks (i.e., Aalen - Johansen estimator) stratified by [CONTACT_129748]. In order to increase power in a clinical trial, we will adjust for baseline 
covariates that are related to the outcome using inverse proba bility of treatment 
weights25, 23. Furthermore, we will also estimate a parametric survival model for 
competing risk settings which will also increase efficiency. Specifically, we will use a 
parametric mixture model34, 35, 30. Because a parametric model as sumes a specific 
distribution which may not always be an appropriate assumption, we will use a flexible 
distribution. Specifically, specifically a flexible Weibull parametric model that allows 
for a variety of curvature to the hazard function and thus redu ce the required 
distributional assumptions for parametric time -to-event models will be used25. 
Furthermore, we will allow for interaction between covariates and time to allow for 
non-proportionality. The factors that we will adjust for are those that likely to 
contribute to development of infection such as age, being immunocompromised, and 
presence of additional comorbidities. In order to check the fit of the parametric model, 
we will graphically assess the parametric cumulative incidence curves to that of the 
non-parametric estimator. If a good fit is not achieved, we will add additional splines to 
the flexible Weibull parametric model and/or modify the interaction between covariates 
and time to allow for additional flexibility in the model over follow -up time. The 
current recommendation for competing risk data is to estimate both the cause - specific

[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessing for the Potential Treatment Effect Heterogeneity by  [CONTACT_129749]. The trial will be recruiting

Individuals may receive convalescent plasma through the National Expanded Access or 
other IND programs occurs after randomization. While this does not lead to confounding, 
analyses that are affected by [CONTACT_11384] (i.e., secondary efficacy endpoints) may be biase d due  to 
the potential of selection bias if we try to analyze the data as per -protocol. The intention 
to treat analysis is not biased but no longer truly reflect the efficacy that was originally 
envisioned in a hypothetical perfect trial. Essentially, thes e individuals are not adhering 
to the protocol for the treatment arm they were randomized to. In order to deal with this 
and estimate a per -protocol effect, we can artificially censor these individuals when they 
deviate from the protocol of the single tran sfusion at baseline that they were randomized 
to. In order to mitigate the selection bias that censoring these individuals when they 
receive convalescent plasma in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129677], we will use inverse 
probability censoring weights, which allows  for informative  censoring.

and 90.  
 
Upon recruitment of 20 donors, we will measure the viral growth  
inhibition titers  of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing antibodies compared to the current 
FDA benchmark neutralizing titer of 1:8160. However, the ability to detect 
neutralizing antibodies for SARS -CoV -2 through true viral neutralization in 
culture is time consuming. Other approache s include in -house ELISA tests for the 
receptor binding subdomain on the external spi[INVESTIGATOR_129690], which 
correlate with viral culture neutralization in previous coronavirus work. Finally, 
there are an increasing number of non -FDA validated, comme rcial ELISA tests 
with the entire spi[INVESTIGATOR_129691]. The 
viral specificity of these commercial ELISA assays for antibodies to the more 
frequent common cold beta coronavirus like OC43 or the rare SARS -CoV -1 as 
well as sensitivity for SARS -CoV -2 antibodies is evolving in the ongoing 
pandemic. Therefore, we will compare the SARS -CoV -2 donor plasma 
neutralizing titer levels to the whole protein commercial ELISAs being adopted 
by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_129692] d omain ELISAs. The goal will be to 
accurately determine the correlation of serum antibody titers measured by [CONTACT_129759] -CoV -2 live 
virus.

Evaluations and  Schedules  
1.2 Definitions  
Adverse  Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation 
subject who has received a study intervention and that does not necessarily have to have  a 
causal relationship with the study product. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or not 
considered related to the study  product.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
1. An SAE is any adverse eve nt that results in any of the following  outcomes:  
2. Death;  
3. Life-threatening (immediate risk of  death);  
4. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10909];  
5. Persistent or significant disability or  incapacity;  
6. Congenital anomaly/birth  defect;  
7. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug  abuse.  
8. Unexpected Adverse event: (UAE): An adverse reaction, the nature or severity  of 
which is not consistent with the investigator’s  brochure.

Serious and Unexpected S uspected Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)  
Investigators should report S[LOCATION_003]Rs to Johns Hopkins University within 5 
calendar days. Johns Hopkins will submit the S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the FDA within 15 
calendar days. Fatal or life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs should be reported to Johns 
Hopkins as soon as possible and no later than 3 calendar days. Fatal or life - 
threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported to the FDA within 7 calendar days.  
An expedited IND safety report will be used to notify the FDA IND division of 
each serious unexpected suspec ted adverse reactions according to FDA 
regulations, part 312 and Guidance for Industry and Investigators: Safety 
Reporting Requirements for INDS and BA/BE Studies effective March 28, 2011. 
In accordance with these regulations, this protocol has a pre -speci fied monitoring 
plan for determining if subjects receiving the intervention are at higher risk for 
mortality and will only report a death as an expedited IND safety report if there is 
evidence of a causal relationship between the intervention and/or the st udy drug 
and the event resulting in death. In addition, an expedited IND safety report will 
be used to notify the FDA if there is an imbalance between the arms suggesting 
there is a reasonable possibility that the intervention or the control caused any of 
the pre -specified safety endpoints. Otherwise, the occurrence of these safety 
endpoints will be reported on an annual basis.  
Written IND Safety reports will include an Analysis of Similar Events in 
accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32. All safety rep orts previously filed 
by [CONTACT_129762], similar reports 
commented on.  
Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events will be submitted to 
the FDA, the JHM sIRB, and all participating investigators for local IRB review 
within [ADDRESS_146555] learning of the event.  
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
Unanticipated Problem that is not an Adverse Event (e.g. breaches of 
confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted -for study 
drug.  
Protocol Deviation  
Deviation from the IRB -approved study procedures. Designated major and minor:  
1. Major Protocol Deviation: Protocol deviation that compromises trial integrity 
and/or the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or  others  
2. Minor Protocol Deviation: Other protocol  deviation

Documentation of AEs. All AEs a nd SAEs will be documented on the CRF from 
time of signing of the informed consent form. All AEs and SAEs will be followed 
until resolution even if this extends beyond the study -reporting period. Resolution 
of an adverse event is defined as the return to p re-treatment status or stabilization 
of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
Investigator’s Assessment of Adverse Events . The determination of seriousness, 
severity, and causality will be made by [CONTACT_63689] -site investigator who is qu alified 
(licensed) to diagnose adverse event information, provide a medical evaluation of 
adverse events, and classify adverse events based upon medical judgment. This 
includes but is not limited to physicians, physician assistants, and nurse 
practitioners . 
Laboratory Abnormalities. Laboratory abnormalities will be reported as AEs if 
they are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  
Assessment of Seriousness  
Event seriousness will be determined according to the protocol definition of an 
SAE  
Assessment of Severity  
Event severity will be assigned according to the MedDRA parameters in the EDC, 
which correspond to the following definitions:  
1  = Mild:  Transient  or mild discomfort  (<48  hours);  no medical 
intervention/therapy  required.)  
2 = Moderat e: Mild to moderate limitation in activity -some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required)  
3 = Severe:  Marked  limitation  in activity,  some  assistance  usually  required;  medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129695]  
4 = Life -threatening: Extreme limitation in activity, some assistance usually 
required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129696]  
5= Death  
Assessment of Association . 
Is the event related to investigational treatment categories to be used for this study are:  
 Not related  
 Unlikely  
 Possible  
 Probable  
 Definite  
The investigator must provide an assessment of association or relationship of AEs 
to the study product based on:  
 Temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study  product;  
 Whether an alternative etiology has been  identified;  
 Biological  plausibility;  
 Existing therapy and/or concomitant  medications.

7.2 Study  Monitoring  
As per ICH -GCP 5.18 and FDA 21 CFR 312.50, clinical protocols are required to be 
adequately monitored by [CONTACT_4530]. Research monitors will be managed by:  
[CONTACT_129764]: Steven W. Mayo, PD, CCRA, PMP  
[ADDRESS_146559], Suite 160C -1020 
Austin, TX [ZIP_CODE]  
 
Research monitors will verify that:  
1. There is documentation of the informed consent process and signed informed consent 
documents for each  subject  
2. There is compliance with recording requirements for dat a points  
3. All SAEs narratives are reported as  required  
4. Individual subjects’ study records and source documents  align  
5. Investigators are in compliance with the  protocol.  
6. Regulatory requirements as per Office for Human Research  Protections -OHRP), 
FDA, and applicable guidelines (ICH -GCP) are being  followed.  
7.[ADDRESS_146560] safety is at risk of being compromised:  
1. Unexpected death of a dosed subject in relation to  transfusion  
2. An overall pattern of symptomatic, clinical, or laboratory events that the medical 
monitor, DSMB consider associated with study product and that collectively may 
represent a serious potential concern for  safety.  
Furthermore, given that ADE may be an issue with convalescent antibody treatment, out 
of an abundance of caution we will monitor the number of subjects in each trial arm that 
progresses to death. Given that we plan to recruit 300 participants in each arm and with 
the following assumptions 1) 18% in the HCIP treatment arm are expected to progress to  
Version 10.0

40  
  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and 2) 1.4% of these enrolled individuals progress to death, the 
probability of observing one death in either arm is likely (Table 3). We will monitor the 
number of subjects  that die and thoroughly evaluate whether each death is likely due to 
anti-SARS -CoV -2 plasma (definite, probable, possible, or unlikely). These data will be 
presented to the masked DSMB so that they may objectively evaluate and determine 
whether they would  like to be unmasked. It is likely if more than 3 deaths occur in 
intervention arm that the DSMB would need to consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_129701] 3 deaths would be highly unlikely (Table 4). There will be two planned 
formal reviews of th e safety data after approximately [ADDRESS_146561] one death  among  each  treatment  arm

7.4 Special considerations for  ARDS  
Given that ARDS is a significant potential consequence of COVID -19 and potentially a 
sign of ADE, we will monitor participants for development of ARDS as a medical 
consequence of concern by [CONTACT_129766] -SARS -CoV -2 plasma. Given that we plan to recruit 300 participants in 
each arm and with the following assumptions 1) 18% progress to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129702], 2) 10.8% progress to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129703] (a 40% reduction 
in risk), and 3) in an abundance of caution as a worst case scenario we will assume that 
40% of ADE will progress to ARDS (in Wuhan the reported frequency of ARDS was 
3.4% for all subjects and 40% among the group reaching the composite endpoint of ICU 
admis sion, ventilation or death). Under this scenario of assumed maximum severity, we 
are likely to see at least one case in both treatment arms (Table 5). Specifically, we  would 
expect six participants in the control and two participants in the treatment arm t o develop 
ARDS (table 6). After at least 50% of trial participants have 28 day follow -up, the 
number of subjects that progress to this stage will be presented to the masked DSMB and 
formally asked whether they (1) see a clinically meaningful difference bet ween trial arms 
that trigger an unmasking of the DSMB and (2) if so, do they require a formal interim 
analysis. At any point should the DSMB ask to be unmasked and require a formal interim 
analysis for safety, we will examine the difference in treatment ar ms for development of 
ARDS. This interim analysis will adjust for factors related to worsening of COVID -[ADDRESS_146562] -case scenario  of 40 and 50%  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129704]

Upon completion of this review, the DSMB will determine if study entry or study dosing 
should be interrupted or if study entry and study dosing may continue according to the 
protocol. Should the trial not be stopped at this time point, the final analysis w ould need 
to account the number of interim analyses that were conducted. Therefore, we would 
spend some of our alpha level with each interim analysis.  
 
7.5 Planned Interim  Analysis  
7.5.1 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_129705] a formal efficacy evaluation will occur for efficacy and futility 
once 40% of the [ADDRESS_146564] accumulated. We use a non -binding Hwang - 
Shih-DeCani spending function with gamma= -4, which approximates the O’Brien - 
Flemmin g boundaries,  for both upper  and lower  bounds.  This results  in an interim  analysis 
Z-value boundary of 2.68 (nominal p=0.0037, spent alpha=0.0037) for the upper bound 
and -0.59 (p=0.277,  spent  beta=0.0148)  for the lower.  For final analysis  the Z-value  is 1.66 
(p=0.049,  spent  alpha=0.0463,  spent  beta=0.1852)  for a one-sided  test with Type  [ADDRESS_146565] with Type  1 of 0.025,  the Z-value  boundaries  would  be interim: 
2.90; final: 1.98 for the upper bounds and interim: -0.39; final: 1.[ADDRESS_146566] size to be detected (the detectable 
reduction in the primary outcome in the active study arm relative to the control arm). The 
DSMB will be unmasked for analyses but keepi[INVESTIGATOR_129706]. This interim analysis will adjust for factors related to mortality including age and 
presence of cardiopulmonary  comorbidities.  
 
7.6         Rules for Halting Plasma Transfusion

Transfusion of plasma will be halted, and will not be restarted, if any of the following 
manifestations of anaphylaxis develop:  
 Skin or mucous membrane manifestations: hives, pruritus, flushing , swollen lips, 
tongue or  uvula  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798]: dyspnea, wheezing, stridor,  hypoxemia  
 A decrease in systolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or >30% decrease from  baseline 
or a diastolic drop of >30% from  baseline.  
 Tachycardia with an increase in resti ng heart rate to > 130bpm; or bradycardia <40 
that is associated with dizziness, nausea or feeling  faint.  
 Syncope  
 Confusion  
 Any other symptom or sign which in the good clinical judgment of the study  clinician 
or supervising physician warrants halting the transfusion. For example, the rapid 
onset of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps, 
for instance, may be manifestations of anaphylaxis and may warrant an immediate 
halt prior to meeting full SAE  criteria  
 
 
8. ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
8.[ADDRESS_146567] of clinical research involving human subjects are met. The information provided 
in this section relates to all JHU sites participating in this research  study  
As the Department of Health and Human Services continues to strengthen procedures for 
human subjects’ protections via new regulations, JHU will review these evolving 
standards in relation to the proposed activities and will advise the investigators on those 
that may apply.  
In addition, JHU has a Federal wide Assurance (FWA) n umber on file with the Office for 
Human Research Protections (OHRP). The FWA number for JHU is FWA00005834.  
This assurance commits a research facility to conduct all human subjects’ research in 
accordance with the ethical principles in The Belmont Report a nd any other ethical 
standards recognized by [CONTACT_114810]. Finally, per OHRP regulations, the research facility will 
ensure that the mandatory renewal of this assurance occurs at the times specified in the 
regulations.  
 
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_146568]  
The JHU IRB will review this protocol and all protocol -related documents and  
Version 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -[ADDRESS_146569] enrollment. The 
JHU IRB currently holds and will maintain a US FWA issued by [CONTACT_129767].  
8.3 Informed Consent  Process  
The informed consent process will be initiated before a volunteer agrees to participate in 
the study and should continue throughout the individual’s study participation.  Participants 
in this trial are initially u nder investigation for SARS -CoV -2 infection, necessitating 
remote consent. Therefore, for we will follow the IRB’s guidance as issued in the 
document “Informed Consent for Human Subjects Research at Johns Hopkins during the 
COVID -19 Emergency.”  Following administration of the Telephone Pre -Screening 
Script and determination that the caller is a study participant, the research coordinator 
will send the written consent form to the participant via email or text for their  review.  
Participants without email or text capabilities will be sent a hard copy of the written 
consent form via US Postal Service.  
After the participant has had a chance to review the written informed consent, the IRB - 
approved consent designee and the participant will participate in the cons ent process 
remotely via phone or other video communication platform. A witness from the JH 
Witness Pool will be used to witness the entire consent process. When available, both the 
consent designee and the witness will receive remote consent training prov ided through 
the OHSR Compliance Monitoring Program.  
With the permission of the participant, the proceedings will be recorded, if this option is 
available on the video communication platform. All parties will introduce themselves and 
their role in the cons enting process. The consent form is reviewed in detail. The 
participant is next invited to ask any questions and to have them addressed by [CONTACT_123894]. If appropriate, the physician/MLP discusses the studies risks and alternatives per 
the physician/mid -level provider consent policy . The consent will explain that subjects 
may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course  of the trial. Adequate time will 
be provided to ensure that the subject has time to consider and discuss participation in the 
protocol.  
If the participant is interested in joining the research study, the participant will be asked 
to sign the consent docum ent. The signature [CONTACT_129791] [CONTACT_129768] “I agree” to 
participate. The consent designee and witness must verify the participant physically 
signed the consent doc ument by [CONTACT_7053]: by [CONTACT_129769]; or obtaining a photo of the signed consent document; or obtaining verbal 
confirmation from the participant that he/she signed the consent form or agreed to 
participate electronically.  
 
 
To reduce the risk of transmission, the hard -copy consent by [CONTACT_129770]’s space. A separate copy of the informed consent 
form will be used to secure the following: the signature [CONTACT_129792],  
Version 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -004 
45  
  
the signature [CONTACT_129793]/MLP (“mid -level provider”) on the appropriate 
signature [CONTACT_129794] -[ADDRESS_146570] retain the completed consent document in its entirety (i.e., all pages 
of the consent form) in the study record or participant binder.  
Consenting a LAR for decisionally impaired participants  
It is presumed that in most cases, due to visitor restrictions or the potential for the LAR to 
be in self -quarantine, the LAR will not be physically present to participate in the consent 
process and t his process will occur remotely. As with participants, the LAR must be 
provided with a copy of the IRB -approved consent document before the consent process 
begins. An electronic copy of the consent should be provided where possible. In the event 
that this is not possible, the study team must mail a copy of the consent form by [CONTACT_129771].  
After the LAR has had a chance to review the written informed consent, the IRB - 
approved consent designee and the LAR will participate in the consent process remotely 
via phone or other video communication platform. A witness from the JH Witness Pool 
will be used to witness the entire consent process. When available, both the consent 
designee and the witness will receive remote consent training provided through the 
OHSR Compliance Monitoring Program.  
With the permission of the LAR, the proceedings will be r ecorded, if this option is 
available on the video communication platform. All parties will introduce themselves and 
their role in the consenting process. The consent form is reviewed in detail. The LAR is 
next invited to ask any questions and to have them addressed by [CONTACT_3476]. If 
appropriate, the physician/MLP discusses the studies risks and alternatives per the 
physicia n/mid -level provider consent policy . The consent will explain that the LAR may 
withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. Adequate time will be 
provided to ensure that the LAR has time to consider and discuss participation on behalf 
of the participant in the protocol.  
If the LAR affirms, acting on the prospective participant’s behalf, agrees to join the 
study, the LAR will be asked to sign the consent document by [CONTACT_129772]; or if the consent is delivered electronica lly by [CONTACT_129773] “I 
agree” to participate. If the consent document has been provided to the LAR by [CONTACT_129774], the full signed and dated consent form can be 
returned to the study team by [CONTACT_2319], fax, email or by a photo of the entire signed consent 
document. If emailed, the document or photo should be returned electronically to the 
study team through secure electronic means. If the LAR is not able to deliver the signed 
document electronically, research proce dures may be initiated based on the verbal 
attestation of signature [CONTACT_129795].  
The consent designee and witness will verify and document the LAR signed the consent 
document: By [CONTACT_129775]; or obtaining a photo or scanned copy of the  
Version 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -004 
46  
  
signed consent document or obtaining verbal confirmation from the LAR that he/she 
signed the consent form.  
Once the LAR documentation is confirmed the following signatures must be secured: The 
consent designee wi ll sign and date the primary consent document; the physician/MLP 
will sign the physician/MLP consent signature [CONTACT_3264], and the witness will sign the 
COVID -19 witness attestation page. The study team will retain the completed consent 
document in its entirety (i.e., all pages of the consent form) in the study record or 
participant binder.  
Mechanisms for Delivering Informed Consent Electronically.  
Our team may pursue the use of MyChart, as a means to deliver the IRB -approved 
consent document electronically to pr ospective participants or their LARs via MyChart. 
Prospective participants will be asked if they have a MyChart account or be asked to 
establish one in order to access the consent through this platform. The MyChart team 
will assist our team in creating an electronic delivery mechanism for consent that will 
have a built in “agree to participate” component.  
 
Provision of information to participants having a language or hearing impairment and 
non-English speakers will follow IRB recommendations as outlined dur ing the COVID 
pandemic.  
Sites Other than Johns Hopkins  
Remote Consent: Individual sites seeking to use a similar remote consent process to the 
Johns Hopkins clinical site will utilize a plan that complies with FDA guidelines for 
COVID -19 related research and comply with any local procedural guidelines/institut ional 
policies for remote consent.  
Electronic Consent: Sites seeking to use e -consenting will ensure the electronic platform 
used is FDA Part [ADDRESS_146571] party without prior written approval of the 
sponsor. The results of the research study may be published, but subjects’ names or 
identifiers will not be revealed. Records will remain confidential. To maintain 
confidentiality, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_129707] a locked area and results 
of tests coded to preve nt association with subjects’ names. Data entered into 
computerized files will be accessible only by [CONTACT_129776]. Subjects’ records will be available to the FDA, the NIH, the 
manufacturer of the s tudy product and their representatives, investigators at the site

the sample will be the small risk of bruising or fainting associated with phlebotomy 
however  these samples will be taken at the same time as other protocol required samples.  
Human genetic testing may be performed on the samples as per participant choice.  
Five ml of blood samples will be collected at 5 time points (See Schedule of Events). 
Serum w ill be frozen in [ADDRESS_146573] relevant assays or expertise not available to the study 
investigators. The spe cimens would remain linked and at JHU for 5 years. Any use of 
these specimens not specified in the current protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_129777].  
8.6 Data Management and  Monitoring  
8.6.1 Source  Documents  
Source documents for this study will include the subjects’ medical records and study 
record documents. If the investigators maintain separate research records, both the 
medical record and the research records will be considered the source documents for the  
purposes of auditing the study. The investigator will retain a copy of source documents. 
The investigator will permit monitoring and auditing of these data, and will allow the 
sponsor, IRB and regulatory authorities access to the original source documents . The 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that the data collected are complete, accurate, and 
recorded in a timely manner. Source documentation (the point of initial recording of 
information) should support the data collected and entered into the stud y database/case 
report form and must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1024]/or reviewing the 
data. All data submitted should be reviewed by [CONTACT_129778], as appropriate. Data ent ered into the study 
database will be collected directly from subjects during study visits or will be abstracted 
from subjects’ medical records. The subjects’ medical records must record their 
participation in the clinical trial and what medications (with d oses and frequency) or 
other medical interventions or treatments were administered, as well as any AEs 
experienced during the trial.  
8.6.2 Data Management  Plan  
Study data will be collected at the study site(s) and entered into the study database. Data 
entry is t o be completed on an ongoing basis during the study. Anonymized individual  
Version 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -004 
48  
  
participant data (IPD) collected in this study, including data dictionaries, will be made 
available to other researchers after the end of the study.  
 
8.6.3 Data Capture  Methods  
Clinical data will be entered into a 21 CFR 11 -compliant Internet Data Entry System 
(IDES). The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks to 
identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_146574]  Retention  
The site investigator is responsible for retaining all essential documents listed in the ICH 
GCP Guidelines. The FDA requires study records to be retained for up to 2 years after 
marketing approval or disapproval (21 CFR 312.62), or until at leas t [ADDRESS_146575] elapsed 
since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational agent for a 
specific indication. These records are also to be maintained in compliance with IRB/IEC, 
state, and federal medical records retention require ments, whichever is longest. All stored 
records are to be kept confidential to the extent provided by [CONTACT_1032], state, and local law. 
It is the site investigator’s responsibility to retain copi[INVESTIGATOR_129708].  
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the 
sponsor and the Principal Investigator. Should the investigator wish to assign the study 
records to another party and/or move them to another location, the site investigator must 
provide written notification of such intent to sponsor with the name [CONTACT_1059]/or their new location. The 
sponsor must be notified in writing and written permission must b e received by [CONTACT_129779].  
10 COORDINATING CENTER FUNCTIONS AND MULTI -SITE  STUDIES  
10.1. Responsibilities. A Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC) will be responsible for 
overall recruitment and retention, data management, monitoring and communication 
among the enrolling sites, and the general oversight of the conduct of this human  subject 
research project. The CC C for this trial is the Brain Injury Outcomes (BIOS) Center, 
located at [ADDRESS_146576]., Baltimore, MD [ZIP_CODE]. The CCC operates under JHM IRB 
approval # NA_00010432 of which Daniel Hanley, MD, is the Principal  Investigator.  
10.2. IRB Document Management . There i s a plan in place for reviewing site approval 
documents. Two sIRB coordinators oversee the process of reviewing site approval 
documents and consent forms prior to sIRB review. The coordinators collaborate with  the 
JHM IRB and conduct web calls with each en rolling site to promptly and adequately pre - 
review site documents prior to site -specific JHM IRB submissions. The sIRB specialists 
confirm that each participating site has on file an FWA with OHRP. Throughout the 
study, the sIRB specialists and CCC site m anagers will assure that all centers have the 
most current version of the protocol, which will be stored in the electronic trial 
management file (eTMF). Site managers will communicate protocol amendments  to 
Version 10.0  
October 20, 2021 (Date submitted)  
November 4, 2021 (IRB approval date; notified November 9, 2021)  CSSC -[ADDRESS_146577] follow -up. 
10.3. Screening and Enrollment Tracking . Recruitment and retention at the sites will 
be supported by a centrally managed electronic data collection (EDC) system where  data 
will be entered on every screen and enrollment, including reasons for screen failures, 
inclusion and exclusion criteria met, and demographics needed for reporting. The eTMF 
will store any documents involved in the screening and enrollment process. Enrollment 
reports will be generated every two weeks and reported annually as part of the renewal 
process.  
10.4. Reporting Protocol Events and Deviations . A formal Data Management Plan will 
outline the collection and management of data centrally and at the centers. A formal Data 
Safety  Monitoring Plan will describe the process for reporting and evaluating protocol 
events and deviations at the enrolling centers. Site-specific protocol events and  deviations 
will be collected in the EDC. Protocol d eviations will be characterized according to one 
of three types (intentional, identified before they occur, and discovered post occurrence) 
and by [CONTACT_129780]. Corrective and preventive 
action (CAPA) plans will be shared with and responded to by [CONTACT_129781]. Protocol deviation reports will be generated every two to four weeks and reported 
annually as part of the renewal  process.  
 
10.5. Identifying Enrolling Sites . As sites are selected, the CCC will notify the JHM 
IRB, using the template below. Fin al approval will be withheld until the JHM IRB  and 
the OHSR have all required documentation on file. The protocol will be amended, as  a 
change in research, as each site is selected and prior to onboarding the site. Johns 
Hopkins will be an enrolling site. If any problems arise with enrolling sites, IRB 
specialists will communicate with the site contact [CONTACT_129782], if 
necessary.  
10.6 COVID -19 Research Environment - The selected sites will demonstrate protocol 
review and protocol approval from institutional Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129709] (HEIC) or equivalent office in regards to a COVID -19 positive clinic. Physical 
areas in which participants will be se en for consent and/or study visits must be in 
compliance with standards set by [CONTACT_129783]. The HEIC promotes patient safety by 
[CONTACT_129784].  
 
All local sites must supply sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) for their study 
personnel and the study participants. Specific types of required PPE and level of 
protection will be determined by [CONTACT_129785].  
 
All local si tes must inform the CCC of any local restrictions or requirements related to 
COVID -[ADDRESS_146578] by [CONTACT_129786] a case -by-case basis.

Prior to initiation, study sites will provide documentation of:  
1. Local HEIC approval or  equivalent,  
2. Sufficient access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and other resources to 
carry out the protocol to keep both t he subjects and the study personnel  safe, 
3. Policies about local restrictions and requirements on COVID -[ADDRESS_146579] (phone and email)

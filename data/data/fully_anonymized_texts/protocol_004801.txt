2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Follicular lymphoma  
 
Non-Hodgkin ’s lymphomas (NHL) encompass a group  of malignancies of lymphocytes that 
vary in their histologic appearance, aggressiveness and response to therapy.  
According to the American Cancer Society, NHL is the 6th most com mon cancer, with more 
than 50,000 new cases per year. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the 2nd most common type of 
NHL accounting for approximately 20% of newly diagnosed NHL . FL is considered an 
indolent, but incurable lymphoma. The goals of therapy are to treat symptomatic advanced 
stage disease to induce a maximum response with minimal toxicity. The optimal treatment of 
advanced stage follicular lymphoma (FL) remains to be determined. Combination 
chemotherapy is the standard frontline treatment option for this disease and the alkylating 
agent cyclophosphamide has been a common backbone  in these combinations. The most 
common treatments for FL in the [LOCATION_002] are rituxima b combinations with 
chemotherapy such as cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (R -CVP) and 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (R -CHOP). The NCCN 
guidelines also include fludarabine -based regimens , and radioimmunotherapy.  
 
With the addition of immunotherapy (rituximab) to chemotherapy, the overall and complete 
response rates have improved. [1-6] Furthermore, there is suggestive evidence that overall 
survival may be improved.  
 
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 2 Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is also effective as salvage therapy for indolent lymphoma and 
transformed lymphoma. [7-9] In the first -line setting, RIT following chemotherapy can 
increase the CR rate and PFS. [10-12] 
 
2.2  Bendamustine, Rituximab and 90-yttrium(Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_322404] cell lines which are resistant 
to other alkylating agents in pre -clinical experiments in vitro . These properties may be 
explained by a mechanism or  mechanisms of action other than alkylation of DNA, 
possibly contributed by [CONTACT_207028] o f the benzimidazole ring and/or butyrate side chain 
or as a result of enhanced in vivo stability of the alkylating functionality.  
 
Bendamustine has been used in Germa ny for over twenty years for the treatment of  
non-Hodgkin ’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin ’s disease, multiple 
myeloma, and breast cancer. However, the drug has been relatively unknown in the  
[LOCATION_002] until recent publications. [13] 
 
Bendamustine as a single agent for patients who have rituximab -refrac tory non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma has shown efficacy. Friedberg et al . showed an overall response 
rate of 77% ( 15% complete response, 19% unconfirmed complete response , and 43% 
partial  response ).[14] The median duration of response was 6.[ADDRESS_322405] frequent nonhematologic adverse events included nausea , vomiting, fatigue, 
constipation, anorexia, fever, cough, and diarrhea. Grade 3 or 4 reversible hematologic 
toxicities included neutropenia (54%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and anemia (12%). 
Overall, single -agent bendamustine produced durable objective responses with acceptable 
toxicity in heavily pre treated patients with rituximab -refractory indolent NHL.  
 
Several randomized trials have shown that the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy 
results in higher response rates and longer time to progression and event -free survival in 
first-line FL or first relapse.  For example, a randomized study of 8 cycles of 
cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CVP) or R -CVP  showed that the overall 
response rate (OR) and complete response rate (CR) were 81% and 41% in the R -CVP 
arm compared to 57% and 10% in the  CVP only arm, respectively. [5, 6]    Median time to 
treatment failure was [ADDRESS_322406] impro vement in overall survival (OS) in the 
R-CVP arm.  Similarly, the German Low -Grade Lymphoma Study Group (GLGLSG) 
showed in a randomized trial that R -CHOP was superior to CHOP with improved 
response rates (97% vs 90%), and longer time to treatment failure ( not reached vs. 31 
months). [4]  Thus, it is widely accepted that rituximab added to chemotherapy is bett er 
than chemotherapy alone.  The choice of a first-line regimen is highly variable, however.  
While fludarabine based -regimens are also highly effective in the first -line setting as well 
as in relapsing patients (Table 1), stem cell mobilization may be im paired for future 
autologous stem cell transplants. [1, 2, 15]

Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 3 Due to clinical data showing activity of the combination of bendamustine plus rituximab 
in non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a phase II study evaluated the  combination of 
bendamustine plus rituxima b in indolent non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma including follicular 
and mantle cell histologies. [16] The stud y by [CONTACT_265172] . evaluated bendamustine 
plus rituximab in 67 adults with relapsed, indolent B -cell or mantle cell lymphoma 
without documented resistance to prior rituximab. Patients received rituximab 375 mg/  
m2 intravenously on day 1 and bendamustine 90 mg/ m2 intravenously on days 2 and 3 of 
each 28 -day cycle for four to six cycles. The overall response rate was 92% (41% 
complete response, 14% unconfirmed complete response, and 38% partial response). 
Median duration of response was 21 months and median  progression -free survival time 
was 23 months. Outcomes were similar for patients with indolent or mantle cell 
histologies. The primary toxicity was myelosuppression (grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 36%; 
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, 9%).  
 
For the first -line t reatment of indolent lymphomas, the combination of bendamustine  plus 
rituximab (B -R) was compared to R-CHOP.  Rummel et al . showed that B -R is non -
inferior to R-CHOP  as first -line treatment of indolent lymphomas including follicular and 
mantle cell lymphom as, while showing a better tolerability profile such as less alopecia, 
and potentially less cardiotoxicity. [17]   A total of 546 patients were randomized to B -R 
vs. CHOP -R x 6 cycles.  The primary endpoint, progression -free survival (PFS), was not 
reached for the B -R arm and was 39 months in the R-CHOP  arm. This difference was not 
statistically significant.  The overall response rate was 94% vs 93% respectively, and the 
rate of CR was similar, 41% v ersus 33%. In this trial , 52% of patients had FL.   
 
 
2.2.2  90-yttrium(Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan  
 
Technical advances have made it possible to link radionuclides such as yttrium -90 (90Y) 
to monoclonal antibodies to specifically target radiation to lymphoma cells. Yttrium -90 is 
a beta -emitting radionuclide that delivers 90% of its radiation (2.3 MeV) over a mean 
path length of 5 mm and has a half -life of 64 hours. These characteristics are particularly 
advantageous for treating bulky, poorly vascularized tumors and those with 
heterogeneous antigen expression.  
Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin; Spectrum Pharmaceuticals ) is a short -course 
radioimmunotherapy that uses immunobiologic and radiolytic mechanisms of action to 
destroy both dividing and nondividing tumor cells. Ibritumomab is the murine, parent 
anti-CD20 antibody that was engineered to develop rituximab. Tiuxeta n is a 
linker/chelator covalently attached to ibritumomab. Ibritumomab tiuxetan can chelate 
indium -111 (111In) for imaging or 90Y for therapy. Thus, the antibody specifically targets 
radiation to CD20+ cells while sparing normal nonlymphoid cells.  
Because  rituximab immunotherapy is widely used to treat patients with NHL, a critical 
issue is whether patients treated previously with rituximab can respond to ibritumomab 
tiuxetan. This study tested the hypothesis that tumor resistance to an unconjugated anti-
CD20 antibody alone can be overcome by [CONTACT_265173]20 -directed 
radioimmunotherapy.  
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 4  
Witzig  et al. showed that ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy is effective in 
rituximab -refractory patients. [9] Eligible patients were refractory to rituximab; this was 
defined as no objective response to rituximab (375 mg/ m2 weekly for 4 weeks) or time to 
progression (TTP) of = <6 months. The ibritumomab tiuxetan treatment regimen 
consisted of pretreatment with rituximab (250 mg/ m2) intravenously on days 1 and 8 to 
deplete peripheral blood B cells, then yttrium -90 ibritumomab ti uxetan (0.4 mCi/kg; 
maximum, 32 mCi) intravenously on day 8, administered on an outpatient basis. An 
imaging/dosimetry dose of indium -111 ibritumomab tiuxetan (5 mCi) was injected after 
rituximab (day 1) in 28 patients. (The indium -111 and dosimetry biosca n are no longer 
required as per the FDA and revised package insert 11/2011). Fifty -seven patients were 
treated. The median age was 54 years, 74% had tumors > 5 cm, and all were extensively 
pretreated (median, four prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; range, one to nine). The estimated radiation -
absorbed doses to healthy organs were below the study -defined limit in all patients 
studied with dosimetry. The overall response rate for the 54 patients with follicular NHL 
was 74% (15% complete responses and 59% partial responses). Th e Kaplan -Meier -
estimated TTP was 6.8 months (range, 1.1 to > 25.9 months) for all patients and 8.7 
months for responders. Adverse events were primarily hematologic; the incidence of 
grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia was 35%, 9%, and 4%, res pectively. 
The only significant toxicity was hematologic.  
 
2.3  Rationale of combining bendamustine and rituximab with consolidation 90-
yttrium(Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan  
 
As mentioned above, the combination of bendamustine  plus rituximab (B -R) appears to be 
non-inferior to R-CHOP  as first -line treatment of indolent lymphomas including follicular 
and mantle cell lymphomas, while showing a better tolerability profile such as less alopecia, 
and potentially less cardiotoxicity,  making it a rational choice for first line treatment of 
FL.[17]   
 
When given after chemotherapy, r adioimmunotherapy can convert partial responses to 
complete responses and can prolong the PFS. The Follicular Lymphoma Ibritumomab 
tiuxetan  (FIT) trial of consolidation Yttrium -90-Ibritumomab tiuxetan v ersus no additional 
therapy after first remission in advanced follicular lymphoma showed a prolongation of PFS 
(36 v ersus 13 months) in the RIT arm. [12] The PFS was prolonged regardless of PR or CR 
after first -line therapy. The primary treatment included CVP, CHOP, flu darabine -based, and 
chlorambucil, with the minority of patients receiving rituximab. The results also showed that 
RIT converted 77% patients from PR to CR/ unconfirmed CR (CRu).   
 
An abbreviated course of CHOP -R followed by [CONTACT_265174] a phase II trial reported recently. [11] Of the 60 patients entering this 
trial, 55 patients completed all protocol therapy. The median follow up was 19.7 months 
(range, 0.26 -35.9 months). For intent -to-treat analysis, the complete response (CR) rate after 
CHOP -R, as assessed by [CONTACT_265175], was 40% and 46%, respectively. After RIT, 
the CR rate improved, as assessed by [CONTACT_265176], to 82% and 89%, respectively.  
 
In this current study, we propose a first -line regimen for untreated FL using bendamustine 
and rituximab (B -R) (bendamustine 90  mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 and Rituximab 375mg/m2 on 
Day 1 of a 28 -day [+2 days]  cycle) x 4 cycles followed by [INVESTIGATOR_61192]; Zevalin  (formerly Biogen 
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 5 Idec/Cell Therapeutics, now Spectrum).  
 
The advantage of this treatment is that B -R has a better side effect profile including 
significantly less alopecia and less infectious complications. Currently  bendamustine is not 
FDA -approved for first -line therapy for follicular lymphoma. 90 -yttrium(Y) ibritumomab 
tiuxetan  (Zevalin) radioimmunotherapy is FDA approved for patients with  previously 
untreated follicular non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), who achieve a partial or complete 
response to first -line chemotherapy. Evidence suggests that consolidation with RIT leads to a 
longer PFS.  Since this specific combination has not been utilized in the first -line treatment 
of FL, it warrants investigation in the current  study.  
 
This trial will begin to establish a standard of care for the first -line treatment of follicular 
lymphoma. We hypothesize that bendamustine plus rituximab followed by [CONTACT_265177]. Based on the results of this trial, we would aim to open a larger trial for follicular 
lymphoma in a cooperative group settin g, i.e. CALGB.  
 
2.4 Correlative Studies Background  
  
The BCL2 gene -Jh rearrangement is the common abnormality in FL t(14;18). This can be 
assessed by [CONTACT_265178]. [18, 19]  
 
Patients can be assessed for this molecular abnormality in their bone marrow at baseline and 
following therapy. For instance in a similar South west Oncology Group study of 
chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_265179]/iodine I -131 
tositumomab  (Bexxar ) for follicular lymphoma,  patients were asked to undergo serial bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_265145], 4 weeks after the sixth cy cle of CHOP (just before 
tositumomab/iodine I -131 tositumomab), and after tositumomab/iodine I -131 tositumomab 
for PCR testing. [20] The mononuclear cell fraction was isolated from marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_265146] -Hypaque sedimentation and cryopreserved for subsequent batch analysis using a 
double nested PCR assay to detect the major breakpoint  region and the minor cluster region 
of the BCL2  gene using the method of Gribben. [18, 19]  Samples were initially analyzed by 
[CONTACT_265180]2  
translocation by [CONTACT_265181]. The adequacy of samples was demonstrated using beta -
globin as a positive control housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_171520]. Patients were  considered to have attained a 
molecular remission if their marrow sample at study entry contained a detectable t(14;18) 
translocation that became undetectable after protocol treatment.

5.0       Study design  
 
This multicenter, open label, single arm clinical trial has been designed to investigate 
bendamustine p lus rituximab followed by 90 -yttrium(Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan in patients 
with untreated follicular lymphoma requiring treatment. Upon successful completion of all 
screening procedures  and registration,  participants  will be treated following the schema 
outlined below:  
 
In cycle 1 only, participants  will receive rituximab 375mg/m2 on day -7 (+1 day).  For every 
cycle, participants  will receive bendamustine 90  mg/m2 and rituximab 375  mg/m2 on day 1  
and bendamustine 90  mg/m2 on day 2.  A cycle will be  28 days (+2 days) and participants 
will be treated for a total of [ADDRESS_322416] a  partial r esponse (PR) , achieve a platelet count 
>100,000/mm3, an ANC > 1500 /mm3, and bone marrow infiltration less than 25% at 
restaging will be eligi ble for consolidation radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 90 -yttrium(Y) 
ibritumomab tiuxetan . RIT treatment will begin  6-[ADDRESS_322417] stable 
disease (SD) or progression of disease  or do not complete 4 cycles of bendamustine and 
rituximab treatment  will not be eligible to receive RIT.   
 
The ibritumomab tiuxetan therapeutic regimen is given in 2 steps: Step 1 includes one 
infusion of rituximab on day 1.  (Step 1 no longer requires the use of indium -111 or the 
dosimetric bioscan as of 11/2011  as per the FDA and new package insert 11/2011 .) 
(http://zevalin.com/v3/pdf/Zevalin_Package_Insert.pdf ) Step 2 is given on day 8 ( +1 day) 
and consists of a second infusion of rituximab preceding Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan. 
Rituximab is administered to deplete peripheral blood CD20+ B -cells and to optimize 
biodistribution.   
 
Following RIT, a weekly CBC w/diff including platelet count is required until count 
recovery.  Every 4 weeks (starting from day 1) a physical exam, CBC w/ diff, serum  
chemistry, vitals, ECOG, and adverse event evaluation is required. Count recovery following 
RIT is defined as ANC >1000/mm3 and platelet count >100,000/mm3.

(refer to package insert 
for Y-90 ibritumomab 
tiuxetan  for details 
regarding administration, 
or refer to institutional 
protocols.)  
 
 Step 1: Day 1: Rituximab 250 mg/m2 IV is administered first (see Rituximab 
package insert ).  
 
Step 2:  Day 8 (+1 day):  a second dose of Rituximab 250 mg/m2 IV is given.  
 
If platelet count > 150,000/mm3: Within 4 hours of completing the rituximab 
infusion, give Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan 0.4 mCi/kg (14.8 MBq/kg) IV over 10 
minutes. The dose administered should be within 10% of the actual prescribed 
dose of Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan.  
If platelet count 100,00 0—149,000/mm3: Within 4 hours of completing the 
rituximab infusion, give Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan 0.3 mCi/kg (11.1 MBq/kg) 
IV over 10 minutes. The dose administered should be within 10% of the actual 
prescribed dose of Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan.  
 
The tota l Y-90 dose should not exceed 32 mCi (1184 MBq) regardless of the 
patient’s body weight.  
 
 For rituximab dosing and administration, rituximab will be rounded to the nearest [ADDRESS_322419] been conducted. Inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., 
fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) have potential to increase plasma concentrations of 
bendamustine and dec rease  plasma concentrations of active metabolites. Inducers of 
CYP1A2 (e.g., omeprazole, smoking) have potential to decr ease plasma concentrations of 
bendamustine and increase plasma concentrations of its active metabolites. Caution should be 
used if conco mitant treatment with CYP1A2 inhibitors or inducers is needed.  
 
Prophylactic use of G -CSF or GM -CSF is discouraged. They are allowed in participants who 
Fol-BRITe study

 11 demonstrate the need for bone marrow support b ased on occurrence of prolonged neutropenia 
(Grade [ADDRESS_322420] a 
grade 1 toxicity by [CONTACT_123554], or the occurrence of  febrile neutropenia in a 
prior cycle of treatment.)  
 
Use of G -CSF or GM -CSF should not be used as a substi tute for dose reduction.  
 
5.3  Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity  as deemed by [CONTACT_30780] , treatment will continue for the planned duration of protocol therapy. Any 
participant  with documented di sease progression will be taken off of study treatments and 
removed from the protocol.   
 
Other conditions for withdrawal:  
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the participant’s  health and/or 
the participant  no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be 
discontinued. In this event , the Dartmouth PI [INVESTIGATOR_265148] , and the reason(s) for 
discontinuation of therapy should be documented in the Case Report Form.  
 
5.4 Duration of Foll ow Up  
 
Participants who receive any amount of study treatment  will be followed  every 3 months (+/ - 
2 weeks)  with a physical exam, vital signs, weight, ECOG, CBC with diff, platelets, and 
serum chemistry  for the first [ADDRESS_322421] 
2 years .  Years 3 through 10, participants will be followed annually . If the participant 
receives alternative treatment, data will be collected on the type of alternative treatment and 
date received. This will allow determinati on of time to next treatment. Follow up will occur 
for a maximum of 10 years from study entry  or death – whichever occurs first .  For those 
who do not receive Y90 ibritumumab tiuxetan but then receive maintenance rituximab, this 
does not constitute a new r egimen, and patients should be followed for a maximum of 10 
years from study entry or death – whichever occurs first.  Rituximab should be recorded in 
the concomitant medications.

On the actual day of RIT, for platelet counts > 150,000/mm3, Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan 
dose will be 0.4 mCi /kg (14.8 MBq/kg).  
 
On the  actual day of  RIT, for platelets count 100,000 -149,000/mm3, Y-90 ibritumomab 
tiuxetan dose will be 0.3 mCi/kg (11.1 MBq/kg).  
 
6.4   Postponement of Bendamustine and Rituximab Treatment  
 
The prescribed time interval between each cycle of rituximab plus bendamustine is 28 days  
(+2 days) .  Non-hematologic t oxicities must have recovered to  < grade [ADDRESS_322429] be  ≥1,000/mm3 and the platelet count must be ≥ 75,00 0/mm3 to 
proceed with treatment (unless the subject has documented >50% marrow involvement with 
lymphoma). If  recovery criteria are not met within 2 weeks following the prescribed start of a 
treatment cycle (i. e. after 2 week delay), the patient will be re -evaluated by [CONTACT_093], 
and a decision will be made regarding  further treatment with B -R. 
 
6.5 Ancillary Therapy   
 
No other anti -tumor treatment is allowed during the course of the study. The investigator 
may prescribe supportive treatment f or adverse events following the evaluation of the causal 
relationship of th e symptom(s) to the study drug. Onset and duration of supportive treatment , 
including pre -infusion medications, should be recorded o n the concomitant medication log 
and in the CRF.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event (AE) recording  and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  All AEs 
and SAEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_265184] b y authorized study personnel, will 
be recorded in the participant’s medical record, on the AE or SAE log, and the case report 
forms. AE recording will begin on the first day of treatment (Cycle 1 Day -7) and end at the 
EOT visit. An ongoing AE will be foll owed until it returns to baseline. Abnormal lab values, 
even if they are expected, must be recorded appropriately as adverse events. Each site must 
record the onset and duration of each hematologic AE.  
The following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the chara cteristics of an observed AE (Section 
7.2) may assist with determination of SAE reporting.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_322430] common nonhematologic adverse reactions (≥30%) were nausea (75%), fatigue 
(57%), vomiting (40%), diarrhea (37%) and pyrexia (34%). The most common non -
hematologic Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions (≥5%) were fatigue (11%), febrile 
neutropenia (6%), and pneumonia, hypokalemia and dehydration, each reported in 5% of 
patients.  (Please  refer to the package insert of Treanda®).  
 
In addition the following adverse events have been reported.  
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version [ADDRESS_322431] included rash, toxic skin reactions, and bullous exanthema.  
Some events occurred when bendamustine was given in combination with other 
anticancer agents, so the precise relationship of the  skin reactions to bendamustine 
treatment is uncertain.  In a study of bendamustine (90 mg/m2) in combination with 
rituximab (study SDX -105-02), 1 case of toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_3915] n ecrolysis (TEN)  occurred. 
TEN has been associated with treatment  with rituximab. Spontaneous reports of SJS and 
TEN, some fatal, have been reported  when bendamustine was administered 
concomitantly with allopurinol and other  medications known to cause these  syndromes. 
The rela tionship to bendamustine cannot be determined.  
 
When skin reactions occur, they may be progressive and increase in severity with further  
treatment. Therefore, patients with skin reactions shoul d be monitored closely. If skin 
reactions are severe or progressive, bendamustine treatment should be withheld or 
discontinued.

8.1 Bendamustine  (please see Treanda®  package insert for more details)  
 
Availability  
Bendamustine is an investigational agent for the first line treatment of follicular lymphoma, 
and it is supplied to investigators by [CONTACT_265189], Inc.  
 
FDA approved indications  
Bend amustine is indicated for the treatment of patients wit h chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 
and for the treatment of patient s with indolent B -cell non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma that has 
progressed during or  within six months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab -containing 
regimen.  
 
Description  
Bendamustine  contains bendamustine hydrochloride, an alkylating drug, as the active 
ingredient. The chemical name [CONTACT_265215] 1H -benzimidazole -2-
butanoic acid, 5 -[bis(2 -chloroethyl)amino] -1 methyl -, monohydrochloride. Its empi[INVESTIGATOR_265154]  C16H21Cl2N3O2 · HCl, and the molecular weight is 394.7. 
Bendamustine  hydrochloride contains a mechlorethamine group and a benzimidazole  
heterocyclic ring with a butyric acid substituent . 
 
Bendamustine  is intended for intravenous infusion only after reconstitution with 20 mL of 
Sterile  Water for Injection, USP, and after fu rther dilution with either 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP, or 2.5% Dextrose/0.45% Sodium Chloride  Injection, USP. It is supplied as a 
sterile non -pyrogenic white to off -white lyophilized powder in a single -use vial. Each vial 
contains [ADDRESS_322442] mechanism of action of bendamustine remains unknown.  
 
Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
Following a single IV dose of bendamustine hydrochloride Cmax typi[INVESTIGATOR_265155]. The dose proport ionality of  bendamustine has not been studied.  
 
Distribution  
In vitro, the binding of bendamustine to human serum plasma proteins ranged from 94 -96% 
and was concentration independent from 1 -50 μg/mL.  Data suggest that bendamustine is not 
likely to displace or to be displaced by [CONTACT_265190] -bound drugs. The blood to plasma  
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 24 concentration ratios in human blood ranged from 0.84 to 0.86 over a concentration range of 
10 to 100 μg/mL indicating that benda mustine distributes  freely in human red blood cells. In 
humans, the mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) was approximately 25 L.  
 
Metabolism  
In vitro data indicate that bendamustine is primarily metabolized via hydrolysis to 
metabolites with low cytotoxic activity. In vitro , studies  indicate that two active minor 
metabolites, M3 and M4, are primarily formed via CYP1A2. However, concentrations of 
these metabolites in plasma  are 1/10 and 1/100 that of the parent compound, respectively, 
suggesting th at the cytotoxic activity is primarily due to bendamustine.  In vitro studies using 
human liver microsomes indicate that bendamustine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9/10, 2D6, 
2E1, or 3A4/5.  Bendamustine did not induce metabolism of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
CYP2 C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 enzymes in  primary cultures of 
human hepatocytes.  
 
Elimination  
No mass balance study has been undertaken in humans. Preclinical radiolabeled 
bendamustine studies showed that approximately 90% of drug  administered wa s recovered in 
excreta primarily in the feces.  Bendamustine clearance in humans is approximately 700 
mL/minute. After a single dose of 120 mg/m2 bendamustine IV over 1 -hour the  intermediate 
t½ of the parent compound is approximately 40 minutes. The mean ap parent terminal 
elimination t½ of M3 and M4 are approximately 3  hours and 30 minutes respectively. Little 
or no accumulation in plasma is expected for bendamustine administered on Days 1 and 2 of 
a 28-day cycle.  
 
Renal Impairment  
In a population pharmacoki netic analysis of bendamustine in patients receiving 120 mg/m2 
there was no meaningful effect of renal impairment  (CrCL 40 - 80 mL/min, N=31) on the  
pharmacokinetics of bendamustine. Bendamustine has not been studied in patients with CrCL 
< 40 mL/min.  These results are however limited, and therefore bendamustine should be used 
with caution in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  Bendamustine should not be 
used in patients with CrCL < 40 mL/min.  
 
Hepatic Impairment  
In a population pharmacokinet ic analysis of bendamustine in patients receiving 120 mg/m2 
there was no meaningful effect of mild (total  bilirubin ≤ ULN, AST ≥ ULN to 2.[ADDRESS_322443], 
and/or ALP ≥ ULN to 5.[ADDRESS_322444], N=26) hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of  
bendamustine. Bendamustine  has not been studied in patients with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment.  These results are however limited, and therefore bendamustine should be 
used with caution in patients with mild hepatic impairment.  Bendamustine should not be used 
in patients with moderate (AST or ALT 2.[ADDRESS_322445]) or 
severe (total bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_322446]) hepatic impairment.  
 
Effect of Age  
Bendamustine exposure (as measured by [CONTACT_265191]) has been studied in patients ages 
31 through 84 years.  The pharmacokinetics of  bendamustine (AUC and Cmax) were not 
significantly different between patients less than or greater than/equal to [ADDRESS_322447] of race on the safety, and/or efficacy of bendamustine  has not been established. 
Based on a cross -study comparison, Japanese subjects  (n = 6) had on average exposures that 
were 40% higher than non -Japanese subjects receiving the s ame dose. The significance of 
this difference on the  safety and efficacy of bendamustine  in Japanese subjects has not been 
established.  
 
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics  
Based on the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analyses of data from NHL patients, a 
correlation was observed between nausea and  bendamustine Cmax.  
 
8.2  90-yttrium (Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan  
 
Availability  
90-yttrium (Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan  is commercially available.  It is supplied to 
investigators through coverage by [CONTACT_13935]’ insurance.  
 
FDA indications  
90-yttrium (Y) ibritumomab tiuxetan  (Zevalin ) is indicated for the  treatment of patients 
with relapsed or refractory, low -grade or fo llicular  B-cell non -Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), 
including patients with rituximab  refractory follicular NHL.  It is in the  NCCN compendium 
for the first -line treatment of follicular lymphoma. On 9/5/2009 the FDA expanded the label 
to include patients with pre viously untreated follicular non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), 
who achieve a partial or complete response to first -line chemotherapy.  
 
Mechanism of Action  
Ibritumomab tiuxetan binds specifically to the CD20 antigen (human  B-lymphocyte -
restricted differentiatio n antigen, Bp35). The apparent affinity  (KD) of ibritumomab tiuxetan 
for the CD20 antigen ranges between  approximately 14 to 18 nM. The CD20 antigen is 
expressed on pre -B and  mature B lymphocytes and on > 90% of B -cell non -Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas  (NHL). The CD 20 antigen is not shed from the cell surface and does not  
internalize upon antibody binding.  The chelate tiuxetan, which tightly binds In -111 or Y -90, 
is covalently linked  to ibritumomab. The beta emission from Y -90 induces cellular damage 
by [CONTACT_265192].  Ibritumomab tiuxetan 
binding was observed in vitro on lymphoid cells of the  bone marrow, lymph node, thymus, 
red and white pulp of the spleen, and  lymphoid follicles of the tonsil, as well as lymphoid 
nodules of other organs , such as the large and small intestines.  
 
Pharmacodynamics  
In clinical studies, administration of the Zevalin therapeutic regimen resulted  
in sustained depletion of circulating B cells. At four weeks, the median  number of circulating 
B cells was zero (range, 0 -1084/mm3). B -cell recovery  began at approximately 12 weeks 
following treatment, and the median level of  B cells was within the normal range (32 to 
341/mm3) by 9 months after  treatment. Median serum levels of IgG and I gA remained within 
the normal  range throughout the period of B -cell depletion. Median IgM serum levels  
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 26 dropped below normal (median 49 mg/dL, range 13 -3990 mg/dL) after  treatment and 
recovered to normal values by [ADDRESS_322448] therapy.  
 
Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic and biodistribution studies were performed using In -111 Zevalin (5 mCi 
[185 MBq] In -111, 1.6 mg ibritumomab tiuxetan). In an early  study designed to assess the 
need for pre -administration of unlabeled  antibody, only 18% of known sites of dise ase were 
imaged when In -111 Zevalin was administered without unlabeled ibritumomab. When 
preceded by  [CONTACT_265193] (1.0 mg/kg or 2.5 mg/kg), In -111 Zevalin detected  
56% and 92% of known disease sites, respectively. These studies were  conducted with  a 
Zevalin therapeutic regimen that included unlabeled  ibritumomab.  
 
In pharmacokinetic studies of patients receiving the Zevalin therapeutic  regimen, the mean 
effective half -life for Y -90 activity in blood was 30 hours,  and the mean area under the 
fractio n of injected activity (FIA) vs. time curve  in blood was 39 hours. Over 7 days, a 
median of 7.2% of the injected activity  was excreted in urine.  
 
 
8.3  Rituximab  (refer to RITUXAN package insert for more information)  
 
Rituximab (Rituxan®) is a genetically engineered chim eric murine/human monoclonal 
antibody directed against the CD20 antigen found on the surface of normal and malignant  
B lymphocytes.  
 
It is indicated for the treatment of patients with relap sed or refractory, low -grade or f ollicular, 
CD 20 -positive B -cell non -Hodgkin ’s lymphoma.  
 
Rituxima b is commercially available.  
 
Rituximab should be administered per the guidelines found in the package insert.

11.1 Assessment of Response  
 
The International Response Criteria for non-Hodgkin’s  Lymphoma will be used to assess 
response. (Cheson, JCO Vol 17, Issue 4 (April), 1999: 1244). CT scans will be used to 
determine the size of the target lesions. PET scans may be used at the discretion of the  
investigator, but should not be used as a replacement for CT scan.  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be evaluated by [CONTACT_265195], after the 
completion of the last cycle of B-R, and 12-16 weeks after  receiving 90 -(Y) ibritumomab 
tiuxetan . Follow up CT scans will occur every [ADDRESS_322458] 2 perpendicular dimensions, 
representative of all involved organs/areas, suitable for accurate repeat measurements, and 
include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease.  
To de fine response, select sites and measure the two longest diameters. Multiply each node’s 
two longest diameters together, then Sum the Products of the greatest transverse Diameters 
(SPD). Calculate the percent increase or decrease. For percent decrease, calc ulate (baseline -
current disease assessment)/baseline. For percent increase, calculate (current disease 
assessment -smallest sum)/smallest sum. This will allow for accurate calculations to define 
response (see Appendix G)  
For this study, a CR and CRu will be  categorized as CR for statistical analyses.

PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression  or 
death from any cause whichever comes first.  
 
Time to next treatment (TTNT)  
TTNT is defined as the duration of time from end of study treatment (Y -90 ibritumomab 
tiuxetan) to next treatment either due to relapse or progression of disease, or death due to 
any cause, whichever comes first.

Clinical lesions   Clinical  lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is 
recommended.  
 
CT is the preferred radiographic modality . PET scans can be performed in addition to CT 
at the discretion of the investigator.   
 
Conventional CT. This technique should be performed per institutional guidelines. Cuts of [ADDRESS_322460], abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and neck tumors 
and those of extremities may be done as per institutional guidelines .

 32 12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
The primary endpoint is complete response (CR) rate. Historical complete response (CR) rate  
has been 35%. This rate will be considered as the null hypothesis.  The alternative hypothesis 
is that bendamustine -rituximab (B -R) followed by [CONTACT_265170] (RIT) will increase  
the CR rate to  55%.  An optimal Simon two -stage design will be incorporated to allow an 
early futility look during the Phase II component while minimizing the expected total sample 
size. It is calculated to be [ADDRESS_322461] a CR the n an 
additional stage of 25 patients will be added for a total of 39. The probability of early 
termination is 64% under the null hypothesis and 12% under the alternative. The expected 
sample size (i.e., average if this study was repeated many times) is 24. 8. These calculations 
assume a type I error rate of 5% and power of 80%.  
 
The CR rate will calculated by [CONTACT_240316] + CRu divided by [CONTACT_941] # of evaluable subjects x 100%.  
 
The ORR will be calculated by [CONTACT_240316] + CRu + PR divided by [CONTACT_941] # of evaluable subjects x 
100%.  
 
Statistical analysis for the primary endpoint will include two pre -planned analyses: The first 
analysis will include only participants who complete all protocol therapy (4 cycles of 
bendamustine and rituximab followed by Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan). If a part icipant does 
not complete all study therapy, he/she will be replaced with another participant in a 1 to 1 
fashion until there are a total of 39 evaluable participants. Since the statistics for the primary 
endpoint are based around additive sequential treat ment, we will be performing this analysis.  
 
The second analysis will include all participants who receive any portion of study therapy 
(intention -to-treat analysis).  
 
Both statistical analyses will be reported.  
 
12.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
39 evaluable  participants . At the accrual rate of about 2 participants per month this trial 
should accrue in 20 months, and be completed in 28 months. Reporting of response rate 
would be possible at 31 months.  At the accrual rate of 4 participants per month, this tri al 
should accrue in 10 months, and be completed in 18 months. Reporting of response rate 
would be possible at 21 months. With an expected dropout rate of 5 to 10%, 41 to 44 
participants will need to be accrued to this study to reach 39 evaluable participan ts. 
 
All participants will be evaluable for toxicity.  
 
12.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoints are safety of this combination. The CTCAE  v4.0 will be used to 
determine toxicities.  
 
In addition we will calculate the CR and OR rate after B -R and Y -90 ibritumomab tiuxetan . 
The conversions from PR to CR will be reported.

Safety and Data Monitoring Committee (SDMC)  
 
The Safety and Data Monitoring Committee (SDMC) is the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
for the Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth. It is a multidisciplinary committee charged 
with overseeing monitoring of safety of participants, co nduct, progress, and validity and integrity 
of the data of all clinical trials at NCCC at Dartmouth. The committee is chaired by [CONTACT_265197], and meets quarterly to review the progress and safety of all 
active research prot ocol that are not reviewed by [CONTACT_265198]. 
If a study is already being monitored by a safety and data monitoring committee formed by a 
national cooperative group, a pharmaceutical sponsor, or a study specific committee for a phase 
III trial, the NCCC SDMC does not actively monitor the study. The SDMC oversees the process 
of adverse event reporting to assure that the requirements are met. The SDMC has the authority 
to require amendments, suspend or terminate any research acti vities that fall within its 
jurisdiction. The SDMC reports to the Clinical Cancer Review Committee (CCRC). The SDMC 
can institute any other appropriate conditions needed for subject safety.  
 
With the exception of the Office of Clinical Research (OCR) Regu latory and Compliance Officer 
who is a standing member, all members serve a five -year term. Committee membership and 
voting status are assigned by [CONTACT_265199]. The Committee includes representatives 
from the following disciplines: medical onco logy, hematology, radiation oncology, 
pharmacology, bio -statistics, ethics, oncology nursing and data management. Presence of three 
or more of the SDMC voting members constitutes a quorum. Members may be appointed on an 
ad hoc basis by [CONTACT_265200], should additional expertise be required in the review 
of certain studies.  
 
The SDMC meets on a quarterly basis. Special meetings may be convened when necessary, for 
urgent concerns regarding patient safety or data integrity. Administration of the SDM C 
(paperwork, meeting coordination, minutes) is provided by [CONTACT_30591]. 
Minutes reflect the members present, substantive issues discussed, voting results, and members 
abstaining due to conflict of interest.  
 
The frequency of SDMC monit oring for a particular study depends on the level of risk (low or 
high risk) assigned to the study by [CONTACT_265201], as described above. Low risk 
trials are reviewed on an annual basis by [CONTACT_133065]. High risk trials are reviewed on a quarterly 
basis by [CONTACT_133065]. The size and complexity of a trial also determines the frequency and level of 
review. Data and safety monitoring activities for each study continue until all patients have 
completed their treatment and all participants are beyond the time point at which study -related 
adverse events would likely be encountered. Since this is a multicenter study, this protocol will 
be reviewed on a quarterly basis.  
 
For each SDMC protocol review, summary information regarding toxicity and accrual patterns is 
prepared by [CONTACT_265202], and submitted to the SDMC. The study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_265159]. Specific information submitted for review 
includes:  
• The expected and actual numbers of participants entered to date, a s well as for the most recent 
reporting period  
• Number of participants treated

conflict of interest (including substantial financial interest in the study sponsor agency ), that 
member may be present to answer questions regarding the study, but must abstain from voting 
and leave the room prior to final deliberations and voting on that study. In the event that the 
Chairman is the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25810], anothe r member of the Committee will 
oversee the Committee deliberations and voting.  
 
The Committee may vote to take one of the following actions for each protocol reviewed:

Abstract    
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the CD20 anti gen present on 
lymphoma cells. Rituximab has revolutionalized the treatment follicular lymphoma, showing 
significantly better response rates, progression -free survival and overall survival when added to 
chemotherapy. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_265163], ritu xmab’s mechanisms of action are 
unknown. Rituximab works through many mechanisms, including antibody -dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and direct apoptotic effects by 
[CONTACT_265203]20.  
Polymorphisms of two IgG Fcγ receptors have been shown to predict clinical responses 
to rituximab therapy , presumably because of their role in ADCC .  The correlation of 
polymorphisms and response in patients treated with rituximab combined with chemotherapy, or 
“chemoimmunotherapy” is unclear. The D1015 clinical trial is studying the clinical and 
molecular response rates of follicular lymphoma patients  to rituximab and bendamustine. As a 
scientific correlative to this ongoing study, we will determine how polymorphisms in Fcγ 
receptors correlate with clinical and molecular responses. We hypothesize that the response rates 
will be higher for patients with  FcγRIIIA -158-V/V and FcγRIIa -131-H/H polymorphisms.  If this 
correlation is confirmed it adds further credence that rituximab primarily acts by [CONTACT_265204]. 
Until recently, R -CHOP has been the preferred first -line chemoimmunotherapy for the treatment 
of fo llicular lymphoma. The clinical trial D1015 uses a novel alkylator/purine analog hybrid, 
bendamustine, in combination with rituximab. This novel combination has shown superiority 
when compared to R -CHOP. This study will be the first study of FcγR polymorph isms in 
follicular lymphoma patients treated with rituximab and the novel agent, bendamustine.

Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 39 Background    
Rituximab is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the B -cell 
surface antigen CD20 expressed on B -lymphocytes. Rituximab indu ces killing of normal and 
malignant B -cells expressing CD20. Rituximab’s proposed mechanisms include: 1) elicitation of 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), 2) induction of lymphoma cell death through 
complement -dependent cytolysis (CDC) and/or  complement -dependent cellular toxicity, and 3) 
direct induction of apoptosis following engagement of CD20 by [CONTACT_4124]. [21]  
Clinical r esponse to rituximab is dependent on specific Fc γR polymorphisms.  Cartron, et 
al. demonstrated that follicular lymphoma p atients homozygous for Fc γRIIIa -158-V/V [valine] 
had a significantly better clinical response rate (100%) compared to patients expressing 
heterozygous (V/F) or homozygous phenylalanine (F/F) genotype (67%) .[22] In addition, Weng 
and Levy confirmed the FcγRIIIa -158-V/V association with clinical response in another cohort 
of follicular lymphoma patients. [23] They also reported that the polymorphism FcγRIIa -131-H/H 
[histidine] is  independently associated with response rate compared to R [arginine] carriers. [23] 
Similarly, in a study of Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia, another form of indolent lymphoma, 
response rates to rituximab correlated with FcγRIIIa -158 polymorphisms. [24] The response trend 
was higher for patients with FcγRIIIA -158-V/V, compared to heterozygous (V/F) or 
homozygous (F/F). [24] Thus, rituximab’s majo r mechanism of action seems to be through 
ADCC.   
In this model, the rituximab’s Fc portion binds to Fcγ receptors on effector cells, 
including natural killer cells, and granulocytes. This binding leads to the destruction of 
rituximab -bound B -cells, either  by [CONTACT_265205]. Functional allelic polymorphisms of the three classes of FcγR (FcγRI, 
FcγRII, and FcγRIII) exist in humans and these generate different receptor properties affecting 
binding affinity for the different IgG subclasses including IgG1. [21] Genetic  polymorphism s 
corresponding to phenotype expression of valine (V) or phenylalanine (F) at amino acid [ADDRESS_322465] 
demonstrated the stronger binding of IgG1 antibody  to homozygous Fc γRIIIa -158V /V NK cells 
than to homozygous Fc γRIIIa -158F /F or heterozygous NK cells. [25, 26]  Similarly, 
polymorphism s related to the expression of histidine (H) or arginine (R) at amino acid 131 in 
FcγRIIa affects the binding affinity of IgG1. [27] This evidence supports that rit uximab, an IgG1 
mAb, functions by [CONTACT_265206].  
When rituximab is combined with chemotherapy, response rates improve significantly 
compared to chemotherapy or rituximab alone. The addition of rituximab to every 
chemotherapeutic combination studied (CVP, CHOP, FND, FCM, bendamustine) [1, 2, 4 -6, 15, 
17] has resulted in significant increase in th e overall response rate and complete response rate. In 
addition, R -CVP has demonstrated a significant increase in overall survival when compared to 
CVP alone. [5] The mechanism of the added benefit of rituximab to chemotherapy is more 
elusive. For instance, in one study, when patients are sequentially treated with chemotherapy 
(CHOP) followed by [CONTACT_4124], the association betwee n FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIa is apparently 
lost.[28] However, in diffuse large B -cell lymphoma patients treated with R -CHOP, Kim, et al. 
demonstrated that the FcγRIIIa -158-V/V polymorphism was associated with responses and faster 
time to response. [29] Thus, it is still unclear whether rituximab works by [CONTACT_265207]. It is  also unclear whether rituximab acts differently 
when combined with chemotherapeutic agents other than CHOP, such as bendamustine. This 
study will provide useful data as to the mechanism of rituximab’s effect in follicular lymphoma 
patients treated with ch emoimmunotherapy that incorporates the novel chemotherapeutic agent, 
bendamustine.  Bendamustine is a purine analog/alkylator hybrid cytotoxic chemotherapy with 
significant clinical activity in lymphoma. It is highly active in refractory indolent B -cell 
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version 06 July 2018  
 
 40 lymphoma as a single agent with an overall response rate of 75%. [30] In front -line combination 
with rituximab compared to R -CHOP, bendamustine significantly improves overall response 
rate, complete response rate, and progression -free survival. Bendamustine and rituximab 
chemoimmunotherapy results in far fewer toxicities including l ess infectious complications, and 
practically no alopecia. [17]  
Within the context of this clinical trial, we will examine specific genetic polymorphisms 
that correlate with clinical and molecular response the chemoimmunotherapy combination of 
bendamustine and rituximab. These results will provide addi tional knowledge addressing 
molecular predictors of rituximab sensitivity and resistance and will have important implications 
in personalizing immunotherapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma.  
 
Specific Aims  
 To determine the association of FcγRIIIa -158-V/V and FcγRIIa -131-H/H 
polymorphisms with clinical and molecular responses in follicular lymphoma patients 
treated with rituximab and bendamustine .  
 
Methods        
Patient samples will be collected and stored at study entry from consenting fo llicular 
lymphoma patients enrolled in D1015. In this proposed study we will examine FcγR (FcγRIIIa 
and FcγRIIa) polymorphisms known to correlate with response. In order to detect the Fc γRIIIA 
polymorphisms, DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood mono nuclear cells collected prior 
to treatment using a kit (Qiagen). Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_265164]3A -158V/F polymorphism will be 
performed as described by [CONTACT_265208], [22] et al using a nested PCR followed by [CONTACT_265209] -specific 
restriction enzyme digestion. Brief ly, 2 FCγRIIIA -specific primers (5’ -
ATATTTACAGAATGGCACAGG -3’, 5’ -GACTTGGTACCCAGGTTGAA -3’) will be used to 
amplify a 1.2 kilobase fragment containing the polymorphic site. The initial PCR assay will be 
performed with 1.25µg genomic DNA, 200ng of each primer , 200µM of each 
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) and 1U Taq DNApolymerase. This first PCR will 
consist of 10 minutes at 95°C, then 35 cycles (each consisting of steps at 95°C for 1 minute, 
57°C for 1.5 minutes, and 72°C for 1.5 minutes), and 8 minut es at 72°C to achieve complete 
extension. The second PCR will use primers (5 ’-
ATCAGATTCGATCCTACTTCTGCAGGGGGCAT -3’, 5’-
ACGTGCTGAGCTTGAGTGATGGTGATGTTCAC -3’) amplifying a 94base pair (bp) 
fragment and creating an NlaIII restriction site only in the FCγRIIIa -158V allele. This nested 
PCR will be performed with 1µL of the amplified DNA, 150ng of each primer, 200µM of each 
dNTP, and 1U of Taq DNA polymerase. The first cycle will consist of 5 minutes at 95°C, then 
35 cycles (each consisting of steps at 95°C for 1 m inute, 64°C for 1 minute, and 72°C for 1 
minute), and 9.5 minutes at 72°C to complete extension. The amplified DNA (10µL) will be 
digested with 10U NlaIII at 37°C for 12 hours and separated by [CONTACT_265210] 8% 
polyacrylamide gel. After staining with e thidium bromide, DNA bands will be visualized under 
UV light. For homozygous FCγRIIIa -158F/F patients, only one undigested band (94 bp) should 
be visible. Three bands (94 bp, 61 bp, and 33 bp) should be seen in heterozygous individuals, 
whereas for homozyg ous FCγRIIIa -158V/V patients only 2 digested bands (61 bp and 33 bp) 
should be obtained.  Similarly, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_265165]γRIIa -131-H/R will consist of PCR followed by 
[CONTACT_265209] -specific restriction enzyme digestion, also described by [CONTACT_265208], et al. [22] 
 
Statistical Analysis  
The primary endpoint of the clinical trial within this study is complete response. The 
secondary endpoint is overall r esponse (complete or partial). Statistical analysis of the clinical 
Fol-BRITe study      
Clinical Study Protocol D1015 version [ADDRESS_322466] (i.e., permutation version of c hi-square 
test for trend). The latter trend test examines the association of number of alleles (0, 1 or 2) with 
the endpoint.  A logistic regression analysis including age >60, stage III or IV, bulky 
lymphadenopathy greater the 6cm, bone marrow involvement , number of extranodal sites >2, 
B2M, will be used to identify independent prognostic variables influencing clinical and 
molecular response.  
A total of [ADDRESS_322467] sufficient power (i.e., 80%) to detect 
associations of compl ete response with presence of an allele (e.g., 1 or 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_241710] 0) whose rate 
ratio is 3.5. For instance, if in truth 75% of patients with [ADDRESS_322468] complete response 
versus 20% with [ADDRESS_322469] 80% power to obtain a significant finding  (i.e., 
p<=0.05). This calculation assumes a complete response rate of 35% and genotype frequency of 
approximately 2 alleles: 15%, 1 allele: 45% and 0 alleles: 45%.  
 
Expected Results  
We anticipate finding an independent correlation between the FcgammaRIIIa -
158/FcgammaRIIa -[ADDRESS_322470] that rituximab acts by [CONTACT_265211]. For instance, FcγRI may play a role in 
rituximab imm unotherapy. FcγRI binding and its contribution to ADCC may be enhanced by 
[CONTACT_125433] -3, by [CONTACT_265212] (termed “inside -out” regulation). [31] 
Apart from ADCC, a CDC mechanism directed through C1qA may also play a role in long -term 
response and PFS in rituximab -treated follicular lymphoma patients. [32] Pharmacogenetics 
relating to bendamustine therapy such as CYP1A2 [33] or DNA repair enzyme 
polymorphisms [34, 35]  may play a role in the responses to bendamustine. When used in 
combination with chemotherapy, rituximab may prime malignant cells to the effects of cytotoxic 
chemother apy, as well as overcome chemotherapy resistance. [36] Rituximab may modulate the 
chemosensitivity of follicular lymphoma tumor cells by [CONTACT_265213] -2 and Bcl -
XL[36] and this phe nomenon would need to be explored further. Polymorphisms or mutations of 
the CD20 protein may correlate with rituximab sensitivity or resistance, [37] and can be further 
studied. Study of these alternative factors will enhance our understanding of targeted 
immunotherapy for follicular lymphoma.  
 
Feasibility  
An accrual of [ADDRESS_322471]. Successful demonstration of an association between FcγRIII and FcγRII 
polymorphisms and response to this novel combination of rituximab and bendamustine will 
enable predictive genomic testing for follicular lymphoma patients treated with this reg imen.  
 
Future Directions  
There are now a new generation of anti -CD20 mAbs including ofatumumab and GA101. 
Ofatumumab is a fully humanized anti -CD20 mAb which is approved for use in refractory 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and is an exploratory treatment fo r follicular lymphoma. 
Ofatumumab binds to a different epi[INVESTIGATOR_265166]20 compared to rituximab, and its mechanism of 
action is unknown, but likely functions through ADCC and/or CDC. A multicenter collaborative 
clinical trials working group has been establish ed that includes Dartmouth, Brown, and Yale. 
One of the ongoing clinical trials from this working group is studying the clinical response of 
ofatumumab combined with bortezomib in patients with low -grade B -cell NHL. The differences 
in immune mechanisms of rituximab and ofatumumab activity have not been well studied. The 
results and methods established from the current pi[INVESTIGATOR_265167]20 mAbs to understand these differences.

 46 APPENDIX G  
In order to correctly assess lymphoma response, please follow the guidelines:  
1. Determine lymphoma measurable disease  
a. Select a maximum of 6 lesions with the following features:  
i. Measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions  
ii. Representative of all involved organs/areas  
iii. Suitable for accurate repeat measurements  
iv. Include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease  
2. Determine lymphoma non -measurable disease  
a. Assessable Disease  
i. Masses that cannot be measured bi -dimensionally  
ii. Organ involvement (liver and spleen)  
iii. Recorded as “present” at baseline, then “no change”, “increased”, 
“decreased”, “absent” at follow up  
b. Bone marrow status  
i. Positive or negative for  lymphoma cells  
3. Report bi -dimensional nodal measurements  
a. Select sites and measure two longest diameters  
b. Multiply each node’s two longest diameters together  
c. Sum the Products of the greatest transverse Diameters (SPD or tumor size)  
d. Double check calculations  
e. Use correct units (cm)  
4. Calculating change:  
a. For response:   % Decrease=(baseline -current disease assessment)/baseline  
b. For progression: % Increase=(current disease assessment -smallest sum)/smallest 
sum

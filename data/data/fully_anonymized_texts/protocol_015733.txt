1.1 SYNOPSIS 
Title:  Dormir Mejor  Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted 
Digital Program of Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia for Spanish 
Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients  
Grant Number: HS024274  
Study Description:  This a parallel -group, single -site, [ADDRESS_1047892]  (+ usual care, and sleep hygiene brochure)  versus  minimally  
enhanced usual care ( mEUC)  (usual care + sleep hygiene brochure) . Follow -up 
assessments of insomnia symptoms and of secondary outcomes will be 
conducted at post -intervention (9 weeks)  and 6 months  follow -up by a staff 
member blinded to group assignment. Sleep duration and sleep efficiency will 
be assessed with actigraphy at baseline  (prior to randomization)  and at post -
intervention (9 weeks) . Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 
either the Culturally Adapted digital CBT -I program ( Somryst ) or minimally 
Enhanced Usual Care ( mEUC) condition. Randomization will be generated by a 
computerized random -number sequence and held by [CONTACT_4305]. 
The sequence will be unknown to research assistants enrolling patients.  Our 
primary hypothesis is that patients randomized to the Somryst treatment 
condition will experience a greater improvement (from baseline) in the 
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at post -intervention (9 weeks)  compared to those 
randomized to mEUC, and scores will continue to be better than mEUC 
patients at [ADDRESS_1047893] 
treatment versus those assigned to mEUC.  
Objectives: The primary objective  of the proposed study is to examine the effectiveness of 
a culturally adapted digital CBT- I program compared to minimally enhanced 
usual care ( mEUC) on primary outcomes: reduction in insomnia symptoms at [ADDRESS_1047894] -intervention . 
Exploratory outcomes will include actigraphy- assessed sleep duration and  sleep 
efficiency.

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  Endpoints: Primary Endpoint: Insomnia symptoms will be assessed at  baseline , at 9 weeks 
(post- intervention) and at [ADDRESS_1047895] -intervention follow -up using the ISI.  
Secondary Endpoints:  Health- related quality of life will be assessed through 
the validated Short -Form 12 (SF-12), Day time s leepi[INVESTIGATOR_764779] 8 -item Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_764780],  at  9-weeks , and 6-
months;  Satisfaction with care will be measured using a question adapted for 
this trial asking patients to rate the quality of professional care they have 
received for their symptoms of insomnia at post -intervention  and 6 -months ; 
Wake after sleep onset will be measured with self -report and actigraphy, and 
sleep onset latency will be measured with self -report at post -intervention.  
Sleep quality will be measured with the PSQI at baseline, [ADDRESS_1047896] -intervention 
using the ActiWatch SpectrumPRO, an actigraphy -based device.  
Study Population:  Two hundred Latina/o adult patients from primary care clinics affiliated with 
Columbia University Irving Medical Center and [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(the Ambulatory Care Network) that serves underserved communities across 
[LOCATION_001] City will be enrolled into the study. Patients will be Spanish speaking 
or bilingual (English and Spanish) adults with moder ate to severe insomnia 
symptoms as documented on initial eligibility screen, who are interested in 
receiving digital care to improve their insomnia  in Spanish .   
Phase II I trial   Phase or Stage: Description 
of Sites/Facilities Enrolling 
Participants: Patients will be recruited through flyers , email, telephone,  and primary care 
provider referrals from primary care clinics affiliated with Ambulatory Care 
Network (ACN) of [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (NYPH). The catchment areas

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  Description of Study 
Intervention /Experimental 
Manipulation : Study candidates who meet initial eligibility criteria and consent to participate 
will be invited for an online virtual  or in -person visit  dependent on participant 
preference where they will complete a baseline sociodemographic and 
psychosocial survey battery, and be asked to complete a daily sleep diary for 
14 days and to wear an actigraph (Actiwatch) that will be mailed to them to 
capture continuous objective sleep data on sleep duration and sleep efficiency 
for 14 days. Participants will be asked to return their actiwatch via mail. After 
completing the baseline assessment, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to eit her the intervention condition (Somryst)  or the comparator 
condition (Minimally Enhanced Usual Care ( mEUC). Patients in the intervention 
group will receive the culturally adapted digital CBT -I (Somryst), usual care by 
[CONTACT_200891] a sleep hygiene brochure. Patients will also be trained on how to 
record their daily sleep diaries using a smartphone diary; and will receive prompts on their smartphones or emails to remind them when to complete 
the daily sleep diaries. Patients randomized to the control group will receive 
minimally enhanced usual care  (mEUC) , which will include the usual care 
provided by [CONTACT_741719] P, and an informational brochure on sleep hygiene . 
Patients in both groups will have their insomnia severity assessed again at  9-
weeks  post -intervention and at 6-months  follow -up. Patients in both groups 
will also wear the Actiwatch  Spectrum Pro to objectively assess sleep for [ADDRESS_1047897] -intervention assessment .

2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE 
Chronic insomnia —dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or sleep quality that is associated with difficulty 
initiating or maintaining sleep, or waking too early, and with impaired daytime functioning for at least 
three months — is a national public health prob lem.1,[ADDRESS_1047904] prevalent sleep disorder in the US and 
is associated with poor health, increased risk of death, and significant economic costs.3–5 Over 30 million 
US adults and nearly 20% of primary care patients suffer from chronic insomnia.6–9 Importantly, the 
prevalence of insomnia is significantly higher in Hispanics (26.5%) than non -Hispanic Whites (22.5%),[ADDRESS_1047905] that 20% of adults seek treatment from a health care provider to manage their insomnia, and primary care providers commonly serve as the first source of treatment.

for chronic insomnia.15–[ADDRESS_1047907] of care. Further, pharmacotherapy far 
exceeds use of CBT -I despi[INVESTIGATOR_764783].17–[ADDRESS_1047908] access to high quality evidence -based 
behavioral health care such as CBT- I, 21–23 primarily because of the lack of available qualified bilingual 
behavioral providers trained to deliver CBT -I in Spanish and costs.24 Given the increasing prevalence of 
insomnia among Hispanics, and the linguistic realities of today’s behavioral healthcare work force, the demand for bilingual behavioral health providers equipped to deliver CBT -I in Spanish significantly 
outweighs the su pply. Advances in health information technology such as self -guided digital treatments 
represent an innovative and scalable means to address the supply and demand imbalance that perpetuates mental health care disparities; however,  its implementation in und erserved communities 
remains elusive.  
Recent technological advances in ehealth  or digital health  demonstrate great promise for improving 
access to CBT -I: self -guided CBT -I delivered via an online web -based platform is as effective as CBT -I 
delivered in -person.
25–32 However, the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested the effectiveness of 
digital versions of CBT -I were conducted outside of the primary care context in English -fluent, high 
socioeconomic status (SES), high health literacy, and non -Hispanic White samples.33–[ADDRESS_1047909] not been adapted for use among these underserved patient populations. 
Further, data on the barriers and facilitators of implementation of these digital behavioral treatments in 
underserved racial/ethnic minority populations were rarely collected or used to support its integration 
into primary care.  
This proposed study will use a Hybrid trial type [ADDRESS_1047910] that compares the effectiveness of a culturally adapted 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
[ADDRESS_1047911] prevalent sleep disorder in the United 
States (US), and is defined as dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or sleep quality that is associated with difficulty initiating or maintaining sle ep, or waking too early, and is accompanied by [CONTACT_764803].
1,2 Over 30 million Americans (10%),3,4 and nearly 20% of primary 
care patients6,7,36,[ADDRESS_1047912] 3 years in 50 -85% of those 
with the condition.37–39 Chronic insomnia also exerts a significant toll on the US economy. Over $[ADDRESS_1047913] costs associated with insomnia -attributable health care services or 
sleep aids,3,18 and insomnia is associated with higher rates of health care utilization (both medical and 
psychiatric care), daytime impairment, and occupational impairment.3,7,[ADDRESS_1047914] costs associated with 
insomnia are as high as $28 to $[ADDRESS_1047915] productivity due to absenteeism and presenteeism (attending work even while sick, fatigued), accidents, and reduced quality of life.
3,40– 42 
Chronic insomnia is associated with poor health and increased risk of death. Insomnia is linked to increased risk of incident hypertension, metabolic syndrome, myocardial infarction, stroke,
3,18,43 –48 and 
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.43,49 Insomnia also has a bidirectional association with psychiatric 
disorders. In many cases, insomnia co -occurs with, results from, or precedes the onset of depression and 
anxiety.50–54 For example, over 33% of people with insomnia also have a mental disorder.4 
Latina/os bear greater risk of chronic insomnia and sociocultural stressors may be important determinants 
of insomnia for Hispanic adults. Importantly, the prevalence of insomnia is significantly higher among 
Hispanics (26.5%) than non -Hispanic Whites (22.5%),55 and this disparity is widening over time.10 Temporal 
analyses using the National Health Interview Survey indicate that the age -adjusted prevalence of insomnia 
among Hispanic/Latino adults was 16.6% in 2002 compared to 19.3% in 2012.10 Additionally, analyses of 
over 5,000 participants in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos indicates that acculturative stress, or the stress associated with integration and adaptation to the US mainland, is 
strongly predictive of insomnia severity (Exp(b)=1.15 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.18).
[ADDRESS_1047916] that 60% of adults take some action to manage their insomnia while the remaining 40% do nothing at all or assume it will go away with time.
11,12 Only 20% of adults seek treatment from a health care provider for their 
insomnia, and primary care providers serve as the first source of treatment.11,12,40 However, primary care 
providers often consider insomnia to be secondary to other psychological or physical health issues, and behavioral treatments for insomnia are rarely considered or available.
57,58 Indeed, a recent review 
identified a number of primary care provider barriers to insomnia treatment including: inadequate training, time -constrained office visits, lack of discussion of sleep issues, inaccurate beliefs by [CONTACT_764804], the perception among providers that

18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  insomnia treatments are ineffective and associated with significant risks, and the lack of a research base 
showing that treatment of insomnia improves outcomes and co -morbid conditions.18 These barriers 
contribute to an overall underdiagnosis and undertreatment of chronic insomnia in the primary care setting.
18 
Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT -I), a robustly effective psychological treatment with large 
effect sizes and proven long -term benefit over medications, is the recommended first -line of treatment 
for insomnia. Pharmacotherapy (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_764784] -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] [sedating 
antidepressants]) and CBT -I are two treatments with considerable evidence to support their effectiveness 
in the clinical management of insomnia.[ADDRESS_1047917] in the short 
term.33,37,59 –[ADDRESS_1047918], CBT -I, 
which combines cognitive therapy to address maladaptive beliefs and expectations about sleep, with behavioral treatments (e.g., sleep restriction, stimulus control), often implemented over 6 -8 weeks, 
results in more sustained benefits over time; CBT -I also has large effect sizes (e.g., wake after sleep onset 
improved by 26 minutes (95%CI: 15.48, 36.52).
13,14,38,[ADDRESS_1047919] before pharmacotherapy is initiated.38,64 
Use of pharmacotherapy far exceeds use of CBT -I for the treatment of chronic insomnia in the primary 
care setting despi[INVESTIGATOR_764785].16 Use of the 
commonly prescribed hypnotic, zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_252211] (Ambien), was implicated in 11.5% of adult psychiatric medication adverse drug emergency department (ED) visits in 2009 -2011, a rate which was markedly 
higher than that of any other drug.
65 Zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_764786] 32.1% of all psychiatric medication 
ED visits for falls or head injuries.65 Concerns about sleep medication side effects – dependence, and 
adverse drug events – loom large among both patients and primary care providers.18 Importantly, when 
offered a choice, up to 75% of patients prefer behavioral treatments over pharmacotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia.
17 Thus, there is an urgent need to expand access to 
evidence based and patient -preferred alternatives to pharmacotherapy for insomnia in the primary care 
setting.  
Latina/os are less likely to have access to high quality behavioral health care, such as CBT -I, and this is 
especially true for Spanish -speakers. On average, Hispanics receive lower quality mental health care than 
their non -Hispanic White counterparts.21–23 Limited English proficiency patients experience greater 
barriers to receipt of comprehensive behavioral health care. Indeed, 20% of Spanish speakers do not seek healthcare because of language barriers.
22 Given the rise of insomnia among Hispanics, and the linguistic 
realities of today’s behavioral healthcare work force, the demand for bilingual behavioral health providers equipped to deliver CBT -I in Spanish significantly outweighs the supply.  
While cognitive -behavioral therapy for insomnia is a robustly effective treatment with structured core 
components that can be adapted and tailored for use among underserved populations, no extant studies of CBT -I have targeted Spanish speakers. We conducte d a systematic review of behavioral treatments for 
sleep problems to determine whether these treatments were adapted for vulnerable populations. Of the 22 studies included, 8 focused on insomnia and only 5 contained some form of adaptation. Modifications included accommodating the setting and length of the intervention. No modifications were made for 
Spanish language or other sociocultural factors. Yet, racial/ethnic and language minorities who receive a 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
[ADDRESS_1047920] impeded its uptake in primary care.18 Indeed, “could not afford cost” is often cited as the most 
common reason among adults aged [ADDRESS_1047921], scalable behavioral interventions for chronic insomnia.  
The RCTs testing CBT -I excluded Spanish -speakers. Many of the RCTs testing CBT- I had stringent inclusion 
criteria and were conducted in academic research centers, among patients with high socioeconomic status (mean education is 16.4 years) and with high levels of health literacy and numeracy.
33,34,69,70 The 
RCTs that were conducted in community settings 71–[ADDRESS_1047922] not been implemented in underserved racial/ethnic communities such as Hispanic communities. Internet -based CBT- I produces reductions in insomnia that are comparable to 
those achieved through in -person CBT- I.
25,29– [ADDRESS_1047923] ess mental health care disparities. Indeed, Internet penetration among 
Hispanics in the US is at an all -time high, with 51% of Spanish -speaking and English -speaking Hispanic 
adults aged 18 and older reporting accessing the Internet via broadband at home, compared to 66% of 
non- Hispanic Whites.
[ADDRESS_1047924] mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers in 
shares similar to Whites76 and Hispanics are more likely than Whites to use their smartphones to access 
health information.76 Advances in health information technology such as self -guided digital treatments 
represent an innovative and scalable means to address the supply and demand imbalance that perpetuates mental health care disparities; however its implementation in underserved communities remains elusive.  
The specific barriers and facilitators for the successful implementation of digital CBT- I for Spanish speakers 
in primary care are unknown. While recent efforts within the Veterans Health Administration have focused on the implementation of in -person CBT- I,
[ADDRESS_1047925] conducted an assessment of 
the implementation context for digital treatments for insomnia. Further, data on the barriers and 
facilitators of implementation of these digital behavioral treatments in underserved racial/ethnic minority 
populations were rarely collected or used to support its integration into primary care. Emergent hybrid 
effectiveness- implementation study designs77 offer great promise for the formal conduct of comparative 
effectiveness research and the identification of organizational, provider, and patient implementation 
factors that may affect successful integration of digital CBT- I. For example, this study design will allow us 
to assess treatment acceptability, providers’ engagement with intervention implementation, patients’ 
intervention self -efficacy, and compatibility of intervention with healthcare setting priorities.

brochure)  vs. minimally enhanced usual care ( mEUC; usual care plus sleep hygiene bro chure). This is a 
parallel -group, single -site, 2-arm study.  
Patients will be recruited through flyers , email, telephone,  and primary care provider referrals from 
primary care clinics affiliated with Ambulatory Care Network (ACN) of [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(NYPH). The catchment areas are the ACN clinics of NYPH, which serve 1.4 million individuals in NYC, including lo w socioeconomic and racially/ethnically diverse communities in NYC such as Washington 
Heights, Inwood, Harlem, and the Southwest Bronx (31% African American; 61% Hispanic descent), as well as geographically broader communities, including Queens (11% Africa n American; 25% Hispanic; 11% 
Asian/Pacific Islander).  
We will enroll [ADDRESS_1047938] that will compare the 
effectiven ess the culturally -adapted  digital CBT -I (Somryst ) program versus minimally enhanced usual care 
(mEUC). Participants in the intervention arm will receive digital CBT -I, usual care by [CONTACT_200891] a sleep 
hygiene brochure. Patients in the intervention group will also be trained on how to record their daily sleep 
diaries using a smartphone and will receive prompts on their smartphones or emails to remind them when to complete the daily sleep diaries. Patients randomized to the comparator  group will receive minimally 
enhanced usual care , which will include usual care  by [CONTACT_200891] a sleep hygiene brochure . Patients in 
both groups will have their insomnia severity assessed again at post- intervention (9 weeks)  and [ADDRESS_1047939]- intervention assessment.   
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
This is a single- site, parallel -group, 2-arm superiority randomized controlled trial of digital CBT -I (Somryst 
+ usual care + sleep hygiene brochure) vs. minimally enhanced usual care (mEUC) . Patients randomized 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
[ADDRESS_1047940] of care in that clinic from their 
primary care provider (which may include pharmacotherapy). We have labeled the condition “ minimally 
enhanced” because participants will be provided with a  sleep hygiene brochure . Minimally EUC was 
chosen as the comparator because it is of high clinical relevance, will allow us to determine if the adapted 
digital CBT- I is superior to usual care, and addresses ethical issues (i.e., identifying but no t treating 
insomnia).78 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION 
The digital CBT -I program used in this intervention (Somryst) is based off SHUTi , an interactive and 
tailored English -language web -based program modeled on the primary tenets of face -to-face CBT- I shown 
to be effective at reducing insomnia symptoms .26 Participants will be asked to complete six cores (main 
intervention content) during the 9 -week intervention period (a new Core becomes available 7 days after 
completion of the previous one). After completing a Core, they can review that Core at any time, a nd 
access program worksheets from the My Stuff section of the mobile program. The six cores are based on 
the primary treatment components provided in face -to-face cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia.6,[ADDRESS_1047941] behavioral treatment for insomnia , adaptations of CBT- I to 
other languages and cultural contexts is necessary.  The digital CBT -I (Somryst) has been adapted using a 
rigorous cultural adaptation framework. We used Barrera et al.’s cultural adaptation framework79 to 
conduct formative qualitative research (N=18) and one -on-one personal interviews (N=13) with Spanish -
speaking Latinx adults from the NYC region with chronic insomnia about digital cognitive behavioral 
therapy for insomnia for funded hybrid Type 1 effec tiveness- implementation R01  trial (HS024274). As 
part of this process, participant input and feedback about sleep hygiene guidelines and ways in which 
these guidelines could be adapted for their urban context was obtained. Participants identified the need  
for key deep- level content changes to traditional sleep hygiene education, including adaptations for 
socioeconomic status and urban settings such as living in multi -generational households, living in 
apartments and small spaces that required creating sepa rate zones within one room, potential inability 
to regulate room temperatures, and limited control of noise or light pollution,  as well as adaptations to 
sleep hygiene guidelines for safety concerns . Other important adaptations that were made were related  
to the salience of immigrant identity, country of origin/heritage group, the importance of family, and adaptations for health literacy and numeracy.

Children under 18 years will not be included in the study. They will not be included as chronic insomnia 
is much less common in children than in adults.  
5.3 LIFESTYLE CONSIDERATIONS  
During this study , participants are asked to: 
•Refrain from starting  specialty behavioral treatment or pharmacotherapy for insomnia.
•Should not be planning  on becoming pregnant in the 8 -month duration of the study.
•Remain available during the  study period , and as such should refrain from  leaving the country
for an extended period of time
If a participant has used prohibited medications , if they become pregnant during the study duration , or 
leave the country for extended periods of time,  that will result in early  study intervention discontinuation  
by [CONTACT_1704].  
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in this study  but are not 
subsequently assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that 
are likely to change over time may be rescreened. Examples include participation in night shift work, 
pregnancy, change in psychotropic medications for depression in past [ADDRESS_1047945] 1 
month, caregiving for infant <3 months of age or unavailability during the study period. Rescreened 
participants will be assigned the same participant number as for the initial screening.  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  We will enroll 200 Hispanic /Latinx women and men in equal proportion (50% women, 50% men). 
Participants will be from several racial groups (27 % American Indian,  15% Black or African American, and 
58% other races or multiple).  Participants will be ages 18 -65 years old. Participants will be recruited 
through flyers , email, telephone , and primary care provider referrals from the primary care clinics 
affiliated with Columbia University Irving Medical Center and [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] (the 
Ambulatory Care Network) that serves underserved communities across [LOCATION_001] City by [CONTACT_764807] -centered care. Recruitment will be conducted remotely or in person 
ensuring  safety measures are in line with  COVID- [ADDRESS_1047946] insomnia questionnaire (the Insomnia Severity Index) to determine study eligibility according 
to severity of insomnia, and only those patients with a positive insomnia screen who are eligible to 
participate  will be invited for a remote study visit, or an in -person visit dependent on participant 
preference .  
For Spanish -speaking patients: We also have developed a range of strategies aimed at racial/ethnic 
minority patient populations from which we recruit and consent. In particular, we are sensitive to the cultural diversity of our population and appreciative of language barriers, issues that must be addressed 
for successful recruitment and retention of participants. To accommodate the Hispanic /Latinx 
community in [LOCATION_001] City and the surrounding boroughs, the consent and research participant forms will be in Spanish  and written at a [ADDRESS_1047947] been informed by [CONTACT_764808]. For our current 
studies, approximately 75% of our research staff is bilingual and we intend to keep our proportion of 
Spanish speaking staff at about the same proportion  in this project. Hispanic /Latinx participants will be 
provided with a copy of the consent form and HIPAA form in Spanish. A verbal explanation by a bilingual 
research member will be provided as well. All ensuing questions will be answered, and participants will 
then be allowed to sign the consent form and HIPAA form.  
Participant incentives 
There are no direct benefits to completing the screener. All adult participants have the opportunity to 
receive up to $ [ADDRESS_1047948] Treatment Group (up to $ 180 total):

6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  ADMINISTRATION  
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DESCRIPTION  
Intervention Arm: digital CBT -I (Somryst ), usual care, and sleep hygiene brochure.  
Patients who are randomized to Somryst will receive the Spanish -language version of the culturally 
adapted Somryst, a self -guided digital program of CBT- I, the usual care provided by [CONTACT_145482], and a sleep 
hygiene brochure. Somryst, is an interactive and tailored mobile -based program modeled on the primary 
tenets of face -to-face CBT- I, the web version has been  shown to be effective at reducing insomnia 
symptoms.25,26  
Patients will be asked to complete six cores (main intervention content) during the 9-week intervention 
period (a new Core becomes available 7 days after completion of the previous one). After completing a 
Core, they can review that Core at any time, and access program worksheets from the My Stuff section of 
the mobile program  (App) . 
The six cores are based on the primary treatment components provided in face- to-face cognitive  
behavioral therapy for insomnia.6,14 The Behavioral Cores incorporate sleep restriction and stimulus 
control, providing patients with a variety of “rules” to follow in order to retrain their bodies to associate sleep with bed. Stimulus control aims to reduce the anxiety or conditioned arousal  individuals may feel 
when attempting to go to bed. Sleep restriction is a form of systematic mild sleep deprivation in which a 
sleep window is maintained to allow the body to relearn proper sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_764791]. The Educational  Core (also called Sleep Hygiene) focuses on general education about sleep 
(e.g., understanding the different types of sleep problems) and improving sleep hygiene and other maladaptive behaviors (e.g., establishing regular sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_764792], eliminating n appi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and avoiding 
nicotine, caffeine, exercise, and drinking alcohol before bedtime). The Cognitive Core (also called Cognitive Restructuring) attempts to address and change the negative beliefs and thoughts about sleep

18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  that may exacerbate sleep difficulties. In addition to these main Cores, there are two other Cores: the 
Overview and Consolidation/Relapse Prevention Cores. These are critical for each user to receive in order to introduce intervention content and provide a rationale for the intervention (Overview); and integrate 
the educational, behavioral, and cognitive elements, promote adherence, generalize the information, help the user identify risk situations, and incorporate strategies to reduce relapse (Relapse Pre vention). 
Somryst relies on user -entered online Sleep Diaries to track progress and to tailor treatment 
recommendations (i.e., assign a “sleep restriction” window). Intervention content is enhanced through a variety of interactive features, including personalized go al-setting, graphical feedback based on inputted 
symptoms, animations/illustrations to enhance comprehension, quizzes to test user knowledge, patient 
vignettes, and video -based expert explanation.  
The primary outcome, insomnia symptoms, will be assessed using the ISI at baseline, a t post- intervention 
(9 weeks),  and at a  6-month follow -up. Health- related quality of life, sleep quality,  secondary outcome s, 
will also be assessed at the same endpoints as ISI. Daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], another secondary outcome will 
also be assessed at baseline and at the post- intervention (9 weeks), and 6- month follow -up visit. 
Satisfaction with care and sleep quality will be assessed at baseline and at post- intervention (9 weeks)  
and 6- months,  and sleep  duration and efficiency  will be assessed [ADDRESS_1047956]- intervention (9 - weeks) . 
Comparator  Arm: minimally Enhanced Usual Care ( mEUC)-  (usual care + sleep hygiene brochure)  
Patients randomized to the mEUC condition will continue to receive the typi[INVESTIGATOR_764793] (which may include pharmacotherapy) . We have labeled the 
condition “ minimally enhanced” because patients will be provided with a sleep hygiene brochure . 
Minimally EUC was chosen as the comparator because it is of high clinical relevance, will allow us to 
determine if the adapted digital CBT- I is superior to usual care, and addresses ethical issues (i.e., 
identifying but not treating insomnia).
78 Patients randomized to mEUC will complete assessments on the 
same schedule as those randomized to the intervention arm.  
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
Somryst  is self- guided  as it is a mobile  or digital program . Intervention content is metered out over time 
through 6 “Cores:” psychoeducation, sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and relapse prevention. Users obtain access to a new Core 7 days after completion of previous Core. Participants will complete the program in 6 -9 weeks. A Core is expected to take 45 – [ADDRESS_1047957] participants 30 – 
[ADDRESS_1047958] relies on user -entered online daily Sleep Diaries to track progress and to 
tailor treatment recommendations (i.e., assign a “sleep restriction” window ). A complete dose is 
considered completion of [ADDRESS_1047959] inf ormation about number of sleep diaries 
completed, number of notifications sent, number of days to complete intervention.  
6.2 FIDELITY 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
[ADDRESS_1047960]  is self -guided and delivered completely via mobile App, fidelity to the intervention 
content will be 100% since there are no interventionists. Study personnel will train participants on the use 
of Somryst via a virtual Zoom meeting  at the randomization visit .  A checklist for the training session will 
be developed for study personnel which will include a standard set of app functions to review such as how 
to sign on and off of the app, how to navigate the app, and where to find help information on the app.  
Study videos related to downloading the app and completing sleep diaries will be available to participants 
and posted on the study website.  
Protocol compliance will be reviewed during weekly meetings between [CONTACT_764821], TBN (Project 
Coordinator) and the research assistants, as well as at monthly meetings (more frequent if required) 
between [CONTACT_764821] and the other co -Is (Drs. Kronish, Schwartz, Moise). Finally, the Project 
Coordinator  will perform a random audit of 5% of study visits, and provide continual feedback to 
improve the quality of informed consent and data collection.  
We have a number of strategies to ensure the quality of the data. First, the web -based electronic data 
entry system we will use “forces” responses to most questionnaire items before allowing progression 
through the particular interview’s template, thereby [CONTACT_764809]. For some items, delayed data entry is possible. Fu rther, each time the research coordinator logs into the secure 
data entry system, it prompts pop up on the initial screen showing what data elements remain incomplete, t o encourage complete data capture. After enrollment of the first [ADDRESS_1047961]. Alcantara will examine the data to ensure adequacy and accuracy of data collection. Finally, as mentioned above, the DSMB will also revie w data completeness, accuracy, 
and timeliness.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
Randomization . After completing the baseline assessment, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_1047962] or minimally Enhanced Usual Care ( mEUC) condition. 
Randomization will be generated by a computerized random -number sequence programmed  by [CONTACT_764810], password -protected, encrypted data tracking 
program . The sequence will be unknown to research assistants enrolling patients.  
Blinding.  One research staff member (TBN)  will be responsible for randomizing participants  and so this 
research assistant and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_764794] . Participants will also be unblinded to 
study condition since treatment condition s will be obvious to them. Research assistants conducting the 
post- intervention (9 weeks)  and 6- month outcome assessments will be blinded to participants’ 
treatment condition , as this is preferred to minimize risk of bias in  outcome ascertainment.  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE  
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  Participants will be asked to complete daily sleep diaries and weekly Cores  (6 total) over a 9 -week  (63 
days)  period. Research staff will receive weekly information about participant engagement with the digital 
treatment, including number of log -ins, number of minutes to complete core, number of sleep diaries 
completed, and time elapsed since completion of core. In the event that participants have not started the 
App, a notification reminder is sent every day for 8 days. Also, periodic notifications are sent after a set 
period of non -activity. Please see Appendix of Administrative forms  for example notification log.    
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
For this protocol, participants may not begin any specialized behavioral treatment or pharmacotherapy 
for insomnia for the duration of the study.

PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
When a participant discontinues from  Somryst  but not from the study, remaining study procedures will 
be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690].   If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified ( including, 
but not limited to changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or quali fied designee will 
determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be 
reported as an adverse event (AE). 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• The reason(s) for discontinuing the participant from the intervention, and methods f or
determining the need to discontinue  
• If the participant is due to complete assessments within 2 weeks of being discontinued from the
study intervention, those assessments will be administered at the time of discontinuation; if the next 
scheduled assessments are more than 2 weeks from the discontinuation date, the discontinued 
participant will wait for the next scheduled assessment. Thereafter, the participant will be included in all 
future scheduled assessments, even though not participating in the intervention .

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE S TUDY 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue a participant from  the study for the following reasons:  
•Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up
study data would not be in the best interest of the participant  or might require an additional
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study
•The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously
recognized) that precludes further study participation
The reason for participant discontinuation from the study will be recorded on the  Case Report Form ( CRF)  
accessed through the data management platform . Participants  who sign the informed consent form and 
are randomized but do not receive the study intervention may be replaced.  Participants  who sign the 
informed consent form, and are randomized and receive the study intervention , and subsequently 
withdraw, or are discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.

required study visit:  
•The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299] , reschedule the missed visit within 14 days,  counsel
the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study
•Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make ever y
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and  texts, i f

Overview : 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  Study candidates who meet initial eligibility criteria and consent to participate will be invited for an 
office visit or a virtual visit where they will complete a baseline sociodemographic and psychosocial 
survey  battery, and be asked to complete a daily sleep diary for 14 days and to wear an actigraph 
(Actiwatch) to capture continuous objective sleep data on sleep duration and sleep efficiency for 14 
days. Participants will be asked to return their actiwatch via mail. After completing the baseline assessment, patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_1047964] 
intervention condition or to minimally Enhanced Usual Care ( mEUC) condition. Patients in the 
intervention group receive digital CBT -I, usual care, and a sleep hygiene brochure. Patients will also be 
trained on how to record their daily sleep diaries using a smartphone diary; and will receive prompts on their smartphones or emails to remind them when to complete the daily sleep diaries. Patients 
randomized to the control group will receive minimally enhanced usual care , which will include usual 
care provided by [CONTACT_200891] a sleep hygiene brochure . Patients in both groups will have their 
insomnia severity assessed a gain at a post- intervention (9 weeks) and 6- months. Patients in both groups 
will also wear the ActiwatchSpectrum Pro to objectively assess sleep for [ADDRESS_1047965]- intervention (9 weeks) . 
All study surveys will be administered by [CONTACT_764811] a teleconference platform  or in-
person dependent on participant preference . 
Screening & Primary Endpoint : 
All interested patients will complete a standard screening questionnaire to determine study eligibility 
according to severity of insomnia. Basic sociodemographic and technological literacy information will be collected. Insomnia symptoms in the past 2 weeks will be measured with the Insomnia -Severity Index 
(ISI) in order to assess severity of ins omnia.
80  The ISI has excellent psychometric properties, and is 
reliable and valid in English,80 and adapted for use in Spanish -speaking populations.81 Changes in 
insomnia symptoms will also serve as the primary outcome.  
Baseline:  
Study candidates who meet initial eligibility criteria and consent to participate will be invited to a virtual 
online visit where they will complete a baseline sociodemographic and psychosocial survey battery .  
Secondary Outcomes: Health- related quality of life will be assessed through the validated Short -Form 12 (SF-12), which is a 12-
item self -report inventory that generically measures quality of life; it yields a measure of global health -
related wellbeing as [ADDRESS_1047966]-

Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_764795] [ADDRESS_1047967]- intervention (9 weeks)  and 6- month follow -up. 
Satisfaction with care will be measured using a question adapted for this trial asking patients to rate the 
quality of professional care they have received for their symptoms of insomnia.[ADDRESS_1047968]- intervention visit (9 weeks) . Based on current best practices66 of cultural 
adaptation of evidence -based interventions, we will also ask participants in the intervention group to

Other Measures: Sociodemographic Information will be collected at screening including, age, sex, 
race, country of origin, educational attainment, nativity status, household income, employment status, 
and health insurance status. Direct health care costs will consist of the retail costs of Somryst (payer’s 
costs plus patient out -of-pocket costs). Structured interviews will gather information about health care 
utilization (primary care, other ambulatory care, emergency department, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]). Indirect

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
This protocol uses the definition of a dverse event from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention -
related . 
An adverse event will be defined as any undesirable symptom, accident, or medical condition 
considered related or possibly related to the intervention. Medical conditions present before the intervention will be considered adverse events only if they worsen  after starting the study and that 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
[ADDRESS_1047971] of research occurring in human subjects as a result of the collection of identifiable private information under the research.  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Serious adverse event: The adverse event will be deemed serious if it is determined to be associated or possibly associated with study involvement, and results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -
threatening adverse experience, in -subject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_1081], a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical 
events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128151] c onsidered a 
serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severi ty.  
•No adverse event or within normal limits
•Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily
activities.
•Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeuti c
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.
•Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or
incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.
•Life-threatening or disabling adverse event
•Fatal adverse event
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
All adverse events ( AEs) will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention , 
assessed  by [CONTACT_9152] -trained clinician  (PI [INVESTIGATOR_764796] -I) based on temporal relationship 
and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories 
below.  
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  •Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory te st
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study procedures administration and cannot be
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of th e
study procedures should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically o r
phenomenologically definitive .
•Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of othe r
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a
reasonable time after  administration of the study procedures, is unlikely to be attributed to
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on
withdrawal.
•Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the eve nt
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of study procedures ). However, other
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, othe r
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or
“definitely related”, as appropriate.
•Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whos e
temporal relationship to study procedures administration makes a causal relationship improbable
(e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study
procedures) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausibleexplanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).
•Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study  procedures administration, and/
or
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be analternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370]. ]
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS 
A clinician  (general internist)  with appropriate expertise in insomnia will be responsible for determining 
whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described 
for the study procedures.  
Anticipated or expected adverse events will include: initial discomfort/embarrassment from discussion 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_764797] a sensitive nature or wearing the actigraph, initial tiredness/fatigue from the sleep restriction component of the intervention, and particip ant confidentiality and privacy concerns about 
sharing personal information on a digital platform.  
Potentially intervention related serious adverse events will include fatigue -related accidents (motor 
vehicle accidents, work -related accidents) .

Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
All AEs , not otherwise precluded per the protocol,  will be captured on the appropriate  case report form 
(CRF) . Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of 
severity, relationship to study procedures  (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] 
a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. 
Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_9111] . 
Research Staff will record events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained 
until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each study 
visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrenc e of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be 
followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
Any adverse event (AE) or unanticipated problem will be identified, responded to, recorded by [CONTACT_978]. If the AE or problem is unexpected, related to study involvement, and puts the participant at increased 
risk, it will be reported to the Columbia IRB immediately, in accordance with local policies, in addition to the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) and if necessary, AHRQ.  All other AEs and problems will 
be reported at the time of continuing renewal.  
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING 
In consultation with the PI, a trained member of the study team  (study physicians, Moise, Kronish)  will be  
responsible for conducting an evaluation of a serious adverse event  and shall report the results of such 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
[ADDRESS_1047972] ( IRB) as soon as possible, but in no 
event later than [ADDRESS_1047973] 
N/A 8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
Pregnancy is not reported as an adverse event. In the event of a pregnancy during trial participant, 
participants will be asked to discontinue the study intervention.  
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS 
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by t he Office for Human Research 
Protections (OHRP) .  OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to  participants or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
•Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the
participant population being studied;
•Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_764812]); and
•Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.

18 May  2022  
NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and t o the Data Safety and Monitoring Board /AHRQ . The UP report will include the following 
information:  
•Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB proje ct
number
•A detailed description of the event, i ncident, experience, or outcome
•An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome
represents an UP
•A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or
are proposed in response to the UP
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline: 
•UPs that are s erious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the Data Safety and
Monitoring Board/AHRQ  immediately within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the
event
•Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and to the DCC/study sponsor /funding agency within  14
days of the investigato r becoming aware of the problem
•All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_764813]’s
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for
Human Research Protections ( OHRP)  within 30 days of the IRB’s receipt of the report of th e
problem from the investigator

8.4.[ADDRESS_1047974] or pre -register our planned analysis plan in clinicaltrials.gov . Information will be provided on 
the analysis plan for the primary endpoint.   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
[Primary endpoint] Our primary hypothesis is that patients randomized to the Somryst treatment will experience a greater improvement (from baseline) in the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) at post-
intervention (9 weeks)  compared to those randomized to mEUC, and scores will continue to be better 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia  for Spanish Speaking Latina/o Primary Care Patients   
[ADDRESS_1047975] treatment versus those 
assigned mEUC.  
[Secondary endpoint s] Our secondary hypothesis is that Somryst will result in greater improvement in 
quality of life, as captured by [CONTACT_764814] -[ADDRESS_1047976] and mEUC participants. We will use the validated method of Brazier et al. to calculate 
utilities (QALY penalties) from  baseline and post- intervention (9 weeks)  SF-[ADDRESS_1047977] deviation (SD) of post- intervention change  scores being 4 to 5 
points. Our expectation is that the improvement in patients assigned to the intervention condition (Somryst ) will be 8 points or greater, and that those assigned to minimally enhanced usual care ( mEUC) 
will exhibit a [ADDRESS_1047978] the SD of change scores to increase for longer 
inter vals (e.g., 6 or 12 months), and have therefore conservatively based our power calculations on a SD 
(change) of 6.0. Accordingly, randomization of [ADDRESS_1047979]  versus m EUC (1 -to-1 ratio) will 
provide 90% power to detect a differential reduction ( post- intervention and 6 -month follow -up) in ISI of 
[ADDRESS_1047980]. This sample size 
estimate allows for up to 15% attrition, such that we have baseline data on all 200 patients (collec ted 
prior to randomization), but follow -up data on only 170.  
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
All primary analyses will be conducted according to the intent -to-treat principle, with all randomized 
patients included in the analysis and their group classification ( Somryst  versus  minimally EUC) based on 
the condition to which they were randomly assigned.  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
The distributions of all clinical measures will be reviewed for outliers. Those exhibiting substantial 
skewness will be transformed (e.g., log or square root) to make their distribution more appropriate for parametric procedures. Independent- sample t -tests and chi -square analyses will be used to examine 
baseline differences between the two treat ment groups (Somryst  vs. m EUC) in clinical and 
Dormir Mejor Study: Randomized Controlled Trial of a Culturally Adapted Digital Treatment of  Cognitive-

NIH Protocol Template for Behavioral and Social Sciences Research  sociodemographic characteristics. All primary analyses will be conducted according to the intent -to-treat 
principle, with all randomized patients included in the analysis and their group classification ( Somryst  
versus m EUC) based on the condition to which they were randomly assigned.  
. 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S) 
Mixed- model RM -ANOVA will be used to estimate and compare the changes in the primary endpoint 
(ISI) and other patient- important outcomes (e.g., insomnia symptom severity, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]) 
between Somryst and mEUC. The RM -ANOVA model will include Group  (Somryst versus mEUC), Time 
(baseline , post- intervention and 6 -month follow -up), and the Group × Time interaction as fixed factors 
with an unstructured residuals covariance matrix. This will yield estimates of the within -group means 
and standard errors at each assessment. Specific interaction contrasts (e.g., Group × Pre -vs-Post 
Intervention) will be estimated to estimate the magnitude and test the statistical significance of the 
differential change in insomnia symptoms using the Wald χ2 statistic. We will plot the mean insomnia 
scores across assessments, stratified by [CONTACT_39815] p, to elucidate the nature of the interaction (i.e., 
whether Somryst resulted in significantly greater improvements [or lesser worsening ] than m EUC). If, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_39470], the two groups differ substantially (p<0.10 after stepdown Bonferroni 
correction) on one or more sociodemographic or clinical factors assessed at baseline, sensitivity analyses 
will be performed in which these factors are included as covariates in the RM -ANOVA, in order to rule 
out the possibility that the results from the primary an alyses are attributable to group differences on 
these factors.  The same analyses will be repeated to estimate and compare changes in the primary 
endpoint and secondary endpoints between Somryst and mEUC at [ADDRESS_1047981] -intervention and 6 -months follow -
up will be evaluated.   In addition, estimated marginal means ± 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated for each assessment point and Cohen’s d will be used as an estimate of effect size for the change from baseline to each assessment point.   
Missing Data: We will use multilevel mixed models to perform intent -to-treat RM -ANOVA. There will be 
no missing data at baseline, because we will only randomize patients who have successfully completed the baseline assessment, and therefore all [ADDRESS_1047982] to data that are “missing at random” . This will appropriately handle the possibil ity 
that attrition (or missing data) is related to either baseline level of the outcome measure , group 
assignment , or their interaction . However, if we discover that attrition is associated with some other 
characteristic (e.g., sex or age), we will use multiple imputation (chained equation approach
104, 105) and 
include the associated characteristic in the imputation model.[ADDRESS_1047983] 
data on the reasons for dropout, who decided the participant should drop out (e.g., their PCP), and whether the dropout involves any aspect of participation in the study. Even if the patient drops out of the inter vention, we will still seek to collect their key outcome information. We will compare key 
characteristics of participants with and without missing data. In cases where there are large differences

9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) 
For secondary endpoints, , we will follow Hochberg ’s step- up approach as outlined in Figure 2.  
Coupled  with  our primary hypothesis that CBT -I will result in improved ISI scores, a secondary hypothesis 
is that CBT -I will result in greater improvement in quality of life, as captured by [CONTACT_764814] -[ADDRESS_1047985] -intervention in both the CBT -I and mEUC participants. We will use

include out -of-pocket medical costs and costs of lost productivity (both due to participation in Somryst  
sessions and due to poor sleep quality).  For the main analysis from the  payer’s point of view, we will 
include cumulative CBT -I costs for the intervention arm payers and patients’ combined costs to access and 
complete the web -based CBT- I intervention), and  for both CBT -I and mEUC  we will gather cumulat ive 
utilization data on medications, office visits, emergency department visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_764798]. We anticipate that most of these data can be gathered from EPIC the electronic health 
record (EHR) used in the AIM Clinic and [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307], but participant follow up 
interviews will both validate electronic record data and capture any health care utilization at outside clinics and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Health facility visit costs will be entered as t he reimbursement for tha t visit type 
specified by [CONTACT_41685]99 fee schedule. Mean wholesale medication 
prices will be estimated from the most recent “Redbook” listing of wholesale drug costs. For the secondary 
analysis from the  patient’s point of view , we will analyze data from participant interviews data on out -of-
pocket medication costs, office visit co -pays, and lost compensation and missed work. Productivity losses 
will be estimated by [CONTACT_764816] -specific labor force participation rates  by [CONTACT_764817] -specific U.S.

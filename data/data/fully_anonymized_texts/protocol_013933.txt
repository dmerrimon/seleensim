 Aim 
To prospectively compare the incidence of biliary complications after liver 
transplan tation in patients who are randomized to undergo biliary reconstruction with and 
without biliary stents.  
 Secondary Aim  
To retrospectively evaluate the incidence of  biliary complications after liver 
transplantation in non- randomized patients who undergo biliary reconstruction with or 
without biliary stents in the same time period.  
 Background  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_461332], biliary 
reconstruction remains a major hurdle.  Morbidity related to biliary complications has been estimated to be as high as 30%.
[ADDRESS_589943]. One of the main techniques of performing biliary reconstruction is a choledochocholedochostomy which can be performed over an anastomotic stent.  Although placement of biliary stents is routine practice in many liver transplant centers around the country, there is no evidence to support their use. As of now both the placement and non -placement of a stent are essentially “standard of care. What has been 
extensively studied in the literature is the use T -tubes. In the early years of liver 
transplant, T -tubes were touted as a great mechanism to prevent anastomotic biliary 
strictures.
[ADDRESS_589944] -operative biliary strictures without the added risk of biliary 
complications  seen with T -tubes. It is expected that the stent will migrate out on its own 
in the early days/weeks after a transplant . However, the practice of using stents in biliary 
anastomosis is not uniform and there are no established guidelines to support their  
indiscriminate ap plication.  We have designed a prospective randomized trial to evaluate 
the effect of stent placement on bilia ry complications and its effect on morbidity.  
 Study Design  
A randomized prospective study will be conducted  of patients at Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center (VUMC) who undergo liver transp lantation from March 1st, 2014 until 
approximately 120 patients are randomized. We will simultaneously perform a review of patients at VUMC who undergo liver transplantation but cannot be randomized for logistical reasons  (i.e. hepatic encephalopathy, timing of the transplant procedure, or 
 
 
3 
 language barriers) . Data from the two groups will be evaluated independently and 
comparatively. The inclusion of both groups of data is critical to avoid bias in the 
findings due to inadvertent selection of patients who may not have the same risk for biliary complications. All data will be de -identified and stored using a secure database, 
REDCap.  
 
 
Inclusion Criteria  
• 18years and older  
• Have receive a decreased full size liver g raft 
• Need for hepaticojejunostomies or reduced size grafts  
 
Recruitment  
Informed consent will be sought from new patients undergoing evaluation from liver 
transplant during their clinic visit with the transplant surgeon. For those patients currently on the  waitlist for transplant, who have already undergone evaluation, consent will be 
sought during their subsequent upcoming clinic visits before transplant. We will also seek out patients who are currently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_461333] . Lastly, 
for those patients with no clinic visits in the near future but for whom transplant is 
imminent, we will reach out to them at their preferred contact [CONTACT_461335] .  
 
Due to timing of the liver transplant procedure or the ability of the patient to understand 
the informed consent  document , some patients may not be able to provide informed 
consent and will not qualify for randomization. Use of a stent in these patients will be determined at  the disc retion of the surgeon. A retrospective review of the data for these 
patients will be conducted.  
 Randomization   
Patients will be prospectively randomized to 2 groups .  
• Group 1 will undergo biliary reconstruction with stent placement at the 
anastomosis sit e.  
• Group [ADDRESS_589945] data on reoperations, 
conversion to hepaticojejunostomies, performance of an endoscopic r etrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_461334] a result of the 
biliary complication.   Statistical Analysis  
The probability of  being free of a biliary complication and the probability of liver graft 
survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_257951]. Continuous variables will be analyzed using Student’s t t est, or Wilcoxon’s rank sum test. Categorical variables will be 
analyzed using Chi -square test or Fisher’s exact test . Multivariable proportional hazards 
regression will be performed to adjust potential confounders. A P value of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.   Limitations  
Potential confounders include the etiology of liver disease, the patient’s age at the time of transplant, the donor age, gender, body mass index, MELD score, the total operation time, cold ischemia time and warm ischemia time.    References:

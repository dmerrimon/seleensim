1. Background Information & Significance  
An isotonic solution, such as saline (0.9%, 300mOsm/L) or lactated ringer’s (273 mOsm/L), is 
commonly used and saf ely proven for joint irrigation during arthroscopy. Arthroscopic fluid is 
usually pressurized to enable visualization through dilation of the joint or bursa and prevent 
bleeding from the microvasculature. It has been recommended that this pressure be maintained at 49mmHg or less below the systolic blood pressure to preserve the clarity of view . The combination 
of large amounts of pressurized irrigation solution and lengthy arthroscopic procedures may cause substantial tissue fluid retention. Thus, extravasation of irrigation fluid into the periarticular ti ssues 
is inevitable and may create technical difficulties as well as patient morbidity and complications. 
Previous investigators have reported complications including tracheal obstruction, post -operative 
airway edema and compromise leading to prolonged int ubation, excess weight gain, neurologic 
injuries, skin necrosis, and fluid overload associated with excessive fluid extrava sation and tissue 
retention .  Furthermore, it has been shown that fluid accumulated during the operation is slowly 
released back  into the systemic circulation . Although there is not a rapid change in circulating 
volume, there may be implications for elderly patients and those with multiple comorbidities 
during prolonged arthroscopic surgery. Our research team and other groups have repor ted that 
hyperosmolar solutions (up to 600 mOsm/L) are chondroprotective in vitro,  and safe and effective 
clinically when used as the irrigation solution for arthroscopic shoulder surgeries in a prospective controlled randomized clinical trial.  
2. Objectives , Contribution, & Hypothesis  
Objectives:  To determine if a hyperosmolar solution, similar to what is used in head trauma 
patients, can reduce the degree of fluid extravasation in knee arthroscopy. To determine if a hyperosmolar solution has any effect on post -operative knee pain compared to the standard 
isotonic solution. To determine if a hyperosmolar solution has any effect on post -operative pain 
medicine consumption compared to the standard isotonic solution.  
Contribution:  The potential benefits of this study lie in determining the differences noted in our 
shoulder arthroscopy clinical trial extend to arthroscopic knee procedures.  
Hypothesis : A hyperosmolar irrigation solution used in knee arthroscopy will reduce the extent 
of fluid extravasation to surrounding tissue, decrease per ioperative pain, and result in diminished 
utilization of perioperative pain medication.  
3. Selection of Subjects  
Inclusion Criteria:  Adult patients (18 years of age or greater) undergoing arthroscopic knee 
surgery  who are willing and able to consent . 
Exclusion Criteria:  Current pregnancy or breastfeeding; Unable to give consent ; Prisoner ; 
Mentally Disabled .  
 
Sample Size:  We anticipate enrolling up to [ADDRESS_720706] irrigation solution. 
 
4. Study Procedure  
Timeline:  12-24 months of data collection 
Protocol:  Study candidates will be identified as they present to the clinic at the Missouri 
Orthopaedic Institute at the University of Missouri, and will be evaluated by [CONTACT_549989]- investigators. Informed consent will be obtained as per IRB 
protocol. Enrollees will receive a copy of the study protocol, consent, and HIPAA form. Background patient information will be collected including age, sex, BMI and co- morbidities. 
American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification will b e assigned by [CONTACT_549990].   Lactate Ringer’s (LR, 273mOsm/L) is commonly used at our facility as our isotonic standard irrigation solution and will serve as the control to be evaluated against a hyperosmolar (1.9%, 600mOsm) solution. The  hyperosmolar solution will be created by [CONTACT_1583] 120cc of 23.4% NS 
solution to a 3L bag of LR. The patient will be randomized before  surgery by a research team  
member by [CONTACT_19201] a sealed envelope that designates the type of irrigation solution to be used in the surgery. If randomized to the hyperosmolar group, an  OR staff member will make the 
solution prior to the start of the case. The surgeon and patient will be blinded to the type of irrigation solution used in surgery.  
 
Quantitative variables that will be recorded include, pre and post -operative blood pressure, the 
type and amount (mL) of irrigation fluid used, amount of intravenous fluid used (mL), pre and 
post-operative weight (lb), procedures performed, number of portals, arthroscopic surgical time 
(minutes), pre and post -operative knee girth measurements (cm), and amount of perioperative 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]. We will also document any immediate, post -operative adverse effects (ie, 
airway comprise, prolonged intubation, etc.).  
 Weight: On the day of su rgery, the patient’s weight will be measured to the closest one tenth of a 
pound (lb) before and after surgery on the same calibrated, digital weighing scale. Patients will be weighed while wearing the same attire and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_549985]. Af ter 
surgery, patients will be weighed before discharge and before voiding or eating to ensure that the maximal amount of weight gain attributable to shoulder arthroscopy can be documented. A standard amount of dressing will be applied for each procedure that is surgeon specific and will be accounted for during the calculation of weight gain. Intraoperatively, we will record the 
amount of intravenous fluid given during the case (mL).  
 Knee Girth: Change in knee size (girth) will be evaluated based on change  in surface area. Prior 
to start of the surgery, a sterile measuring tape will be used to record knee girth. Following the surgical procedure the operating surgeon will perform a repeat measuring of the knee girth.  During the assessment, the patients will lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_549986].  The knee will be  relaxed and extended as much as possible. If the knee extends  
below 0°, a cylinder firm back roll will be  placed under the heel of the foot. The tester will stand 
closes t to the examined leg and place  a small dot with a  pen  [ADDRESS_720707] an electronic version sent to them (through Patient IQ) 
each day . The patient will be instructed to write down their pain level (based on the Visual 
Analog Score, 0- 10) and amount of pain medication taken during each day from the day of 
surgery to post -operative day 3. If given the paper form, t he patient will return this form at 
his/her first post -operative clinic visit.  
 
Approximately 1 year after surgery, patients will be contact[CONTACT_217702] a member of the research team. A telephone ques tionnaire will be conducted to gain additional information about 
their recovery and current functional status. The phone interview will include questions 
pertaining to three outcome measures:  1) KOOS Jr, 2) Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation 
(SANE) score  for their knee, and 3) Data collection regarding any additional surgeries involving 
the affected shoulder.    
 
5. Confidentiality of Data  
Patient confidentiality during the course of this study will be protected in compliance with 
HIPAA requirements as well as the requirements of the University of Missouri Health- Sciences 
IRB.  
 All subjects will be assigned a study identification number that requires the use of a key in order to decipher a subject’s personal identification information. The key will be kept i n the Cerner 
Power Trials database, which is password protected. The study identification number will be 
used to label all paper data collection instruments.  
 All subject information in electronic format will be kept in password -protected storage. All 
subject information in paper format will be kept in locked cabinets in a secured suite at the 
Missouri Orthopedic Institute, and otherwise will be archived in a secure storage facility, or 
destroyed.  
 
6. Assessment of Risks & Benefits 
Risks:  Risks for breach of confidentiality does exist but will be limited with tight control and 
limited access to the investigators .     
 
Benefits:  The potential benefits of this study lie in determining the differences noted in our 
shoulder arthroscopy clinica l trial extend to arthroscopic knee procedures.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan:  Subject safety will be ensured through standard of care 
perioperative monitoring by [CONTACT_334718] .   
7. Payment and Remuneration, and Costs  
Payment and Remuneration: Participants will not receive payment for participating in this study.  
 
Costs : Subjects will be responsible for the cost of any surgical and clinic follow up costs. The treatment 
arm does not in any way effect the costs that patients are exp eriencing.

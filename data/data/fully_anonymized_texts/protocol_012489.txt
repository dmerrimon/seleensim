 11 CONFIDENTIAL  2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) 
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2), a novel betacoronavirus , was 
isolated in December 2019 from patients presenting with unidentified viral pneumonia ( Zhu et al. 
2020 ). As of early June 2020, the virus resulted in more than 7 million infections and nearly 
500,000 deaths worldwide ( Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resourc e Center 2020 ).  
Infection with SARS -CoV -2 produces illness known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 or “COVID -
19”. Commonly reported symptoms include fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty 
breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, new lo ss of taste or smell, sore throat, 
congestion or runny nose, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea ( U.S. CDC 2020 a). The severity of 
illness ranges from mild and self -limited to very severe or fatal, with the current U.S. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_164138] 82 per 100,000 ca ses and 255 per 100,000 in those over 65 years of age 
(U.S. CDC 2020b ). 
Seroprevalence studies conducted in U.S. metropolitan areas have estimated between 5% and 14% 
population -level exposure to SARS -CoV -2, indicating that a significant proportion of the 
population is still at risk for a first infection ( Sood et al. 2020 , Goldberg 2020 ). Continued social 
distancing and “safer at home” measures  aimed at reducing transmission of the virus has resulted 
in record unemployment in the U.S., and the  SARS -CoV -2 pan demic is expected to result in a 
more than 10% reduction in U.S. domestic GDP in 2020  (OECD 2020 ). 
Remdesivir for intravenous administration has received emergency use authorization in the U.S. 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19, but no antiviral has been authorized or approved for 
mild or moderate illness.  
2.2. Nitazoxanide (NTZ)  
NTZ is a thiazolide anti -infective with in vitro  activity against parasites, anaerobic bacteria, and 
viruses ( Anderson and Curran  2007 ). 
ALINIA® (NTZ) for Oral Suspension (patients 1 year of age and older) and ALINIA (NTZ) 
Tablets (patients 12 years and older) are marketed in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of diarrhea 
caused by [CONTACT_287703] .  ALINIA for Ora l Suspension and 
ALINIA Tablets have not been shown to be superior to placebo for the treatment of diarrhea caused 
by [CONTACT_287704] -infected or immunodeficient patients ( ALINIA Prescribing 
Information 2019 ). 
2.2.1.  NTZ Inhibits Viral Replication a nd Cytokine Secretion  
Tizoxanide, the active circulating metabolite of NTZ, has been shown to possess antiviral activity 
in cell culture against a broad range of viruses including influenza A and B viruses, coronaviruses 
(SARS -CoV -2, MERS -CoV , HCoV -229E, HCoV -OC43, HCoV -NL63 , canine CoV S -378, 
murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV -A59)), parainfluenza (Sendai) virus, 
RSV A -2, rotavirus, norovirus, hepatitis C virus genotypes 1a and 1b, Japanese encephalitis virus, 
dengue fever virus -2, yellow fever virus, hepatitis B virus, and human immunodeficiency virus 
Protocol RM08 -3008 FINAL v4.0  January 11, 2021  
 12 CONFIDENTIAL  (HIV) ( Rossignol 2014 , Rossignol 2016 , Wang et al. 2020 , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_287659]. 2018 , Romark data on 
file).  Experiments in HeLa R19 cells have shown that NTZ inhibits replication of rhinov irus A 
serotypes 2 and 16 (Romark Study Report RM01 -0434).  Concentrations of tizoxanide required to 
inhibit replication of these viruses by 50% (EC50s) were generally between 0.[ADDRESS_1181618] conditions.    
The anti -influenza activity of nitazoxanide and its circulating metabolite, tizoxanide, has been 
investigated in human (Monocytic U937, T -lymphocytic Jurkat, and Alveolar type II -like A549) 
and canine (MDCK) cells after infection with multiple different strains of influenza A virus 
including oseltamivir -resistant and amantadine -resistant strains ( Rossignol et al. 2009 , Ashton et 
al. 2010 , Sleeman et al. 2014 ).  In a study of the susceptibility of 210 circulating seasonal influenza 
viruses to tizoxanide demonstrated median EC50 values (±IQR) of 0.48 μM (0.33 -0.71), 0.62 μM 
(0.56 -0.75), 0.66 μM (0.62 -0.69), and 0.60 μM (0.51 -0.67) for A  (H1N1)pdm09, A  (H3N2), B  
(Victoria lineage) and B  (Yamagata lineage), respectively ( Tilmanis et al. 2017 ). 
Laboratory studies to evaluate the potential f or resistance of influenza A virus to tizoxanide have 
been unable to select for resistant virus (Romark Study Report RM01 -0417).  These studies suggest 
a low potential for resistance.  
Studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells have also shown tizoxanide  suppresses secretion of 
pro-inflammatory cytokines that are upregulated by [CONTACT_849896][INVESTIGATOR_4416] s (VRIs) .  
Concentrations required to suppress cytokine secretion by 50% for IL -2, IL -4, IL -5, IL -6, IL -8, 
IL-10 and TNF -α ranged from 2.0 to 9.8 µM ( Rossignol and van Baalen 2018 , Romark Study 
Report 9264).  Nitazoxanide has also been shown to suppress IL -6 production in thioglycollate 
broth -injected mice ( Hong et al. 2012 ). 
Ongoing studies of the mechanism of action of NTZ have shown NTZ and tizoxanide m odulate 
mitochondrial function by [CONTACT_287706].  Studies indicate tizoxanide 
decreases cellular ATP in a dose -dependent manner in MDCK cells and in MDCK cells infected 
with influenza viruses.  Maximum inhibition of ATP in influenza -infected or uninfected MDCK 
cells reaches up to 45% after 24 hours of exposure to 100 µM tizoxanide.  In these experiments, a 
10% reduction of ATP achieved by [CONTACT_287707] 10 µM tizoxanide is sufficient to inhibit 
influenza virus replication by [CONTACT_36084] 90%.  The decrease in cellular ATP does not affect 
cell viability and is reversible after eliminating tizoxanide from the culture ( Rossignol and van 
Baalen 2018 ).  Studies of a number of different viruses have shown viral replication is ATP -
dependen t (Braakman et al. 1992 , Braakman et al. 1991 , Doms et al. 1987 , Chang et al. 2009 , 
Mirazimi and Svensson 2000 ).  In the case of NTZ, key viral proteins like hemagglutinin 
(influenza), F -protein (RSV and parainfluenza), and N protein (coronavirus) have been identified 
as potential end targets of this mechanism ( Rossignol et al. 2009 , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_287659]. 2018 , Cao et al. 
2015 ).  In addition, inhibition of ATP and its downstream effect on AMP -activated protein kinase 
activation has been shown to suppress sec retion of pro -inflammatory cytokines ( Lee et al. 2017 , 
Sag et al. 2008 , Wang et al. 2003 ). 
The activity of NTZ in inhibiting replication of a broad range of respi[INVESTIGATOR_849870] -inflammatory cytokines upregulated during respi [INVESTIGATOR_849871].  
Protocol RM08 -3008 FINAL v4.0  January 11, 2021  
 13 CONFIDENTIAL  2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics of NTZ in Humans  
NTZ is not detectable in the plasma following oral administration of the drug.  The main 
metabolites of NTZ in humans are tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide.  Tizoxanide is highly 
bound to plasma proteins (>99%).  The absorption of NTZ in immediate release tablets is 
significantly enhanced (Cmax and AUC of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuroni de in plasma are 
more than doubled) when it is administered with food.  In fasted human volunteers receiving a 
single [ADDRESS_1181619] of the dose was excreted in urine as 
tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide, and two -thirds  was excreted in feces as tizoxanide.  No 
other significant metabolites were detected (NTZ 300 mg Tablets Investigators Brochure).  
The pharmacokinetics of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide during repeated oral dosing of 
NTZ 300 mg extended release tabl ets administered 600 mg twice daily with food were evaluated 
in healthy volunteers.  Twelve (12) subjects received two NTZ controlled release tablets twice 
daily with food for [ADDRESS_1181620] analysis of variance, the steady state tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide plasma 
concentrations was reached by [CONTACT_2006] 2, after one day of treatment with  NTZ at 600 mg b.i.d.  The 
main pharmacokinetics parameters of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are summarized in

lower (2.8%), bronchitis (2.8%), nausea (2.7%), and headache (2.3%).  In the placebo -controlled 
trials, the rates of occurrence of AEs did not differ significantly from those of placebo except for 
chromaturia (10.8% compared to 0.8% for placebo).  Less than 1% of subjects discontinued 
therapy because of AEs ( NT-300 Investigators Brochure -COVID/VRI ). 
2.2.4.  Clinical Experience with NTZ in Treatme nt of Coronaviruses  
Fifty -two (52) coronavirus -infected subjects meeting the criteria proposed by [CONTACT_849899]08 -3004, a study of NTZ in the treatment of influenza. The FLU -PRO 
instrument was administered daily for 21 days . The N TZ group experienced a treatment benefit of 
101 hours at the median in Time to Sustained Response [Median (IQR): 101.3 (58 -250) for the 
NTZ group and 201.8 (117 ->504) for the placebo group, p=0.0932]. See Figure 1 for Kaplan -
Meier curves of Time to Sustain ed Response for this population.

4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Study Design Overview  
This study is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to 
evaluate efficacy and safety of NTZ 600 mg administered orally twice daily for five days compared 
to a placebo for the treatment of mild or moderate COVID -19. 
Subje cts will be stratified according to the following criteria:  
Severity of COVID -19 Illness:  • Mild illness  defined as  baseline assessments of (1)  at 
least one respi[INVESTIGATOR_1798]* with a baseline score 
≥2 and (2) resting pulse <90 beats per minute and (3) 
resting respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] < 20 breaths per minute.  
• Moderate illness  defined as baseline assessments of 
(1) at least one respi[INVESTIGATOR_1798]* with a baseline 
score ≥2 and either (2) resting pulse ≥90 beats per 
minute or (3) resting respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ≥ 20 breaths per 
minute.  
* For this purpose, respi[INVESTIGATOR_849872] 5 FLU -PRO domains/subdomains: chest, cough, 
nose, throat and head.  
Time from onset of symptoms to  
randomization :  <36 hours/≥ 36 hours  
Risk of severe illness (per  CDC ):  • At Increased Risk:  Subjects with COPD, Type 2 
diabetes mellitus, obesity (BMI ≥30), chronic kidney 
disease, sickle cell disease, serious heart conditions 
(such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or 
cardiomyopathies) , asthma (moderate or severe), 
cerebrovascular disease, cystic fibrosis, hypertension 
or high blood pressure, immunocompromised state 
(due to immune deficiencies, HIV, use of 
corticosteroids, or use of other immune -weakening 
medications), neurologic conditi ons (e.g., dementia), 
liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis, past or present 
history of smoking, thalassemia, or type 1 diabetes 
mellitus.  Subjects who are ≥65 years of age.  
• Not At Increased Risk:  Subjects with none of the 
above conditions  
Within strata, sub jects will be randomized 1:1 to one of the following groups:  
• Group 1 (NTZ):   Two NTZ 300 mg tablets b.i.d. for 5 days  
Protocol RM08 -3008 FINAL v4.0  January 11, 2021  
 17 CONFIDENTIAL  • Group 2 (Placebo):  Two placebo tablets b.i.d. for [ADDRESS_1181623] that a large number of subjects enrolled will be positive for Enterovirus/Rhinovirus 
(EV/RV). Efficacy and safety data for subjects who are positive for EV/RV at Baseline will be 
analyzed as part of concurrently enrolling study RM08 -3009 . 
4.2. Rationale for Important Issues in the Study Design  
4.2.1.  Choice of NTZ Dose and Duration of Treatment  
The dose of NTZ used for this clinical trial (600 mg b.i.d. for 5 days) has been associated with 
reductions in durations of illness in subjects infected with influenza, Enterovirus/Rhinovirus , and 
coronavirus . Dose -range -finding study RM08 -3001 in subjects with influenza infection 
demonstrated a dose -dependent efficacy response with a 300 mg b.i.d. group demonstrating a non -
significant improvement over placebo.  
In clinical trials involving 2, 659 subjects, adverse events reported by [CONTACT_528616]  600 mg 
NTZ b.i.d. for 5 days were similar to those of subjects receiving the placebo,  with the exception 
of a higher rate of  chromaturia (10.8% compared to 0.8% for the placebo) . Studies of NTZ at 
higher doses have shown dose -dependent increases in the frequency  of reported diarrhea and other 
gastrointestinal side effects, therefore no higher dose is  planned for this study.  
SAR S-CoV -2 virus titer is believed to peak between the onset of symptoms  and symptomatic day 
4 and is not able to be cultured after seven days of symptoms ( Wölfel et al. 2020 ). Antiviral  
treatment will have a reduced magnitude of treatment benefit when the ho st immune response is 
effectively decreasing the infectious viral load. Further, a study of remdesivir comparing 5 - and 
10-day courses of treatment found no difference between the two in patients with severe COVID -
19 (Goldman et al. 2020 ). Therefore, it is  unlikely that a course of treatment beyond five days will 
confer any significant additional benefit.   
4.2.2.  Choice of Duration of Follow Up  
A 28-day (+3 days) study duration is proposed, including five days on treatment and approximately 
23 days of safet y and symptom follow -up. As previously described, SARS -CoV -2 virus titer is 
believed to peak between the onset of symptoms and symptomatic day 4 and is not able to be 
cultured after seven days of symptoms  (Wölfel et al. 2020 ). Further, onset of Acute Respi [INVESTIGATOR_157412] (ARDS) in patients infected with SARS -CoV -2 is approximately 8 -12 days ( Li 
and Ma 2020 ). Therefore, [ADDRESS_1181624]. Discussion of specific eligibility c riteria is 
presented below.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Choice of Signs and Symptoms Required for Inclusion  
Data from studies RM08 -3004 and RM08 -3005 indicate that, in subjects infected with influenza, 
EV/RV  or seasonal coronavirus, subjects with low symptom scores for the head, thro at, nose, chest 
and cough symptom domains in the absence of elevated pulse or respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], illness may be 
expected to resolve quickly. These subjects have less opportunity to benefit from antiviral 
treatment . Further, subjects who indicate that sympto ms are already improving are also unlikely 
to benefit from treatment. Therefore, subjects will be required to have a score of ≥2 for two 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_849865] (head, throat, nose, chest, or cough) or a score of ≥2 for one 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_849866] i n the presence of elevated vital signs (pulse ≥90 beats per minute or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ≥16 breaths per minute).  Subjects will be excluded if they report having no 
symptoms (global assessment), being at their usual health, that their symptoms do not interfe re 
with their usual activities, or that their symptoms have improved since yesterday.  Subjects 
presenting with signs or symptoms consistent with severe COVID -19 (resting shortness of breath, 
resting pulse ≥125, resting respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] ≥30) will also be ex cluded from the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Inclusion of Subjects At Least 12 Years of Age (No Upper Age Limit)  
The population to be studied includes adults and adolescents at least [ADDRESS_1181625] participation in this study (see Section 8.1.1 ). A 
signed assent form will be required for any minors enrolled (≤ 18 years of age or as local 
regulations apply) as well as signed parental/legal guardian consent by [CONTACT_29382]/legal guardian 
allowing for the minor’s participation.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Inclusion  of Subjects with Underlying Conditions  
For the present study, some subjects (e.g., subjects >65 years of age, underlying asthma or COPD, 
diabetes mellitus, underlying cardiovascular disease, etc. – see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria ) who 
are at higher risk of complications or exacerbations of underlying conditions will be allowed to 
participate if, in the judgment of the investigator, they are able to comply with protocol 
requirements and are not expected to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. There is no approved anti viral for 
mild or moderate COVID -19, and subjects will not be prevented from being prescribed rescue 
medication for complications. Therefore, participation in the study will not pose unreasonable risk 
to any eligible subject.   
Protocol RM08 -[ADDRESS_1181626] been studied in subjects with renal and 
hepatic impairment and no dose adjustment is recommended in these populations. A thorough QTc 
study of NTZ at doses of 675 mg and 2700 mg found no prolongation of the QTc interval.  
CYP450 inh ibition assays indicate that tizoxanide inhibits CYP2C8 with an IC 50 of 4.3µM , but a  
mechanistic static model used for potential drug -drug intera ctions indicated that a clinical 
interaction stemming from CYP2C8 inhibition by  [CONTACT_849900].  
While tizoxanide is more than 99.9% bound to plasma proteins, a n in vivo drug-drug interaction 
study found no interaction between NTZ and warfarin. Tizoxanide inhibits the BCRP transporter 
and therefore may affect the pharmacokinetics of BCRP substrates , such as  rosuvastatin . Co-
administration of NTZ and rosuvastatin for seven days  led to a 40% increase in the C max of 
rosuvastatin and 80% and 70% increases of rosuvastatin AUC 0-t and AUC 0-∞, respectively.  
However, the short duration of treatment in this study is not anticipated to cause adverse effects 
related to co -administration of NTZ and rosuvastatin.  
For more  detailed information, refer to the NT -300 Investigator’s Brochure -COVID/VRI.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Exclusion of Subjects with Significant Immunodeficiency  
Individuals with significant immunodeficiency, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy, 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_849873], and HIV patients with very low CD4 
counts are more susceptible to lo nger durations of illness and more likely to experience 
complications due to viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. This is an important population in which to study 
antiviral drugs for the treatment of viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. Nonetheless, these subjects will  be 
excluded from the present study due to (1) the likelihood of longer viral shedding necessitating 
longer courses  or higher doses  of treatment than what is  proposed in this study, and (2) the 
likelihood that symptoms of illness may present differently in  immunocompromised persons 
compared to immunocompetent persons due to reduced ability to produce the immune response 
that results in symptoms  (van der Vries et al. [ADDRESS_1181627]. Jude Children’s Research Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ).  
4.2.5.  Use of Vitamin B Complex Supplement  
All subje cts will receive a vitamin B  complex supplement (Super B -Complex™, Igennus 
Healthcare Nutrition, Cambridge,  [LOCATION_006]) one tablet twice a day with study medication. This dose 
follows the  manufacturer’s labeled dosing. The purpose of the supplement is to help mask  any 
chromaturia attributed to NTZ and aid in maintaining study blinding. The supplement  will supply 
each subject with the following Percent Daily Values based on a 2,000  calorie diet: vitamin B1 
1,333%, vitamin B2 824%, vitamin B3 240%, vitamin B5  360%, vitamin B6 1000%, vitamin B7 
100%, vitamin B12 15,000%, folate 100%, and  vitamin C 267%. Considering this supplement will 
provide well beyond the needed  daily allowance of these water -soluble vitamins, excess amounts 
are expected to be excreted in the urin e and provide discoloration.   
4.2.6.  Choice of Patient -Reported Outcome Instrument  
This clinical trial will use the InFLUenza Patient -Reported Outcome Questionnaire (FLU -PRO©).  
FLU -PRO© was developed with the support of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Se rvices 
through the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, National Institutes of Health, in response to the need for improved metrics to evaluate 
Protocol RM08 -[ADDRESS_1181628] 
viral diseases.  It was developed and validated in accordance with FDA’s guidance, “Patient -
Reported Outcome Measures: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims.”  
It has also been validated for use on an electronic device as part of an electronic diary (“eDiary”) 
that can time stamp diary entries to ensure timely recording, thereby [CONTACT_849901].  
We will use an electronic diary for this clinical trial.  FLU -PRO© was separat ely validated for use 
in a population with non -influenza like illness and also has recently been used in vaccine studies 
with older adults for the prevention of RSV ( Powers et al. 2018 , Yu et al. 2020 ). Data from Romark 
studies RM08 -[ADDRESS_1181629] change in patients 
infected with Enterovirus/Rhinovirus  or seasonal coronavirus.  
4.2.7.  Choice of Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint was developed using data collected from 1,467 subjects infected with 
influenza, Enter ovirus/Rhinovirus  or seasonal coronavirus es during Romark studies RM08 -3004 
and RM08 -3005.  The endpoint defines a level of symptom improvement that constitutes a 
meaningful within -patient change in health status . The determination of m eaningfulness was based 
on empi[INVESTIGATOR_849874].  The endpoint requires (1) oral 
temperature <100.4  ºF, (2) reduction of total symptom severity score from the previous day , (3) 
the patient to provide confirmation that symptoms are at least somewhat better,  and (4) no 
symptom domain increase except below background levels for the remainder  of the study  
(sustained response) . These b ackground levels were de rived  based on symptom scores  reported by 
[CONTACT_849902] a t usual health.

8.1.1.  Informed Consent  
Each subject must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of the study 
has been fully explained.  The informed consent form (ICF) must be signed before performance of 
any study -related activity.  The informed consent form will be approved by [CONTACT_849910].  They will be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration 
of Helsinki, current I CH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and Sponsor 
policy.  
Before enrollment in the study, the Investigator or an authorized member of the investigational 
staff must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipate d benefits, and 
potential hazards of the study, and any discomfort participation in the study may entail.  Subjects 
will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to 
participate at any time.  They will be informed  that choosing not to participate will not affect the 
care he/she will receive.  Finally, they will be told that the Investigator will maintain a subject 
identification register for the purposes of long -term follow -up if needed and that their records may 
be accessed by [CONTACT_849911], to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_6983](s) or regulations.  By [CONTACT_849912], and agrees to a llow his or her study physician to re -contact 
[CONTACT_849913], if needed. Only 
subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential AEs of the study, and 
provide the ir consent voluntarily will be enrolled.  
The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the opportunity to ask questions.  
After this explanation and before entry into the study, consent should be appropriately recorded 
by [CONTACT_19720]'s personally dated signature.  After having obtained the consent, a copy of 
the ICF must be given to the subject.  
If the subject is unable to read or write, an impartial witness should be present for the entire 
informed consent process (which inclu des reading and explaining all written information) and 
should personally date and sign the ICF after the oral consent of the subject is obtained, if permitted 
by [CONTACT_1769].

8.4. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.4.1.  Definitio ns 
The following definitions will apply to the reporting of adverse events:  
1. Adverse Event:  Any unwanted physical, psychological or behavioral change experienced 
by a subject during the course of the study and a fter taking the first dose of study 
medication regardless of its severity or relation to the study.  Adverse events may include 
symptoms, signs, unexpected worsening of pre -existing conditions, clinically significant 
changes in laboratory values, diseases and syndromes, and significant and unexpected 
failures of pharmacological action of other medications.  Symptoms of viral respi[INVESTIGATOR_58776] (VRIs) (cough, sore, throat, nasal obstruction, fatigue, headache, myalgia, or 
feverishness) will not be report ed as adverse events.  
2. Serious Adverse Event:  Any adverse experience occurring at any dose that is fatal or life 
threatening; requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109577]; is a persistent significant disability/incap acity; is a congenital anomaly or 
birth defect; or is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed above.  
3. Unexpected Adverse Event:  Any adverse experience that is not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the Investigator's Brochure for NTZ.  
4. Severity of adverse events  will be  assessed as mild, moderate, severe or potentially life -
threatening by [CONTACT_849921] 4 (derived and adapted from “Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Grading Scale for 
Healthy Adult and Adolescent  Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials”, 
US Dept. of HHS, FDA, CDER, September 2007 and the National Institutes of Health, 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 5.0).  
5. Causality (rela tionship to treatment)  will be assessed as follows:  
Protocol RM08 -3008 FINAL v4.0  January 11, 2021  
 31 CONFIDENTIAL  • Definitely Related : The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s) 
or research intervention: the adverse event has a temporal relationship to the 
administration of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention, follows a 
known pattern of response, and no alternative cause is present.  
• Probably Related : The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention: the adverse event has a temp oral relationship to the administration of the 
investigational agent(s) or research intervention, follows a known or suspected pattern 
of response, but an alternative cause may be present.  
• Possibly Related : There is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by [CONTACT_287018] a significant way to the research; the adverse event has a 
temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research 
intervention, follows a suspected pattern of response, but an alterna tive cause is 
present.  
• Unrelated (or Not Related) : The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the 
investigational agent(s) or intervention: the adverse event has no temporal relationship 
to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research in tervention, follows 
no known or suspected pattern of response, and an alternative cause is present.  
Under double -blind treatment conditions, it should be assumed that all subjects are taking 
the test drug.  
8.4.2.  Recording and Follow Up of Adverse Events  
At the t ime of each visit, the subject will be questioned regarding the occurrence and nature of any 
adverse events and all events will be recorded in the subject’s medical records and in the EDC 
system. Any subject affected will be examined by [CONTACT_849922]. All adverse events must be followed until their 
resolution or stabilization even beyond the planned study period.  
All moderate and severe adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_3433] e Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_849882]/her best clinical judgment whether they warrant the subject to be discontinued 
from the study.  The Sponsor will be notified immediately if a subject is discontinued from the 
study.  For all adverse eve nts that require the subject to be discontinued from the study, relevant 
clinical assessments and laboratory tests will be repeated as clinically indicated until final 
resolution or stabilization of the event(s).  
All subjects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737], Investigator's assistants, or clinical 
personnel should the subject have any serious adverse experiences.   
An overdose is defined as any intentional or unintentional consumption of the drug by [CONTACT_849923]'s Brochure  or in an investigational protocol, 
whichever dose is larger.  Overdoses without an associated adverse event should be recorded, but 
not reported as an adverse event.

Meier figures.  
Protocol RM08 -3008 FINAL v4.0  January 11, 2021  
 35 CONFIDENTIAL  There will be one primary efficacy analysis:  
• Time to Sustained Response for the NTZ treatment group will be compared t o that of the 
placebo treatment group using a stratified Gehan -Wilcoxon test (α=0 .05) where 
stratification will follow that used for randomization. Subjects without a Sustained 
Response recorded will be treated as censored as of the last diary without a do cumented 
Sustained Response , except for subjects who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_849884], who 
will be censored at Day 21 (hour 504).  
Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy analysis will be described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  
If the prim ary analysis is significant at the 0.05 level, the key secondary efficacy analys is will be 
formally evaluated at the 0.05 level as follows:  
• Proportions of subjects progressing to Severe COVID -19 Illness will be compared between 
the treatment groups using a  Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_64118].  
Exploratory analyses will be performed as follows:  
• Proportions of subjects positive for SARS -CoV -2 by  [CONTACT_849888]® SARS -CoV -2 Assay  at 
study Day 4 and Day 10  will be compared between the treatment groups using a Cochran -

9.4.2.  Population Pharmacokinetics Analysis  
On Day 4, plasma samples will be collected before the morning dose (at the trough) for 
determinatio n of drug concentration.  These data will allow for analysis of relationships between 
trough plasma concentrations and clinical and virologic response.   
Trough plasma concentrations of tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide will be summarized 
descriptively  for NTZ -treated subjects  except those positive for EV/RV at Baseline .  Exploratory 
analyses will be conducted to evaluate the relationships between plasma concentrations and age, 
race, gender, body weight, body mass index, VRI and adverse events.  
Pharmaco kinetics data for subjects positive for EV/RV at Baseline will be analyzed as part of 
concurrently enrolling study RM08 -3009.  
9.4.3.  Safety Analyses  
All randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication  except those positive 
for EV/RV at Basel ine will be evaluated for drug safety. Safety analyses will be done descriptively.

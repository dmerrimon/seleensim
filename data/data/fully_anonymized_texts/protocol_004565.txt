3. INTRODUCTION
As per ICH E9 , the purpose of this document is to provide a more technical and detailed 
elaboration of the principal features of the anal ysis described in the protocol, and to include 
detailed procedures for executing the statistical analy sis of the primary  and secondary  
variables and other data.
This TSAP assumes familiarity  with the Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP), including Protocol 
Amendments. In particular, t he TSAP is based on the planned analy sis specification as 
written in CTP Section 7 “Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size”. Therefore, 
TSAP readers may consult the CTP for more background information on the study , e.g., 
study  objectives, stu dy design and population, treatments, definition of measurements and 
variables, planning of sample size.
The validated SAS®version will be used that is in place on the BI s ystemat the time of 
analyses.  Currently  Version 9.4is being used.

4. CHANGES IN THE PLANN ED ANALYSIS OF THE S TUDY
The phase II, single arm trial was originally designed with two parts : i) Safety  run-in to 
decide the RP2D of the combination therapy  for the main part and ii) main part of phase II.
Atthe end of safet y run -in,after careful consideration of benefit -risk assessment and current
available treatment options, SMC recommended to stop the trial. Below are some of the main 
changes compared to planned anal ysis in study  protocol version 2.0, considering that the trial 
will not go to the main part:
Analy sis and decision on RP2D was not conducted as the trial will not go to the main 
part of the phase II.
Analy sis of duration of response will not be done, as there are not enough number of 
responses to do this analy sis.
No e xtensive subgroup analy sis for primary  endpoint will be done for PD -L1 
expression, and for subgroups defined b y the biomarkers related to immune status. 
Subgroup anal ysisforother efficacy  endpoint e.g. PFS, OS, ORR, DOR involving 
PD-L1 expression and s ubgroups defined b y the biomarkers related to immune status
willnot be done due to small number of patients.
No anal ysis,except a listing ,will be done forirRECI STcriteria.
The anal ysis of PK assessment, mentioned in section 7.3.3 of the protocol, will not be 
done. A listing with the information on actual time of collection of PK -sample with 
the values of plasma concentration will be reported.

5. ENDPOINT (S)
This trial is an open -label, single arm phase II study  assessing the tolerability  and anti- tumour
activity  of afatinib when given in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab in
patients with squamous NSCL C, who progressed during or after first line platinum -based
standard therap y and had no prior treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor or EGFR
targeted therap y.
This trial consists of two parts: 
1)Safety  run-in:  Maximum of [ADDRESS_1262248] part. 
a)At first [ADDRESS_1262249] one full cy cle, at the starting dose of 
40 mg of afatinib and 200 mg of pembrolizumab. Along with the results from 
Bayesian logistic model (BL RM), safet y
-monitoring committee (SMC) will assess 
the overall safet y and tolerability of this dose. If the starting dose is tolerable and 
safe, it will be declared as RP2D. 
b)If the starting dose of afatinib (40 mg) is intolerable , [ADDRESS_1262250] 
one full cy cle, the SMC will assess the overall safety  profile along with results 
from BLRM to confirm this combination as RP2D and the study  will go to main 
part. 
If this reduced dose ( 30 mg afatinib with 200 mg of pembrolizumab) is also too 
toxic no additional patients will be enrolled and the study will be stopped and will 
not go to main part .
Note that th issafet y run -inis to determine the safe dose of afatinib in combination 
with standard dose of pembrolizumab .
2)Main part: Once the RP2D has b een established, this will be the starting dose of 
afatinib for future patients entered to the main part of the trial. In total, 38 patients 
will be included in the main part to assess efficacy and safet y of this treatment 
combination .
If the RP2D is defined as the original starting dose of afatinib (40 mg dail y) in combination
with pembrolizumab, the trial will include 12 patients from the safety  run in and 38 patients
from the main part, leading to 50 patients in total. However if the RP2D is defined as 30 mg
of afatinib in combination with pembrolizumab, the trial will include 62 patients in total (12
patients at 40 mg and 50 patients at 30 mg).
Decision after safety run -in: Safety
 monitoring committee reviewed safety  and efficacy  data 
of
[ADDRESS_1262251] cohort, 12 patients were 
treated with a starting dose of 40 mg of afatinib and 200 mg of pembrolizumab and in the 
second cohort ,12 additional patients were treated with a starting dose of 30 mg of afatinib 
Boehringer Ingelheim
TSAP for BI Trial No: 1200.283 Page 9of 27

and 200 mg of pembrolizumab. After careful assessment of benefit -risk, and consid ering 
current available treatment option sfor the population, the committee advised to stop the trial. 
The anal ysis for this trial will include patient sfrom thesafet y run -in phase.
5.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT (S)
The primary endpoint for this study is to assess the efficacy  of afatinib in combination with 
pembrolizumab as measured b y Objective Response rate(ORR). ORR is defined as the 
proportion of patients with the best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) from first drug i ntake until the earliest of disease progression, death, or last 
evaluable tumour assessment before start of any new subsequent anti -cancer therap y, lost to 
follow -up, or withdrawal of consent.
RECI ST 1.1 (2)will be used to determine all response and progression endpoints.
Note: Asthe study  will not go to the second stage ,protocol mentioned “supportive anal ysis
with summaries” will notbe done with supplemented immune -related RECIST ( irREI CST 
(9)) criteria; though a detailed listing will report all theassessments , following RECI ST and 
irRECI ST criteria, 
done in this study .
5.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S)
5.2.1 Key secondary endpoint (s)
The key secondary  objectives are to confirm the recommended phase II dose (RP2 D) of dail y 
afatinib when combined with pembrolizumab given in 3 -weekl y cyclesandassess the safety
profile of the combination treatment.
5.2.2 Other s econdary endpoint (
s)
Other secondary  endpoints are: 
Disease control rate (best overall response of CR, PR(confirmed )or SD) .
Progression- free survival (PFS) , defined as the time from the treatment start date to 
the date of disease progression, or to the date of death from an y cause, whichever 
occurs earlier .
Overall survival (OS) , defined as the time from the date of treatment start date to the 
date of death.
Tumour shrinkage .
Note: As the trial will not go to the 
main part, no formal anal ysis will be done for protocol 
specified secondary  endpoint “Duration of ( confirmed ) objective response ” and no decision/ 
analysis on “Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D)” will be done as well for this trial.

6.3 PATIENT SETS ANALYSE D
Treated set : this includes all patients who received at least one dose of afatinib or 
pembrolizumab. 
The “treated set ” will be u sed for all efficacy  and safet y analyse s.
Note: Safety monitoring committee reviewed safety  and efficacy  data for 24 patient sfrom 
safet y run -in phase. After careful assessment, of benefit -
risk and considering current 
available treatment option for the population, the committee advised to stop the trial. The 
analysis for this trial will include patient streated in “safet y run in ”phase only.
6.5 POOLING OF CENTRES
This section is not applicable because centre/country  is not inc luded in the statistical model.
6.6 HANDLING OF MISSING 
DATA AND OUTLIERS
Missing efficacy  data will not be imputed and all reasonable efforts will be taken during the 
study  to obtain such data.  Patients with unknown vital status or time to progression will be 
censored for time to event ana lyses; further details are provided in Section 7.  
Missing or incomplete AE dates will be imputed according to BI standards (see “Handling of 
missing and incomplete AE dates”) . (3)

dose of study  
treatment (refer to section 6.1 for definition) .
Study  day will be calculated relative to the date of the first administration of study  treatment .
The day ,prior to first administration of study  treatment, will be ‘Day  -1’ and the day  of first 
administration of study  treatment will be ‘Day  1’; therefore ‘Day  0’ will not exist.
Time windows and visits will be calculated to dete rmine the planned day
 of tumour 
measurement and response status, based on the protocol- specified tumour imaging schedule. 
Imaging data will be display edas screening, Week 9, 18, 27 … etc . First i maging isscheduled 
tobe performed at week 9 (56- 63 day s after C1_V1) and every 9-week s intervals (63 ± 7 
days, 126 day s ± 7 day setc.) thereafter until PD/start of subsequent anti- cancer treatment.

7. PLANNED ANALYSIS
In general the display  format of the anal ysis results will follow BI guideline ( 7, 8) as much as 
possible.
For End -Of-Text (EoT) tables, the set of summary statistics is: N / Mean / Standard deviation 
(StD) / Min / Median / Max.
For tables that are provided for endpoints with some extreme data, median, quartiles and 
percentiles should be preferred to Mean, StD, Min and Max.
Tabulations of frequencies for categorical data will include all possible categories and will 
display  the number of observations in a category  as well as the percentage. Percentages will 
be rounded to one decimal place. The category  missing will be display ed only  if there are 
actuall y missing values.
7.1 DEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHER BASELINE C

7.7 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE
Total treatment time (days and number of courses) will be calculated for each patient; 
off-drug periods due to non- compliance or toxicity  prior to permanent discontinuation will b e 
included as treatment time.  In addition, the total treatment time will be summed over all 
patients and transformed to patient y ears.  Standard descriptive summaries of these data will 
be provided for the treated set of patients.
Further summaries will a lso be produced:
Treatment time (day s) broken down by  [CONTACT_900094] (40mg and 
30mgofafatinib with p embrolizumab ) .
Number and proportion of patients on each dose level over time.
Time to first dose reduction and duration (day s) of off-drug periods prior to first dose 
reduction.
7.8 SAFETY ANALYSIS
All safet y anal yses will be performed on the treated set. 
7.8.1 Adverse events
The anal yses of adverse events (AEs) will be descriptive in nature. All analy ses of AEs will 
be based on the number of patients with AEs and NOT on the number of AEs.
The anal yses will be based on BI standards. Adverse events will be coded with the most 
recent version of MedDRA. The severity  of AEs will be scaled according to CTCAE version 
4.05.
Furthermore, for analysis of AE attributes such as duration, severit y, etc. multiple AE 
occurrence data on the CRF, will be collapsed into AE epi[INVESTIGATOR_900091]:
• The same MedDRA lowest level term was reported for the occurrences .
• The o ccurrences were time -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_406290] -adjacent (time -adjacency  of [ADDRESS_1262261] occurrence) .
•
Treatment did not change between the onset of the occurrenc es OR treatment changed 
between the onset of the occurrences, but no deterioration was observed for the later 
occurrence .

AE epi[INVESTIGATOR_900092]. For further details on summarization of AE data, please refer to the guideline 
'Handling and summarization of adverse event data for clinical trial reports and in tegrated 
summaries'. ( 4)
For further details on summarization of AE data, please refer to (3, 4).
The anal ysis of AEs will include all events with onset in the on- treatment period (between 
treatment start date and (last date of trial medication + 30 day s)) and residual effect period.  
Events occurring before first drug intake will be assigned to ‘screening', and all events 
occurring after the residual effect period wi llbe assigned to ‘ Post-study /follow -up’. 
An overall summary  of AEs will be presented.

Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_15624]:
For patients with normal liver function (ALT, AS T, bilirubin within normal limits) at
baseline:
i) An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper 
limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or 
equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline 
phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined 
by [CONTACT_398841] -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory  testing.
For patients with abnormal liver function at baseline (AST an d/or ALT>ULN)):
ii) An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 5X the upper 
limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value greater than or equal to 
2X upper limit of normal measured in the same blood draw sample, with the 
exclusion of causes due to underly ing diseases.
Dose Limiting Toxicities
Dose L imiting Toxicities (DLT) occurring during the first cy cle in patients 
included in the safet y run in will be considered protocol specified AESI. Please 
refer to section 5.2.5 in clinical trial protocol.
Separate summary  tables will be reported for hepatic injury  and dose limiting toxicity . A 
separate listings will be prepared for patients who are identified as having experienced any  of 
the following AE s.  
AEs of special search c ategory
A separate summary and listing will be reported for “AEs of special search category ”.
Identification will be based upon modified MedDRA SMQ and HLT groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].  Details of 
AESI  are provided in table 7.8.1: 1 .

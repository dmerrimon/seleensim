Purpose  
The pre sent study is designed to determine whether the drug, TVB -2640 will significantly reduce liver fat synthesis in 
male subjects with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome.  
 
Background  
The continuum of metabolic synd rome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the more advanced disease of non -
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can progress to significant liver diseases including cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.  Over the next [ADDRESS_1092259] prevalent liver disease in the U.S.  In 
addition, NAFLD is associated with increased comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.  Obesity and 
the metabolic syndrome [4] are two key risk factors for NAFLD which are cha racterized as an imbalance in energy 
utilization and storage.  This imbalance leads to dysregulated metabolic pathways and inflammatory responses that drive 
further changes leading to liver damage and comorbid conditions.  There are currently no approved d rugs to treat 
metabolic syndrome or NAFLD.  The synthesis of fatty acids in the liver, a pathway termed hepatic de novo lipogenesis 
(DNL), is increased in subjects with metabolic syndrome and NAFLD.  The DNL pathway not only produces fatty acids 
that contr ibute to elevated liver stores of triglycerides, but the fatty acids that are produced are saturated fatty acid species, 
primarily palmitate (C16:0), which contribute to signaling events that increase liver inflammation.  Therefore DNL is an 
important path way for therapeutic intervention to reduce the consequences associated with metabolic syndrome and 
NAFLD.  One of the key enzymes in DNL is fatty acid synthase (FASN); this enzyme is solely responsible for 
synthesizing palmitate.  Normal responses to feedi ng carbohydrate in meals include a transient increase in DNL which is 
dependent on the enzyme FASN.  Using isotopic tracers, it is clear that subjects with NAFLD have higher rates of hepatic 
DNL compared to subjects without fatty liver.  Additionally, NAFL D subjects do not suppress DNL upon fasting unlike 
the subjects without fatty liver.  This observation forms the basis for evaluating the inhibition of FASN, thereby [CONTACT_792206], as a potential therapeutic target  to reduce fatty liver disease.

metabolic syndrome"  
Version 6 Date:  March [ADDRESS_1092261] profile and the side effects that did 
occur (xeroderma, some hai r loss, dry eyes), appeared after 14  days of treatment at doses ranging from 150-450 mg per 
day.  Therefore, the present study will use a shorter duration of treatment (10 days), and  choose a starting dose at the 
lower end of this treatment range ( 50 mg/d).  
 
Specifically, as described in the attached IND application, i n [ADDRESS_1092262], a t doses of 400 -600 mg/d, for 
durations longer than 10 days , corneal edema (n=3) and palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE, n=3) were also 
observed.  The corneal edema and PPE were thought to be related to the ac tion of the drug and extended dry eye.  All the 
side effects described above resolved after discontinuation of drug.  
It should be noted that , becau se previous use of this drug  occurred in cancer patients on concurrent treatment with 
paclitaxel, side effect s common to paclitaxel were also observed during co -treatment.  These effects, including  uveitis, 
fatigue, decreased appetite, and peripheral neur opathy, were not unexpected.  
 
During these studies, a  fatty acid biomarker of lipogenesis, found in blood trig lyceride (TG) was found to be reduced 
significantly.  The present study will test a lower dose ( 50 mg/d) in men (no women) with characteristics of the metabolic 
syndrome, who are otherwise healthy.  The focus on subjects with metabolic syndrome is based on  the fact that the future 
use of the drug will be in patients with non -alcoholic fatty liver disease who will likely have metabolic syndrome 
characteristics.  
 
The Parks lab has developed an oral sugars tolerance test (OSTT ) to determine the magnitude of liver stimulation of 
lipogenesis when an individual consumes a n oral  bolus of sugars  [1].  In the present study, we will use this protocol to 
determine whether 10 days of drug treatment will significantly reduce fasting and sugar -stimulated lipogenesis.  The study 
is divid ed into 3 parts (described belo w) which will allow us to make minor adjust ments in  the dose of  drug after the first 
six subjects'  results are available  to optimize the suppression of lipogenesis, while also minimizing any sid e effects the 
drug might have.  
 
The over all study design is shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1092263] -treatment samples.  
 
Summary of s tudy objectives  
This study 's goal is to identify a drug dose that  will effectively lower lipogenesis, while minimizing any side effects.   We 
will start studying two subjects at a dose of 50 mg/day, and  continue at 50 mg/day for the following [ADDRESS_1092264] amount of side effects, if any.  A decision tree 
to serve as the basis for these decisions is presented as Supplementary Figure  1 in the Appendix  
 
We will accomplish the following specific aims : 
Aim 1  (Part 1, subjects 1 and 2 ).  First, t reat two  subjects with 50 mg/d of drug  for 10 days  to preliminarily determine 
the effects of the drug to lower lipogenesis.   Measure fasting and sugar -stimulated lipogenesis before and af ter treatment, 
while m onitor ing for side effects .   Hypothesis 1 :  A 10d duration of 50 mg/d treatment will lower acute lipogenesis  
stimulated by a bolus of sugars  by [CONTACT_2669] 2%  and result in no, or minimal side effects.

Version 6 Date:  March 8 , 201 7 
 
Aim 2  (Part 2, subjects 3 -6):  Test an additional  4 subjects according to the results of Part 1 .  Hypothesis 2 :  Additional 
subjects treated at the same dose will refine the statistical confidence in the observations of Objective 1 . 
 
Aim 3  (Part 3, subjects 7 -12):  Using the final targeted dose of drug, study 6 subjects using the same in -patient protocol 
as in the other aims.   Hypothesis  3:  Using the final dosing scheme, the last six subjects will demonstrate a significant 
reduction in fasting and stimulated lipogenesis, with the lowest side effects, if any.  
 
 
Study Details  
The sour ces of research materials will include following  items.  
Screen ing:  Research subject and family medical history, demographic data, vitals, height, weigh t, BMI calculated, and 
screening labo ratory tests including  a CMP, hepatitis panel, CBC w ith differential, concentration  of insulin, a lipid panel , 
apolipoproteins B and A1,  ECG,  and HbA1c.  Demographic data (plus other relate d data, e.g., emergency contact [CONTACT_9702] ), 
smoking history are collected, along with l ifestyle information including food /beverage/alcohol  intake and physical 
activity will be obtained  via questionnaire  and a urine sample is used for a general drug screen.  
 
Inpatient  CRC studies :  Blood is pr ocessed to  obtain  plasma and the sample used in the isolation and measurement of 
blood metabolites an d hormones including glucose, fructose, TG, FFA, ketones, insulin, and for the VLDL -lipoproteins, 
apolip oprotein B100, VLDL -TG concentration, and TG -palmitate lipogenesis .  Once the samples have been processed for  
mass spectrometry and the data acquired, the processed samples will be kept until at least 10 years after publication  (the 
stable isotope does not decay and the samples retain their value) .  DEXA  is used to measure total and regional fat mass 
and f at-free mass , a FibroScan ® ultrasound  is performed to measu re liver elastography  (liver stiffness due to fibrosis) , and 
MRI  is used to assess liver fat .  Indirect calorimetry is performed to measure energy expenditure , and skin oil collected 
(Sebutape ®) to measure  fatty acid composition.   Table [ADDRESS_1092266].

Schedule of Events  
Telephone S creening:  The subject will respond to the recruiting flyer  or advertisement  and answer the waiver of written 
consent and screening questions.  These questions are for preliminary screening only and are not used as study data since 
the data repr esent self -report.  The questions include queries about health history/habits, age, gender, height, weight, 
tobacco u se, medications/supplements, over -the-counter  drugs use, illness, and chronic conditi ons.  The study design is 
described in general terms to subjects, with mention of three  factors most likely to impact subject interest in participating.  
These factors include having an IV line, that there are two overnight stays in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792186], and that the drugs 
may have side effects.  If the subject is interested in bein g screened for participation, research staff  then make s an 
appointment for the subject to come into the CRC for formal consenting, and screening procedures.  The length between 
the screening visit and beginning study procedures may vary according to subject’s availability but will not be longer than 
4 weeks.  For each of the visits shown in Figure 1 , the procedures as are described below.  
 
Screening and Consenting V isit:  The first v isit to the CRC will include a written formal consent.  We estimat e that we 
will have to screen 100  people to find the 12 subjects to do the study.  After signing the consent form, medical 
information is obtained by [CONTACT_792207], gender, ethnic/ racial category, height, body weight (history of body 
weight), vitals, and medical history (medications use, smoking history and a fasting blood draw (40 mL) is taken to test 
for biochemistries) .  An ECG will be performed and read  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mary Dohrmann, Cardiology.   
 
As soon as the blood biochemistry results are available, the subject is contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], provided with a copy of the results, told 
whether he is eligible to continue, and asked if they want to participate further.  Staff also as k the subject to describe, in 
their own words, what the baseline visit will be like.  If they agree to participate, an appointment is made for the subject to 
come to the CRC for their overnight baseline visit.  
 
Three days before visit 1, the subject is pr ovided with food and beverages to meet his total energy needs for weight 
stability.  No alcohol will be consumed during this time.  The meals are made up of commercially available foods and the 
composition is based in foods the subject normally consumes.  
 
Baseline Visit 1 :  Before arriving to the CRC, the subject will go to Fairview Digestive Health Clinic for a 15 minute 
FibroScan.  If a FibroScan becomes a vailable to be housed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , then this trip to Fairview would not be 
necessary and the meas urement would be made during the inpatient study.  The CRC will begin at 4:[ADDRESS_1092268] procedure is MRI to assess liver fat content.  Next, after 
returning to the CRC, an IV line will be placed in one of the arms and an isotope (13C1-acetate, 10g/1200 mL half -normal 
saline) will be infused through that IV.  Afterward, the subject will be fed dinner and then undergo a skin test, where a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_792187] [ADDRESS_1092269] will sleep 
overnight at the CRC.  At 6:[ADDRESS_1092270] (OSTT).  The calorimetry test will be performed again at 9:30 AM and blood will be 
drawn intermittently until 2:[ADDRESS_1092271] the CRC.  If all

Version 6 Date:  March [ADDRESS_1092273] dose that evening.  
Each day, he will take a single pi[INVESTIGATOR_792188] 10:30 PM (or at bedtime if before 10:30 PM).  The study physician, 
Camila Manrique, MD, will oversee the prescribed dosage the subject will take.  This dosage will be deter mined in 
consult with the Safety Officer, Ghassan Hammoud, MD, according to the attached Dosing Decision Tree.   
 
The OSTT is a combination of glucose and fructose consumed in [ADDRESS_1092274]  a "Kool -Aid like" solution of 0.9g/kg fructose and 0.3g/k glucose in water.  After the baseline test is 
completed, the subject takes home all food/beverages that he will consume until he returns for visit 2.  
 
Safety Blood Draw Visits  2 and 3 :  As shown in Figure [ADDRESS_1092275] is instructed not to exercise on this morning before this blood 
draw.  For 12 hours before these visits, he i s asked to not eat or drink anything besides water.  Blood will be taken (10 ml) 
and vitals will be checked.  This visit will take about [ADDRESS_1092276] takes home food to eat until visit 4.  
 
Safety Blood Draw Visit  4:  The subject will return to the CRC for a third safety blood draw and all procedures done at the 
previous safety blood draws will be repeated, with the addition of the skin test.  A small amount of blood will be drawn 
(14 mls).  The subject is asked to not exercise on this morning before this blood draw.  For [ADDRESS_1092277] is told not to apply any lotion or skin 
products to the face on the morning of this visit.  This visit will take about 45 minutes.  At the end of visit 4, the subjec t 
takes food home to keep him weight stable until Follow -up visit 5.  
 
Follow -Up Visit 5 :  On the day of the subject’s last dose of medication, he will return to the CRC for the follow -up visit. 
This visit is exactly the same as the baseline visit, however, blood will also be drawn four times during  the night to assess 
drug pharmacokinetics.  The subject will come to the CRC at 4:[ADDRESS_1092278]  will discontinue taking the drug.  
 
Safety Blood Draw Visit 6 :  Approximately [ADDRESS_1092279] is told to not eat or drink anything besides water.  A small amount of blood will be taken 
(10 mls).  This visit will take about 30 minutes.  
 
 
Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics  
Recruitment and informed consent :  The study population includes overweight and obese male subjects,  aged 35-60y.  The 
recruitment process will include the typi[INVESTIGATOR_792189].  The recruitment material will be 
posted around University of Missouri campus, as well as other public places such as swimming pools, churches, and 
grocery stores.   We also plan to use the service called Studykik ( https://studykik.com/ ).  All advertisements  will state the 
purpose of the study, eligibili ty criteria and will tell subjects to call into our laboratory for more information.  During 
these calls, the study will be described briefly.  A checklist will be phone through to perform initial screening for age, 
gender, health status.  Subjects who are  eligible by [CONTACT_792208] a screening visit.  
 
The consent form states the purpose of the study, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other important information 
about the study and has been prepared in lay terms so that it is easy to understand.  During  the screening visit  the form is 
reviewed comprehensively.  The subject will be instructed to ask questions about any words or information that they do 
not clearly understand and questions will be answered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_792190].  Th is will enable us to determine the 
subject’s comprehension of the study.  The consent form will be signed before any study procedures a re initiated.

Subjects who live [ADDRESS_1092287] from Columbia by [CONTACT_792210] $25 for the screening visit.  
 
Potential risks  
Physical risks may include:  
1.  Intravenous catheterization:  The tests in the present protocol require one IV line to be in for roughly [ADDRESS_1092288] rule of thumb for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792191] 48 hrs.  The duration of the IVs in the present protocol is less than this time.  Placement of IV lines 
may cause bleeding, bruising, infection, clotting, pain  at the needle site, and/or fainting.  Extravasation of study 
substances could cause swelling and local irritation at the intravenous site.  A black and blue mark may result from 
placement of and IV.   This can be painful, but it carries no significant risk s.  Infections from IVs rarely occur.  
2. Blood drawing:  During the screening and safety blood draw visits, blood will be drawn through a needle.  The risk of 
blood drawing may include temporary discomfort from the needle stick, bruising, and rarely, infectio n.  
3. The total blood loss for the entire study is [ADDRESS_1092289] calorimetry:  The inpatient stays include [ADDRESS_1092290] slightly stressful.  
5. Stable is otopes:  The stable isotopes received in the IV contain no radioactivity, and have no recognized harmful 
effects.  These compounds are commonplace variants of naturally -occurring compounds (fatty acids, amino acids, 
etc.).  The isotope solution is made by [CONTACT_792211] 48 hours.  
6. DEXA:  The radiation during DEXA is equivalent to about 2% of the average radiation dose from all sources (natural 
background radiation, consumer appliances, radon gas, medical tests, etc.) that a pers on in the [LOCATION_002] receives 
each year.  
7. Magnetic resonance imaging:  The risks of undergoing an MRI include some psychological stress from a loud, 
banging noise during the scan.  Subjects may experience nervousness from confinement in a tight space 
(claustrophobia).  Magnetic fields to be used in this study present no known hazards to human subjects whose bodies 
do not contain any para -magnetic metals.

Version 6 Date:  March 8 , 201 7 
 
8. FibroScan:  This ultrasound measurement of the liver involves a probe being placed on the skin above t he liver.  
There is no radioactivity associated with this procedure.  A FibroScan test is painless and lasts [ADDRESS_1092292] 
will need to lie very still.  
9. Intake of TVB -2640:  This is an experiment drug which has been shown to have some side effects.  Of the people who 
have taken the drug for [ADDRESS_1092293]: During the baseline and follow up visit, subjects will be asked to consume a bolus of sugars.  Risks could 
include upset stom ach. 
11. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470965]:  During the visits and study, the subject will be restricted to the CRC.  Although quiet leisure activities 
can be provided, confinement to the CRC may be boring or the subject may feel hungry.  Some may find it hard to be 
confined to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792192].  
12. Sebutape:  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_792193].  The procedure is noninvasive but the 
tape tugs slightly on the skin when it is removed.  
13. Psychological stress:  The psycholog ical stress from participation in this study is minimal.  However, some of the 
questions about food intake and physical activity may make the subjects feel uncomfortable.  The indirect calorimetry 
test is painless; however, persons who are uncomfortable in  confined spaces may find this test stressful.  
14. Loss of confidentiality:  Any time information is collected, there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality.  Every 
effort will be made to keep subject’s information confidential; however, this cannot be guaranteed.  The information 
collected includes: age, gender, height, body weight, blood pressure, and blood tests results (e.g. glucose, blood fats), 
hepatitis status, urine drug test results, and hormones (insulin).  Finally, the investigator will rep ort information to 
authorities in order to prevent serious harm to the subjects or to others.  If the Investigators suspect child, elder or 
disabled person abuse, they will report such concerns to proper authorities as required by [CONTACT_2371].  
15. Risks to sperm:  The  effects of the DEXA on the male reproductive system are unknown but could cause harm.  
16. Other risks:  There may possibly be other side effects that are unknown at this time.  The complete history of 
experience with this drug in humans is described in the In vestigators Brochure which is part of the attached IND 
application.  
 
Protection against risk  
1. Infections from IVs rarely occur.  However, if any signs of infection appear, the IV will be removed and the area

inclusion/exclusion criteria.  All medical and biographical in formation will be held in strict confidentiality and no 
disclosures of personal identity will be made unless specifically requested by [CONTACT_423].  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_110304], 
as well as the experimental log book, are kept in a locked file cabinet in the laboratory.  Only subject ID numbers are used 
to also insure confidentiality.  Participants will not be individually identified in any publications.  The participants’ rig ht 
to privacy will be protected to the highest extent possible.  
 
Protection of materials, and privacy  
All sample tubes  are coded to conceal the subjects' identities  and n o identifying information is present on the tubes.  They 
are labeled  with the subject's th ree-letter code identifier and the date.  No tools (e.g., cell lines, probe s, etc) will be 
generated from any of this material.  The study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and HIPAA 
guidelines.  Only the Investigators and study coordinator will have access to the codes.  Aside from the sample sent to th e 
Sponsor (3V Biosciences)  the samples will not be shared with other investigators within the University of Missouri or 
outside the University.  No identifying information will be shared or reported in any publication.  
 
Potential benefits to human subjects  and others  
The research plan t ests whether the drug will lower liver fat in men with risks for future nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.  
Development of such a drug would aid the millions of U.S. citizens who suffer from this condition.  There is no direct  
benefit for the subjects and all study procedures are voluntary.   
 
Reducing risk in p articipants  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_792194]. Camilla Manrique  will monitor all procedures and the study results.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_792195].   [CONTACT_792223] is the safety officer .  The special precautions are as follows:  
1. The subjects will be closely monitored at the CRC by [CONTACT_39137].  
2. Standard aseptic technique, frequent monitoring of vital signs, and visual inspection of the IV line sites will  be 
followed during IV line placement and blood sampling.  
3. The isotopes used are purchased to be consumed and prepared as sterile for administration via IV.  The isotope

INTRODUCTION  
This consent may contain words that you do not understand.  Please ask the investigator or the study 
staff to explain any words or information that you do not clearly understand.  This project is a  research 
study.  Research studies  include only people who choose to participate.  As a study participant 
you have the right to know about the procedures that will be used in this research study so that 
you can make the decision whether or not to participate.  The information presented here is 
simply an effort to make you better informed so that you may give or withhold your consent to 
participate in this research study.  Please take your time to make your decision.  This study is 
being sponsored by [CONTACT_198207], 3V Biosciences, who has developed  an investigational  drug to 
treat liver disease in overweight people .  This drug is not approved by [CONTACT_792213].  One 
of the Co -Investigators , Elizabeth Parks, consults for this company and therefore she received 
financial compensation from the company sponsoring thi s research.  Elizabeth Parks has 
designed the study and a physician, [CONTACT_231894] will be conducting it.  
 
What is this study about?   People who are overweight can begin to store fat in their liver.  This fat is 
made from dietary sugar and can cause the liv er to not work well.  You are being asked to take 
part in this study because your body weight increases the likelihood that your liver will make fat.  
In order to participate in this study, it will be necessary to give your written consent.  
 
The following definitions may help you understand this study:  
• “Researchers ” means the study doctor and research personnel at the University of Missouri.  
• “Stable isotopes ” are naturally occurring elements used to help us trace sources of fat in the  
             blood.  Stable isotopes are not radioactive.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART? 
The company 3V Biosciences has developed a n investigational  drug called TVB -2640.   This drug is not 
approved by [CONTACT_792213].   In prelim inary studies, this drug has been shown to lower liver fat 
production but the ideal dose for its use has not been decided.  The purpose of this study is to test the 
drug in overweight men, to determine the appropriate dose.  The information from this study  will enable 
future studies to test the drug’s effects in patients with liver fat due to disease.  The tests performed are 
not part of your standard medical care.  Up to 100 people will be screened to find the 12 people who will 
take part in this study.  
 
  
 
 
UMC,  HS IRB:  CONSENT   
  14 of 20WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY AND HOW LONG WILL I PARTICIPATE ? 
This research is measuring how the drug may improve liver health.  You will be screened to find out if 
you are eligible to participate.  As shown below,  over [ADDRESS_1092303] had.  This visit is located at the Clinical 
Research Center (CRC).  The C RC is on the 5th floor of the University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792200].  You will come to the CRC after fasting overnight for 12 hours (no food 
or drink, except water).  This visit will take 1 hour and you are welcome to bri ng a family member or close 
friend to this visit.  
 
Research staff will meet with you to review the study procedures, answer questions, sign this consent 
form and review your medical history.  A small amount of blood will be drawn (about 2.5 tablespoons) to  
check your general health which includes a test for hepatitis  as well as a measurement of your fasting 
blood sugar to ensure you are not diabetic .  Your urine will be tested for drugs.  Your height, weight, and 
blood pressure will be measured and you will  be given a chance to learn about a procedure called 
calorimetry, which we use to measure how many calories your body burns.  If you enter the study, this 
technique will be performed four times.  Within a week after the screening visit, you will receive th e 
results of all screening tests and someone on the study team will go over the results with you.  Since this 
is not a treatment study, these lab tests are not being used for standard medical care.  You will be given 
a copy of the results which you can sha re with your primary physician.  
 
If your screening results qualify you to be in the study, and if you are interested in proceeding with the 
study, you will be scheduled for a second, baseline visit.  Again, you will come to the CRC at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792201].  For [ADDRESS_1092304] consume only 
these meals, all of the food provided, and no other food .  You may not consume alcohol between days -2 
and 13 of the study.  
 
BASELINE VISIT 1:  On the day of your first overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792202], you will come into the CRC at 4:[ADDRESS_1092305] procedures include 
assessments of your liver health.  This will include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and also, 
potentially, a procedure called the FibroScan.  These, and all the procedures are described in detail 
below.  When you return to th e CRC after your scan, an IV line will be placed in a vein in one of your 
arms.  Next, an IV solution is infused.  This solution is called an isotopic tracer and it will continue until [ADDRESS_1092306] a sample of the oils produced by [CONTACT_792214] .   
 
You will  then sleep overnight in the CRC.  At 6 AM the next morning, you will arise and wash up.   Then, a 
second IV line is placed in your other arm and this one will be used to draw blood.  You will undergo a 
procedure called calorimetry, which measures the amount of calories you burn.  You will then consume a 
  
 
 
UMC,  HS IRB:  CONSENT   
  15 of 20sugary drink and blood will be drawn of f and on until 2 PM .  You will undergo calorimetry a second time.  
After the final blood draw, you will be fed lunch and undergo a procedure called a DEXA  scan .  The 
DEXA scan measures your body composition.  After this you will be discharged and can go ho me. 
 
If all baseline procedures are successful, you will begin the drug treatment regimen for the next 10 days.  
You will take a single daily dose of the drug orally before bedtime or 10:[ADDRESS_1092307].  
The physician assigned to this study w ill oversee the prescribed dosage you are instructed to take.  
 
SAFETY BLOOD DRAW VISIT 2:  The morning of this visit , please do not exercise, and for 12 hours before 
the visit, do not use caffeine and vitamin supplements.  You will come into the CRC after fasting 
overnight for 12 hours - no food or drink, except water after 7 PM.  A small amount of blood will be taken 
(about 1 tablespoon) and we will check your weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. This 
visit will take about 30 minutes.  
 
SAFETY BLOOD DRAW VISITS 3:  This visit is the same as visit #2 above.  A small amount of blood will be 
taken (about 1 tablespoon).  
 
SAFETY BLOOD DRAW VISITS 4:  This visit is the same as visit #[ADDRESS_1092308] the oils produced by [CONTACT_792215].  The morning of this visit, do not apply any lotion or skin pro ducts on your face.  A small amount of 
blood will be taken (about 1 tablespoon).  This visit will take about 1 hour.  
 
FOLLOW -UP VISIT 5:  Just as you did for the baseline visit, you will come in to the CRC at 4 PM and the 
procedures will be the same.  Howe ver, in this visit, blood  will also be drawn 4 times during  the night.  
This visit will take 24 hours and the total blood draw will be about 2 oz or about 2 tablespoons.  Following 
this visit, the treatment portion of this study is over and you will discon tinue taking the drug.  
 
SAFETY BLOOD DRAW VISIT 6:  Approximately 5 -7 days following visit 5, you will come into the CRC for 
final safety blood draw (1 tablespoon).  The same procedures will be done at this visit as with safety 
visits 2 and 3.  This visit will take about 45 minutes.  
 
WHAT ARE THE PROCEDURES AND RISKS OF BEING IN THIS STUDY ? 
STUDY DRUG 
The study drug, TVB -2640, has been given in preliminary studies for [ADDRESS_1092309]  
after the subjects stopped taking the drug.  These side effects were seen at higher doses than will be used 
here, and when the drug was given for longer durations.  In the present study, you will take the drug for 10 
days.  Even  so, you will be monitored closely and blood samples will be taken every couple of days to 
document the drug’s effects.   If you notice any side effects such as dry skin, nausea, or eye problems, please 
notify the study staff immediately.  If your skin gets  dry you will be provided with lotion to reduce this side 
effect.  Additionally, it is unknown whether this drug has any effects on a man’s ability to reproduce.  We 
advise all subjects to use contraception (condoms) during the duration of this study.  
 
STUDY DIET:  FOOD AND BEVERAGES  
  
 
 
UMC,  HS IRB:  CONSENT   
  16 of 20If you participate in the study you will be provided all your food during the 10 days you are taking the 
drug.  This food is commercially available (bought from HyVee) and the meals are made both fresh and 
also made up of some frozen meals.  When you come in for the safety blood draws, you will be given the 
food in a cooler to take home.  If you prefer, you may be provided a couple of cans of soda to drink 
during this time (no other soda than these can be consumed).  Otherwise, only water, tea, and coffee are 
allowed (cream and any kind of sweetener is allowed).  No additional milk shakes, protein shakes, or 
energy drinks should be consumed during this study.  
 
It is advised that if you have a special event coming up in the next m onth (wedding, vacation travel, etc.) 
that you not participate in the study at this time.  You should not consciously change your physical 
activity while you are in the study.  In other words, if you would like to join a gym or begin exercising 
more, we as k that you wait until the study is over before you do this.  
 
CALORIMETRY  
This test measures how many calories your body uses.  This procedure will be performed at visit [ADDRESS_1092310] is painless; however, persons who are uncomfortable in confined spaces may find 
this slightly stressful.  You will get a chance to familiarize yourself with this procedure during screening.  
 
MEASUREMENT OF BODY FAT AND MUSCLE BY [CONTACT_792216] 1 and 5.  A DEXA (dual energy x -ray absorptiometry)  scan  is a 
procedure to measure y our body composition - how much fat and muscle your body has.  It is a type of x -
ray machine with a moving arm.  This procedure involves lying on a table for [ADDRESS_1092311] participated in any other research study involving 
ionizing radiation exposure (x -rays) in the past 12 months, discuss this with the Investigator to determine 
if you are el igible to participate in this study.  You will be exposed to a small radiation dose which is 
about 2% of the average radiation dose from all sources (natural background radiation, consumer 
appliances, radon gas, medical tests, etc.) that a person receives in the [LOCATION_002] receives each 
year.  However, radiation effects add up.  If you need an x -ray in the next year, you should inform your 
doctor of your participation in this study.  
 
MEASUREMENT OF LIVER FAT BY [CONTACT_792217] 1  and 5 at either the department of Radiology at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792203].  Transportation will be provided.  MRI 
(magnetic resonance imaging) is a technique used to measure the amount of fat pre sent in your liver.  
The risks of undergoing an MRI could include some psychological stress from a banging noise during the 
scan.  Subjects may experience nervousness from confinement in a tight space (claustrophobia).  
Magnetic fields to be used in this s tudy have no known hazards to human subjects whose bodies do not 
contain any magnetic metals (see below for protection from risks).  If you feel anxious, you can stop the 
procedure at any time.  You may experience some discomfort and fatigue from lying sti ll during scanning.  
You will be questioned using a standardized interview about whether you have a heart pacemaker, 
metallic objects, vascular clips, electrodes, cochlear implants, neurostimulators, shunts, heart valve 
implants, penile implants, vascular filters, rods & screws, post CABG pacer wires, colored contact [CONTACT_13293], 
dental prostheses, limb prostheses, eye prostheses, shrapnel, metal in head, eye, or skin, and 
  
 
 
UMC,  HS IRB:  CONSENT   
  [ADDRESS_1092312] blood drawn through a needle.  Risks associated with 
drawing blood from your arm include minimal discomfort and/or bruising.  Infection, excess bleeding, 
clotting, and/or fainting  also are possible, although unlikely.  As a result of your participation in this study 
you will have donated blood.  If you wish to participate in other research after you finish this project, you 
should let the investigator know that you have given about  6 oz (or about 3/4 cup).  Your blood volume 
will be checked during screening to make sure that it is in safe limits.  
 
INTRAVENOUS CATHETERIZATION  
During baseline visit [ADDRESS_1092313] to be placed in a different location on 
the arm or hand.  The IV lines will be in for about 20 hours.  The pro tocols that the CRC nurses follow to 
reduce risk of infection include:  cleaning the skin thoroughly before IV placement, securing the IV with 
tape, covering the site with clean gauze, and protecting the site using an elastic sleeve.  The site is 
inspected  at each blood draw – with particular attention paid to any changes in the surrounding skin.  
 
HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_792204].  Although quiet leisure activities can be provided, 
confinement to the CRC may be boring or y ou may feel hungry.  You may move about your assigned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792205], unless the test being performed requires bed -rest.  Some 
people may find it hard to be confined to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_792192].  For the r easons 
stated above the investigator will observe you closely while giving the treatment described and, if you 
have any worrisome symptoms or symptoms that the investigator or her associates have described to 
you, notify the investigator immediately.  Inve stigator’s telephone number is (573) [ADDRESS_1092314] study coordinator, Kimberlee

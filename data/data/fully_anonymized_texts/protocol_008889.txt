tightness, and coughing ( The Co llaborative Study on the Genetics of Asthma , 1997 ; GINA,

The current guidance on the management of patients with asthma is a stepwise intensificat ion 
of a daily  maintenance regimen primarily  centered around the combinat ion of inhaled 
corticoster oids (ICS) and l ong-acting β2 agonists (LABA) ( GINA, 2023 , GINA, 2021 ).In 
patients wi th moderately severe asthma, an add-on of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_476584] (L TRA) is recommended, while the add -on of tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_476585] -immunoglobulin 
E (IgE), anti -interleukin-5/5 receptor (anti -IL5/5R), or anti -IL4R is recommended for those 
with severe asthma ( GINA, 2023).

in the airway ( also referred to as eosinophilic asthma) representing approximately  40% to 60% 
of patients wi th asthma ; these pat ientsexhibit adegree of eosinophilia associ ated wi th clinical  
severit y including the risk of asthma exacerbat ions (Bousquet et al .,1990; Louis et al .,2000; 
Di Franco et al .,2003; Scott and W ardlaw, 2006
, Simpson et al .,2006; Zhang and Wenzel,
2007). Also of interest is the observed reduct ion in the frequency o f asthma exacerbat ions 
when convent ional ICS -based asthma therapy  was adj usted according to the degree of sputum  
eosinophils as a biomarker of disease activit y inprospective trials ( Green et al .,2002
; 
Jayaram et al.,2006).
IL-5 is a cy tokine factor essent ia
l for eosinophil trafficking and survival ( Molfinoet al.,2011 ). 
Benralizumab is an anti -IL5R monoclonal ant ibody devel oped as add -on therapy  for pati ents 
with severe eosinophilic asthma.
2.1 Study Rationale
To date, benralizumab has proven efficacy and safety in both randomized clinical trials (P hase 
3 and4
) as well as in studies using real-world data. Functional changes on ai rway  dynamics
and their correlation to the clinical benefit smeasured by [CONTACT_476639]-reported outcomes ( PROs )following treatment with benralizumab ,have yet to be fully  
explored.

In thi s study , Funct ional Respi[INVESTIGATOR_476588] (FRI) will be used to measure changes in airway 
dynamics . FRI i s a relatively novel quant itativemethod to m easure bio logical  responses to 
therapeuti c intervent ions using a combinat ion of high-resolution computed tom ography  (CT)
and co mputational fluid dynamics (CFD) . FRI provides detailed visualizat ion and evaluat ion 
of the l ungs and ai rway structures, allowing for an in -depth descript ion of baselin e lung heal th 
and level o f deteri oration and a better understanding of post -treatment effects. By  [CONTACT_476640], the method is more sensit ive (higher 
effect si ze) com pared wi th standard l ung f unction test s(De Backer et al., 2012a) . Several  
clinical trials in patients wi thasthma (De Backer et al., 2008; Vos et al., 2013 ; De Backer et 
al., 2015 )and chronic obstructive pulmo nary disease ( COPD) showed significant correlat ions 
between the change in forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_4034] 1 second ( FEV 1), other pulmo nary functi on 
test param eters or asthma control ,and the change in both image -based vo lume and /orairway 
resistance fo llowing bronchodilat ionor resol ution of exacerbat ion(De Backer et al., 2011 ; 
Vos et al., 2016; De Backer et al., 2018; Van Geffen et al., 2018) .The background variance o f 
well controlled imaging such as FRI is lower relat ive to pulmo nary function testing due to the 
exclusio n of confounding factors such as upper airway properties, patient effort, and coaching. 
This m eans that FRI has enhanced sens itivity (better signal to noise ratio) compared with 
convent ional spi[INVESTIGATOR_96656](Ides et al ., 2012 ; De Backer et al., 2013 ).
In addit ion tobronchoconstrict ion and airway thickening, mucus plugging is commo n and 
often persistent in pat ients with asthma and seen on CT scans of most patients. Eosinophils are 
the major cell t ype found in the Charcot -Leyden crystals in mucus plugs of asthmat ics. Mucus 
plugs wi th eosinophilic inflammat ion may have a profound effect on pulmo nary functi on and 
the development of exacerbat ions, and imaging of bronchial segments and scoring of mucus 
plugging is a well -accepted research tool in respi[INVESTIGATOR_23715] ( Oguma et al ., 202 1)
.
Depl etion of eosinophils should lead to a reduction in mucus plugging on imaging and 
improvement of airway patency and airflow distribution. Kooner et al. demonstrated that 
patients wi th high baseline mucus score had significant improvements in VDP and asthma 
control  post -benralizumab while participants with low mucus score did not ( Kooner et al., 
2021).
Ongo ing trials like the CHINOOK study will also evaluate the relationship between any 
observed effects on airway rem odeling , improvements in lung physio logyand airway 
dynamics in response to benralizumab ;however ,this study  isprimarily  focused on the impact 
onairway  remodeling by m orphol ogical and histologi cal measures in subjects with severe 
eosinophilic asthma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; ClinicalTrials.Gov ). 
This m echanistic study  will thus invest igate the short -term benefit s of sustained deplet ion of 
airway eosinophils by  [CONTACT_476641] - 5.[ADDRESS_611035] dynamic measurements and 
 
 will also be explored, 
aiming to identify a link between  with functional parameters measured at ba seline and following treatment with benralizumab.
2.2 Background
Benralizumab is currently approved for clinical us e by [CONTACT_72563] (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) as add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma and with an eosinophilic phenotype. It is a humanized, afucosylated, m onoclonal antibody against the IL-5R α subunit that induces 
direct, rapid, and near-complete depletion of eosinophils in blood, airway tissue, and bone 
marrow through enhanced antibody-depende nt cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Tan et al., 
2016) . Natural killer cells are involved in this apoptotic process resulting in controlled 
eosinophilic elimination (Kolbeck et al., 2010; Pham et al., 2016) . 
The efficacy and safety of benralizumab ha s been evaluated in four phase 3 rando mized 
controlled clinical trials. Benralizumab significantly decreased the rate of annual exacerbations and improved FEV
1, compared with placebo, in patients with severe 
uncontrolled asthma who were receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β2
agonists in the SIROCCO (Bleecker et al., 2016)  and CALIMA (FitzGerald et al., 2016) trials. 
In the 24-week ANDHI trial (n = 660), benralizumab significantly reduced exacerbation risk 
compared with placebo in addition to statist ically si gnificant improvements from bas eline to 
week 24 in  versus placebo. Benralizumab also improved pulmonary 
function as measured by [CONTACT_105225]-BD FEV1 (Harrison et al., 2021, 
Investigator’s Brochure ). The rate of AEs was similar between the benralizumab and placebo 
groups (Harrison et al., 2021) . This analysis included patients with an eosinophilic phenotype 
defined as an EOS count of ≥ 150/μl plus at least one of the following: maintenance OCS, 
nasal polyps, FVC < 65% predicted, 3 or more exace rbations in the prior year and adult onset 
of disease (Harrison et al., 2021) .
In the 28-week ZONDA trial, benralizumab significantly reduced the need for oral 
corticosteroids as well as the rate of asthma exacerbations in an OCS dependent population 
when compared to placebo (Nair et al., 2017) .
The efficacy and safety of benralizumab was also evaluated in open label trials, such as the 
open-label extension trials, MELTEMI (Korn et al., 2021)  and PONENTE (Menzies-Gow et 
al., 2021) , with both efficacy and safety result s consistent with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518].
Nevertheless, the shorter-term effects of benralizumab on airway dynamics remain to be fully 
elucidated. A deeper understanding of this coul d provide additional useful insights into the CCI

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 29of 1362.3.1 Risk Assessment
For the fo llowing potenti al risks of clinical significance , summary o f data rel ated to 
these ri sks, and corresponding mit igation strategi es for the invest igational product (IP), 
benralizumab, may be found in the Investigator's Brochure. Serious hypersensit ivity 
reacti ons (including anaphylaxis) are ident ified risks of biologic therapy , including 
benralizumab . Anaphylaxis may be life- threatening. Risk minimizat ion recommends a 
minimum o f a 1-hour observat ion peri od at the clinical site following IP administration 
for the appearance of any  acute drug reacti ons.
Develop ment of ant i-drug ant ibodies (ADA) to benralizumab has been documented. 
Theoretical risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_476589]. There was no apparent impact of ADA on overall 
benralizumab safet y or efficacy in th e phase 3 tri als.
Eosinophils are a prominent feature of the inflammatory  response to helmint hic 
parasit ic infect ions. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that prolonged eosinophil 
depletion may diminish the abilit y to def end against helmint hic parasite s. There were 
no reports of helmint h infect ion in the phase 3 asthma exacerbat ion studi es.
Malignancies have been reported at a low incidence in the completed and ongoing 
studi es of  benralizumab. Eosinophils have been fo und in associat ion with solid tum ors, 
especially  tumors of  epi[INVESTIGATOR_412261] (breast and col on), and m ay play  an active role in 
tumor defense by [CONTACT_476643], or may  be a by[CONTACT_145152]. However, 
the cause and consequences ( ie,pro-tumorigenic versus ant itumorigenic) of eosinop hil 
recrui tment and accumulat ion into tum ors are unclear ( Jacobsen et al., 2012 ).
Serious infect ions have been reported for benralizumab. The incidence of serious 
infect ions was similar across groups in the phase [ADDRESS_611038] ion has not been 
established.
Inform ation regarding the use of benralizumab in pregnant and lactating wo men is 
currently missing. Appropriate risk minimizat ion measures have been implemented in 
the study  protocol  (see Secti on 1.3, 5.2 and 7.1).
The clinical benefit demonstrated in clinical trials, combined wit h the overall safet y profile of 
benralizumab has established a posit ive benefit -risk profile for the approved severe asthma 
indicat ion. Risk minimizat ion measures include the exclusio n of part icipants wi th allergy or 
reacti on to any  com ponent of the benralizumab formulat ion, untreated helmint h paras itic 
infect ion and act ive or recent malignancy , while concurrently performing routine 
pharmacovigilance act ivities.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 30of 136Risks of the study  design are those associated with computed tomography  (CT). In clinical 
practi ce, pati ents wi th asthma are not subjected t o many high -resolution CT scans. As such, 
undergo ing the CT procedure during this study may result in a benign or incidental finding. 
The use of CT also invo lves ionizing radiat ion that increases the risk of radiogenic tumors in 
participants and may also p ose a risk to embry o fetal devel opment and infant. Steps will be 
taken to minimize these risks including the exclusion of pregnant and lactating women in the 
study . Further inform ation on the steps taken to reduce radiat ion exposure are detailed below. 
TheCT procedures incorporated into this study  design are aligned wi th the di rectives 
presented in the European Unio n (EU) gui dance ( Directorate -General –Environment, nuclear 
safet y and civil protection, 1998a ). Parti cipants will be informed of the risks associated with 
the CT procedure before entering the study .
In thi s study , extra attenti on will be paid to reduce radiat ion by [CONTACT_476644]. Low 
radiation scanning protocol guidance will be provided to sites before any subject scan visits. 
Parti cipating study  centers will  be requi red to set up a study -allocated CT scanner with a low 
radiation scanning protocol  and conduct a phantom scan using this protocol. The phantom 
scan will be sent to a central vendor supporting this study  for FRI analysis for review and 
confirmat ion for the l ow radi ation CT scanner settings. All study  team  personnel invo lved in 
theCT scanning procedure will also undergo training to ensure qualit y and consistency of the 
high-resolution CT scans are m aintained across study  centers. Study  centers will only be 
certified for the CT scanning procedure after the phantom scan is approved b y the central 
vendor and all relevant study  team  personnel have successfully co mpleted their training.
Specifically , the am ount of  radiation exposure for participants in this study  is dependent on 
the scanner used. The software CT -expo is used to give an e stimation of the radiation dose a 
patient will get from  a FRC/TLC CT scan. CT -expo’s calculat ions are based on computational 
methods which were used to evaluate the data collected in both German surveys on CT 
exposure practice in 1999 and 2002 ( Stamm and Nagel, 2014 ). A com prehensive descript ion 
of these m ethods can be found in the book ‘Radiation Exposure in Computed Tomography’ 
(Nagel  and Wal ter, 2002 ). Based on a selection of CT s canner brands and models fro m four 
manufacturers, the estimated radiat ion exposure using the low radiat ion scanning protocols 
recommended for this study  can be found on Table S1 (Appendix A).Specific settings that 
were used in CT -expo are described on Table S2 (Appendix A).
The average effect ive dose for a high -resolution CT scan that will be conducted for this study 
averaged over all scanner ty pes ment ioned in T able S1 (Appendix A) is 1.[ADDRESS_611039] scans will be 7.78 mSv ( based on the scanner brands and models in T able 
S1 [Appendix A]
; note this calculat ion is dependent on body  size and com position). This dose 
is wit hin the accepted radiat ion dose range for bio logical research (1 to 10 milli Sieverts;

It is noteworthy  that while a high -resol ution CT scan taken with the recommended low 
radiation protocol in this study  is higher than a standard chest x -ray or m amm ogram  at 
0.02 mSv and 0.13 mSv respectiv ely according to the US Environmental Protection Agency 
(US Environmental Protection Agency, 2021a ), the average est imated radiation exposure 
received by  [CONTACT_476645]-resol ution CT scans at 7.78 mSv (based on 
the scanner brands and models in Table S1 [Appendix A ]) is approximately  [ADDRESS_611040] scans which would expose a person to 32 mSv of radiation (8 mSv per 
scan [ US Environmental Protection Agency, 2021b ]). 
An average US cit izen receives an annual natural background radiat ion exposure fro m natural  
sources of 3.1 mSv ( [LOCATION_002] N uclear Regulatory  Commissio n, 2017). Parti cipants 
completing this study will therefore receive an equivalent of 2.[ADDRESS_611041] imated radiat ion exposure in Table S1 (Appendix A). Based on the 
estimated total amount of radiat ion exposure for each participant, the potential benefit s of the 
study  are also expected to be Category  IIB fo llowing the European Unio n (EU) gui dance 
docum ent 
(Directorate -General –Environment, nuclear safet y and civil protection 1998b ) 
targeting the diagnosis, cure, or prevent ion of disease.
Further calculat ions on the relat ive risk increase were conducted and demonstrated a relative 
risk increase of 0.033% for the 7.78 mSv received fro m all scans in the current study , based 
on the detriment adjusted nominal risk coefficient for an adult at 4.2% per Sv as published by

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 35of 1364 STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
This is an interventional single group, open -label, uncontrolled, prospective, multicenter
clinical trial .
The s tudy will be conducted in m ale and female parti cipants ≥18 years old wit h established 
severe eosinophilic asthma, as defined by [CONTACT_118812]/ATS clinical guidelines (Chung et al., 2014 ), 
inadequately controlled by [CONTACT_476648] -LABA wit h or without oral corti costeroi ds 
(OCS )or other asthma controller medications .
There will be no study  intervent ion assignment applied as t his is a single group study .
Each p articipant will part icipate in the study  for a minimum  of 15weeks and up to 23 weeks 
from the time when informed consent is obtained through to end of study , inclusive of study  
follow-up. The fo llowing are the sequence and duration of study  periods:
Inform ed consent and instructions for withho lding maintenance and rescue asthma 
medicat ions for screening (24 hours to 30 days prior to screening)
Screening visit (V0)
Visit 1 (V1; week 0; within 1 to 21 day s of screening)
Visit 2 (V2; week 4 ±5 days ) 
Visit 3 (V3; week 8 ±5 days ) 
Visit 4 (V4; week 13 ± 5days)
Follow-up (2 weeks [±7 day s]after V4) -Phone call fo llow-up
Refer to Table 1for further inform ation on the Schedule of Act ivities (SoA)to be perform ed 
throughout the study .
Patients will  be discharged fro m the study  after the phone call follow -up is com pleted. Thi s 
study  will not be extended and there will be noroll-over studies. Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_611043] 
demonstrated very  low variabilit y in FRI parameters when patients are not subjected to an 
intervent ion or when imaged after equivalent maintenance medicat ion withhold periods (De 
Backer et al., 2012a ; De Backer et al., 2016 ; De Backer et al., 2018 ; Langton et al., 2019) .
A study  in an asthmat ic populat ion showed no change in airway volumes (siVaw)in repeated 
high reso lution CT scans after 3 to 7 day s when equivalent wash -out peri ods were observed 
(De Backer et al., 2016 ). Another study of patients with severe asthma who underwent 
bronchial thermoplast y also dem onstrated that airways in the untreated lung did not change 
significant ly after 4 weeks ( Langton et al., 2019 ). Subsequent variabilit y analysis was 
undertaken on untreated subjects from a previous double -blind placebo -controlled study  on 
the longitudinal change in FRI endpoints to inform expectations for endpoint progression in 
untreated patients (data o n file). FRI endpo ints were m easured at weeks [ADDRESS_611044] ics to that in the current study  
(sputum  eosinophilia and persistent, moderate -to-severe asthma). In the placebo group, siV aw 
changed (de creased) an average of -3.46% between weeks 0 and 12, with a 95% CI of 
(-7.50%, 0.584%), suggesting that subjects not receiving treatment are likely to exhibit stable 
or declining endpo int values. It should be noted that measures will also be taken during the CT 
image acquisit ion process to ensure variabilit y is reduced during this procedure. This includes, 
butisnot limited to, the use of phantom scans to ensure every site adheres to specific scanning 
protocol s provi ded to them . These qualit y assurance m easures will further improve the signal -
to-noise ratio.
Apart fro m the above, previous studies have reported a worsening in airway endpo ints in 
patients treated with placebo. This was observed in a placebo -controlled cross -over study  
assessing the effect o f budesonide/formoterol in patients with COPD ( De Backer et al., 
2012a ), as well as in another placebo -controlled cross -over study  assessing the effect of 
glycopy rrolate/formoterol  fumarate in pati ents wi th COPD ( De Backer et al., 2018 ). 
Therefore, the proposal to study  within-patient changes from baseline in a single -arm study  
may perhaps be a more conservat ive approach compared wi th a placebo -controlled study  
design . 
Taking the above rationales into consideration, the proposal of a single -arm study  design may  
be the most appropriate approach to meet the study aims and intent ion. Placebo data in

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 37 of 136patients with severe asthma will become availa ble from other studies of biologics in severe 
asthma ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and could be used as a placebo group in future post-hoc analysis.
Correlation analy sis conducted by [CONTACT_476649] 
(n = 79) and those with COPD (n = 49) suggest that the effect size of FRI outcomes in response to respi[INVESTIGATOR_476590]-to-four times larger 
than those in FEV
1, the current gold standard efficacy endpoint (De Backer et al., 2015) . The 
investigators concluded that FRI may be a good tool for evaluating the potentially subtle 
changes in lung function caused by [CONTACT_14181]-inflammatory compounds ( De Backer et al., 2015) .
FRI studies in patients with severe asthma  following treatment with other biologics are 
ongoing and data are not available presently.
CT-based mucus plug scoring has been shown to be positively associated with asthma linked 
eosinophilia ( Dunican et al., 2018) . Moreover, in patients with asthma, the presence of mucus 
plugs in four or more lung segments occurred in 67% of patients with FEV 1(percent 
predicted) of less than 60%, 19% of patients with FEV 1from 60%-80%, and 6% of patients 
with FEV 1greater than 80% (Dunican et al., 2018) . These results suggest that airway 
occlusion by [CONTACT_476650] a mechanis m underlying airflow obstruction in eosinophilic 
asthma. Therefore, it could be speculated that benralizumab-mediated eosinophil depletion in severe eosinophilic asthmatics may reduce mucus burden and correspondingly, the degree of airway obstruction.
Current methods for mucus plug scoring are discrete counts that disregard mucus plug size.
However, a novel method has been developed as part of FRI that extends mucus plug scoring 
by [CONTACT_476651], thereby 
[CONTACT_476652]. Given the established relationship between mucus plugs and airway obstruction, it is also plausible that reduced mucus volume will result in reduced air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_476591]. These changes may lead to improvements in  the participant’ s lung function and patient-
reported outcomes (PROs), ultimately allowing the participant to breathe more easily and thus feel better and experience a better quality of life. A clinically meaningful change in the 
primary endpoint would be a significant cha nge in total untrimmed mucus volume at week 13 
from baseline after treatment with benralizumab. Significant changes in FEV
1, forced vital 
capacity (FVC) and scores from , and positive correlations between 
these changes and the changes in the primary endpoint would further reflect and support the clinically meaningful improvements in outcomes under benralizumab. It will also allow the results from the current study to be put in to context with previous or future findings from 
studies on benralizumab treatment (see below for further details regarding PROs conducted in previous studies on benralizumab treatment).CCI
Clinical Study Protocol - 5.[ADDRESS_611045]-benralizumab, with changes detected as early as 14 days, and 
pronounced effects on patients with SEA and mucus plugs ( McIntosh et al., 2020; McIntosh et 
al., 2021; Oguma et al., 2021)  following treatment with benralizumab every [ADDRESS_611046] udy. The results show improvements in change 
from baseline in FEV
1as early as week 8 following treatm ent with benralizumab 30 mg every 
4 weeks compared with the placebo arm (data on file). These observations provide support for 
assessing outcomes in patients treated with benralizumab for a shorter duration, while ongoing 
trials like the CHINOOK study with a study duration of one year, will take measurements as early as 8 weeks and will be repeated at week 48. 
A 13 (± 1) week study duration was selected for this study to evaluate outcomes under 
treatment based on the above. Furt her, it is also to ensure the evaluation occurs at the middle 
time point between the third and fourth dose of benralizumab [ADDRESS_611047] optimal serum concentrations during evaluation of the final measurements for the study.
Patient-reported Outcomes (PROs)
The benefits shown on other PROs at 28-days post-benralizumab (McIntosh et al., 2020;  
McIntosh et al., 2021; Oguma et al., 2021)  also suggest the possible value of exploring the

Age Selection
Only participants ≥18 years old will be eligible to participate in the study as there is currently 
no data are available for children aged 6 to 11 years old with the treatment of benralizumab, 
and while data is available in adolescents aged 12 to less than 18 years old permitting use of 
benralizumab in this patient group by [CONTACT_476653], the EMA made no recommendation on a posology. The current study will e nroll participants from the US and 
EU. Therefore, an older age limit has been placed to allow only participants ≥18 years old.
There are no overall differences in safety or effectiveness observed between geriatric patients 
and younger patients, and other re ported clinical experience has not identified differences in 
responses between the elderly and younger patien ts. However, participants  older than 70 years 
will not be allowed to participate. 
4.3 Justification for Dose
For this drug-device study intervention, the term “dose” refers to the amount of benralizumab
administered via its device to the participant at w eeks 0 (Visit 1), 4 (Visit 2), and 8 (Visit 3) 
respectively. In this study, participants w ill receive a total of three subcutaneously (SC) 
applied doses of 30 mg benralizumab.
The 30 mg Q4W (for the first 3 doses) then Q8W (for subsequent doses) dosing regimen is
currently approved for treatment of severe asthmatics with an eosinophilic phenotype by [CONTACT_476654]. Therefore, based on the duration of this study ie, [ADDRESS_611050] completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of CCI

will implement validated protocols and algorithms to convert the high-resolution CT images into patient specific, segmented, three- dimensional (3D) computer models of the l ung lobes, 
the airway lumen and wall, and the vascular tree. These models will then be used for 
performing measurements of the following struct ural and functional FRI parameters and used 
for further evaluations of functional FRI parameters that utilize computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
The following are the relevant stru ctural and functional FRI parameters:
1. Untrimmed total mucus volume at TLC (Primary)2. Untrimmed total mucus plugs score at TLC (Secondary)3. Untrimmed total air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_476579] (Secondary)

The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach will also be used to model exposure to 
inhaled particles. Specifically, aerosol deposition using CFD simulates the particle flow and particle behavior of within the reconstructed lungs of participants as a function of the specific 
inhalation profile, geometry of the airways and the drug particle size. In this study, aerosol

Central airway will be defined as the trachea and all airways with diameter > 1–2 mm and reaching out to 7–10th generation of dichotomous branching, while the peripheral airways will be defined as airways with a diameter < 1–2 mm and > [ADDRESS_611095] scans at baseline (Visit 1) and follo wing benralizumab treatment (at Visit 4) w ill be

(RLL), left upper lobe (LUL) and left lower l obe (LLL), as well as into central and distal

[IP_ADDRESS] Mucus Plugging
As detailed in the previous section, untrimmed total mucus volume at TLC and untrimmed 
mucus plugs score at TLC are FRI parameters of interest in the study. 
Mucus plugging will be assessed visually through diligent segmentation of the airways. 
Airways will be segmented from central airways to distal airways by [CONTACT_3553] a deep learning Convolutional Neur al Network (CNN) model to the extent which the resolution of the scanner 
allows. After segmentation of the airways, a mucus plug will be identified as such if the plug prematurely blocks or ends the airway segmen tation and presents with an open airway after 
the plug (full occlusion). The above approach to mucus plug assessment allows for multiple, 
sequential mucus plugs from central to distal areas in the airway tree to be detected and
included for analysis. Each bronchopulmonary segment will be given a score that directly represents the number of mucus plugs within that segment. Therefore, mucus plugs will be counted per segmental airway branch, and the total number of mucus plugs will be presented on a segmental, lobar (RUL, RML, RLL, LUL and LLL), and total level, by [CONTACT_476666].CCICCI

Next, w ith the use of data presented from the mucus plugging assessment above, mucus pl ugs 
will also be scored with ascoring system similar to that by [CONTACT_476668]. with the Severe 
Asthma Research Program (SARP) ( Dunican et al., 2018 ), based on bronchopulmo nary 
segmental  anatomy . Each bronchopulmo nary segment will be given a score of 1 (mucus plug 
present) or 0 (mucus plug absent). The segment scores of each lo be will be summed to 
generate a total mucus score for both lungs, yielding a mucus score ranging fro m 0-20. Of 
note i s the means of determining whether a particular segment con tained a m ucus plug will 
differ fro m that described in Dunican et al ., [ADDRESS_611098] ion measurements will be assessed as part of efficacy assessment and at screening

9.4.1 General Considerations
All continuous variables (including FRI parameters, pre-BD FEV 1, pre-BD FVC,  
) will be summarized using means, standard deviations and 95% 
ranges, or medians and inter-quartile ranges, depending on the distributions of the data. Mean changes from baseline in continuous variables will be reported, including asymptotic 95% confidence intervals and standard errors. Categorical data (e.g.,  control 
  asthma control category) will be summarized as the number and percentage 
among patients with non-missing data. Descri ptive statistics will also be calculated for the 
data stratified by [CONTACT_547]. Unless otherwise stated, all hypothesis tests are two-sided and all 
hypothesis tests will be performed at a 5% signif icance level. Analyses will be carried out for CCI

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Objectives
For the primary  objective, a pai red t-test will be used to determine if there is a significant 
difference between the mean of untrimmed total mucus vo lume atTLC at week [ADDRESS_611125] ics.
Secondary analysis o f the primary endpo int(untrimmed total mucus vo lume at TLC) will be a
mixed -effects m odel to incorporate the repeated measurements (corresponding to the different 
lobes) for each subject. The outcome of change from baseline in the primary endpoint at 
week [ADDRESS_611126] imate the average  change fro m 
baselinein mucus vo lumeat week 0 vs week 13 per lobe.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Objective s
For the secondary  object ive 1, univariate paired t-tests and mixed effects modelling will be 
used to assess whether there are statist ically significant differences in the means of secondary  
FRI endpo ints (untrimmed total mucus plugs score at TLC, untrimmed total air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_476625],trimmed distal  iVaww at TLC ,trimmed distal siVaw at TLC and FRC ,and untrimmed 
total iVlung at TLC and FRC )at week [ADDRESS_611127] ics.
Secondary  analysis o f each secondary  endpoint will be a mixed- effects m odel to incorporate 
the repeated measurements (corresponding to the different lobes) for each subject. The model
will estimate the average change fro m baseline in secondary  endpoint at week 0 vs week 13 
per lobe, after accounting for the baseline measurement of the secondary  endpoint per lobe
and heterogeneit y across l obes.
For secondary  objective 2, a scatter plot will be used to display values of imagin gendpo ints 
(primary and secondary FRI parameters ) and convent ional lung funct ion measures (pre -BD 
FEV 1and pre -BD FVC response) at week 0, to get a first indicat ion of the relat ionship 
between endpo ints at baseline. Spearm an’s rank correlation coefficients will describe the 
strength of the associati on between two endpoi nts.Pearson correlation will also be 
used forlinear relationships. Regressio n models will be used to estimate the average increase 
in imaging endpo ints perunit increase in convent ional lung funct ion measures, with 95% 
confiden ce intervals.
For secondary  objective 3, a scatter plot will be used to display changes fro m baseline at

baseline at week 13 in conventional lung function measures (pre-BD FEV 1and pre-BD FVC 
response). Both Spearman’s rank and Pearson c orrelation coefficients will describe the 
strength of the association. If changes from baseline in conventional lung function measures at week 13 are related to baseline values, as indi cated by [CONTACT_476671], correlation 
coefficients will be reported per subgroup defined by [CONTACT_72062].
A linear regression model for imaging endpoints will be fitted, consisting of a binary 
explanatory variable (corresponding to week 13). The regression coefficient for time will 
estimate the change from baseline (week 13 vs week 0) in the imaging endpoint. The model will be fitted with and without the inclusion of the change from baseline in pre-BD FEV
1and 
pre-BD FVC as individual covariates. Est imated regression coefficients for time from the 
unadjusted and adjusted models will be compared, to indicate whether the change from baseline in the imaging parameter is explained by [CONTACT_476672]-BD FEV
1and pre-BD FVC. 
Estimated regression coefficients for changes in pre-BD FEV 1and pre-BD FVC will be 
reported, to quantify the average change in  each imaging endpoint for every one percent

Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
C [ADDRESS_611143] a causal relat ionship with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign ( eg, an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest 
pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product . 
The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence . An AE may occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study intervent ionhas been administered.
C 2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase ( ie,run-in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res in -partici pant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_476630]
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty. 
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may requi re 
medical treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Adverse Events (AEs) for malignant tumors reported during a study  shoul d generally  be 
assessed as Serious AEs. If no other seri ousness criteria apply , the ‘Important Medical Ev ent’ 
criterion shoul d be used. In certain situat ions, however, medical judgement on an individual 
event basis should be applied to clarify that the malignant tumorevent should be assessed and 
reported as a non-serious AE. For exam ple, if the tumoris included as medical history  and 
progression occurs during the study , but the progressio n does not change treatment and/or 
prognosi s of the m alignant tumor, the AE m ay not fulfil the attributes for being assessed as 
serious, al though reporti ng of the progression of the malignant tumoras an AE is valid and 
shoul d occur .Also, some t ypes of malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely  after a 
routi ne treatm ent that does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], may be assessed as non-serious; 
examples in adults include Stage 1 basal cell carcino ma and S tage 1A1 cervical cancer 
removed via cone biopsy .

‘Life-threatening ’ means that the participant was at immediate risk of death fro m the AE as i t 
occurred or it is su spected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
participant ’s death . ‘Life-threatening ’ does not m ean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death ( e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96698] a serious A E, although the reasons 
for it may be ( e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema) . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the participant was enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteriorate in 
an unexpected way  during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Treatment
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], disabilit y or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the participant or may 
requi re medical treatm ent to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of seri ous. 
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_476631] m ean that i t is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatm ent
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
Blood dy scrasias ( eg,neutropenia or anemia requi ring bl ood transfusi on, etc.) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094]
Development of drug depen dency  or drug abuse
Intensity Rating Scale:

intensity need not necessarily be considered serious . For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Appendix C 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in A ppendix C
2.
C 3 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course . Exposure to suspect drug . Has the participant actually received the 
suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
Consistency wit h known drug profile . 
Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of th e sam e 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
De-challenge experience . Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_72918]?
No al ternative cause . The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_476683], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally  recommend or support a 
re-challenge .
Laboratory  tests . A specific laboratory invest igation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Isthere a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related ’ is made if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case . The expression 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal  relati onship is meant to convey , in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.[ADDRESS_611144] a 
causal relat ionship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not rel ated’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibili ty.
C 4 Medication Error , Drug Abuse, and Drug Misuse
Medication error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an IMP that either causes harm  to the parti cipant or has the potenti al 
to cause harm to the participant . 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error :
Occurred
Was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that coul d have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given 
to the parti cipant
Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
Drug not taken as indicated eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IRT/RTS Merrors)
Wrong drug administered to p articipant (excluding IRT/RTS Merrors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IRT/RTS M
-including those which lead to one of 
the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medicat ion error 
Clinical Study Protocol -5.0 [COMPANY_008]
Benralizumab - D3250R00107
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 111of 136Parti cipant acci dentally  missed drug dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion in 
open l abel studi es, even if an [COMPANY_008] product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error .
Drug Abuse
For the purpose of this study , drug abuse is defined as the persistent or sporadic intent ional, 
non-therapeut ic excessive use of IMP for a perceived reward or desired non -therapeutic effect.
Any events of dr ug abuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to 
the Data Entry  Site using the Drug Abuse Report Form . This form should be used both if the 
drug abuse happened in a study  parti cipant or if the drug abuse involves a person not e nrolled 
in the study  (such as a rel ative of the study  parti cipant).
Examples of drug abuse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent of getting a perceived reward (by [CONTACT_355663] a person not enrolled in the study )
The d rug in the form o f a tabl et is crushed and injected or snorted with the intent of 
getting high
Drug Misuse
Drug misuse is the intent ional and inappropriate use (by  a study parti cipant) of IMP for 
medicinal purposes outside of the authori zed product information, or for unauthori zed IMPs, 
outsi de the intended use as specified in the protocol and includes deliberate administration of 
the product by  [CONTACT_244972].
Events of drug misuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to 
the DES using the Drug Misuse Report Form. This form should be used both if the drug 
misuse happened in a study  parti cipant or if the drug misuse regards a person not enrolled in 
the study  (such as a rel ative of the study part icipant).
Examples of drug m isuse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent ion to cause an effect in another person
The drug is so ld to other people for recreational purposes 
The drug is used to facilitate assault in another person

A Medical Device SAE is an any serious adverse event that:
a.Led to death
b.Led to serious deterioration in the healt h of the participant, that either resulted in:
A life-threatening illness or injury. The term “life -threatening” in the definit ion of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of 
the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were m ore severe.

AE, SAE, and Medical Device Deficiency Recording
When an AE/SAE/medical device deficiency occurs, it is the responsibilit y of the invest igator 
to revi ew all  documentati on (e .g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory  reports, and d iagnosti cs 
reports) related to the event.
The invest igator will then record all relevant AE/SAE/medical device deficiency informat ion 
in the part icipant ’s medical  records, in accordance with the invest igator ’s normal clinical 
practi ce and on the appropriat e form .

will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_244877] n to the Sponsor .
The invest igator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical informat ion. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptom s) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
For m edical device deficiencies, it is very  important that the inve stigator describes any 
corrective or remedial act ions taken to prevent recurrence of the deficiency.
A remedial act ion is any action other than routine maintenance or servicing o f a 
medical device where such act ion is necessary  to prevent recurrence of a m edical 
device deficiency. This includes any amendment to the medical device design to 
prevent recurrence.
Assessment of Intensity
The invest igator will make an assessment of intensit y for each AE/SAE/m edical  device 
deficiency reported during the study  and assign it to one of the following categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal disco mfort 
and not interfering with everyday act ivities.
Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes wit h norm al 
everyday act ivities.
Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activi ties. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with an SAE. “Severe” is a category used for rating the 
intensity of an event; both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when i t meets at l east [ADDRESS_611150] igator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE/medical device deficiency.
A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conv eys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship, cannot be ruled out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the relat ionship.

screen failure was due to a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis (see Secti on 5.4 ).
Parti cipants may  also reschedule Visit 1due to a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h 
crisis perSecti on 5. 5.Any changes to the allowances forrescreening and rescheduling of 
visitsdue to a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis beyond the current protocol
may only beconsidered at the Sponsor ’sdiscretion and Invest igators will be informed 
accordingly.
Changes described in F 1 to F 5below mayonly be implemented at the Sponsor ’s 
discreti onduring study  disrupti ons due to any  of or a combinat ion of civil crisis, natural 
disaster, or public health crisis (e.g., during quarantines and resul ting si te closures, regi onal 
travel  restri ctions and considerat ions if site personnel or study participants beco me 
infected/quarant ined due to SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_611155] ion) during 
which participants may not wish to or may be unable to visit the study site for study 
visits.These changes should only  be implemented if allowable by  [CONTACT_5737]/regional guidelines 
and fo llowing notificat ion from the Sponsor and instructions on how to perform these 
procedure s will be provi ded at the time of implementation.

guidance.
F 1 Consent/Reconsent of Study Participants During Study 
Interruptions
During study  interrupti ons, i t may not be possible for the participants to complete study  visits
and assessments on si te and al ternat ive means for carrying out the visit s and assessments may  
benecessary , e.g., telemedicine visits. Consent/reconsent should be obtained for the 
alternat ive means of carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to 
performing the procedures described in Sect ions F 2 to F 5 . Local and regional regulat ions 
and/or guidelines regarding consent/reconsent of study  parti cipants shoul d be checked and 
followed. Reconsent may  beverbal if allowed by [CONTACT_476687] (note, in the

be avo ided.
F [ADDRESS_611156] On -site Visit (where applicable)
In thi s appendix and the associated Study  Instructions for Mi tigation Due to Civil Crisis, 
Natural Disaster, or Public Healt h Crisis for Benralizumab, the term telemedicine visit refers 
to rem otecontact [CONTACT_476689] g telecommunicat ions techno logy including virtual
or video visi ts.
During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public health crisis, on -site visi ts may  be replaced by  
[CONTACT_476690]/regional guidelines. Having a telemedicine conta ct 
with theparticipants will allow adverse events, conco mitant m edicat ion, any worsening o f 
underlying asthma symptoms/asthma exacerbat ions since last contact [CONTACT_476691]. If applicable, safet y procedures will be per formed according to 
the revised SoA  inthe Study  Instructions for Mi tigation Due to Civil Crisis, Natural Disaster, 
or Public Healt hCrisis for Benralizumab.
On-site visits that ma y be replaced by a T elemedicine V isit only apply  for Visit 2 and Visit 3
of this study .
F 3 At-home or Remote Location IP Administration Instructions
During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public health crisis, i fa site visi t is not possible, at -
home administration o f IP may be performed by [CONTACT_148703]/her caregiver . The 
option of  at-home IP administration ensures participants' safety  in cases of a pandemic where 
participants m ay be at increased risk by [CONTACT_122652]/clinic. This will also minimize 
interrupti on of  IP administrati on during other study disrupt ions, e.g., site closures due to 
natural  disaster .
At-home IP administration may be conducted for Visit 2 and Visit 
3of this study via a 
Telemedicine Visit .
At-home or Remote Location IP Administration by [CONTACT_476692]/Her Caregiver
Prior to at -home or rem ote locati on IP  administration the Invest igator must assess the 
participant or his/her caregiver to determine whether they  are appropri ate for at -home or 
remote locati onadministrati on of  IP. Once the participant or his/her caregiver is deemed 
appro priate for at -home or rem ote locati on administration, he/she must receive appropriate 
training. All necessary supplies and instructions for administration and documentation of IP 
administration will be provi ded. More inform ation related to the visit can be obtained via a 
telemedicine visit. All process for a t-home or remote location IP administration will be 
witnessed by  [CONTACT_24342]/authorized delegate virtually during a telemedicine visit.

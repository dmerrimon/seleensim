AMENDMENT HISTORY  
November 3, 2016:  Final version of SAP.  Version 1.0  
May 16, 2018:          Vorapaccess SAP revised. Version 2.0  
Added a new secondary outcome  
Added a sentence on the deviation from the planned analysis due to low 
enrollment and early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_705670].  
June 11, 2018:          Updated the definition of the secondary outcome “ ‘AV fistula functional or  
anatomic maturation at 180 days as determined by [CONTACT_978] ” 
  
June  11, [ADDRESS_959013] patients, 
hemodialysis rarely restores health.  Roughly one in five patients on dialysis die each year; 
patients who survive experience poor functional status, impaired physical and cognitive 
function and severely impaired health -relat ed quality of life.  Moreover, the cost of the 
ESRD program exceeds $40B in the US annually (1).  
 
Hemodialysis vascular access is often referred to as the ”Achilles Heel” of dialysis care.  The 
Brescia -Cimino (radiocephalic end -to-side) fistula is consider ed to be the gold standard 
vascular access (2); upper arm arteriovenous fistulae are often created instead.  
Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are next best, but are frequently complicated by 
[CONTACT_167302] “thrombosis,” commonly caused not by [CONTACT_705676], but rather by 
[CONTACT_705677].  Unfortunately, the majority of patients 
have insufficient time to undergo pre -emptive creation of an arteriovenous fistula or graft, 
and most patients start hemodialysis with either a temporary or “semi -permanent” 
tunneled catheter, often placed in one of the internal jugular veins.  
 
For patients who do undergo fistula creation, either in advance of (optimally) or after 
starting hemodialysis, a sizeable fraction of arteriovenous fistula e never matures 
sufficiently to be usable for hemodialysis.  It is common for patients to undergo three or 
more attempts at fistula creation, extending the time during which they experience a 
heightened risk of infection and venous stenosis/thrombosis of t he internal jugular veins 
or in some cases other complications including superior vena cava syndrome.  Therapeutic 
agents that could facilitate maturation of arteriovenous fistulae could vastly improve the 
health and well -being of patients on hemodialysis,  and could well result in enhanced 
survival.  
 
1.2. Objectives  
1. To determine if vorapaxar safely improves arteriovenous (AV) fistula functional 
maturation when administered during the maturation process compared with 
placebo.  
2. To determine if vorapaxar safely  improves AV fistula patency, allowing for 
secondary procedures to aid in fistula maturation compared with placebo.  
3. To determine if vorapaxar safely facilitates successful cannulation of AV fistulas for 
hemodialysis compared with placebo.  
4. To determine the safety profile of vorapaxar for patients requiring hemodialysis.  
June  11, 201 8.  Version 3.0

1.3. Hypotheses  
1.  Vorapaxar initiated two days following AV fistula creation will result in improved 
fistula functional maturation without increased risk of bleeding or other major 
adverse  events.  
 
2.  Vorapaxar initiated two days following AV fistula creation will result in improved 
fistula patency and will increase the utility of secondary procedures to aid in fistula 
maturation, without increased risk of bleeding or other major adverse e vents.  
 
3.  Vorapaxar initiated two days following AV fistula creation will facilitate successful 
cannulation of AV fistulas for hemodialysis without increased risk of bleeding or 
other major adverse events.  
 
2. Study Design  
 
2.1. Study Design   
This is a r andomized placebo -controlled double -blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  Half of enrolled patients 
will receive the study drug (vorapaxar [Zontivity™] 2.5 mg daily) and half will receive a 
look -alike placebo.  
 
Patients will be assigned to treatment groups with a 1:1 random ization in blocks of 4 at the 
conclusion of the AV fistula creation.  Patients will be stratified based on fistula location  
(lower arm versus upper arm). Randomization will be performed after successful creation 
of an arteriovenous fistula, on the day of s urgery.  We expect to randomize  50 patients.  
 
The study drug (12 -week supply of study drug or placebo) will be dispensed to enrolled 
patients on the day of surgery. Participants will be instructed to start taking their study 
medications on Day -two post -surgery.  
 
2.2. Study Participants  
Patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria at Stanford University Medical Center or 
Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (SCVMC)  will be eligible to participate in the study.  Study 
procedures will be conducted at Stanford University Medical Center and SCVMC. All 
standard -of-care (SOC) procedures will be conducted at the respective sites. However, the 
final [ADDRESS_959014] or SCVMC.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Age > =[ADDRESS_959015] thrombin and other 
inhibitors  
5.   Indication or ongoing therapy with strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A  
 
Study participants will be followed up at approximately 6 weeks, 3 months, 4 months and 6 
months after randomization. At each of these visits, data will be collected on the following 
measures:  
 Patency of fistula (yes/no)  
 Fistul a being used for dialysis at least 6 times in 3 weeks (yes/no)  
 Adverse events  
 Additional procedures performed to aid in fistula maturation (yes/no)  
o Type of procedure  
o Successful (yes/no)  
 BARC and G USTO  Bleeding Classification  
 
In addition, at the 6 week and  6 month follow up visits, data will be collected on:  
 Diameter of fistula by [CONTACT_2207]  
 Velocit y of fistula by [CONTACT_2207]  
 
 
2.3. Study Endpoints  
The primary efficacy outcome is time to AV fistula functional maturation (defined as 
successful cannulation of the AV fistula for six hemodialysis sessions within three weeks).  
 
The secondary efficacy outcomes are:  
 AV fistula use within 180 days of surgery  
 AV fistula patency at [ADDRESS_959016] 50% increase in vein diameter by 
[CONTACT_705678]  
 Update: New secondary outcome added: AV fistula functional or anatomic 
maturation at 180 days as determined by [CONTACT_978]  
 
[INVESTIGATOR_705671].   
BARC Bleeding Cl assification  
 Type 0: No bleeding  
 
June  11, 201 8.  Version 3.0 
 8  Type 1: Bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek 
unscheduled performance of studies, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or treatment by a healthcare 
professional; may include epi[INVESTIGATOR_15664] -discontinu ation of medical 
therapy by [CONTACT_15743] a healthcare professional  
 
 Type 2: Any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage (e.g., more bleeding than would be 
expected for a clinical circumstance, including bleeding found by [CONTACT_3868]) that 
does not fit the criteria for type 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_959017] one of the following 
criteria: (1) requiring nonsurgical, medical intervention by a healthcare 
professional, (2) leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3820], or (3) 
prompting ev aluation  
 
 Type 3  
o Type 3a: Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to 5 g/dL* (provided 
hemoglobin drop is related to bleed) Any transfusion with overt bleeding  
 
o Type 3b: Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop >5 g/dL* (provided hemoglobin 
drop is related to bleed); Cardiac tamponade; Bleeding requiring surgical 
intervention for control (excluding dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid); Bleeding 
requiring intravenous vasoactive agents  
 
o Type 3c: Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include micro -bleeds or 
hemorrhagic trans formation, does include intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]); Subcategories confirmed 
by [CONTACT_15745]; Intraocular bleed compromising 
vision  
 
 Type 4  CABG bleeding  
 Type 5: Fatal bleeding  
 
 
GUSTO Bleeding Classification  
 Severe: Bleeding* that was fatal, in tracranial, or that caused hemodynamic 
compromise requiring intervention (e.g., systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg that 
required blood or fluid replacement, or vasopressor/inotropic support,** or surgical 
intervention).  
 
 Moderate: Bleeding* requiring transf usion of whole blood or packed red blood cells 
without hemodynamic compromise (as defined above).  
 
 Mild: Bleeding*:  Bleeding without blood transfusion or hemodynamic compromise.  
 
*In all cases, bleeding must be clinically overt.  
**Need for vasopressor/inotropic support for hemodynamic compromise, even if blood 
pressure  
 
June  11, [ADDRESS_959018] completed follow -up we will 
review the data for completeness and value checks. Thereafter, we will conduc t two 
additional data quality checks: after an additional [ADDRESS_959019] that a small proportion of 
subjects randomized  for the study ( 1-2 subjects ) will not complete all visits.  We will fully 
describe missing data for each variable and any pertinent patterns of missingness (e.g. how 
missingness is related to specific baseline measurements or time, if at all).  The statistical 
methods we will use  are particularly flexible for missing data and allow for systematic 
missingness that is related to observed features.  
 
3.3. Descriptive Statis tics 
We will provide d escriptive statistics such as means, medians, standard deviations and 
interquartile ranges for continuous measurements, and frequency statistics for categorical 
characteristics.  We will use g raphical tools such as histograms and boxp lots to assess 
distributional aspects of continuous variables.   
 
 
3.4. Statistical Analysis : 
 
We will derive c umulative incidence plots to depi[INVESTIGATOR_705672], stratified by 
[CONTACT_705679].   
 
The primary outcome is time to AV fistula maturation, defined as successful cannulation of 
the AV fistula for six hemodialysis sessions within three weeks.   
 
Subjects who are lost to follow up or who die prior to maturation will be censored at the 
time of  death or last recorded activity.  
 
Our primary analysis will be based on the intention -to-treat principle.  To that end, patients 
will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment assignment, and all patients 
randomized to treatment assignment will be included in the analysis even if they are lost to 
follow up or die before the end of their observation period.  We will use a log -rank test 
stratified by [CONTACT_705680] (vorapaxar versus placebo).  The test will be two -sided and 
conducted at the 0.[ADDRESS_959020] (if required) will be employed secondarily to estimate an adjusted treatment effect.  
 
Other secondary analyses involve the use of logistic regression techniques to evaluate the 
effect of treatment on secondary endpoints – use of AV fistula within 180 days , AV fistula 
patency within 150 -180 days  and AV fistula functional or anatomic maturation at 180 days 
as determined by [CONTACT_978] . We will also compare rates of bleeding by [CONTACT_511490] t -
tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate.  
 
 
UPDATED: Based on low enrollment and early termination of the study, the planned 
analysis as described above will not be conducted.  Instead, we will conduct a 
descriptive analysis only.  
 
UPDATED: The secondary outcome ‘ ‘AV fistula functional or anatomic maturation at 
180 days as determined by [CONTACT_978] ” will be defined using clinically adjudicated after a 
review of the medical record.  
  
Power/Sample Size  
 
We have sufficient power to address our primary aim.  Based upon a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_959021] approximately 70% power to detect a 
hazard ratio of 2.05 between treatment arms, assuming that only 50% of subjects will 
experience maturation by [CONTACT_705681].  If only 40% 
of subjects experience maturation by  [CONTACT_705682] 70% 
power to detect a hazard ratio of 2.15.  
 
4. Statistical conventions  
 
This section details general conventions to be used for the statistical analyses and 
presentation of the data. Departures from these gener al conventions may be given in the 
specific detailed sections of this analysis plan.  
 
1. SAS Version [ADDRESS_959022] deviation, median 
(25th percentile, 75th percentile), minimum and maximum values. Categorical variables 
will be presented as number of subjects and percentage of number of subjects by [CONTACT_705683].  
3. The number and percentage of responses will be presented in  the form XX (XX) 
where the percentage is in the parentheses.  Unless otherwise specified, the 
denominator for percentages will be the number of subjects in a given treatment group 
within the analysis population of interest. The denominator will be include d when it 
differs from the standard analysis population.  
June  11, 201 8.  Version 3.0 
 11 4. All summary tables will include the analysis population sample size (i.e., number of 
subjects).  
5. Change from baseline will be calculated for each period as follows:  
            Change from baseline =  Post -baseline value  baseline value.             
6. Date variables will be formatted as DD -MON -YYYY for presentation.  In the case of 
missing day, month, and/or year information, “NA” will be presented.  For example, a 
date with a missing month and day will  be presented as NANAYYYY.  
7. Unless otherwise stated, statistical comparisons will be performed using two -sided 
significance tests. An alpha level of 0.05 will determine significance unless otherwise 
noted for a specified analysis.  
8. When count data are presen ted, the percentage will be suppressed when the count 
is zero in order to draw attention to the non -zero counts.   
9. Unless specified otherwise, data will be presented by [CONTACT_705684] . 
 
 
5. Adverse event s data and reporting process  
 
Adverse  events data will be collected at each follow up visit as described above in the 
section on Study Participants.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_705673], and AEs will be reported to the sponsor and 
the IRB per research guidelines. Participation for th e individual will terminate if he/she has  
a serious adverse reaction that prevents future participation. In the event of adverse 
effects, the patient’s  primary physician will be notified .

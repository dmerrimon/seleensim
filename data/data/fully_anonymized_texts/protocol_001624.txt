Study Protocol and Sta.s.cal Analysis Plan  Oﬃcial Title: Novel Management of Airway Protec5on in Parkinson's disease: A clinical trial  NCT number: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Document Date: (Grant submission – February 2016)  Study Protocol This prospec5ve experimental study will include two par5cipant groups; one group will receive EMST and the other smTAP. Brieﬂy, once enrolled in the study, par5cipants will undergo baseline tes5ng consis5ng of airway protec5ve measures, physiological measures of respi[INVESTIGATOR_789498]5on, and pa5ent-centered outcome measures. Par5cipants will then be randomly assigned with alloca5on concealment to either the EMST or smTAP training groups. They will be further randomized to receive immediate training or delayed training where there is a 5-week wait to start with a second baseline performed at the end of the 5-week delay. Whether par5cipants are in the immediate or delayed start groups, once treatment commences they will receive [ADDRESS_1087513]-treatment assessment consis5ng of all tests and measures from the ini5al baseline assessment. All treatment and assessment visits will be completed ‘on’ op5mal PD medica5on dosage which will be deﬁned as one hour a]er medica5on administra5on. Par5cipants may use diet and/or postural modiﬁca5ons as recommended by [CONTACT_789502]5ng Speech-Language Pathologist to maintain nutri5onal status and swallowing safety during enrollment in the study, but are not to par5cipate in other dysphagia exercise-based rehabilita5on including treatments such as the eﬀoraul swallow, mendelsohn maneuver, etc. that have been shown to have exercise training eﬀects (e.g., [10]). Pre- and post-treatment procedures are described below. More speciﬁc informa5on about the selected outcomes is included in the ‘clinical protocol synopsis’. Pre and Post Treatment Assessments  Swallowing Assessment Procedures. Three 10 cc thin liquid boluses by [CONTACT_789503] 3-oz thin liquid sequen5al swallow challenges will be administered by [CONTACT_789504]. Our research team has extensive experience in the evalua5on and measurement of swallowing dysfunc5on in PD (e.g., [20, 30, 31]).  A recent retrospec5ve analysis by [CONTACT_789505] [ADDRESS_1087514] change in swallowing performance. We will also include a smaller bolus (10 cc.) in the case that swallowing performance is so severe that it precludes the ethical presenta5on of the 3-oz liquid challenge.   Reﬂex Cough Assessment Procedures. Par5cipants will be ouaiged with a facemask covering the nose and mouth. The facemask will be coupled to a pneumotachograph, diﬀeren5al pressure transducer, and have a side port with a one-way inspi[INVESTIGATOR_789499]5on. The nebulizer will be a DeVilbuss T-pi[INVESTIGATOR_82424] a dosimeter that delivers aerosolized solu5on during inspi[INVESTIGATOR_20116]5on with a delivery dura5on of two seconds. The cough airﬂow signal will be digi5zed (Power Lab Data Acquisi5on System) and recorded (LabChart 7; ADInstruments, Inc) to a laptop computer.   
Par5cipants will be seated for an ini5al 30 seconds of quiet breathing in order to acclimate to the facemask. Par5cipants will then complete a capsaicin challenge with three randomized blocks of 0, 50, 100, 200, and 500 μM capsaicin dissolved in a vehicle solu5on. Our preliminary data iden5ﬁed 500 μM as a supra-threshold concentra5on for elici5ng the reﬂex cough in par5cipants with PD. Par5cipants will be given the instruc5on “cough if you need to” prior to capsaicin delivery. The solu5on will be administered automa5cally upon detec5on of an inspi[INVESTIGATOR_789500] a minimum of one minute between each trial. Par5cipants will be provided water to drink between trials. Our research group has extensive experience u5lizing this methodology to induce cough (e.g., [8, 22, 32, 33]).  Our group holds an FDA IND # [ZIP_CODE] for the use of capsaicin in the study of cough reﬂex sensi5vity and motor pagern.   Treatment protocols:   Every eﬀort was made to match the two targeted treatments on amount of 5me with clinicians, home prac5ce 5me, and number of repe55ons.   Expi[INVESTIGATOR_789501] (EMST) EMST involves a calibrated device consis5ng of a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_111285] a one-way spring-loaded valve. The valve blocks airﬂow un5l a suﬃcient "threshold" pressure is produced to overcome the force. The pressure range is from [ADDRESS_1087515] the device set to 75% of his/her MEP , and then complete EMST ﬁve days per week for ﬁve weeks. During that 5me period they will be seen for weekly study-treatment visits in our clinical-research laboratory which will last approximately 45 minutes.    Weekly study-treatment visits:  During weekly visits, a study clinician will re-measure MEP , re-set the EMST device as appropriate (75% MEP), and observe the par5cipant complete the targeted 25 repe55ons. MEPs are completed by [CONTACT_789506]5cipants blow into a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_82424] a pressure manometer via tubing with a 14-guage needle air-leak. The par5cipant blows into the manometer for two seconds.   Home pracGce:  The daily training sessions will be completed at home, with the assistance of the par5cipant’s primary caregiver if necessary. Each day approximately 20-[ADDRESS_1087516] ProtecGon (smTAP)  Par5cipants will complete 45 minutes of cough rehabilita5on in the laboratory with a trained research clinician once a week for ﬁve weeks. During the weekly visits, par5cipants will complete 25 ‘hard/long coughs’ at sub-threshold levels of capsaicin.  Level of capsaicin will be determined from baseline (pre-test) measures. Par5cipants will train at the concentra5on just preceding their reﬂex cough threshold (C2). Agen5onal focus to the sub-threshold s5mulus will be emphasized. Visual feedback will be provided in real 5me via LabChart 7 (ADInstruments, Inc) and will be displayed on a large 20 inch desktop computer monitor. A visual target line 25% above maximum PEFR (derived from baseline cough assessment; ﬁgure 5) will be provided during cough training in order to promote enhanced PEFR. PEFR was selected as a primary target given that it has been iden5ﬁed as a measure which can be modiﬁed through cueing of reﬂex cough [22], is related to swallowing outcomes [34, 35], can be visually targeted by [INVESTIGATOR_57967]5cipants, and is associated with increased cough eﬀec5veness. The par5cipants will only be provided with feedback regarding 
their performance on the ﬁrst ﬁve coughs trained within each session in order to reduce the inﬂuence of clinician bias on treatment outcomes.   Home pracGce: The daily training sessions will be completed at home, with the assistance of the par5cipant’s primary caregiver if necessary. Each day approximately 20-30 minutes will be spent training.  Home prac5ce will be completed 5 out of 7 days. Par5cipants will complete 25 voluntary coughs (5 sets of 5 repe55ons) using a peak ﬂow meter [36].  Each week the target peak cough ﬂow will be 25% above maximum PEFR as iden5ﬁed during the study treatment visits to the laboratory.    Sta.s.cal Analyses Mul5level models with main eﬀects of treatment, 5me, and their two-way interac5on will be used. A randomeﬀect of par5cipant will be used to include mul5ple trials (eg, three trials of MEP at each 5me point). In the presence of an interac5on, diﬀerences in the magnitude of change between groups, as well as changes within each group, will be examined. For primary outcomes, separate models will be performed for delayed to pre-training and pre-training to post-training cohorts. More speciﬁcally, for par5cipants randomized to the delayed treatment group, MEP and voluntary cough PEFR will be tested between delayed (ﬁrst baseline) and pre-training (second baseline). For the ac5ve treatment phase, all outcomes will be tested between pre-training (which was the second baseline for those in the delayed treatment group) and post-training. α will be set at 0.05, and mul5ple pairwise comparisons were adjusted via Holm–Bonferroni correc5ons. Standardized eﬀect sizes will be computed by [CONTACT_789507]ﬀerence by [CONTACT_789508] eﬀect variance. Single measure, absolute agreement intraclass correla5on coeﬃcients and weighted Cohen’s kappa will be used for cough airﬂow and number of coughs, respec5vely, for reliability. Analyses will be performed in R.

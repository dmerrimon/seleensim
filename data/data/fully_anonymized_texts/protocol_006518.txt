Synopsis  
Primary Objective  
The primary objective  of this study  is to validate  the utility  (sensitivity , specificity  and 
accuracy ) of a  quantitative non -biased  olfactory  device for  the rapid  identification of SARS -
CoV-2 infected subjects.  
Secondary Objectives :  
The seconda ry objective is to test if SARS -CoV-2 positive ‘asymptomatic ’ COVID -[ADDRESS_469048] in smell  (hyposmia ), which is revealed 
through our quantitative  olfactory  smell test.  
 
Study Duration :  
The expected  duration of this study is 3 to 6 weeks . 
Study Design :  
This is a  non-therapeutic correlative  trial.  Loss of smell in test subjects will be c ompared 
to the presence of  SARS -CoV-2 corona virus , as determined by [CONTACT_937]-PCR .  
Study Population :  
This study is oriented towards the  average  US adult population  and is limited to  anyone 
over 18 years old  and exclud es pregnant women .  The study will focus on two cohorts: 
‘drive -thru’ outpatients and people  at high -risk of being infected with coronavirus 
(healthcare workers  that work in a  nursing home or  at the  Yale Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53756] -19 ICU). 
Protocol Number  
 Version Date  and Version #  
 
4 Number of Participants :  ~100 SARS -CoV-2 positive outpatient  subjects and ~250 total 
asymptomatic Health Care Workers .  An equal  or greater  age and gender matching group 
of  SARS -CoV-2 negative subjects will be included as a comparison group.  
Number of Study Sites  
The proposed study sites  would be:  
Outpatients:  
• Drive Up Coronavirus PCR testing  
o Greenwich Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  , Greenwich, CT  
o Central Louisiana Department of Public Health  
Asymptomatics : 
• Waveny LifeCare   Nursing Home in New Canaan , CT  
o Point Pleasant Nursing Home, Bradeton, [LOCATION_012]  
o Westminster Winter Park/Baldwin Park Nursing Home  
 
Primary Outcome Variables  
The subject’s score on using the olfactory device will be compared to the PCR results 
(SARS-CoV-2 negative or positive)  on COVID19 outpatients .  As the smell test has a 
variable scale (0 -5) the ideal cutoff will be determined to maximize these factors:  
• Sensitivity  
• Specificity  
• Accuracy  
The score with the olfactory device will also be compared to subjects ’ response  to the 
question  “Do you  have a new loss of smell  or taste?”  (current standard) .  Repeatability will 
also be examined in a test-retest score  conducted within 24 hours with a second device in 
which the sequence  of the odorants is altered . 
 
Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables (if applicable)  
We will determine if ‘asymptomatic ’ SARS -CoV-2 positive subjects  experience  a partial  
loss of smell  (hyposmia) and if so determine the fraction of subjects in  which this occurs.  
Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy will be measured.

1 Introduction  
1.1 Introductory Statement  
 
This document is a protocol to evaluate in a non-therapeutic correlative  human research 
study  the performance of a non-invasive  olfactory  device as an indicator of loss of smell , and 
an initial indicator of COVID -19 positive subjects . The purpose of this protocol is to ensure 
that this study is to be conducted according to ICH GCP guidelines , CFR 21 Part 812, 
applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
  
Protocol Number  
 Version Date  and Version #  
 
[ADDRESS_469053] anosmia (loss of smell) is the use of ‘scratch -n-sniff’™ type of  
scent cards , as in the long establish University of Pennsy lvania SIT (UPSIT) olfactory test 
(Doty et al, Laryngoscope, 1984, 94, 176 -8) .  Here microencapsulated non -toxic scents are 
scratched by [CONTACT_374660] , sniffed and in a discriminatory forced -choice manner the 
subject chooses the best matching  scent  choice as part  of a multiple choice exam. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_374648] a long format taking [ADDRESS_469054] is recognized by [CONTACT_374661] d of use of neurological diseases (e.g. Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s 
Disease).   However, the UPSIT test is long, expensive and non -variable, neither of which 
makes it suitable for widescale or repeated testing.  [CONTACT_374675]  designed and had 
manufactured a new design of olfactory test card ( u-Smell -it™) that could be deployed 
widescale. These ‘scratch and sniff’ ™ type devices are deemed saf e by [CONTACT_374662] -invasive and use  non-toxic fragrance .  The device card proposed here uses the 
same fragrance and microencapsulation process as used in the NIH Toolbox® tests for loss 
of smell.  Further  the fragrances used in the u-Smell -it™ test kit are compliant with IFRA and 
its components do not contain oils derived from nuts, wheat or g lutens and do  not us e any 
phthalates or their derivatives.  These formulations are in widespread  use in children’s books 
and cards for over 40 years , as well as other consumer markets.  Further, the  FDA has 
approved of use of a ‘scratch -n-sniff’™ for anosmia . As described below there is now strong 
mounting evidence for the association of anosmia and COVID -19, albeit largely through 
patient surveys  (see Background 2.2 ). 
 
2.1.2 Device Clinical Experience  
A similar style ‘scratch and sniff’ assay  that use 40 odorants  (as a [ADDRESS_469055] booklet)  was 
recently shown in a study in Iran to identify smell dysfunction in COVID -19 positive inpatient s 
(Moein et al, Int Forum Allergy Rhinol, 2020;  PMID: 32301284) . Our quick 4-[ADDRESS_469056] 
odorant ‘u-Smell -it’ device uses similar microencapsulated scents that are  manufactured in 
an identical process  on a single card . It is optimized for speed , cost , and maximizing signal -
to-noise in the analysis, and ease of use .  The device is very quick to use, taking <[ADDRESS_469057] has four  to five  odor options a nd a “no scent” option that 
serve s to optimize the signal/noise of the assay in a small fast format, as both points are  
essential for widespread testing.  Thus , there is evidence that quantitative testing has value 
and the Moein study and numerous reports suggest that acute loss of smell (hyposmia) 
cannot be reliably self -reported and instead needs a quantitative blinded test, as proposed 
here.   
 
2.2 Background/prevalence of research topic  
There  is an urgent  need  for rapid  testing  on a massive  scale  (millions  of COVID -19 
tests/week)  and longitudinal  testing  of high risk people  (e.g.  HCWs)  to identify 
Protocol Number  
 Version Date  and Version #  
 
[ADDRESS_469058], but it is 
estimated that up to 50 -times  more tests per week will be needed than is currently 
achieved. The key hypothesis  underlying this clinical trial is that loss of smell 
(anosmia) may  analogous  to a ‘canary -in-a-coalmin e’ and serve as an indicator of 
being infected with the COVID -19 coronavirus.  
In support of this hypothesis emerging evidence  has come  from  a number  of 
different countries and includes the following studies  (only some are fully peer 
reviewed) : 
• Anecdotal evidence suggests loss of smell (and taste) in COVID -19+ patients  and 
may be an early onset factor  (1)  
• A paper from 12 European hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64572] 6 countries showed that 85% of COVID -19+ 
people reported loss of smell (anosmia) ; this paper was based on patient surveys 
and self -reports of smell loss.  (2) 
• In an European  self-report survey of COVID -19 positive patients 70% 
reported anosmia  and 45% reported fever.  Thus anosmia is a better single 
indicator than fever for COVID -19. (3) 
• In contrast, in a Korean a self -report survey of 3,191  COVID -19 positive 
patients only 15% reported anosmia, with a mean recovery of 7 days  (4). 
• A US study showed that smell loss was 10x more likely to be from COVID -19 than 
other causes ; this was based on patient surveys and self -reports of smell loss.  (5, 6)   
• A study in Iran using  olfactory testing showed that 58% of COVID -19+ 
inpatient had anosmia/severe microsmia and 27% had moderate microsmia. 
98% of COVID -19+ inpatient s had some type of olfactory dysfunction  (7). 
• A paper showed that loss -of-smell was a good indicator of being positive for 
COVID -19 if one eliminate s loss of smell associated with a stuffy or runny 
nose. Unlike other viruses such as influenz a and the common coronavirus  
that also present with loss of smell  (8), COVID -19+ patients have loss of 
smell with no sinus  blockage .   This supports that loss of smell in COVID -19 
patient is a different mechanism that  in other viral diseases and may be a 
good diagnostic indicator . 
• SARS -CoV-2 entry factors  (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) are highly expressed in nasal 
cavity and localize to multiciliated cells.  
• New loss of taste  or smell  was recently recognized  by [CONTACT_6750]  (but not yet 
WHO) to be a symptom associated with  COVID -19.  
• Olfactory Dysfunction (OD) is present in ~ 20-86%  of COVID -19 patients and 
is frequently an early symptom. (Speth, Thirza et al, In Press)  
• Most studies of an association of COVID -19 and anosmia were retrospective  
and few addressed smell reduction (hyposmia ) and mainly considered 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] , which can have selection bias  (9). 
In summary, although there is strong support of an association of loss of smell with 
COVID -19, the degree to which this occurs is variable and may in a large part reflect 
that nearly all of the studies we re retrospective patient surveys, without any direct

predict may be detected with our  device.  Further an open important question is do 
asymptomatic COVID -19+ (PCR) people actually have a mild symptom of olfactory 
loss that could be detected ?  If so they could self -isolate and avoid virus 
transmission to others  and potentially receive earlier treatment with anti -viral drugs .

3 Rationale/Significance  
3.[ADDRESS_469060] reports are potentially biased, 
not well controlled , and based on surveys .  Here we seek to validate this olfactory device 
and robustly  determine  its usefulness in t erms of sensitivity , specificity , accuracy and 
repeatability .  Of particular relevance to its sensitivity we seek to identify if COVID -19+ 
asymptomatic individuals in fact have a mild defect in smell, that can only be identified in a 
sensitive and objective test, as proposed here.  
3.2 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact  
Protocol Number  
 Version Date  and Version #  
 
[ADDRESS_469061] (or even perhaps nearly all) COVID -19+ individuals have a transitory (~7 
day) early loss of smell . If this is true and could be robustly  and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_374649] a device  
that could be deployed at large scale repeatedly then this could be ultimately used for a 
massive pre -testing for COVID -19.  If this holds true then this olfactory device could  
outperform PCR tests  in the following areas:  
Area  PCR  ‘u-Smell -it’ Device  
Cost per test  ~$35 (with labor)  <$[ADDRESS_469062]  10 min to 5 days  <1 min  
Danger to HCW  Considerable for Nasal 
Swabs (less for saliva)  None; self -performed

False Negative Rate  ~15-30% TBD here  
False Positive Rate  <5% TBD here  
 
If the device performs well it ultimately would be broadly deployed as a n initial indicator test 
to identify people likely infected with SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_469063] been used clinical extensively .  Firstly , these ‘scratch -n-sniff’™ style 
scent cards us e the same  odorants have been heavily used in FDA approved studies of 
anosmia and are part of the NIH toolkit © and meet f ragrance safety compliance . A very 
minor risk of a  potential adverse reaction to scents may exist for asthmatics and people with 
scent allergic and thus these people will be excluded . Their condition will be identified by 
[CONTACT_18654] -report.  This study will not prescribe any action  to the participant  so there is no 
risk of interpretation .   
The only other risk is that the test subject if COVID+ could contaminate the answer form with 
live virus, and this should be treated as a biohazard. To avoid th is risk the consent and 
answer form will be photographed while the subject is in the car through the closed window 
(they will merely hold it up)  but not showing the full face of the subject so as to hide their 
identity . Only information needed to interpret the results of the study will be transmi tted. 
Using these digital/electronic consent measures eliminates potential contamination of HCW

4.2 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to valida te the utility (sensitivity, specificity and 
accuracy) of a quantitative non -biased olfactory device for the rapid identification of SARS -
CoV-2 infected subjects  (as identified by [CONTACT_954]). The performance of the device will also be 
compared to the standard CD C patient query  for ‘new loss of smell or taste ’. 
 
 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objective is to test if SARS -CoV-2 positive ‘asymptomatic’ COVID -[ADDRESS_469069] in smell (hyposmia), which is 
reveale d through our quantitative olfactory smell test.

[ADDRESS_469070] Senator Kasser  whom represents 
Fairfield County  (Greenwich & North Stamford)  Greenwich Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (a Yal e New Haven 
Health System affiliate)  was identified  as a good site for the drive through outpatient testing . 
Yale N ew Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374650]. T he Nursing home  
of Waven y Life Care  in New Canaan  as an appropriate site for asymptomatic subjects, for 
they have done widescale PCR screening and they have at least 30 asymptomatic COVID+ 
people and staff .  The President and CEO  of Waven y (Russell R. Barksdale, Jr., 
MPA/MHA, FACHE)  is eager to begin as soon as possible and will complete PCR tests of all 
subjects and provide nurses to assist with administration of the test.  They also have ~[ADDRESS_469071] that the initial testing will be done in  < 2 weeks (depending on 
the local incid ence rate), with all completed studies taking as little as 3 weeks , with a 
maximum estima ted duration of ~[ADDRESS_469072] immediately  
after approval from Yale’s  IRB.   
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_469073]-up testing would be Greenwich Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , Yale-New 
Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374651] . The asymptomatic 
study would occur at the [LOCATION_012] based nursing homes and Waven y Life Care nursing home 
in New Canaan  (the President and CEO of this center , Russell R. Barksdale ,  strongly 
supports t his study and will provide corresponding PCR testing and support staff) . These are 
the principle sites, outside sites would be considered as long as any testing would be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_374663].  
 
5.[ADDRESS_469074]’s score on using the olfactory device will be compared to the PCR results 
(SARS-CoV-2 negative or positive) on COVID19 outpatients .  As the ‘u-Smell it’  test has a 
variable scale (0 -5) the ideal cutoff will be determined to maximize any one (or combination) 
of these factors:  
• Sensitivity  
Protocol Number  
 Version Date  and Version #  
 
19 • Specificity  
• Accuracy  
We will compare the performance of the smell test to the current CDC metric of self -
described assessment of smell loss (the de facto standard – e.g. “I have a new loss of smell 
or taste”) in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.   Repeatability will also be 
examined in a test -retest score conducted within 24 hours  in a ran dom subset of  25 
asymptomatic  HCW  with a second device in which the order of the odorants is altered.  
 
5.2.2 Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables (if applicable)  
We will determine if ‘asymptomatic’ SARS -CoV-2 positive subjects experience a  partial  or 
transitory  loss of smell (hyposmia) and if s o determine the fraction of subjects in which this 
occurs . Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy will be measured.  
 
5.3 Study Population  
This study is oriented towards the average US adult population and is limited to anyone over 
18 years old (and excludes pregnant women ). The goal is to be wide reaching and minimize 
selection bias of choosing outpatients.  The study will focus on two cohor ts: ‘drive -thru’ 
outpatients  with minor COVID -19 symptoms (enough to merit a test) and healthy volunteer  
asymptomatic  adults at high -risk of being infected with coronavirus .  We will exclude 
pregnant women, those with pre -existing anosmia, head injury, sc ent allergies, asthma or a 
self-reported stuffy/runny nose.  These conditions will be identified by [CONTACT_18654] -report.  
We will also exclude vulnerable patients with dementia  as they are less likely to understand 
the test . They will be identified by [CONTACT_374664]; if not, then they would be excluded.  
 
 
5.3.1 Number of Participants  
Upon consultation with Yale biostatistician s Profs. James Dziura and Denise Esserman, 
based on our sampling they calculated the following table to show  the precision of 
sensitivity/specificity measurements for different sample sizes  (Table 1 ).  For example, the 
95% confidence inte rval for 90% sensitivity with 100 subjects ranges from 82 to 95% , but if 
we have 400 subjects, the confidence interval ranges from 87 to 93% (about +/ - 3%). Thus  
the number of participants will be guided by [CONTACT_374665].  A minimal 
estimate is ~[ADDRESS_469075] good confidence

[ADDRESS_469076] 100 age /gender matched SARS -Co-V2 negative 
subjects. If there are 3:1 SARS -Co-V2 negative to SARS -Co-V2 positive then ~400 
outpatients (300 +100) will be tested. For the more exploratory testing with asymptomatics 
we will limit the study to ~ 100 COVID -19 positive subjects and a similar nu mber of SARS -
Co-V2 negative subjects.

22 6 Methods  
6.1 Treatment – Device  
6.1.1 Intended Use for Device    
The intended use of the ‘u -Smell -it’™ olfactory test device is to in a quantitative, fast and 
repeated manner rapi[INVESTIGATOR_374652] a loss of smell and if so, based on 
the score  and the precision of the device  determine the likelihood that s/he is at risk of being 
positive for SARS -CoV-2. This result would in turn serve as a quantitative indicator to guide 
judicious action  (analogous to how temperature is used to truly identify a  fever vs. patient 
self-identification)  – e.g. a follow up PCR test.  The comparative gold standard (most used)  
is the question of if the person believes that s/he has “a new loss of smell or taste ”, as 
currently stipulated by [CONTACT_6750]  (whether performed i n a written or electronic questionnaire) .  
While there are other smell based test kits they are either very long  (10-15 min)  and tedious 
(UPSIT) and will not be suitable for wide -scale rapid test ing, or for the rapid [ADDRESS_469078] to the user -identified stated “new loss 
of smell/taste ” – and anticipate a real unbiased test to greatly outperform a highly subjec tive 
assessment . A related  underlying hypothes is that we seek to test in this trial is that 
COVID19+ people perform poorly in self -assessments and grossly underestimate their loss 
of smell.  If this premise is validated AND the performance of the device i s statistically high 
(especially in terms of sensitivity) then one would seek FDA approval under emergency 
authorization use  (EUA) .  If this  eventually  clear s the FDA then it would be used in wide 
scale US testing at  the state and federal level.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_469079] is to not inadvertently damage 
it and as such would be given in a sealed pouch with a ‘golf pencil’, consent form, 
instructions and multiple choice answer sheet.  
Patients who are in queue for drive -through COVID -19 testing will be approached by a 
research team member. No prior medical information will be provided to the study team 
regarding a patient’s eligibility.  
The device in a pouch would be given to drive up outpatients that are undergoing PCR 
testing for COVID.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the device packet would be placed on the test subject ’s 
windshield just as they  drive in and are waiting.  If the subject consents to take the test, it will  
only take a minute.  They will have the smell test and consent form digitally recorded (by 
[CONTACT_228232]) as they hold the test answers against the closed windows while inside the car.  They 
will then give a nasal or oral sample for PCR testing , which is not c onducted as part of the 
study. Of note, the subjects are already undergoing PCR testing and the smell study merely 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_374653]. Thus there is practically no extra burden .  
Protocol Number  
 Version Date  and Version #  
 
[ADDRESS_469080] can be replicated multiple times with different variants.  As these tests are done 
in presence of a HCW there is little issue of compliance.  
 
6.1.3 Method of Assignment/Randomization (if applicable)  
All drive -through subjects that meet the inclusion /exclusion  requirements will be tested . 
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_469081] for calibration as ever y individual responds to odors  somewhat 
differently. But in a healthy population (C OVID -19 negative ) we expect to get a statistical 
distribution of results . We will ensure that over time for the control group that the 
performance of the device is similar and repeat test a random subset of individuals.  
 
6.1.5 Storage Conditions  
The device can be stored at ambient temperature (5 -40 deg. C) for up to [ADDRESS_469082] enabled from the device  will be compared to:  
• Patient self -identification for loss of smell: “Do you have any new loss of smell or 
taste?”  YES or NO.  
• PCR results for the presence of SARS -CoV-2 
The methods for the assessment will be stati stical, as describe d above.

Pregnancy status will be sepf reported and any pregnant patients will be exclud ed from the

6.2.3 Adverse Events Definition and Reporting  
Based on extensive use with scratch -and-sniff™ cards without adverse effects such events 
would be considered unlikely, nevertheless should they occur they will be immediately 
reported to the P. I.  ([CONTACT_374676] ).  Also the test is fast and no n-invasive – highly limiting 
adverse events . 
 
6.2.4 Pharmacokinetics (if applicable)  
None  
 
6.2.5 Biomarkers (if applicable)  
The outpatients are already scheduled for RT-PCR testing of SARS -CoV2 which  will be

mandated by [CONTACT_374666]’s  manufacture  directions.

windshield. The bag will contain the following materials:  
a. A consent form  
b. A pre -sharpened ‘golf -pencil’  
c. The ‘u -Smell -it’ olfactory device test card  
d. A multiple choice answer form  
2. While in the car, if the  patient consents, they will sign the consent form, read the 
simple instructions (which are also shown as pi[INVESTIGATOR_374655]), take the test, and fill in the answers.  This process will take about [ADDRESS_469085]:  The test card device has 5 window s each printed with 
a different scent (or no scent) and marked #1, 2, [ADDRESS_469086] (“no scent”, and  
scent A, B, C or D).  For instance this could be: no scent / apple / orange / 
Protocol Number

25 cherry /banana / rose.   This procedure will be repeated for each of the [ADDRESS_469087] if:  
i. “Do you have any new loss of taste or smell? ”  (Yes/No)  
ii. “Does anything smell different  in the last year ?”  (Yes/No ) 
iii. Do you have a stuffy or runny nose?  (Yes/No)  
c. If the test site is not part of EPIC  the patient will be asked their gender and 
age band (18 -29, 30 -39, 40 -49, 50 -59, 60 -69, 70 -79, 80+)  
3. After the patient completes the test they will pull out the Consent and Multiple 
choice questionnaire form , and with the window still CLOSED  hold it up to the 
driver ’s side window and it will then be photographed by [CONTACT_374667] (likely an 
ENT resident doctor) whom will add the unique identifier number and add it to the 
EPIC system . 
a. [Alternative should there be any issues with the camera  or the patient must 
get out of the car ]: The patient will take the completed test packet , place it  
back in the pouch and under the windshield. The HCW will take the packet 
and remove the Consent Form  and Multiple choice questionnaire form , 
chec k if it is completed (if ask the patient), and place all remaining materials 
in a biohazard box for destruction. The Consent form and the Questionnaire 
will be digitalized (scan or photographed) and linked with EPIC so as to be 
compared to the PCR test results.  
4. Information from the uploaded and Multiple choice questionnaire form  will be 
entered by a person authorized to access the information into a tabl e that includes:  
a. Unique identifier  
b. Gender  
c. Age band (10 year)  
d. Y/N to pa tient self -identified new loss of smell or taste  
e. Y/N to patient response to “things in the last year smell different”  
f. Y/N to patient self -identified blocked or stuff nose  
g. Individual answers on the [ADDRESS_469088]  
h. RT-PCR results for SARS -CoV-2 (+, - or Inconclusive)  
i. Any other tests for COVID19 (CT or Serological) if given  
5. The data will be analyzed in the following fashion : 
a. Patients that report a blocked or stuffy nose will be excluded from the main 
analysis (as COVID -19 loss of smell is not due to nas al congestion); but will 
be analyzed separately to see how this would confound any interpretation.  
b. Patients that are denoted SARS -CoV-2 “inconclusive” will be excluded from 
the main analysis; but will be separately analy zed to see if they colocalize 
with normos mia or ano smia . 
c. Patients will be split into SARS -CoV-2 positive and negative.  As the negative 
pool is likely to be much larger it will be statistically matched by [CONTACT_374668] (potentially with larger bands – e.g. 20 year, depending o n the 
sample size)

e. False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN) will be identified and used to 
measure the selectivity and sensitivity, respectfully.  
f. Based on the statistical performance (see Table 1) we will determine when 
we have enough patients to complete the study wit h a given value of

We will analyze how much the projected cost would be to test every American in the US with 
different cost models of the device (e.g. $1 Unit) as compared to PCR based tests and 
current costs. We will then estimate based on the sen sitivity and projected prevalence of 
Coronavirus, and current testing with PCR, the number of new cases that might be identified 
if taken to full scale, and the number that would be missed.  This would provide a 
generalized estimated  range  given the underl ying assumptions of the cost/benefit of wide -
level screening with the olfactory device.   Importantly unlike PCR tests this test could be 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_374657].  Also the test can be performed at home with only

IRB will determine whether informed consent and HIPAA authorization are required.  In 
addition:  
• The IRB will conduct continuing review at intervals app ropriate to the degree of risk, 
but not less than once per year.  
• A study closure report will be submitted to the IRB after all research activities have 
been completed.    
• Other study events (e.g. data breaches, protocol deviations) will be submitted per  
Yale IRB's policies.

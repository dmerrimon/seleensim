-2- 1. Precis  
The clinical manifestations of disorders of energy metabolism and defects in 
oxidation/reduction are similar because the basic defect involves the inability to transfer 
electrons. The same is true for many mitochondrial diseases. Affected patients exhibit a 
wide variety of signs and symptoms, but the most frequent and earliest dysfunctions occur 
in the muscle and brain, where energy requirements are high. The diagnosis of t his type of 
defect is problematic because of the nonspecific and protean clinical manifestations of 
these disorders. Treatment is equally challenging, since the exact locus of the primary 
defect generally remains enigmatic. As a consequence, physicians rel y upon generic 
cocktails of vitamin co -factors or endogenous intermediates intended to enhance 
mitochondrial electron transport, diminish the damage of reactive oxygen species, and 
promote energy production. The field is such a morass that, in general, it calls for trial -and-
error treatment based upon empi[INVESTIGATOR_710522]. Edison Pharmaceuticals, Inc, has developed an in 
vitro assay that utilizes patient fibroblasts to model the innate susceptibility to oxidative 
stress caused by [CONTACT_710567]/reduction. The assay 
system also determines if the cells respond with increased viability to an IND drug called 
EPI-743. We propose a clinical trial that enrolls [ADDRESS_966257] a disorder that, base d upon studies performed in a clinical protocol such as 
76-HG-0238 (“Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism and 
Other Genetic Disorders”), is consistent with a defect in energy metabolism or 
oxidation/reduction. Second, their cultured fibroblasts must exhibit a defect in the ability 
to withstand oxidant stress. Third, their fibroblasts must respond to EPI -743 in vitro  by 
[CONTACT_710568]. This protocol is a double -
blind, placebo -controlled crossover study with 6 -month periods of treatment  and a two-
month washout period . Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2-5 days every 
3 months. The primary outcome measure is quality of life based upon the Newcastle 
Paediatric Mito chondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) for ages 2 -11 years ; parts I -III are 
evaluated separately from part IV . Secondary outcome measures are tailored to each 
patient’s laboratory, imaging, and clinical abnormalities. Results while receiving EPI -743 
will be compa red to results while receiving placebo; both repeated measures analyses and 
Student’s t test will be employed. To date, [ADDRESS_966258] that they could benefit

3. Brief Rationale and Background  
Version: 9 June 2019  
-3- Individuals with extremely rare or undiagnosed diseases often find it difficult to receive 
appropriate diagnoses and treatments (1,2). A subset of patients with undiagnosed diseases 
has clinical findings that suggest defective energy utilization or an abno rmal 
reduction/oxidation (redox) state within cells. These abnormalities are generally 
attributable to mitochondrial disorders (3), but they could also involve cytoplasmic defects. 
The diseases themselves are sometimes fatal in the first decade of life. Pa tients often 
present with significant neurological and/or muscular findings that can include growth 
failure, short stature, psychomotor retardation, abnormal respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], nystagmus, 
ophthalmoparesis, ataxia, dystonia, optic atrophy, retinitis pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802], h ypotonia, 
myopathy, seizures, or parkinsonism. Laboratory findings can include elevated lactate and 
pyruvate levels in plasma and/or cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], abnormal mitochondrial morphology 
on muscle, nerve, or liver biopsy, and the presence of mutations on sequencing of 
mitochondrial genes or nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. In addition, muscle 
biopsy can reveal abnormal electron transport chain enzymology, changes in mtDNA copy 
number, or muscle -specific coenzyme Q deficiency. The diagnosis, c linical investigation, 
and therapy of this group of disorders are widely considered inadequate and fraught with 
false positives, false negatives, and huge levels of uncertainty. Rational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_710523] Q 10, idebenone, dichloroacetate, B vitamins, 
L-carnitine, or a ketogenic diet (4 -7). However, a beneficial response is unusual and 
unpredictable.  
 
To address the problem of diagnosing extremely rare and enigmatic diseases, the NIH 
Undiagnosed Diseases Program (UDP ) was established in 2008 (1,2). The NIH UDP has 
received over [ZIP_CODE] inquiries, reviewed over 3500 medic al records, and admitted over 800 
patients to the NIH Clinical Center.  Approximately 25% of patients have achieved 
diagnoses, some of which are amenabl e to conventional treatments. Most UDP patients, 
however, never reach a diagnosis or therapy, and many of them exhibit clinical findings 
suggesting a defect in energy balance or in oxidation/reduction status.  
 
To address the unmet need of treatment for suc h individuals, Edison Pharmaceuticals Inc., 
has developed a small molecule therapy (EPI -743) as well as an in vitro  assay to ascertain 
which patients are likely to respond to that drug. The assay involves measuring cell 
viability under conditions of oxidat ive stress; fibroblasts from patients with abnormal 
mitochondria or improper redox states die at lower levels of exogenous injurant. Certain 
patient cell strains can be rescued from injurant -induced lethality by [CONTACT_294595] -743. This quinone 
oxidation product of a  vitamin E isomer, alpha -tocotrienol quinone, is a potent rescue agent 
for cultured cells derived from patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases.  EPI -743 is 
a functional and structural equivalent to coenzyme Q 10.  Edison Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
currentl y sponsors IND #107401 for EPI -743 for the treatment of inherited mitochondrial 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_710524]. The drug has not been approved by [CONTACT_1622].  
 
The cellular efficacy of EPI -743 was established in oxidatively stressed primary fibroblasts 
cultured fr om a patient with mutations in SURF1  resulting in Leigh syndrome  (8), a 
metabolic disease causing subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy ( 9).  In this assay, 
the oxidative stress was induced by [CONTACT_710569], resulting in loss of cell viability. The same level of oxidative stress did not 
Version: [ADDRESS_966259], the redox silent/locked analogue of EPI -743 (bis -pi[INVESTIGATOR_710525] -743 
dihydroquinone) did not rescue Leigh syndrome fibroblasts, supporting a redox -dependent 
mechanism of action for EPI -743.  Lack of cellular efficacy of  the redox silent analogue of 
EPI-743 was not due to cellular toxicity, since growth inhibition by [CONTACT_710570].  
 
EPI-743 showed similar potency (EC 50 = 18nM) in rescuing the fibroblasts of a patient 
with a s evere CoQ [ADDRESS_966260]. This form of CoQ 10 deficiency is biochemically 
similar to Leigh syndrome (SURF1) because both conditions affect the function of the 
mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).  
 
While the exact mechanism of action for EPI -[ADDRESS_966261] as an NADPH dependent cofactor to facilitate the repletion of cellular glutathione 
stores, which appear to be lower in mitochondrial disorders ( 10). In addition, the ratio of 
reduced to oxidize d glutathione (GSH/GSSG) within tissues appears to reflect the level of 
oxidative stress (1 1). 
 
In human studies, several patients with genetically confirmed Leigh syndrome with SURF1 
mutation have been treated with EPI -743, and have shown cessation of disease progression 
and evidence of improvement in global motor function, cognitive function and quality of 
life as a ssessed retrospectively by [CONTACT_710571] I-IV. Patients with Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy have also benefitted from 
EPI-743 treatment (1 2).  
 
An open -label study confirmed the beneficial effects of EPI -743 in 13 children and one 
adult with mitochondrial disease (1 3), including 4 with polymerase -
 deficiency , 4 with 
Leigh syndrome , 3 with MELAS , 2 with mitochondrial depletion , and 1 with Friedreich ’s 
ataxia . Two patients died of their disease. Ten of the [ADDRESS_966262] reviewed the role of EPI -743 as an antioxidant (14), correlated 
brain blood flow (as gauged by [CONTACT_21851]99m -HMPAO uptake) with response to EPI -743 in 
patient with mitochondri al diseases (15), and described glutathione redox status in response 
to EPI -743 in patients with mitochondrial encephalopathies (16).  
 
We propose to identify patients, both within and outside  our UDP cohort, whose fibroblasts 
in culture both exhibit an abn ormal oxidative stress response and are rescued by [CONTACT_294595] -743. 
We will treat these patients with EPI -743, and record quality of life scores using the 
Version: 9 June 2019  
-5- Newcastle Paediatric Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) for ages 2 -11 years 
(Appendix A). We will also measu re objective outcomes such as growth parameters, 
plasma lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids, leucocyte CoQ, plasma carnitine levels, 
ammonia, CPK, serum liver enzymes, urine organic  and amino  acids, and CSF lactate and 
amino acids. Clinical changes will be documented by [CONTACT_565970], neurology and 
audiology evaluations, neuropsychological testing, EKG and echocardiograms, and video -
tapi[INVESTIGATOR_710526]. For patients with muscle involvement, the Gross Motor Function 
Measure (GMFM) -66 will be employed (Appendi x B).  Possible outcomes include 
increased strength, decreased fatigue, less acidosis, improved laboratory values, fewer 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], reduced frequency of seizures, less ataxia or dystonia, and improved 
hearing and/or vision. For patients with progress ive disease/disability, a plateauing of signs 
and symptoms may be considered beneficial. (See Section 8.1.)  
 
We provide two examples of patients whose fibroblasts have met the in vitro  criteria for 
eligibility into this protocol. In the assay for increased susceptibility to oxidant stress, 
fibroblasts were exposed to increasing concentrations of an oxidizing agent, and cell 
viability was assessed by [CONTACT_710572] -AM. The f ibroblasts of two UDP 
patients, #1262 and #2473, exhibited 50% cell death at concentrations of oxida ting stressor 
(
M) that were significantly lower than those for age-matched control  cells (Fig. 1).  All 
cells were between passages 3 and 12.

One non -serious but severe Adverse Event was experienced by [CONTACT_710573] -06 in May o f 
2015. This 4 year -old girl had a Grade 4 elevation of  her s erum cr eatine phosphokinase 
(CK) in month [ADDRESS_966283] arted and the CK again 
rose to Grade 4 levels. The drug was stopped,  and the patient terminated from the study, 
but the CK has remaine d elevated for several weeks.  At one point, this Adverse Event was 
considered probably rel ated to the drug, whe ther placebo or EPI -743. Based upon the 
recommendations of the NHGRI DSMB, monthly monitoring of CK values has been 
incorporated into this protocol, and a letter has been sent to patients notifying them of this 
event. In addition, elevated CK is noted as a  risk in Section 9.1 and in the consent.

4. Study design  
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled, cross -over trial involving 20 children whose 
clinical findings and in vitro  (i.e., cultured fibroblast) studies suggest that they could 
benefit from EPI -743. These patients will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 2-5 
days and will receive either EPI -743 or placebo, t.i.d., for 6 months.  The dosage will be 
15mg/kg  three times a day  up to a maximum of 200 mg three times a day.  Patients  will 
return after 1 , 3, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 1 4 months ; safety labs studies and phone evaluations will 
be spaced between these visits. A fter the 6 -month  admission , there will be a two-month 
washout period and then the drug will be changed to either placebo or EPI -743. PK data 
show a terminal half -life for EPI -743 of 24 hours at low plasma concentrations. A two-
month washout should be sufficient, since washout is typi[INVESTIGATOR_710549] 
5 times the terminal half -life. Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_969], physi cal examination, 
laboratory testing and consultations. Efficacy will be determined based upon comparison 
of the 6 months on EPI -743 with the 6 months on placebo. The primary outcome parameter 
will be the quality of life score on the Newcastle Paediatric Mi tochondrial Disease Scale 
(NPMDS) for ages 2 -11 years ; parts I -III will be assessed separately from part IV . 
Secondary outcomes will consist of a set of laboratory and clinical measures customized 
for each patient,  such as the GFMF -66 and specific laborato ry tests. After completing the 
crossover portion of this trial, all patients will be offered open -label EPI -743. 
 
 
5. Procedures  
After screening is performed to assess for entry criteria, baseline data relevant to the 
patient’s individual disorder will be collected. Patients will remain on any supplements 
they have been receiving. Accepted  patients will be randomized by [CONTACT_710574] -743 ( 15mg/kg  three times a day) or placebo, 
with meals  to a maximum dose o f [ADDRESS_966285] 6 -month treatment period plus a two-month 
washout period. Testing will be individualized based upon clinical findings, but certain 
studies will be performed on every patient (Table 1).

following studies will be performed at baseline and at 6, 8, and 1 4 months: G MFM -66, brain MRI/MRS, CSF lactate, 
amino acids, folate, neurotrans mitters , neuropsychological testing, video, ophthalmology, audiology, ECG, Echo, and 
EEG  
 
Additional  laboratory studies will be obtained locally for safety reasons at week 2,  month 
2, and 2 weeks after the end  of each treatment period (see below).  
 
5.1 Med ical information  
Upon admission to the NIH Clinical Center, a history and physical examination will be 
performed in addition to several laboratory tests, procedures, and consultations. Patient 
data will be entered into  the Clinical Trials Database (CTDB), an electronic data capture 
system provided by [CONTACT_133812]. Computer files will use numbers assigned to patients and will 
have secure passwords. This database is secure and password protected. Data entered 
directly in CTDB wi ll be considered digital source documentation. CTDB is a Web -based 
application that supports protocol design, clinical data collection and reporting. Clinical 
Trials Database (CTDB) is a secure password -protected enc rypted database, where patient  
informati on is stored by [CONTACT_710575]. Descriptions 
of CTDB and its security information are included in Appendices A and B, attached.  
 
Baseline and follow -up outcome measures (0, 3, 6, 8, 11, 14 months)  
Laboratory tests inclu de a routine urinalysis  with dipstick and testing for organic acids . A 
two-hour urine protein will be obtained if the urinalysis is positive for protein. Blood will 
be drawn for CBC and differential, platelets, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, acute care, 
mineral and hepatic panels , cholesterol, triglycerides, amylase, lipase lactate, pyruvate, 
ammonia, prothrombin time and INR, partial thromboplastin time, plasma and urine amino 
acids, carnitine  (at 0, 3, 6, 8, 11 and 14 month s), creatine phosphokinase  (CK) , and 
glutathione .  When indicated, leucocyte coenzyme Q will be obtained. Endocrine studies 
will include thyroxine and TSH. Blood ( 15 ml) will also be drawn for research purposes, 
such as measurement of creatine (1 7) and FGF -1. Unused plasma and serum will  be banked 
Version: 9 June 2019  
-15- for use at a later date  for questions related to this and future studies . Coagulation studies 
(PT, PTT, INR) will be repeated [ADDRESS_966286] been reached by [CONTACT_159753].  (The initial half -life of EPI -743 approximates 4 hours.)  
 
“Study” b lood volumes will be 68  mL for the baseline and 8-month admission s and  60 mL 
for the 3, 6, 1 1, and 1 4-month admissions. Additional blood will be drawn for medically 
indicated tests. Total blood volumes , monitored by [CONTACT_710576], will be  consistent with Clinica l Center guidelines. 
Specifically,  no more than 9.5 mL/kg or 550 mL will be drawn for research p urposes over 
any 8 -week p eriod, and no more than 5 ml/kg will be drawn at one time.  When blood 
volumes are limiting because of the patient’s weight, the least relevant studies will be 
eliminated.  For example, some patients may not need to have lactate, pyruvate, ammonia, 
amino ac ids, or carnitine drawn.  
 
Procedures will include electrocardiograms at every NIH a dmission . In addition, studies 
that are medically indicated for the patient’s disorder will be performed. These may include 
an audiogram, ABR, measurement of visual acuity, visual field testing using the Humphrey 
32.3 chart , sedated electroretinogram and/or optical coherence tomography, MRI /MRS  of 
the brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_710550], electromyogram/nerve conduction velocity, EEG, videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
or neuropsychological testing. These stand ard studies, if indicated to characterize or 
diagnose the patient’s basic illness, will be repeated at the beginning and end of each 
treatment period  to assess the effects of the treatment. Another outcome measure will be 
total days hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710551] e-related illnesses.  
 
Consultations may include neurology, neuropsychology, audiology, cardiology, 
rehabilitation medicine, ophthalmology, and others as indicated by [CONTACT_148737].  If 
a lumbar puncture is performed, the CSF will be sent for lactate, pyruvate, 5 -methylene 
tetrahydrofolate, neurotransmitters, and pterins.  
 
Safety studies ( 0.5, 1, 2, 6.5, 8.5, 9, 10, 14.5 months)  
These  safety -related blood draws will be  obtained  locally and the results sent to the NIH. 
They include CBC  with differential , ESR, acute care, mineral and hepatic panels , PT/INR, 
aPTT, and creatine phosphokinase (CK),  for a total volume of ~14 mL. (These same blood 
tests are included in the “study” bloods drawn at 0, 3, 6, 8, 11, and 1 4 months .) In addition, 
a CBC with differential and CK will be drawn locally at 4, 5, 12, and 13 months to comply 
with the DSMB and FDA’s requirement to follow th ese tests monthly.  Additional lab 
studies will be performed if there are abnormal results. Specifically, if the CK is el evated 
during this study or was elevated in the past, a CK will be performed more frequently, 
based upon the investigator’s medical judgment.  
 
All patients enrolled in this protocol will also be enrolled in protocol 76 -HG-0238, 
“Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Other Genetic 
Disorders.”  Under that study, a variety of blood tests (requiring 52 m L plus up to 100 ml 
for research), consultations, and procedures (photos, radiographs, skin biopsy) may be 
performed. When st udies for the two protocols coincide, they will not be duplicated , and 
the total amount of blood drawn for both protocols will not exceed NIH limits.  
Version: [ADDRESS_966287] results will be stored in a locked file cabinet and 
treated as conf idential clinical data. A Clinical Report Form (Appendix C ) will be 
completed for each patient at each admission. The CRF includes the delineation of a 
specific set of laboratory and clinical criteria that will comprise the secondary outcome 
measures for e ach patient. The Clinical Report Form can be computerized and the data 
maintained as files. Computer files will use numbers assigned to patients, with the key kept 
in a locked file cabinet. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_710552].

EPI-743, or 2 -[(3R,6E,10E) -3-hydroxy -3,7,11,15 -tetramethyl -6,10,14 -hexadecatrienyl] -
3,5,[ADDRESS_966291] of alpha -tocotrienol, one of the eight naturally 
occurring forms of vitamin E.  EPI -743 is a visc uous yellow oil.  It will be administered as 
a mixtur e with sesame oil NF/USP at 100 mg/mL, with meals.  Dose formulations will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_131770].  
 
Experience with EPI -743 in patients is as follows:  
1.) For patients with Leigh syndrome tr eated with EPI -743 at 100 mg t.i.d. ( both under 
the US expanded access protocol and in the phase 2 study conducted in Rome ), the 
mg/kg dose ranged from 3.3 to 14.8 mg/kg .  No drug -related adverse events or 
safety laboratory abnormalities were observed during the course of treatment at 
these doses.   
2.) Based on the PK data obtained from the studies with EPI -743 at the dose of  100 mg 
t.i.d., we estimate that a dose level of 15 mg/kg, w ith a maximum dose of 1 00 mg 
t.i.d., will expose patients to an AVERAGE daily AUC of approximately 9,000 
ng.h/mL, and a MAXIMUM daily AUC of approximately 46,000 ng.h/mL. Based 
on the NOAEL in 28 -day rat toxicity studies (AUC 55,000 ng.h/mL), these 
exposures correspond to safety margins of 6 - and 1.2 -fold, respectively.  
3.) Because the dose -limiting effect of EPI -743 in non -clinical safety studies is 
inhibition of coagulation, the protocol includes appropriate monitoring of 
Version: 9 June 2019  
-18- coagulation parameters during the study, as well as a provision to lower the dose in 
those patients where INR increases  to Grade 2 or greater severity. (See Section 9.1.)  
Recent data, described in Section 9.1, indicate that EPI -743 is safe and well tolerated at a 
dosage of 15mg/kg three times a day,  with a maximum dose of 200 mg three times a day,  
and this is the dosage to be used in this protocol.  
 
Each bottl e of EPI -743 contains approximately 20 g of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient 
(API) and is labeled with the following: the product name, product lot number, protocol 
number, recommended storage conditions, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], “Caution: New Drug -Limited 
by [CONTACT_710578],” and Edison Pharmaceuticals’ company name [CONTACT_2758]. Labeling will comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.6.   
 
Placebo will be supplied by [CONTACT_710579].  
 
All study drugs will be stored and dispensed in accordance with the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and local regulations concerning the storage and administration of 
investigational drugs. Drug use will be tracked by [CONTACT_710580] ; this will be recorded on the CRF.

Quality of life questionnaires w ill be administered in the form of the Newcastle Paediatric 
Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) for ages 2 -11 years (Appendix A). For patients on 
the extension study who are more than 11 years old, the NPMDS for ages 12 -18 will be 
employed. The results wil l serve as the primary outcome parameter.  The GMFM survey 
will serve as a secondary outcome measure and will be completed as appropriate.

7. Statistical Considerations (Appendix D) 
In this cross -over study, patients will serve as their own controls. Outcome measures during 
the EPI -743 treatment period will be compared with values during placebo treatment.  
 
The primary outcome measure will be the quality of life score on the Newcastl e Paediatric 
Mitochondrial Disease Scale (NPMDS) for a ges 2 -11 years (Appendix A).  This will be 
completed every 3 months  during the treatment periods . Parts I -III will be analyzed 
separately from part IV. C hange over the period of therapy (6 months) will b e compared with 
change over the period of placebo (6 months). That is, the midway score for each period will 
not be considered, since some NPMDS items assess status over the past 6 months. For 
analysis of the entire 20 patients, mean changes on and off EPI -743 will be compared using 
Version: 9 June 2019  
-21- Student ’s t-test. Subsets of the NPMDS scale that do not assess the previous 6 months will 
include scores every 3 months, and can be analyzed using repeated measures.  
 
The NPMDS data will be analyzed via a two -treatment crossove r design in which half the 
patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment A (EPI -743) in period 1 and B 
(placebo) in period 2, while the other half will receive B in period 1 and A in period 2.  
There will be a 2-month washout between the two time  periods.  It is assumed that there 
will be no carry -over after the washout period.  NPMDS will be measured at 4 time points: 
(X1, X2) = immediately before and immediately after period 1, then, after the washout, 
(X3, X4) = immediately before and immediate ly after period 2.   The changes from baseline 
in each period are then given by Y1 = X2 -X1 and Y2=X4 -X3. SAS code will be used for 
this analysis. If there is carry -over, the crossover design must be abandoned in favor of a 
student’s two -sample t -test of th e differences between arms in period [ADDRESS_966296] X1 (both treatment groups pooled) is 
not signi ficant, this will encourage belief in no carry -over.  
 
Secondary outcome measure s, besides the number of days of disease -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710556] 3 months, will be customized to each patient and recorded on the CRFs. They will 
include biochemical  parameters reflecting a change in laboratory findings specifically 
selected at baseline. Examples are serum lactate and pyruvate, blood creatine, glutathione, 
FGF1, and CO 2. For patients with muscle involvement, the GMFM -66 will be employed 
(Appendix B).  Since all these data will be obtained every 3 months  during the treatment 
periods , a repeated measures analysis will be used to compare rates of change on EPI -743 
and on placebo for each individual. In addition, qualitative measures of change (e.g., video 
evidence of improved gait or movement) will be evaluated.  
 
We will not address futility or success in terms of the protocol in its entirety, since 
improvement in even a single individual would be gratifying. Hence, there will be no interim 
analysis of com posite data  for efficacy. (Safety is addressed in Appendix D.) Both  futility 
and success will be evaluated for each patient based upon a comparison of the outcome 
parameters at the 3 time points on treatment with the 3 time points on placebo. Individuals 
in whom treatment was deemed succe ssful will continue to receive E PI-743.  
 
If patients are removed from the study and no longer receive treatment, their data will be 
retained and analyzed on an “intent to treat” basis.  
 
 
8. Potential Benefits  
8.[ADDRESS_966297] benefits to participants.  
Individual patients could benefit from EPI -743 by [CONTACT_710582]. Patients enrolled in this study 
will also receive optimal care and follow -up of their illness.  
 
 8.2 Collateral benefit to participants.  
Version: 9 June 2019  
-22- The results of clinical testing performed at the Clinical Center will provide baseline and 
follow -up medical data for each patient’s record.  
 
 8.3 Benefits to society.  
This protocol should help determine  the safety and efficacy of EPI -743 for various disorders 
of energy and oxidation/reduction.  
 
 
9. Likelihood and Seriousness of Harms and Means to Maximize Safety  
 9.[ADDRESS_966298] not excluded the possibility 
of human Ether -a-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) inhibition because of the very low water 
solubility of EPI -743.  hERG , also called KCNH2 , codes for a potassium ion channel. 
Therefore, ECG monitoring prior to and during the initial dose stages will be performed.  In 
vivo toxicology information is limited to short term studies (up to 28 days) at this time.  A 
decrease in hematocrit and hemoglob in was observed 14 days after single dose at 1000 mg/kg 
and 2000 mg/kg in rats.  In dogs and rats, coagulation parameters were inhibited after 7 daily 
doses of 300 mg/kg and higher, with death occurring with signs of internal hemorrhage.  In 
a 28-day study  in rats and dogs, coagulation times (PT and aPTT) were elevated by 15 -80% 
at doses of 300mg/kg (rats) and 100 mg/kg (dogs).  A structural similarity to other agents 
suggests that EPI -[ADDRESS_966299] clini cal 
hematology tests will be performed periodically throughout the trial and prothrombin 
time/INR and PTT will be monitored throughout the trial.  EPI -[ADDRESS_966300] Level (NOAEL) of EPI -743 after daily oral 
administration for 28 days to rats and dogs is 100 mg/kg, corresponding to AUC levels of 
approximately 60,000 and 180,000 ng.h/mL, respectively.  Based on the pharmacokinetic 
results from the open label studies in patients treated with EPI -743 thus far, the AUC 
resulting from a dose of 100 mg p.o., t.i.d. is estimated to be below 3,000 ng.h/mL.  
 
EPI-[ADDRESS_966301] in vitro tests . EPI -743 did not cause any 
neurological changes as indicated by [CONTACT_710583] 28 -day toxicity studies in rats, at doses up to 300 mg/kg. EPI -743 did not cause ECG 
changes in dogs during the 28 -day toxicity studi es at doses up to 100 mg/kg. EPI -743 did 
not cause changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_710557] 300

The potential for enzyme induction by [CONTACT_294595] -[ADDRESS_966302] been dosed with EPI -743 for a 
total of over 300,0 00 dosing days. Patients ranged  in age from 22 days to 56 years. There 
Version: [ADDRESS_966303] been no dose -limiting toxicities reported; one patient had a possibly drug -related serious 
adver se event (clinically diagnosed pneumonia in a child with  mitochondrial disease).  In the 
current study (12 -HG-0161), one patient had a non -serious Grade 4 elevation of serum CK 
considered probably related to the drug, although we do not know if the drug was  EPI-743 
or placebo.  
 
As of November 2014, the dose level of 15 mg/kg has been evaluated in several trials in 
addition to the NIH study including:  
1) Rett syndrome placebo -controlled trial: EPI -743 was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg 
TID (dose ranging from 145 to 405 mg TID) for 6 months. There were no laboratory 
abnormalities related to drug treatment, no drug -related SAEs and no dose -limiting toxicities.  
2) Leigh syndrome trial: A total of [ADDRESS_966304] been enrolled in an ongoing placebo -
controlle d trial (EPI743 -12-002) at a dose level of 15mg/kg TID up to [ADDRESS_966305] been no drug -related SAEs or dose -limiting toxicities and coagulation data show no 
abnormalities in PT/INR.  
 
Blood chemistries, histories, and physical examinations obtained on every admission will 
help to detect any potential, unforeseen, or  chronic toxicity of EPI -743. In addition, specific 
questioning about side effects will be performed on every admission by [CONTACT_710584].  
 
Patients who develop grade [ADDRESS_966306] grade 1 in severity 
within two weeks of the initial dose reduction, admi nistration of EPI -743 may either be 
further reduced or discontinued.  
 
Once a patient’s dose is reduced due to elevated INR thought to be related to study drug 
administration, the dose should not be re -escalated.  
 
To further ensure safety, an interval analy sis will be performed if and when [ADDRESS_966307].  
 
If a patient is terminated from the study for any reason, every attempt will be made to obtain  
a final evaluation that will include a history and physical examination, AE evaluation and 
documentation, and determination of the reasons for early termination, and follow -up 
laboratory testing and EKG.  
 
9.2 Diagnostic interventions  
Version: 9 June 2019  
-24- The primary procedure -associated risk of this study consists of phlebotomy requirements, 
which are approximately 68 mL per admission and will never exceed  5 mL/kg at any one 
time or  9.5 mL/kg in any 8 -week period, including blood drawn for ancillary tests and for 
other protocols. Blood volumes will include that collected locally, which will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_710585]. Discomforts include venipunctures (usually 2 per admission).   
 
In selected patients, some procedures that are medically indicated to be performed once will 
be repeated to provide outcome measures. These may include a n MRI of the brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_710558], EEG, videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or neuropsychological testing.  
 
 9.3 Radiation.  
Only medically indicated radiation exposure will be incurred.  
 
 9.4 Sedation.  
Sedation will be given only for medically indicated studies.  
 
 9.5 Psychological harms.  
This protocol may give false hope; the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_710559] c counselors 
will attempt to avoid this.

information about the participants without their expressed consent.  
 
 
10.  Privacy and Confidentiality of Medical Information/Biological Specimens  
 10.1 Will participant identifiers be attached t o data?  
Data files will have only numbers, not names. However, an identifier will be attached to the 
data, all of which will be maintained in records in a locked file cabinet within a secured 
laboratory or office.  
  
10.2 Clinical/demographic information.  
Age, sex, diagnosis, and laboratory results will be part of the Clinical Report Form kept in a 
locked file within a secured office.  
 
 10.3 How might information make specific individuals identifiable?  
It is doubtful that any demographic information could id entify an individual.  
 
 10.4 Access to the key for patient identification.  
The code to patient identities, as well as other patient data, will be kept in a locked file. 
Access to the code will be restricted to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_710560].  
Version: 9 June 2019  
-25-  
 10.5 Will pedigrees be published?  
We have no plans to publish pedigrees from this protocol. If we do, elements of a pedigree 
that could uniquely identify it will be disguised by, for example, not specifying the genders 
of certain members.  
 
 10.6 Will results be provided to participants?  
Clinical data will be given directly to the patients at a debriefing session just prior to 
discharge. The results of outcome measures such as the NPMDS score, however, will be 
withheld so as not to unblind p atients and their families.  
 
 10.[ADDRESS_966309] parties?  
The investigators will not disclose to third parties any information about the participants 
without their expressed consent.  
 
 10.8 Sharing of data/samples with other researchers.  
Data and samples may be shared with collaborators, but will not be transferred to another 
site with any identifiers. The fibroblasts sent to Edison Pharmaceuticals for stressor and EPI -

None.  
 
 
11. Assessment of Significance of Study (Balance of Risks and Benefits)  
Patients eligible for this protocol have no proven therapy for their disorders.  While the 
prospects of slowing the progression of disease are unknown, adverse events related to  
EPI-743 treatment are expected to be minimal. The risk/benefit ratio favors attempting EPI -
743 treatment.  
 
 
12. Collection, Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events, protocol deviations, unanticipated problems (UP), serious adverse events, 
are defined as described in NIH HRPP SOP 16 (“Reporting Requirements for 
Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events and Protocol Deviations.”). All adverse events 
occurri ng during this study, including those observed by [CONTACT_106637], 
will be recorded. Serious unanticipated problems and serious protocol deviations will be 
reported to the  IRB and Acting CD as soon as possible but not more than [ADDRESS_966311] ing to the requirements of 21 
CFR 312.64(b) and as agreed upon with the sponsor. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_710561]: 9 June 2019  
-26- and report them to the Sponsor according to the timetable for reporting specified in the 
protocol (21 CFR 312.64(b)).  
Some minor protocol dev iations are expected, and will not be reported to the IRB unless 
they occur at a rate greater than anticipated. These deviations include drawing blood later 
than planned, occasional missed individual lab test or EKG, rare missed vital sign 
documentation, missed NIH visits related to local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_710562], failing to have the patient fast for a blood draw, creating a 
hematoma on blood drawing, etc.  
 12.1 Exclusion of adverse event reporting.  
There are a large number of expected events associated with the disorders affecting patients 
enrolled in this protocol.  
 
Anticipated adverse events that known to be associated with EPI-743 and that are Grade 1 
or Grade 2 will not be reported to the IRB unless they occur at a rate above 5% . Examples 
of expected adverse events include but are not limited to those events detailed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure for EPI-743 and in the protocol’s  risk section . The severity of  
organ and laboratory abnormalities is defined in the CTCAE 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06 
14_QuickRefere nce_8.5x11.pdf ). If the rate or severity of these events exceeds the rate or 
severity anticipated in the protocol or investigator’s brochure, the events will be classified 
and reported as though they are Unanticipated Problems.  
In addition, certain non -serious Protocol Deviations are expected to occur  approximately 
once every 3 -6 months per patient , and these will not be reported to the IRB except at the 
time of the annual report. These include certain missed laboratory tests (such as an ESR, 
often missed locally) , late laboratory tests  (such as blood lactate levels  or urine test results ), 
and late telephone calls to check on the patients ; any of these  could be delayed by 1 -2 
weeks. Other reporting exclusions would be follow -up visits that are late by [CONTACT_8622] 3 weeks.   
 12.2 Monitoring of adverse events related to this protocol.  
Adverse events (AEs) will be collected from the time of study drug initiation  to the 1 4.5-
month followup. In addition, SAEs will be collected from the time informed consent is 
obtained to the 14-month end of study  visit + 30 days for SAEs that are ongoing at the 14-
month  study visit.  All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_737], reported by [CONTACT_102], 
from clinically significant laboratory findings, or other means, will be recorded in the 
patient’s medical records and on the CRF.  An Adverse Event Collection Form comprises 
Appendix E.  
 
Adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_710586] , monthly after that , and [ADDRESS_966312] study drug 
dose. Adverse events occurring at the NIH Clinical Center will be recorded in the medical 
records  and in study documents.  Nurses on the unit (1NW) will monitor excessive blood 
drawing by [CONTACT_491975]. In addition, patients will have easy access to the treatment team 
to report adverse events  by [CONTACT_48052].  
 
Version: 9 June 2019  
-27- Adverse events, protocol deviations, unanticip ated problems (UP), Unanticipated Adverse 
Device Effects (UADEs), serious adverse events, sponsor and serious, are defined as 
described in NIH HRPP SOP 16 ("Reporting Requirements for Unanticipated Problems, 
Adverse Events and Protocol Deviations"). All ad verse events occurring during the study, 
including those observed by [CONTACT_106637], will be recorded. Serious 
unanticipated problems, Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects and serious protocol 
deviations, will be reported to the IRB and C D (Clinical Director) as soon as possible but not 
more than [ADDRESS_966313].  
Data from this study will be reported to the standing NHGRI DSMB. Reports will be made 
every 6 months. Early reporting will relate to safety, and the report to the DSMB will tabulate 
symptoms and abnormal laborator y findings.  
 
Stop/Pau se rules are given in Appendix D. A pause means that no new patients will be 
enrolled until the DSMB lifts the pause; enrolled patients will continue to receive drug. The 
DSMB will decide whether to stop/pause the study . Specifically,  if 2 different patients 
experience the same Grade 3 adverse event, or if any patient develops a Grade 4 adverse 
event, the DSMB will be notified immediately and will decide if the study should be stopped. 
In addition, since  5 serious adverse events  (SAEs)  have occur red, the DSMB will be notified 
in real time of each subsequent SAE, and will make  a determination regarding whether to 
continue the study  or to impose a pause . A pause will occur automatically when [ADDRESS_966314] to 
adverse event evaluation and safety issues.  
 
The FDA will be informed of any Stop in the protocol, and if the protocol is terminated.  
 
13. Alternatives to Participation  
Patients with mitochondrial defects, other disorders of energy metabolism, or 
oxidation/reduction abnormalities frequently receive a cocktail of drugs designed to stabilize 
the electron transport chain. This alternative, often already attempted in our patients, remains 
a possibility.  
 
 
Version: [ADDRESS_966315] that EPI -743 may provide no benefit whatsoever, and could even be harmful.  
 
14.4 Protections for vulnerable participants.  
An assent form is attached for children. In cases of legal guardianship, the rule of law w ill 
apply and the decision of the appointed surrogate will be honored. In questionable cases, 
an ethics consult will be obtained, and consent monitoring will be invoked. We will also 
assess for signs of agreement or objection conveyed through body language . 
 
 14.5 Special circumstances.  
None.

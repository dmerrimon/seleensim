Context : 
Early childhood is a sensitive period in which young children develop language and socio -
emotional skills foundational for school readiness. Unfortunately, poor vulnerable children 
experience disparities in these critical areas of development. Parent -child  shared reading can 
help ameliorate these disparities, yet low -income parents do not consistently engage in this 
activity. Behavioral economics approaches utilizing automated hovering (AH) have the 
potential to increase parent -child shared reading through text messages and financial 
inducements.  
Objectives : 
1) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of 3 novel AH interventions of 
increasing complexity hypothesized to increase the frequency of parent -child 
shared reading.  
2) Explore relevant outcomes related to parenting stress, the home reading 
environment, and language and socio -emotional development.  
Study Design:  
The study design has two phases, Phase [ADDRESS_396125] the effects of 
AH approaches to increase parent -child shared reading.  
Setting/Participants : 
We plan to recruit 3-4 urban CHOP -affiliated pediatric practices from CHOP’s Pediatric 
Research Consortium (PeRC) to participate in the s tudy. These practices care for a diverse, 
complex urban population and have onsite social worker s to assist with family crises.  
A total of [ADDRESS_396126] a parent with 
daily access to a smart phone in order to receive and send text messages. Children born <[ADDRESS_396127] them at high risk 
for developmental disabilities will be excluded.  
Study Intervention and Measures:  
Ten p articipants in phase 1 will undergo an audio -recorded qualitative interview that will be 
used to develop coaching tips  for phase 2.  
Forty -five participants in phase 2 will be randomized to receive one of the 3 AH 
interventions: daily text message reminders, daily text message reminders with coaching or 
daily text message reminders with coaching and weekly lottery entries.  The weekly lottery is 
related to principles of behavioral economics so that participants in this group will be 
externally motivated. The lottery is testing a methodology and is not a non -permissible form 
    
   
   vi 
of payment.  There will be 15 participants per group to adequately assess feasibility and 
acceptability.  
The result of this application would be expected to inform future R01 applications on the 
effects of AH to improve parent -child shared reading in a larger and more diverse 
population of low -income children.

[ADDRESS_396128] been 
estimated to exceed $[ADDRESS_396129] found that parent -
child shared readi ng is associated with improved language functioning, better school 
performance, less harsh parenting, and fewer disruptive behaviors especially for children from 
low-income families.9-12 Yet parents of young children from low -income communities do not 
consistently engage in reading activities with their children until they are older, due to numerous 
barriers such as lack of time, lack of understanding of importance, difficulty developi[INVESTIGATOR_320973], stress and fatigue, and competing priorities.13 From an economics viewpoint, 
these barriers can impose a time bias that discounts future language and socio -emotional benefits 
in favor of the current costs of shared reading.  
Early sha red reading strategies, such as Reach Out and Read (ROR) and Imagination Library, 
promote parent -child shared reading and distribute board books to low -income children.8,[ADDRESS_396130] improvements in the frequency of shar ed reading and still lag 
behind their higher income peers in language development.15  
1.1 Introduction  
The overall goal of this LDI pi[INVESTIGATOR_320974] (A H) to improve the frequency of early parent -child 
reading behaviors among low -income families. Such approaches have previously shown benefit 
in medication adherence, smoking cessation, immunization rates, health care utilization, and 
weight management and have the potential to shape parent -child reading behaviors and improve 
language and socio -emotional development in young children.16-21 This application addresses the 
care o f vulnerable populations, one of LDI’s four priority research areas. If successful, 
behavioral economics approaches can be incorporated into current early literacy promotion 
strategies to maximize their potential and further improve early language and soci oemotional 
development. For example, children participating in ROR at participating pediatric practices can 
be signed up to receive automated text message reminders with or without financial inducements 
at the same time as they receive a board book and rea ding promotion counseling from their 
pediatric clinician at a corresponding well child visit.

   1.2 Name [CONTACT_320987] -child shar ed reading through text messages. The intervention consists 
of daily text messages for 8 weeks in 3 AH intervention groups. The text messages were part of 
the aforementioned trial on early literacy promotion (see Appendix 1).  
Group [ADDRESS_396131] to Health Platform. Participants will be asked to reply to the text 
message on daily shared reading activities including the titles of the books and time spen t 
reading (see Appendix 1).  
Group [ADDRESS_396132] of Group 2 personalized coaching plus ava ilability of a weekly lottery. The 
lottery is related to principles of behavioral economics so that participants in group 3 will be 
externally motivated. The lottery is testing a methodology and is not a non -permissible form of 
payment. Participants who re port back that they read on a particular day will be entered into a 
weekly drawing to receive $20. Each reported daily reading behavior will provide a single lottery 
entry so that participants who report they read all [ADDRESS_396133] 7 ent ries in 
the weekly drawing. Lottery entries will begin on Mondays and close at 12:[ADDRESS_396134] Monday after enrollment.   
1.3 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_320975] 45 CFR 46 and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline 
approved by [CONTACT_8639]. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_320976].  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, wil l obtain consent and 
assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance 
with Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66939]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the 
privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  
[ADDRESS_396135] the effects of AH approaches to promote child language and socio -
emotional development. As such, we will incorporate behavioral economic approaches using 
automated hovering (AH) to improve the frequency of parent -child shared reading in low -income 
children and help ameliorate disparities for school readiness.

   2.1 Prim ary Objective (or Aim)  
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the feasibility and acceptability of automated hovering of varying 
intensity designed to improve the frequency of parent -child reading behaviors among low -
income families.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
Specific Aim 2:  To explore differences in reading frequency, the home reading environment, 
parenting stress, and child language and socio -emotional development by [CONTACT_320977] -income families.  
[ADDRESS_396136] a parent with daily 
access to a smart phone in order to receive and send text messages. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for Phase 1 will be th e same as Phase 2. In our previous study utilizing text messaging 
with low -income families for a study of early literacy promotion, only 28 (18.9%) of 148 eligible 
participants approached for recruitment were ineligible because they didn’t have access to a  
smart phone. Children and their parents will be recruited from participating practices at any [ADDRESS_396137] books and reading promotion 
from their child’s clinician as part of the ROR program.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_396138]. The text messages were previously developed as part of the 
aforementioned trial on early literacy promotion (see appendix). Usi ng a rapid -cycle design 
process developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Buttenheim, data from brief interviews with N=[ADDRESS_396139] based on their needs.  The interviews will be audio 
recorded  and transcrib ed in order to analyze content.  In the event that the baseline visit  cannot be 
completed in -person, an alternative method of obtaining informed consent will be used , and the 
interview will be completed over the phone . All interviews will be audiotaped and transcribed 
for analysis. Interview transcripts will be analyzed and coded using NVivo, a qualitative 
software. The information can inform the motivational tips in phase 2 to address barriers to 
shared reading.  
Following the telephone screening, caregivers  of eligible children will be sent the 
informed consent document electronically through REDCap. The study team will then go over 
the document in detail with the eligible caregiver by [CONTACT_320978] e -consent function to 
obtain their signature. The signe d e-consent form will be stored within REDCap and a copy will 
be made available to download and email securely to the caregiver.  
4 
 
   3.1.2 Phase 2  
After conducting the rapid -cycle design for phase 1, forty -five eligible children and their parents 
will be consented a nd enrolled in the study.  In the event that the baseline visit cannot be 
completed in -person an alternative method of obtaining informed consent electronically through 
REDCap  will be used . Following informed consent and completion of baseline surveys, 
participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_320979] 1:1:1 to receive one of the 3 AH 
interventions for an 8 -week duration. Using a similar recruitment strategy, we were able to 
successfully recruit 120 (81%) of [ADDRESS_396140] of Group 2 plus availability of a weekly lottery. 
Group 3 participants who report back that they read on a particular day will be entered into a 
weekly drawing to receive $20. Each reported daily reading behavior will provide a single lottery 
entry so that participants who report they read all [ADDRESS_396141] to Health platform and will be assessed as the 
mean overall number of days/weeks of reading for each group. Partic ipants will also be provided 
with an opt out of the daily text messages option if they no longer desire to receive daily text 
messages. Participants will be queried at follow -up on their overall satisfaction (5 -point Likert 
scale) with their intervention g roup and asked to answer survey questions regarding likes and 
dislikes concerning the intervention group they received following the intervention period. The 
survey questions at the end of phase 2 will be based on input from the rapid -cycle design process 
of phase 1 interviews.  
At baseline, parents will complete a measure of demographics (child and parent age, 
race/ethnicity, sex, highest education completed, and family income category) (see Appendix 2). 
To explore differences in the home reading environmen t, parents will complete the Read 
subscale of the StimQ, a validated 14 -item parent report measure of the home reading 
environment, at baseline and follow -up.23 To explore differences in parenting stress, participants 
will complete the Parenting Stress Index -short form (PSI -SF), a validated 36 -item parent report 
of parenting stress, at baseline and following the 8 -week intervention in order to assess 
changes.24 Finally to explore differences in child language and socio -emotional development, 
parents will complete at follow -up the MacArthur Communicative Developm ent Inventory 
(CDI), a validated parent -report scale of early language development, and the Devereux Early 
5 
 
   Childhood Assessment (DECA), a validated [ADDRESS_396142] visit. Caregivers of eligible children 
will be consented in person or electronically throug h REDCap . Following informed consent  and 
completion of the baseline surveys  participants will be randomized 1:1:1 to one of 3 AH groups: 
1) daily text message reminders on shared readings using the Way to Health Platform or 2) daily 
text message reminders plus personalized coaching and social comparisons through links in the 
text messages or 3) daily text message reminders, coaching and the availability of a weekly 
lottery. Randomization will be accomplished in advance using computer generated numbers. 
Allocation concealment (blinding of the treatment assignment) will be implemented and sealed, 
opaque envelopes, along with stratification, and randomly permuted blocks of unequal sizes (to 
prevent providers and patients from manipulating the randomization).

these criteria must be reported in accordance wi th IRB Policies and Procedures.  
4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Phase 1 Rapid -Cycle Design  
Informed Consent : Parents will participate in -person consent visits.  In the event that the baseline 
visit cannot be completed in -person an alternative method of obtaining informed consent 
electronically through REDCap  will be used.  Modified Verbal consent will be collected  if the 
COVID -19 pandemic persists to limit study staff exposure. Parents will be called to obtain verbal consent 
for participation using the written informed consent document. Parents who agree will be sent the written 
consent form for signature [CONTACT_320988] p. In the event that the baseline visit is conducted remotely, 
parents will be given the option to complete the interview over the phone.  
Review of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Interview : The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed. We will be us ing ADA Transcription 
services. The outline of content of the interview will use open -ended questions to identify specific 
behavioral barriers to more frequent reading with children (see appendix 3  for Interview Guide ). Data 
from the interview will be used  to edit reminder messages and coaching content in phase 2 to address 
perceived  barriers. The interviews will occur in the primary care practice following the completion of 
their child’s well visit. or over the phone if COVID -[ADDRESS_396145] udy staff exposure.

5.1.2 Other Evaluations, Measures  
At the start of phase 2, f ollowing written informed consent, participant families will complete a 
baseline visit. In the event that the visit cannot be completed in person, study procedures may be 
conducted virtually  online through REDCap. Measures of demographic and biological variables 
(child age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, maternal education level, and family structure), 
parenting stress , and the home reading  environment will be collected by [CONTACT_320980] (See Appendix 2).  
The Read subscale of the StimQ is a validated 14 -item parent self -report questionnaire designed 
to measure of the home reading environment, at baseline and follow -up for children ages 5 t o 72 
months of age.23 The StimQ contains 4 subscales (availability of learning materials, reading, 
parental involvement in 1developmental advance, parental verbal responsivity) and is available 
in English and Spanish. Internal consistency (Cronbach =0.88 -0.93) and test -retest reliability 
(ICC=0.93) of the StimQ is excellent, and it correlates well (r=0.55) with the IT -HOME 
Inventory, another measure of the home environment.78 Poverty will be assessed by [CONTACT_320981] (<100% of the Federal Poverty Level) and maternal education status (  High 
School). Parenting stress will be measured at baseline and at follow -up 2 months later using the 
Parenting Stress Index -Short Fo rm (PSI -SF). 24 
Parenting Stress Index -Short Form (PSI -SF): Baseline and follow -up. The PSI -SF is a validated 
36-item scale that measures parenting stress. It has been shown to have excellent internal 
consistency and to be positively associated with matern al psychological distress. Scores on the 
PSI-SF correlate well with the full PSI. The total score will be used.   
MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (CDI): 2 -month follow -up. CDI is a 
validated parent -report scale of early language development w hich captures important 
information including language comprehension, production and grammar. 26 
Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (DECA): [ADDRESS_396149] safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_271938]. As this study is not greater than 
minimal risk serious adverse events are not anticipated.

   6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
For ph ase 1, t he primary endpoint will be the qualitative interview responses used to inform texts 
and survey for phase 2. For phase 2, the primary endpoints will be acceptability and feasibility of 
the intervention. T o determine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention,  we will assess the 
number of participants who complete the daily text messages and query participants on their 
overall satisfaction measure (5 -point Likert scale) with their intervention group and provide 
survey questions  regarding likes and dislikes concerning the intervention group they received 
following the intervention period.   
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary outcomes will be  explore d in phase 2 to determine the  differences in reading 
frequency, the home reading environment, parenting stress, and child language and socio -
emotional development at 2 months.  
6.3 Control of Bias and Confounding  
Randomization and allocation concealment are the primary means of avoiding b ias. Analytic 
strategies will also be used to control for residual confounding: (1) Stratification will control for 
imbalance not controlled by [CONTACT_8345]. (2) Additional potential confounders will be evaluated for 
any residual association with treatment and i ncluded in model as needed. (3) Post randomization 
effects: The primary source of bias will arise after randomization from dropout and loss to 
follow -up. To address this problem and avoid missing data, we shall implement the following 
measures: (a) incenti ves to each family to complete the study, (b) collection of multiple contact 
[CONTACT_271939], and (c) contact [CONTACT_271940], even if they do not 
continue with their clinical contacts.  
6.[ADDRESS_396150]  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Specific Aim 1  
Primary outcomes:  
To determine the feasibility of each group of the intervention, we will assess the proportion of 
participants who rece ive and report a daily reading behavior each week across all groups, the 
proportion of participants who access coaching content in group 2 & 3, and the proportion of 
participants who participate in the weekly lottery in group 3. To determine acceptability of the 
intervention, we will assess the number of participants who opt out of the daily text messages 
and query participants on their overall satisfaction (5 -point Likert scale) with their intervention 
group and provide survey questions regarding likes and  dislikes concerning the intervention 
group they received following the intervention period. The survey questions at the end of phase [ADDRESS_396151] 
inferential statistics and intention -to-treat analysis. Survey question responses will be assessed 
using qualitative methods in which codes will be developed and emerging themes ident ified by 
[CONTACT_320982].  
Secondary outcomes:  
To explore differences in reading frequency, the home reading environment, parenting stress, 
and child language and socio -emotional development, we will examine differences in mean 
weekly reading frequency, mean changes in StimQ Read Subscale scores and PS I-SF scores, and 
mean CDI and DECA scores between groups using standard inferential statistics and intention -
to-treat analysis. In addition, effect sizes will be computed to assess differences between Group 1 
and each of the other 2 groups and to power fut ure studies.  
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. The main risks of 
participation are disclosure of PHI and distress with answering study measures.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during 
the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported t o the CHOP IRB in accordance 
with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not 
serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or 
other format and submitted to the I RB at the time of continuing review.

   8 STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
8.1 Treatment Assignment Methods  
8.1.1 Randomization  
Children and their parents will be randomized following informed written consent 1:1:1 to 1) 
daily text message reminders on shared readings using the Way to Health Platform or 2) daily 
text message reminders plus personalized coaching through links in the text messages or 3) daily 
text message reminders, coaching and the availability of a weekly lottery.  
  
8.1.2 Blinding  
Allocation concealment (blinding of th e treatment assignment) will be implemented using sealed, 
opaque envelopes, along with stratification, and randomly permuted blocks of unequal sizes (to 
prevent providers and patients from manipulating the randomization). Participants will not be 
blinded t o their treatment assignment. However, research will be blinded to treatment assignment 
when collecting study data.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_396152]. All data for these study 
procedures will be maintained on CHOP’s secure research serve r, and all analyses will be 
performed on de -identified data only. All collected study measures will be entered directly into a 
REDCap database maintained and protected on this secure research server. The unique 
identifiers will be used to track enrolled fa milies over the course of the study. Confidentiality 
will also be maintained by [CONTACT_271954]. 
Each member of the research team, including investigators, research assistants, and stakeholder -
investigators  will receive appropriate training in human subject research and patient 
confidentiality.  
 
For all data collection and management of audio recordings, a digital audio recorder will be used 
and all digital audio files will be stored on a CHOP server for the  study. All audio files will be 
sent to ADA Transcription services for transcription with deletion of  any identifying 
information. The de -identified transcripts will be returned and maintained on CHOP’s secure 
research server.  The ADA Transcription service s is a CHOP approved vendor that have been 
used before for other research studies at CHOP  and will continue to be used in the future . 
 
Unique identifiers will be created for each subject in the study. REDCap will be used to store the 
data. A master list containing PHI and subject ID number will be kept separate from data forms 
(electronic and paper). The master list will be kept using pas sword -protected files. These files 
will be encrypted and maintained on the CHOP secure server to ensure security. Participants’ 
[ADDRESS_396153] -protected serv er with regular backup.  
 
8.4 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
8.4.1 Risk Assessment  
The research involves the collection of sensitive and protected health information from 
participants. The risk of participation is considered minimal. For both  phases of the stu dy there is 
a potential risk of breach of confidentiality of information and study results about individuals. 
This risk is minimized by [CONTACT_271955]: use of 
secure files, storing data on secure computers, using  unique study identifiers, de -identification of 
data prior to analysis.  
 
For participation with the rapid response phase of the study, there is a risk that participants may 
become uncomfortable answering questions . In addition, participants responses may be 
inadvertently disclosed outside of research . If participants feel uncomfortable answering 
questions , they may skip any question or stop the interview at any time. Additionally, the study 
team will take the necessary steps to ensure no breach in confiden tiality with the audio -
recordings as well. The study team will make sure to keep participant’s information secure after 
the initial recording by [CONTACT_171739], storing data on secure computers,  using unique study 
identifiers and de -identifying  all recording. No one other than the research team and the person 
who writes down the answers will hear the recordings. Also, if someone’s name [CONTACT_320989], it 
will not be included on any notes made by [CONTACT_41314].  The transcripts will have all 
identifyin g information deleted.  
 
For p articipation in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833] , there is a  risk that participants may become 
uncomfortable in completing study measures. If this occurs, the protocol will allow participants 
to stop at any time. Should any specific co ncerns arise throughout the project period, the CHOP 
IRB will be promptly informed. Since the purpose of the intervention is to help parents improve 
parent -child shared reading, we expect that adverse consequences due to the intervention will be 
extremely rare and unlikely.  
[ADDRESS_396154] to 
increase parent -child shared reading in a larger more diverse population of low -income children. 
This model may be replicated in different care settings and thus generate generalizable 
knowledge.  Further, the information obtained will be disseminated as wi dely as possible, 
including publication in peer -reviewed journals and policy briefs and presentations at scientific 
and lay conferences. Given the minimal risk nature of the study, the risks are considered 
reasonable in relation to the potential benefit to  be gained.  
8.4.3 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Given the minimal risk nature of the study, the risks are considered reasonable in relation to the 
potential benefit to be gained.  
8.5 Recruitment Strategy  
8.5.1 Subjects  
Eligible children and their parents will be identified in the clinic by  [CONTACT_320983] a recruitment flyer (see Appendix 8). The flyer will be used  to 
deliver information of the study to eligible children and parents . If permitted, research staff will 
recruit in person at the clinic. Parents who verbally agree to be contact[CONTACT_320984] a REDCap referra l form  (see Appendix 9) . The contact 
[CONTACT_320985] . Medical 
records of the potentially eligible subjects will be screened and assessed for eligibility prior to 
contact[CONTACT_13742].  Subsequent to screening the medical record, the subject will be called by 
[CONTACT_271958] a study visit. Research staff will briefly 
explain the study procedures, guided by [CONTACT_271959]. 
This includes reading the inclusion criteria to the potential participant, and asking whether or not 
this individual is interested in participating. Research staff will then schedule a time to meet with 
the parent in person - or remotely to co mplete the baseline visit.  At this visit, parents will be 
asked to provide written informed consent to participate in the study . In the event that the 
baseline visit cannot be completed in -person, an alternative method of obtaining informed 
consent will be used. Following the telephone scree n, caregivers of eligible children will be sent 
the informed consent document electronically though REDCap. The study team will go over the 
document in detail with the eligible caregiver by [CONTACT_648]. The e -consent fu nction in REDCap will 
be used to obtain the caregiver’s signature. The signed e -consent will then be stored within 
REDCap and a copy of the form will be available to download and emailed securely to the 
caregiver.   
 
The rationale for the involvement of chi ldren in the study is that the investigation addresses child 
development in pediatric care settings. The study does not involve any other special class of 
subjects.  
 
14 
 
   8.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
Following the screening via review of the medical record, eligibility for study participation will 
be explained via phone. During the research staff visit subsequent to the screening process, 
written informed consent will be completed . Research staff will discuss the study aims, 
procedures, ri sks and benefits, alternatives to participation, and confidentiality protocols with the 
parent. Research staff will speak to the parent about the voluntary nature of participation and 
provide the potential subject with the opportunity to ask questions abou t the study and its risks 
and benefits. Parents who consent to participate and who give parental permission for the child’s 
participation, will sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1076]: one will be kept for study 
purposes and the other will be provided  to the consenting parent . In the event that the baseline 
visit cannot be completed in person, informed consent may be obtained electronically through 
REDCap. In order to give parental permission for the child to participate, the consenting mother 
must be at least [ADDRESS_396155] the health care they or their children receive at participating 
practices. Participants who are already enrolled in the study and need to be reconsented due to 
study changes (such as the  implementation of certain measures), will be contact[CONTACT_320986] -consented over the phone (or in person if that is the preferred method of the participant). 
No information sheet or copy will be offered to subjects who are verbally re -consented  due to the 
fact that these subjects already have a copy of the main consent form.  
All activities stated in this proposal will be performed in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  CHOP personnel, including resea rch staff and 
stakeholders, must complete training on the privacy measures of HIPAA. This training reviews 
the HIPAA policies relevant to research practice to protect the confidentiality of patients and 
research subjects.  The protection of human subjects training provides formal, comprehensive 
education in order to protect children, adolescents, and parents from the risks associated with 
participating in research, and to reduce the risk to investigators and the institution that are 
associated with non -comp liance.  Training covers institutional policies and procedures, federal 
regulations and critical aspects of study implementation.  These training requirements are 
fulfilled by [CONTACT_271969] (CITI) Course in the 
Protection of Human Subjects, an online program that covers the history and ethics of human 
subject research, the organizational structure and procedures of the Institutional Review Board, 
the protocol process, HIPAA for clinical research, and standard s for conducting clinical research 
at CHOP.  
 
8.6.1 Payments to parent for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation)  
Participants in Phase 1 will be paid up to a total of $25 for their participation.  
Participants in Phase 2 will be paid up to a total of $75 for their participation. They will receive 
$25 upon completion of the initial study visit (Baseline). At the final study visit (2 -month follow -
up) they will receive $50. Group 3 participants will be  entered into a weekly drawing with the 
opportunity to receive $[ADDRESS_396156] the 
opportunity to receive additional payments up to $160. All payments will be made in the form of 
pre-paid, CHOP -issued debit cards.  
15 
 
   8.6.2 Gifts  
No other gifts will be given.  
 
9 PUBLICATION  
This study will be registered with ClinicalTrials.gov following IRB approval of the final protocol 
and before any potential patients and their families are enrolled in the study. All study data will  
then be reported to the ClinicalTrials.gov site. Additionally, all arising publications of Study data 
and analyses will follow the set of guidelines outlined in the CHOP publications policy manual.  
 
The research team plans to work closely with key stakeho lders to disseminate and implement the 
findings of the research study into accessible and usable formats in research, clinical, and 
community -based settings. We will target findings to state and national policymakers, county EI 
agencies across the state, p arent advocacy groups, and pediatric practices using social media, 
policy briefs, mass emails, and newsletters. We will work with PolicyLab at CHOP to develop 
dissemination plans. PolicyLab has extensive experience distilling research findings into policy -
relevant summaries and disseminating research findings to end -users. We will also utilize 
traditional approaches such as peer -reviewed publications and presentations at national meetings 
to disseminate findings to other researchers.

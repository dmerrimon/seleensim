Confident ial and Propri etary 6 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: [ADDRESS_88821] ion Study  #[ADDRESS_88822] ive Crohn’s 
Disease
Indication
Crohn’s disease (CD) is an immune -mediated inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract.  Annual incidence varies geographically, wit h est imates ranging from 3.1 to 14.6 per 
100,000 people in the [LOCATION_002] and fro m 0.1 to 16 per 100,000 worldwide ( Lakatos, 2006 ).  
Subjects with CD suffer from diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, abdo minal pain, and fever.  
CDis characterized by a lifelo ng chronic course of remissio ns and exacerbat ions.  The pathology  
of this disease is characterized by [CONTACT_81651] i nfiltration of  lymphocy tes and m acrophages, 
granulo mas, fissuring ulcerat ion, and submucosal fibrosis.  The transmural inflammatory process 
of CD predi sposes subjects to the format ion of fistulas and it has been estimated that 
approximately  35% of  subjects will have at least 1fistul a during the course of their disease 
(Schwartz, 2002 ).  In a recent study , within 10 y ears of  diagnosis, 50% of adults with CD had 
undergone bowel surgery  (Peyrin-Biroulet, 2010 ).
The current standard of medical care for patients wit h moderately to severely  active CDconsists 
of anti-inflammatory  approaches, such as corticosteroids, azathioprine (AZA)/6 -mercaptopurine 
(6-MP), methotrexate (MTX), and bio logics such as ant i-tumor necrosi s factor (TNF)α, anti -
interleukin (IL) -12/IL-23,or anti -integrins.
Immunomodulators ai d in corti costeroi d withdrawal  and in preventing relapse, but also are 
associ ated wi th considerable side effects.  Infliximab, an ant i
-TNFα -therapy , is able to reduce 
signs and symptoms and induce and maintain remissio n in the majorit y of subjects for which it is 
indicated.  However, in a large Phase 3 maintenance trial o f infliximab for CD (ACCENT I), 
only 45% of  subjects w ere considered in remissio n at W eek [ADDRESS_88823] dose group (where 
remission was defined as the abilit y to achi eve a Crohn’s Disease Act ivity Index [CDAI] of 
<150 points) ( Hanauer, 2002 ).  Similarly, the primary response rates in trials of ada limumab 
(Colombel, 2007 ) and certolizumab ( Sandborn, 2007 ) were approximately 47% and 37%, 
respectively .Thus, a sizable proportion of the patient population is unresponsive to both 
convent ional therapy  and TNF antagoni sts. Vedolizumab, a gut -specific anti- integrin therapy , is 
also indicated for achieving clinical response andclinical remissio n in this population. However, 
in a large clinical tri al of vedo lizumab ,only 32% of subjects had a clinical response at Week 6, 
and only  39% receiving vedolizumab every  8 weeks were in remissio n at Week 52 ( Sandborn, 
2013). Ustekinumab, a monoclonal ant ibody  to the p40 subunit of interleukin -[ADDRESS_88824] ion trials of ustekinumab, only  32% of  subjects were respon ders at 
6 weeks ( Feagan, 2016
),and about 40% were in remissio n at Week [ADDRESS_88825] ive, and oral treatments 
forpatients with CD.

Study Design
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study to determine the effect of 
oral ozanimod a s an induct iontreatm ent for subjects with moderate lyto severe ly activeCD, 
defined as a CDAI score ≥ 220 to ≤ 450 . Approximately 600subjects with active clinical 
symptoms and mucosal inflammat ion will be randomized in a 2:1 rati o to receive either 
ozanimod 0.92 m g or placebo. Subj ects will be str atified  
. Approximately 50% of subjects with a history  of 
treatm ent wi th marketed biologic agents (eg , TNF antagonists , anti -IL-12/23 and anti-integrin 
therapy )will be recruited. This limit will ensure the enrollment of subjects who have failed or 
been into lerant to corti costeroi ds or immun omodulator sbut never failed a biologic agent . A
futilit y analysis will be conducted when approximately [ADDRESS_88827] been enrolled, with a 
similar proportion of bio logicnaïve to bio logicexposed popul ation as that in the overall study  
popul ation. 
 
 
 
The primary  endpoint of the study  is the proporti on of subjects in clinical remissio n (CDAI 
score< 150) at Week 12. Key secondary e ndpoints are presented in Secti on2.

The incidence, severit y, relationship, and t ype of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events ( AEs)leading to discont inuat ion of IP, and AEs of 
special interest (AESIs) will be summarized, as well as clin ically meaningful changes fro m
baseline ,clinical laboratory measures, vital signs, and 
electrocardi ogram s (ECGs).
Statistical Methods
This is a Phase 3, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to expl ore the effect of 
oral ozanimod as an induct ion treatment on clinical remissi on forsubjects with moderately to 
severely  active CD.  The fo llowing analysis populations will be used in the statist ical analysis: 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT):  The ITT analysis population will consist of all randomized 
subjec ts from the Screened analysis populat ion that receive at least 1 dose of IP.  
Subjects in the ITT analysis population will be analyzed according to the randomized 
treatm ent, regardless o f the treatment actually given.  The primary  analysis 
popul ation for all efficacy endpo ints will be the ITT analysis population.
Safety: The safet y analysis populat ion is defined as all subjects who are randomized 
and receive at least one dose of study  treatm ent, analyzed by  [CONTACT_81652].

Confident ial and Propri etary 12 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun 2021Per-protocol (PP): The PP popul ation will consist of all subject s in the ITT populat ion
who do not have protocol deviations that may substantially affect the primary  efficacy  
assessment . Thi s populati on will  be used in a sensitivit y analys is of the primary  
endpo int.
Determinat ion of Sample Size for the Primary  Endpoint
The primary  endpoint is CDAI clinical r emissio n at Week 12.  Subjects will be deemed a 
responder wi th respect to this endpo int if they  meet the definit ion for CDAI clinical remissio n at 
Week 12.  This s tudy is designed to have at least a 90% power to correctly  detect a stati stically 
significant difference between placebo and o zanimod with respect to this endpo int.  
Sample size determinat ion was done separately for the two- group chi -square test of equal 
proporti ons wi th 2:1 unbalanced treatment arms.  This yields an overall sample size o f 600 wi th 
the assumption of a t ype I error rate of 5%.  The overall t ype I error rate across all controlled 
endpoints will  be maintained at 5% .
Efficacy Analyses
A futility analysis is planned to be performed when approximately 300 subjects ( with a similar 
proporti on of  biologic naïve to bi ologic exposed subjects as that in the overall study  popul ation) 
from both Induction Studies, collectively , have completed the [ADDRESS_88828]
been cleaned. The primary endpo int, CDAI remissio n (CDAI < 150) at Week [ADDRESS_88829] ion Studi es (RPC01- 3201 and RPC01- 3202) may  be stopped for fut ility 
if the observed treatment effect size in CDAI remissio n is at a low probabilit y to dem onstrate 
superi ority.  Addi tional efficacy endpoints including CDAI response, abdominal pain and stool 
frequency  scores, SES -CD, will be evaluated a s supporting 
analyses. The futilit y boundary  is “non -binding ,” implying that the boundary  can be overruled if 
desired wi thout inflat ing the type -1 error. The “non -binding” boundary is intended to allow the 
Sponsor or the independent Data Monitoring Commi ttee (DMC) to conti nue the study  to gather 
additional information, despi [INVESTIGATOR_81624] . 
The fut ility analysis will be conducted by  [CONTACT_81653] (statist ician and 
programmers) that supports the DMC and the results will be sent to the DMC and may also be 
sent to a Cel gene internal review committee (IRC) for review. The Celgene IRC members will 
not pl ay a rol e in the study  conduct, and the blind will be maintained for persons responsible for 
the ongoi ng conduct and manageme nt of the study  through the end of the Maintenance Study 
(RPC01- 3203), until database lock.
For the primary  analysis of remissio n and/or responder endpoints, subjects who have insufficient 
data for remissio n and/or response determinat ion for the timepoint /study  visit under 
consideration will be considered non- responders for that timepo int. Sensit ivity analyses, missing 
data imputation, and continuous endpo int efficacy analys es are discussed in the statistical 
analyt ical plan ( SAP).

Confident ial and Propri etary 21 RPC01 -3202, v6.0: 14 Jun [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Disease Background 
Crohn’s disease (CD) is an immune -mediated inflammatory  disease of the gastrointestinal (GI) 
tract.  Annual incidence varies geographically, wit h est imate s ranging from 3.1 to 14.6 per 
100,000 people in the [LOCATION_002] and fro m 0.1 to 16 per 100,000 worldwide ( Lakatos, 2006 ).  
Subjects with CD suffer from diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, abdo minal pain, and fever.  
CDis characterized by a lifelo ng chronic course of remissio ns and exacerbat ions.  The pathology  
of this disease is characterized by [CONTACT_81655] m acrophages, 
granulo mas, fissuring ulcerat ion, and submucosal fibrosis.  The tra nsmural inflammatory process 
of CD predi sposes subjects to the format ion of fistulas and it has been estimated that 
approximately  35% of  subjects will have at least 1fistul a during the course of their disease 
(Schwartz, 20 02).  In a recent study , within 10 y ears of  diagnosis, 50% of adults with CD had 
undergone bowel surgery  (Peyrin-Biroulet, 2010 ).
The current standard of medical care for patients wit h moderately to severely  active CD consists 
of anti-inflammatory  approaches, such as corticosteroids, azathioprine (AZA)/6 -mercaptopurine 
(6-MP), methotrexate (MTX), and bio logics such as ant i-tumor necrosi s factor (TNF)α, anti -
interleukin ( IL)-12/IL -23, or anti -integrins.
Immunomodulators ai d in corti costeroi d withdrawal  and in preventing relapse, but also are 
associ ated wi th considerable side effects.  Infliximab, an ant i-TNFα -therapy , is able to reduce 
signs and symptoms and induce and maintain remissio n in the majorit y of subjects for which it is 
indicated.  However, in a large Phase 3 maintenance trial o f infliximab for CD (ACCENT I), 
only 45% of  subjects were considered in remissio n at Week [ADDRESS_88840] dose group (where 
remission was defined as the abilit y to achi eve a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] of 
<150 points) ( Hanauer, 2002 ).  Similarly, the primary response rates in trials of adalimumab 
(Colombel, 2007 ) and certolizumab ( Sandb orn, 2007) were approximately  47% and 37%, 
respectively . Thus, a sizable proportion of the patient population is unresponsive to both 
convent ional therapy  and TNF antagoni sts.Vedolizumab, a gut -specific anti- integrin therapy , is 
also indicated for ac hieving clinical response and clinical remissio n in this population. However, 
in a large clinical tri al of vedo lizumab, only 32% of subjects had a clinical response at Week 6, 
and only  39% receiving vedolizumab every  8 weeks were in remissio n at Week 52 ( Sandborn, 
2013). Ustekinumab, a monoclonal ant ibody  to the p40 subunit of interleukin -[ADDRESS_88841] ion trials of ustekinumab, only  32% of  subjects were responders at 
6 weeks ( Feagan, 2016
), and about 40% were in remissio n at Week [ADDRESS_88842] ivity on the other

Many  cell ty pes express S1P1, including vascular endothelial cells, brain cells, and lymphocy tes. 
Stimulation (agonism) of this r eceptor results in biological act ivities that includes lymphocy te

reversible systemic reduct ion in circulating lymphocy tes (Mand ala, 2002 ). Given the immune -

dampening of disease processes.

1.2.1. Summary of Nonclinical S tudies
The n onclinical safet y assessment for ozanimod included repeated dose toxicit y (rodent and 
non-rodent), genotoxicit y, carcinogenicit y, reproductive and developmental toxicit y, 
phototoxi city, and immunotoxi cology studies. 
The m ajority of the findings in the chr onic toxi cology studi es, the carcinogenicit y studi es, and 
the reproductive toxico logy studi es are consi dered target m ediated effects of S1P1 and S1P5 
agonists.  These include peripheral blood lymphopenia, lympho id depletion in the splenic 
periarteri olar lympho id sheaths and decreased thymic cortical lymphocytes. The activit y of 
ozanimod and the characterized metabo lites was evaluated in in -vitro and in -vivo pharmaco logy 
assays. Two mouse models of inflammatory  bowel disease, naïve T -cell adopti ve transfer a nd 
2,4,6 -trinitrobenzenesulfo nic acid (TNBS) -induced colit is, demonstrated significant reduction in 
disease severi ty scores as evidenced by [CONTACT_81656], and 
histopathology . Improvement in disease parameters correlated with lymphoc yte count reduction 
with stati stically significant effects observed when lymphocyte counts were decreased by  [CONTACT_81657].

Results fro m single ascending dose and mult iple ascending dose studies in Phase [ADDRESS_88852] appropri ate doses for P hase 2 studies. The Phase 2 study of ozanimod in UC was 
conducted comparing 0.92 mg and 0.46 mg of ozanimod with placebo. Safet y was com parable 
across both ozanimod arms, and the 0.92 mg/day dose arm demonstrated better efficacy as 
compared to the 0.46 m g/day  dose arm  across various clinical and endoscopic endpo ints 
(Sandborn, 2016). Results suggested a dose dependent efficacy response, making 0.[ADDRESS_88853] igation.  
The favorable clinical result s and the available safety  data from  the Phase 2 and Phase 3 UC 
studies,as described above, as well as supportive clinical and safety data fro m the com pleted

complywith the Table of Events .
3.Subject has signs and symptoms consistent wi th a diagnosis of C Dfor at least 3 m onths 
(prior to fi rst IPadministration).  The diagnosis should be confirmed by [CONTACT_81661] c evi dence and corroborated by  a histol ogy report. (Note: endoscopy  and local 
histopathology  confirmat ion may be obtained during Screening if no pr ior report is 
readily  available ).
4.Subject has met each of the fo llowing 2 criteria:
a CDAI score ≥ 220 and ≤ 450
an average daily  stool  frequency ≥ 4 poi nts and/or an abdo minal pain of ≥[ADDRESS_88863] has a SES-CD score of ≥ 6 (or SES -CD ≥ 4 in subjects with iso lated ileal

9. Female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) :
Note: For the purposes of this study , a female subject is considered to be of childbearing 
potenti al if 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy  (the surgical  removal of the uterus) or 
bilateral  oopho rectomy (the surgical removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been 
postm enopausal for at l east 24 consecutive months (that is, has had menses at any  time 
during the preceding 24 consecutive months). Must agree to practice a highly  effect ive 
method of contra cepti on throughout the study  until completion o f the  
. Highly effect ive methods of contraception are those that alone or in 
combinat ion resul t in a failure rate of a Pearl I ndex of less than 1% per y ear when used 
consistent ly and correctly .Examples of a cceptable methods of birth control in the study  
are the fo llowing:
combined hormonal ( containing oestrogen and progestogen ) contraception, which 
may be oral, intravaginal, or transdermal 
progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation, 
which may  be oral , injectable, or implantable
placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)
placement of an intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)
bilateral  tubal  occl usion
vasectomi zed partner
complete sexual abst inence
Periodic abst inence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), wi thdrawal  
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only , and lactati onal amenorrhoea m ethod are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.
Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potenti al risks of fetal  exposure m ust be 
conducted for FCBP . The Investigator will educate all FCBP about the different options 
of contraceptive methods or abstinence at Screening and Day  1, as appropri ate. The 
subject will be re -educated every  time her c ontraceptive measures/methods or abilit y to 
beco me pregnant changes. The female subject’s chosen form of contraception must be 
effect ive by [CONTACT_81662] (for example, 
horm onal contracepti on shoul d be ini tiated at least 28 day s before randomizat ion).
10.Subject must have documentation of posit ive varicella zoster virus (VZV) 
or com plete VZV vaccination at least 30 days

[IP_ADDRESS]. Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease 
The SES-CD assesses the degree of inflammat ion.  The SES

components: size of ulcers, ulcerated surface, affected surface, and presence of narrowing.  Each 
of these com ponents are scored on a scale of 0 to 3 as outlined in Table 5.  
In the SES -CD, each of these 4 components are assessed in the 5segm ents of the ileum and 
colon:  ileum , right, transverse, l eft (descending and si gmoid), and rectum .  The SES -CD is the 
sum of the individual scores of each of the components across the 5segm ents.

Detailed methodology  for summary  and stati stical analyses o f the data collected in this study  will 
be docum ented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_1034] . 
The SAP may  modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major m odificat ions of the

9.1. Overview
This is a mult icenter, double -blind, rando mized, Phase 3, placebo -controlled study  to determine 
the effect of oral ozani mod as induct ion therapy  on clinical remissi on in subjects with 
moderately  to severely act ive CD. Approximately [ADDRESS_88899] ive clinical symptoms 
and mucosal inflammat ion will be rando mized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either ozanimod 0.92 m g 
or placebo. Subj ects will be stratified  
.  
Interactive response t echno logy (IRT) will be utilized to ensure a central rando mizat ion based on 
a stratified block rando mizat ion.See Secti on9.3.4 for more details. An independent Data 
Moni toring Committee (DMC) will be used to monitor the study  conduct.
9.2. Study Population Definitions
The fo llowing analysis populat ions will be used in the statist ical analysis: 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT): The ITT analysis populat ion will consist of all randomized 
subjects fro m the Screened analysis populat ion receiving at least 1dose of IP.  
Subjects in the ITT analy sis popul ation will  be analyzed according to the randomized 
treatm ent, regardless o f the treatment actually given. The primary  analysis populati on 
for all efficacy endpoints will be the ITT analysis populat ion.
Safety: The safet y analysis populat ion is defined as all subjects who are randomized 
and receive at least one dose of study  treatm ent, analyzed by  [CONTACT_81652].
Per-protocol (PP): The PP populat ion will consist of all subject s in the ITT populat ion 
who do not have protocol deviations th at may substanti ally affect the primary  efficacy  
assessment . Thi s populati on will  be used in a sensitivit y analys is of the primary

9.6. Efficacy Analysis
Because all primary  and secondary  endpoints for this study  are ei ther remi ssion or responder 
endpo ints (ie, proporti ons of subjects meeting the criteria to be classified as remitters or 
responders for the 2 treatm ent groups), the analysis of endpo ints using a continuous measure will 
not be described here, but rather discussed in the SAP. For the primary analysis of remissio n or 
responder endpo ints, the ITT analysis populat ion will be used. Furthermore, for the primary 
analysis of remissio n or responder endpoi nts and for a given time point or study  visit, ITT 
subjects who have insufficient data for remissio n or response determinat ion will be considered 
non-remitters/non -responders for that time point or study  visit. Sensi tivity analyses , missing data 
imputati on and cont inuous endpo int efficacy analyses are di scussed in the SAP.
9.6.1. Futility Analysis
A futility analysis isplanned to be performed when approximately 300 subjects ( with a similar 
proporti on of  biologic naïve to bi ologic exposed subjects as that in the overall study  popul ation) 
from both Induction studies, collect ively, have completed the [ADDRESS_88904] 
been cleaned. The primary endpo int, CDAI remissio n (CDAI < 150) at Week 12 will be used in 
the analysis. 
 
 The Inducti on studi es (RPC01 -3201 and RPC01 -

12.1. Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential
Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure must be 
conducted for female subjects of childbearing potent ial(FCBP) .  The Invest igator will educate 
all FCBP about the different options of contraceptive methods or abstinence at Screening and 
Day 1, as appropriate. The subject will be re -educated every  time her contraceptive 
measures/methods or abilit y to becom e pregnant changes.  The female subject ’s chosen form  of 
contraception must be effective by [CONTACT_81683]  (for 
example, hormonal contraception should be init iated at least 28 day s before rando mizat ion).
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or posi tive pregnancy tes t in a 
female subject of childbearing potential regardless of disease state) occurring while the subject is 
on IP ,  are considered immediately  
reportable events.  IPis to be discont inued immediatel y and the subject instructed to return any 
unused porti on of  the IP to the Invest igator . The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy , or posi tive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Sponsor ’sDrug Safet y or desi gnee immediately using the 
Pregnancy Init ial Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
The Investi gator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy , and m ust 
notify Sponsor ’s Drug Safet y or desi gnee immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy 
(either normal  or abnorm al outcom e) usi ng the Pregnancy Fo llow-up Report Form, or approved

1. Addition of Maximum Dose and Dose Escalation 
Steps  
The maximum human dose is determined by [CONTACT_774880] 4 -week 
toxicol ogy study in the ra t which corresponds to 
approximately 0.16 mg/kg in a human according to 
pharmacokinetic (PK)  prediction . Dose s between 
cohorts will not exceed a 2-fold increase relative to 
the specified doses stated below . The maximum dose 
for each cohort will be define d as: Cohort 1 - Starting 
dose 0.01 mg/kg;  
Cohort 2 – Dose will not exceed 0.02 mg/kg;  
Cohort 3 – Dose will not exce ed 0.04 mg/kg;  
Cohort 4 – Dose will not exceed 0.08 mg/kg;  
Cohort 5 – Dose will not exceed 0.16 mg/kg.  
Dose escalation will be based on clin ical safety and 
available PK data.

2. Correction of Placebo  Description  
Placebo is a sterile, matching solution (all 
components except the drug substance) and free of 
visible particles.  
Section  8.1.[ADDRESS_1064248] the D1 0 Visit. Therefore, coho rts may 
overlap. After PK modeling  from preclinical 3 animal 
species , human Cmax is expected to be reached 
approximately 3 days after dosing.  As dose limiting 
adverse events occur at or around C max, safety data 
beyond Day 1 0 are not  critical  for a dose escalation 
decision.

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  Number of 
Subjects  Approximately 40 subjects, divided in 5 cohorts with 8 subjects 
per cohort.  
Summary of 
Study Design  This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo controlled, SAD 
study  to investigate the safety, tolerability, and PK  of the 
subcutaneous (SC) administration  of HM15211 in healthy obese 
subjects.  
The study will be conducted in 5 sequential dosing cohorts, 
enrolling 8 subjects per cohort.  Cohorts may partially overlap, if 
dose escalation decision after the Day 1 0 Visit has been made. 
Subjects will be randomized to HM15211 or placebo in a r atio of 
6:2 (6 on active, 2 on placebo).  
Dosing will follow a sentinel approach with dosing at least 24 
hours apart. Based on available safety, tolerability, and PK data, 
and following a safety review and dose escalation meeting 
between the investigator an d the sponsor, dose escalation to the 
next cohort may proceed.  If dose escalation is stopped, dose de -
escalation may occur in additional cohorts, to further refine 
clinically relevant dose levels.  
Adjustments to the procedures may occur after the review of  
available safety and PK data:  
• Adjustments to the number of study cohorts may occur: 
Additional cohorts may be enrolled and proceed at a 
higher or a lower dose. If deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_290164], there may be more than one 
cohort investigated at the same dose level.  
• Adjustments to the 24 -hr BP and HR monitoring: After 
the evaluation of the first cohort, tests may be 
rescheduled, or measurement periods may be focused on 
specific days to capture the 24 -h measurement around the 
PK peak.  
• Adjustments to the visit schedule: If PK data suggest, 
additional sampling times and/or outpatient visits may be 
added to the study schedule.  
Each subject will undergo a screening visit, up to [ADDRESS_1064260] will underg o one in -house period of 9 -day duration, 
two outpatient visits, and a follow -up visit.  
Screening:  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd  
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1064261] dosing to identify eligible subjects for the study.  
In-house Period:  
Subjects will check  in to the clinic in the morning on Day -2 for a 
9-day In -house Period. They will receive standardized meals 
throughout their inpatient stay. Subjects will be connected to an 
ABPM system, and overnight measurements will be taken to 
familiarize the subjects  with the device. ABPM measurements 
will continue throughout Day 4. Only 24 -hour monitoring data 
from Day -1 will be used for the baseline monitoring evaluation.  
In the morning of Day -1, subjects will get connected to a Holter 
ECG for 24 -hour measurements  and will continue these until the 
morning of Day 4. Only 24 -hour monitoring data from Day -1 
will be used for the baseline monitoring evaluation.  
Subjects will be randomized to a single SC injection of HM15211 
or placebo.  
On Day 1, the active study drug o r placebo, will be administered 
in the morning at approximately 08:00 hours (t=0), SC into the 
abdominal wall  by [CONTACT_114007]. Measurements of vital 
signs, PK and laboratory parameter will be performed for safety 
evaluation.  
ABPM and Holter ECG mo nitoring will be continued until the 
morning of Day [ADDRESS_1064262] time period for 24 -h 
monitoring period around PK peak. 
Subje cts will continue to stay in -house for safety evaluations and 
PK. They will be released from the clinical research unit (CRU) 
in the morning of Day 7 and will return for two outpatient visits 
on Day 10 and 17.  
Outpatient Visits:

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  4.0 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background  
Overweight has become an epi[INVESTIGATOR_774869] s the health of more than 1.9 
billion adults, of whom 650 million are obese, defined by a.  BMI of ≥ 30 kg/m2. This 
represents about 13% of the worlds adult population.[ADDRESS_1064275] s many organ systems. One affected system is  the cardiovascular system , 
including an increased prevalence of heart failure, hyperte nsion and coronary heart 
disease. Obstructive sleep apne a and asthma are al so common in the obese. Non -
alcoholic fatty liver disease  (NAFLD) , including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  (NASH) , 
is on the rise and may  become the leading cause of cirrhosis and h epatocellular 
carcinoma. Psychosocial and psychiatric consequences of obesity are also increasing .[ADDRESS_1064276] been developed that co-target the glucagon and glucagon like peptide  
(GLP -1) receptors  for obesity treatment .[ADDRESS_1064277] added 
a gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor ( GIPR ) agonist to the combination, are under 
development in early phase clinical studies . 
HM15211 is a novel long-acting triple incretin agonist . It is a chemical conjugate of a 
chimeric peptide (GLP -1/Glucagon/GIP triple agonist; named as TA15211) and human 
immunoglobulin G4 Fc fragment (named as HMC001) linked via a bifunctional 
Maleimide -Polyethylene glycol - Aldehyde (MAL -PEG -ALD) linker molecule.  
TA15211 is produced by [CONTACT_363662]15211 is controlled by 
[CONTACT_363663] -house specification. The HMC001 moiety was derived from the 
constant region of human immunoglobulin G4 fragment and produced in the transformed 
E. coli as an inclusion body. The inclusion body was purified after successive refolding 
and purification steps, and the quality of HMC001 was controlled by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -house 
specification. Human immunoglobulin G4 Fc fragment (HMC001 ) was chosen as the 
stabilizing agent because it is the most prevalent blood protein and has an in vivo half -life 
of several weeks without effector functions including antibody dependent cellular toxicity 
(ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).  The linker is a 10 kDa 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) with bifunctional reactive groups (maleimide aldehyde 
reactive groups at individual ends, MAL -PEG -ALD). The conjugation of TA15211 and 
HMC001 is carried out through the formation of a thioether and amine bo nd between 
hetero -bifunctional MAL -PEG -ALD, Cys40 in TA15211, and the N -terminal amino acid 
in HMC001.  
HM15211 is a long -acting GLP -1/Glucagon/GIP triple agonist with extended half -life 
through reduced renal clearance and possibly by [CONTACT_774888] r ecycling via FcRn 
binding. HM15211 showed triple -agonistic properties with potent glucagon activity in 
addition to balanced GLP -1 and GIP activity.  
According to series of in vivo pharmacologic studies, HM15211 can be an attractive 
treatment option for obese patients based on its potent body weight loss efficacy from 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  energy intake inhibition and energy expenditure enhancement. Glucagon activity 
provide s potent body weight loss primarily from fat mass reduction as shown in efficacy 
studies in diet-induced obesity ( DIO) mice. Furthermore, GLP -1/GIP activities negate a 
possible hyperglycemic risk as demonstrated in intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test 
(ipGTT ) studies in normal and DIO mice.  
Above all, liver preferential distribution, and following hepatic lipid metabolism 
improvement , renders HM15211 a suitable therapeutic option for NASH and hepatic 
fibrosis. Therefore, HM15211 is expected to have favo rable therapeutic profiles in both , 
obesity and NASH as well as convenience in its clinical dosing regimen.  
For further information please refer to the Investigator’s brochure (IB).  
4.[ADDRESS_1064278] -in-human, single ascending dose study is to investigate safety and 
tolerability of the drug as well as the PK profile in healthy obese subjects. Five cohorts of 
8 subjects will investigate the drug, and will include a placebo comparison in each cohort.  
Based on the pre -clinical data and existing research on the drug components/ drug class 
that exists in the public domain, as well as the proposed monitoring conditions of the 
proposed inpatient study, it is reasonable and appropriate to investigate the study drug in 
the inten ded potential target population. Healthy obese subjects will ensure that a robust 
and relevant set of safety and PK data can be generated to inform the design of 
subsequent clinical studies . 
4.[ADDRESS_1064279] be en conducted with HM15211.  
In vitro activity of HM15211 was evaluated using respective receptors, human GLP -1 
receptor ( hGLP -1R), human glucagon receptor ( hGlucagonR ), and human GIP receptor 
(hGIPR ). HM15211 showed dose -dependent activation of all three re ceptors with potent 
glucagon activity in addition to balanced GLP -[ADDRESS_1064280] avoiding hypergl ycemic risk.  
Further in vitro studies confirmed , that since HM15211 includes an aglycosylated Fc 
moiety derived from human IgG4, it shows minimal  immune -mediated effector functions. 
In addition, due to Fc moiety, HM15211 retained pH -dependent FcRn binding  property, 
which is essential for vascular endothelial recycling.  
In vivo pharmacology studies using obese mice showed that HM15211 enables potent 
body weight loss from both , food intake inhibition and enhanced energy expenditure. The 
body weight loss was mainly from fat mass reduction, along with lowered serum lipid 
profile. Glucagon action increased energy expenditure and thus enhanced body weight 
loss and hyperglycemic risk by [CONTACT_363665] -

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  (TG), oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Furthermore, HM15211 treated animals 
showed significant reduction in NAFLD activity score and hepatic fibrogenic markers , 
suggesting HM15211 as an effec tive pharmacotherapy for NASH with hepatic fibrosis.  
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted to evaluate the effects on the 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], central nervous systems and in vitro hERG channel assay. No 
significant effect was observed in the s afety pharmacology studies and in vitro  human  
ether -a go-go related gene ( hERG ) channel assay.  
In pharmacokinetic studies, HM15211 exhibited a prolonged half -life (t½) after 
subcutaneous ( SC) or intravenous ( IV) dosing, which ranged from approximately 42. [ADDRESS_1064281]. HM15211 is preferentially distributed in the 
liver, making HM15211 a favorable treatment option for dysfunction in  lipid metabolism 
specifically in the liver.  
The toxicity studies of HM15211, repeat dose toxicity up to 4 weeks in rats and monkeys , 
and in vitro genotoxicity studies, were conducted. Local tolerance of HM15211 was 
investigated in 4 -week repeated rat and monkey studies. Additional studies were 
conducted with HMC001 (inactive ingredient) in rat and monkey up to [ADDRESS_1064282] article -related findings at the injection sites were noted. No 
adverse events were observed in HMC001 studies.  
4.4 Rationale for Starting and Maximum Dose  
The proposed starting dose of HM15211  is 0.01mg/kg, selected ba sed on the results of 
the 28 days toxicology  assessments of HM15211 in monkeys and rats, and the application 
of an additional safety factor, as described  in Table 4-1 below .

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  The NOAEL was 0.4  mg/kg in rats and 2  mg/kg in monkeys. For conversion to a human 
equivalent dose (HED), these values were divided by 6.2 for rats and 3.1 for monkeys , 
resulting in a HED of 0.07 mg/kg  for rats and 0.7 mg/kg for monkeys.  The starting dose 
of 0.01  mg/kg in this clinical study is approximately 1/7th of the NOAEL for rats and 
1/70th of the NOAEL in monkey s during the 28 -day toxicity evaluation of HM15211 . 
Additionally, the starting dose of 0.01  mg/kg is between the ED 10 pharmacologically 
active dose for mice (0.013  mg/kg) and rats (0.007  mg/kg).5,6 
 
The maximum human dose is determined by [CONTACT_774885]  
4-week toxicology study in the ra t which corresponds to approximately 0.16 mg/kg in a 
human according to PK prediction. Dose escalation will be determined in safety review 
and dose escalation meeting by [CONTACT_774889].  
4.5 Dose Escalation Algorithm  
The proposed dose escalation algorithm for HM15211 may include the following steps:

Cohort 5  N=6 HM15211 ≤ 0.16 mg/kg  
N=[ADDRESS_1064283] will be randomized to HM15211 or placebo according to the table  above . 
The dose will be 0.01 mg/kg, based on the body weight measured prior to dosing.  For 
dose calculation and rounding, please refer to the Operational Manual/Pharmacy Manual.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd  
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1064284] 6 subjects (n ≥ 4 subjects  on active drug HM15211)  in each cohort  have 
completed at least Day 1 0, safety and available PK data will be reviewed and a dose  
decision/ dose  escalation decision for the subsequent cohort will be made by [CONTACT_774890]. Doses between cohorts will not exceed a 2-fold increase relative to 
the specified doses stated  in the Table 4 -3 above. Following the dose escalation decision, 
the procedures for the subsequent cohorts will be identical to those described above.  
Adjustments to the procedures /cohorts  may occur after the review of available safety and 
PK data:  
• Adjustments to the number of study cohorts may occur: Additional cohorts  may 
be enrolled and proceed at a higher or a lower dose. If deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_290164], there may be more than one cohort investigated at the 
same dose level.  
• Adjustments to the 24 -hr BP and HR monitoring: After the evaluation of t he first 
cohort, tests may be rescheduled, or measurement periods may be focused on 
specific days to capture the 24 -h measurement around the PK peak.  
• Adjustments to the visit schedule: If PK data suggest, additional sampling times 
and/or outpatient visits may be added to the study schedule.

Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1064286] -in-human, randomized, double -blind,  SAD study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of HM15211 as primary objectives  in healthy obese subjects.  
The study will be conducted in  five sequential cohorts  (cohort 1 to 5)  comprising a total 
of up to approximately [ADDRESS_1064287] (IP) or placebo in a 3:[ADDRESS_1064288] s (1 on 
active, 1 on placebo) and the remainder of the cohort  at least 24 hours apart. A minimum 
of 10-days between the start date of consecutive dose levels will be maintained. Based on 
available safety, tolerability, and PK data of each cohort, and following a safety review 
and dose escalation meeting between the investigator and the sponsor, dose escalation to 
the next cohort may proceed.  If dose escalation is stopped (please see dose escalation 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_246456]  6.4.1 ), dose de -escalation may occur in additional cohorts, to 
further refine clinically relevant dose levels.  
Each subject will undergo a screening visit, followed by [CONTACT_668944] -house/ treatment period 
per subject. Two additional outpatient visits will occur, prior to a final follow -up visit that 
will conclude subject study participation.  
The duration of subject participation in this study, including screening, treatment and 
follow -up will approximately be [ADDRESS_1064289] will undergo the following procedures during the study:  
Screening Visit:  
Before the screening takes place, potential subjects for the trial will be provided with 
written and oral information about the trial and the procedures involved. Subjects must 
sign the informed consent form  (ICF)  prior to entering the study. Please see section  9.1.[ADDRESS_1064290] dosing day, to 
identify eligible subjects for the study. All ass essments performed at the screening visit 
are stated in  Table 16-1 and will be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
Please see section 9.1.2  and 11.2 for further details.   
In-house Period:  
Subjects  will check in to the clinical research unit (CRU)  in the morning of Day -[ADDRESS_1064291] ECG will be performed. Subjects will be connected to an ABPM 
system for measurement of blood pressure ( BP), and measurements will be started 
overnight on Day -[ADDRESS_1064292]  as close to the drug administration as possible.  
On Day 1, after an ≥ [ADDRESS_1064293], subjects  will be dosed with HM15211or placebo 
at approximately 08:00 hours (t=0), through SC injection into the abdominal wall  by 
[CONTACT_114007]. Measurements of vital signs, ECG, blood sampling for PK and PD 
analys es, local injection site evaluation,  and laboratory parameter will be performed for 
safety evaluation , at timepoints  stated in  Table 16-1. 
ABPM and Holter ECG monitoring will be continued until the morning of Day [ADDRESS_1064294] time period for 24 -h monitoring period 
around PK peak. 
Subjects will continue to stay in -house for safety evaluations , PK and PD assessments . 
They will be released from the CRU in the morning of Day 7 and will return for two 
outpatient visits on Day 10 and 17.  
Outpatient Visit s: 
Subjects  will return to the CRU on Days 10 (± 1) and 17 (± 1) for two outpatient visits.  
Blood samples for PK and PD analys es will be collected , and additional safety 
assessments will be performed as stated in th e Table 16-1. 
Follow -up Visit:  
A Follow -up Visit will be performed on D ay 30 (± 2) for final safety procedures . Please 
see Table 16-1Schedule of Events  for details.  
Sampling and Assessment : 
Time points for study procedures and sample collection are specified in the Table 16-1. 
Safety assessments will occur throughout the duration of the study, including monitoring 
of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests ( eg, chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation , amylase, lipase  and urinalysis), vital signs measurements (blood pressure, 
heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and aural temperature), 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), 
ABPM, Holter ECG monitoring, and physical examinations.  
Local t olerability assessments will be perfor med by [CONTACT_363668]-points.  
Immunogenicity samples for assessment of  ADAbs , nAbs  and anti -PEG  will be taken 
prior to dosing , on Day [ADDRESS_1064295] . Enrollment criteria will favor the target 
population, as body mass index will be limited to ≥ 30 to ≤ 40 kg/m2. 
After PK modeling,  Cmax is expected to be reached approximately [ADDRESS_1064296] -in-human study , measurements for the assessment of cardiovascular events 
will start right after dosing and will continue until Day 4. After evaluation of the PK 
values in the initial cohort(s),  the moni toring period will be adjusted, to ensure that the 
24-h period around the PK peak is captured . 
The proposed PK endpoints are  well-established, commonly used parameters to 
characterize pharmacological profiles of drugs . For the PK endpoints, blood samples for 
determination of HM15211  will be analyzed using a validated assay . 
This is an exploratory study. No formal sample size calculation and no statistical 
hypothesis testing will be performed.  
The study will be conducted at a  specialized early phase research centre, where the 
subjects will be under supervision of physicians, research nurses and additional medical 
staff experienced in conducting early phase clinical studies investigating new metabolic 
compounds.

must have a negative urine  hCG pregnancy test at check -in to in-house periods . 
Males must be surgically sterile (at least [ADDRESS_1064328] vasectomy), abstinent or if engaged 
in sexual relations of child -bearing potential, the subject and his partner must be using an 
acceptable contraceptive method from screening and for a period of [ADDRESS_1064329] 
Follow -up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception are the use of condoms together 
with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository.  In addition, they must be advised not 
to donate sperm during this period. Male subjects must also encou rage their female 
partner to use effective contraception. Effective contraceptive for the female partner 
includes surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], 
bilateral oophorectomy), hormonal contraception, intrauterine  contraception/device, or 
barrier methods (female condom, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap) together with 
spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ suppository.  The adequacy of other methods of 
contraception will be assessed on a case -by-case basis by [CONTACT_079].

congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious 
adver se event . 
9.1.11  ECG Procedure   
All ECG’s throughout this  study will be performed as  standard triplicate 12-lead ECG ’s, 
except the ECG at Screening. ECG’s will be recorded after 5 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. Only the Triplicate ECG’s will be recorded at least 1 minute apart from each 
other, not exceeding a time period of 5 minutes for the completion of all three ECG’s.  
The Investigator (or designee) will interpret the ECG’s by [CONTACT_352428]: within normal limits, abnormal but not 
clinically significant, or abnormal with clinical significance. ECG’s are perfor med 
according to the Table 16-1. The following parameters will be recorded from the 
subject’s ECG trace: heart rate, QT interval, PR interval, QRS inte rval, R -R interval, and 
QTcF (corrected).  
The Investigator will be responsible for assessing the accuracy of the electronic QTc 
interval recording using Fridericia correction formula  
• Fridericia correction: QTcF = QT ÷ cube root of the R -R interval (where R -R is 
the duration of the entire cardiac cycle)  
When ECGs are to be collected at the same time point as a blood collection, ECGs should 
be collected first to avoid any artificially increased heart rates due to the blood collection.  
ECG measurement s are to  be collected during screening  and on Day -2 before subjects 
are connected to the ABPM  device . Additionally, ECG measurements are taken on Day 
4, after ambulatory devices (Holter and ABPM) are removed, and Days 5, 7, 10, 17 and 
30. 
In some cases, it may be  appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs. If a machine -read QTc 
value is prolonged, repeat measurements may not be necessary if the Investigator’s 
interpretation determines that the QTc value is in the acceptable range.  
9.1.12  Check -in Procedure  
All subjects will che ck in to the clinic in the morning for the In -house  Period. The 
following will be assessed:  
1. Alcohol breath test.  
2. Urine drug screen.  
3. Urine pregnancy test.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd  
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1064332] 12 hours.  
5. Any medical condition that could interfere with glucose metabolism, as judged by [CONTACT_3786].  
Subjects who fulfill one or more of the stated criteria at check –in, will not be able to 
continue onto the treatment period. The tre atment period will be rescheduled. Each 
treatment period may be rescheduled no more than twice. After that, the subject will be 
excluded from the study. Replacement of subjects for the dosing period may be permitted 
to enroll sufficient subjects into the s tudy after discussion with Sponsor and Investigator.  
9.1.13  Standardized Meals  
During in -house period, subjects will receive standardized meals.  The standardized 
weight maintaining meals will be provided using estimated BMR × activity factor of 1.[ADDRESS_1064333] -dose assessment period will start in the morning of Day 1.  Measurements will 
be taken hourly up to 14 hours and then 2 -hourly  until 24 hours every day (for every 24 -
hour period), until the morning of Day 4.  
Time points stated  in the  Table 16-1. Adequate cuff size will be documented for each 
subject, after determination of the patient’s non -dominant arm circum ference.  Subject’s 
bedtime and awakening will be recorded to divide the downloaded data into diurnal and 
nocturnal values.  Depending on available PK and safety data, timepoints for 
measurements may be adjusted for the following cohorts.  
Specifications abou t the ABPM model  will be described in the Op erational  Manual  and 
ABPM Procedure Manual, a s well as detailed instructions of blood pressure  frequency ,

The local reaction from the injection site, the insertion site, and the adhesive will be 
evaluated quantitatively using a Draize scale or similar scale. If an injection site reaction 
like pain on palpation, itching, erythema, edema, induration is observed, it must be 
recorded as an AE and then will be evaluated using the following scale:  
 Erythema will be evaluated as follows:    
•  0 – No erythema  
•  1 – Very slight erythema (barely perceptibl e)  
•  2 – Well -defined erythema  
•  3 – Moderate to severe erythema  
•  4 – Severe erythema (beet redness) to slight eschar formations (injuries in 
depth)  
Edema will be evaluated as follows:  
•  0 – No edema  
•  1 – Very slight edema (barely perceptible)  
•  2 – Slight edema (edges of area well defined by [CONTACT_363681] )  
•  3 – Moderate edema (raised approximately 1 mm)

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  •  4 – Severe edema (raised more than 1 mm and extending beyond the area 
of exposure)  
For the irritation assessment, all irritation events will be documented as AEs. The 
diameter of the affected area will be measured with a paper measuring tape in centimeter 
(cm) and the condition of the injection site will be recorded. Digital photography will be 
used to document all positive injection site reactions. In case of clinically significant 
injection site reactions, subjects may undergo a dermatological consultation and/or 
cutaneous biopsies for further histological examination of the injection s ite reaction. 
Biopsies will be performed using a 4 -mm punch biopsy centered on the injection site. 
The biopsy area will be anesthetized with lidocaine prior to the biopsy. Wound closure 
will be performed with Steristrips. If stitches are necessary to close  the punch area, they 
will be removed approximately 2 weeks later. The time between injection and biopsy will 
be recorded. Microscopic and histological examination of the punch biopsies will be 
performed at a qualified lab.  
9.1.20  Blood Volume  
Total blood samplin g volume for subjects will approximately be 370 mL.  
Even in case of further unexpected blood sampling , extension of blood sampling period  
or necessary retesting,  sampling volume will increase to approximately  400 mL.

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse E vent (AE)  
An AE is any undesirable and unintended medical event occurring to a subject in a 
clinical study, whether or not related to the study products. This includes events from the 
first study related activity after the subject has signed the informed c onsent and until post 
treatment follow -up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be 
recorded as AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at 
screening:  
• Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which th e procedure was planned 
has worsened from the first study related activity after the subject has signed the 
informed consent  
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures  
• Pre-existing events that has not worsened in intensity or frequency from baseline  
10.1.2  Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE)  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any clinically significant event not 
present before exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsens in either 
intensity or frequen cy after exposure to study drug.  
10.1.3  Clinical Laboratory Event  
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that suggests 
a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active management, 
(i.e. change of d ose, discontinuation of study  product, more frequent follow -up, or 
diagnostic investigation).  
A laboratory re -test and/or continued mon itoring of an abnormal value is  not considered 
an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for verification, 
evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention.  
10.1.4  Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event ca used by a drug. Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the 
drug caused the event.  
10.1.5  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction is defined as a subset of any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the  drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND 
safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd  
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential  Page 59 of 77 
Protocol No. HM -TRIA -101 
 
Version 4.0_06Apr2018  relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected advers e reaction 
implies a l ower  degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means 
any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Reasonable possibility is given if:  
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated  with drug exposure  
• One or more occur rences of an event , that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug  
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study  that indicat es 
those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurr ent or 
historical control group.  
10.1.6  Unexpected Adverse Event/ Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected  adverse 
reaction that is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or  Protocol , as occurring with a 
class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are 
not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug un der investigation, or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Investigator 
Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described 
in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application.  
10.1.7  Serious Adverse Event ( SAE )/ Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death . 
2. Is life threatening.  
• The term “life threatening” refers to an event in whic h the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869].   
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
5. Leads to a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
6. Is an important medical event  that satisfies any of the following:  
• May require intervention to prevent items 1 through 5 above.  
• May expose the subject t o danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].

Protocol No. HM -TRIA -101 
 
Version 4.0_06Apr2018  10.1.8  Life-Threatening Adverse Event /Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reaction  
A life -threatening AE/life -threatening suspected adverse reaction , in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, places the patient or suspect at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
The determination of whether an AE is life threatening can be based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_58901]. If either, the Sponsor or investigator believes that the event is 
serious or life threatening, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_774899] r eporting (21 CFR 312.32(a) and 312.32(c)(1)).  
10.2 Severity  of AEs 
The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows:  
Mild:  The event is transient,  easily tolerated by [CONTACT_774900]’s daily activities . 
Moderate:  The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s 
usual daily activities.  
Severe:  The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with 
the subject’s usual activities.  
10.3 Relationship to Study Treatment  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug (s) will be assessed by [CONTACT_97728]-Investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions:  
1= Related : 
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study  product administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., 
disease under study , concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications).  
 
The AE follows a reasonable temp oral sequence from the investiga tional  product 
administration, and represents a known reaction to the drug under study  or other drugs in 
its class, or is predicted by [CONTACT_363684].  
 
The AE resolves with discontinuation of the investigational product and/or recu rs with 
rechallenge, if applicable.  
 
2 = Not Related : 
The AE does not follow a re asonable temporal sequence from investigational product 
administration, or can be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other 
factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases , and concomitant medications).  
 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd  
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential  Page 61 of 77 
Protocol No. HM -TRIA -101 
 
Version 4.0_06Apr2018  3= Not Assessable/ Not Classifiable:  
 The AE cannot be judged because of insufficient or contradictory information. The AE 
cannot be supplemented or verified.  
10.[ADDRESS_1064336] ing of AEs 
Collection of all AEs (serious AEs and non -serious AEs) will commence from the time 
the subject signs the informed consent to participate in the study  until the post -treatment 
follow -up visit . Throughout the in -house treatment period , the Investigator  will assess 
whether any subjective AEs have occurred. In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, a non -
specific  question, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” may be 
asked. Subjects may report AEs occurring at a ny other time during the  study.  
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study 
medication or not, must be monitored and given appropriate medical treatment at the 
discretion and judgement of the Investigator until the symptoms subside and a ny 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is 
a satisfactory explanation for th e changes observed. All  AEs will be documented in the 
AE page of the CRF , whether or not the Investigator  concludes that the ev ent is related to 
the drug treatment.  The event term, start and stop dates , severity, action taken with study 
drug and outcome, will be documented, along with the Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_363646].  
10.4.2  Collection and Reporting of SAEs  
When an SAE occurs , it should be reported according to the following procedure:  
An SAE f orm must be completed  immediately or within [ADDRESS_1064337] identification numb er, Investigator’s name, name [CONTACT_363699] a c ausality assessment.  
In the inter est of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs 
(regardless of their relationship to study drug) should be reported to the Sponsor or a 
designated qualified vendor within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first knowledge of th e 
event.  
The collection of SAEs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent form and 
stop at the end of the subject’s follow -up period. An  Initial Serious Adverse Event Form 
should be completed , and a copy should be faxed to the Sponsor or designated qualified 
vendor . 
All serious and unexpected adverse event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR 312.32 for 
IND drugs and 21 CFR 314.80 for marketed drugs (15 -day alerts). The Institutional 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical  Co., Ltd  
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_1064338](IRB) and all Investigators will be notified of the alert reports per FDA 
regulations.

Possible anticipated, adverse effects from the study procedure are:  
Risks related to repeated blood draws  
Subjects will participate in several blood draws throughout the course of the study which 
have the potential to cause a v enous line -vasovagal response, bruising, tenderness, and

10.6 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
All AEs  should b e followed up and subjects will be rendered appropriate medical care 
and treatment at the discretion of the I nvestigator until resolution or until the Investigator 
and Sponsor concludes that “further follow -up is not necessary”. If the AE has not 
resolved by [CONTACT_7620] -treatment follow -up visit, the stop date will be recorded as 
“ongoing.”  
All SAEs should be follow ed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the event or 
until the Investigator  and S ponsor judge that fur ther follow -up is not necessary . 
If information is not available at the time of the first report and becomes available later, 
the Investigator  shou ld complete a follow -up SAE form at the earliest possible or provide 
other written documentation and fax it immediately within 24 hours of receipt  of 
information to the Sponsor or designee . Copi[INVESTIGATOR_363647] (e .g., ECGs, l aboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be 
sent accordingly.  
All other non -serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is 
“recovering” (for chronic conditions), or “recovered” , or until the end of the post -
treatment f ollow -up stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries 
related to these AE’s have been resolved.  
10.6.1  Safety Reporting to  IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities  
The Sponsor  or designated qualified vendor will be responsible for reportin g all 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and any other applicable 
SAEs to regulatory authorities, Investigator s, and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in 
accordance with national regulations in the countries where the study is conducted.  
Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the Sponsor  or 
Sponsor ’s designee, S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_1064340] a copy of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC 
in accordance with national regulations.

Version 4.0_06Apr2018  11.0 DATA HANDLING  AND MANAGEMENT  
Clinical Data Management (CDM), including CRF data, is the  responsibility of  
ProSciento. With permission of the Sponsor, CDM may be delegated under an agreement 
of transfer of responsibilities to a qualified vendor of ProSciento.   
11.1 Data Management  
The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented  in the Data 
Management Plan (DMP).  
AEs and medical history will be coded using the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Concomitant medications will be coded 
using the World Health Organization (WHO) WHO Drug  Global .  
Unique numbers will identify the subject and the biological material obtained from the 
subject. Appropriate measures such as encryption or deletion will be enforced to protect 
the identity of human subjects in all presentations and publications as requi red by 
[CONTACT_5737]/regional/national requirements.  
Data from screening failures will not be entered into the database.  
Laboratory data from the central laboratory will be electronically transferred to 
ProSciento for database reconciliation purposes. The electron ic laboratory data will be 
considered source data. In cases where sensitive non -PK laboratory data is transferred via 
non-secure electronic networks, data will be encrypted during transfer.  
The laboratory will provide one copy of the laboratory reports to the CRU staff. The st aff 
will receive all laboratory data electronically or based on FAX reports directly from the 
laboratory. An Investigator must review, evaluate, sign and date the laboratory print -outs 
upon receipt. The signed print -out of the laborato ry reports are source data.  
All other results, including PK, PD data, and laboratory tests will be transferred 
electronically to the responsible Data Management Unit.   
11.2 CRFs (Electronic)  
11.2.1  Clinical  Data Management Workflow  
Electronic CRFs will be developed by [CONTACT_774901] , in collaboration with the 
clinical study team at ProSciento and statistician. CDM will document the process 
workflow in the DMP. After data entry, monitor(s) will source data verify (SDV) the 
eCRFs a gainst the source documents. Queries may be issued to clarify the data entered. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_363648] , all queries 
have been resolved  and all external data has been reconciled with the eCRF data.  If 
corrections and/or resolution of queries are required after PI [INVESTIGATOR_352379], those eCRFs 
affected by [CONTACT_352436] -signed by [CONTACT_978]. The database may be locked after the PI

created and will be provided to the Sponsor , if requested . 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1064341] safety assessments will be entered from source 
documentation into eCRFs. Instructions for data entry will be provid ed in the eCRF 
Completion Guidelines, developed by [CONTACT_774901] . All staff involved with 
entering data into the eCRFs will be trained prior to gaining access to the study database . 
11.2.3  Corrections to eCRFs  
Queries may be generated by [CONTACT_774902], and queries may be 
generated by [CONTACT_352438], monitors, and other data reviewers during the course of the 
study. Only specific CRU personnel will be authorized to make corrections to the eCRFs; 
CDM will train personnel prior to granting access in the eCRF system. Corrections will 
be made directly in the eCRF – by [CONTACT_352439], adding new data, or deleting 
data, as appropriate. All data corrections will be logged in the electronic audit trail.  
11.2.4  PI [INVESTIGATOR_774877]’s authorized staff must ensure that all information 
derived from source documentation is consistent with the source information and 
accurately reflected in the eCRFs. By [CONTACT_363686], the Investigator 
confirms that the i nformation is complete and correct.  
11.[ADDRESS_1064342] 15 years from the study closure or longer in accordance with  local regulation and 
applicable regulatory authority guidelines, and the study sponsor will be notified prior to 
destruction of study records.  
Current FDA guidelines require records to be retained for a period of 2 years following 
the date a marketing app lication is approved for the drug, for the indication for which it is 
being investigated. If no application is filed or if the application for the investigated 
indication is not approved, documents will be kept until 2 years after the investigation is 
discontinued and the FDA is notified. It is the sponsor’s responsibility to inform 
ProSciento as to when essential documents are no longer needed to be retained .

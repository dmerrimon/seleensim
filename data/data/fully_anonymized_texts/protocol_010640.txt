 Background and Significance  
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34251] a P2Y [ADDRESS_95126] of care for the long -term secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events  in patients with 
acute coronary syndrome  (ACS)  or undergoing percuta neous coronary intervention (PCI)  [1]. 
Moreover antiplatelet therapy is commonly used in patients with other atherothrombotic  disease 
manifestations, such as stroke and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87233] P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor and is the only agent of this class currently recommended in patients 
with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing PCI , and for the treatment of stroke or PAD  
[2]. Although the efficacy of DAPT with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87234], rates of ischemic recurrences remain elevated  despi[INVESTIGATOR_87235] , especially in high risk patients  [1,3]. This has been in part attributed to the high  
interindividual variability in respons es to clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]  [3,4]. Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87236] a pro -drug which 
requires a two -step metabolic transformation to exert its antiplatelet effect . Pharmacodynamic (PD) 
studies have shown that approxi mately 30 -40% of patients experience  high on-treatment platelet 
reactivity (HPR) while receiving clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87237]  [3,4]. Importantly HPR status has been 
strongly associated with an increased risk of ischemic events, in particular stent thrombosis, in 
patients with ACS and following PCI  [4]. This underscores the need for strategies aimed to reduce 
HPR rates in patients treated with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. Several factors (clinical, cellular, and genetic) have 
been associated with HPR on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] [ 3,4]. Among these, genetic polymorphisms of the hepatic  
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 gene, the enzyme involved in both metabolic steps of transformation 
of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87238] -drug into its active metabolite, have shown to affect clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87239] [ 3,4]. In particular, t he *2 and *3 loss-of-function 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/2018  
3 
 (LOF) allelic variants confer loss of enzyme function, which leads to attenuated clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87240], lower platelet inhibition and wors e outcomes [ 3,4]. 
Multiple approaches have been advocated to reduce HPR rates. Intui tively, the use of the 
more potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor represent potential treatment options 
[1]. However, their increased costs and risk of bleeding complications compared with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87241] [ 1]. The pleiotropic effects associated with lipid 
lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], in particular statins, have been subject to extensive research [ 5]. In a previous 
study we showed that treatment with high -dose atorvastatin in addition to double -dose clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87242] -dose clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87243] -naïve 
patients with stable CAD and HPR [6]. To date, the exact biological mechanisms involved in the 
statin modulation of platelet function are not ful ly understood, a lthough likely attributed to both its 
lipid-lowering and non -lipid-related effects [ 7,8]. In fact, t here is increasing evidence that 
circulating lipoproteins affect platelet function. In particular, LDL, VLDL, and especially oxidized 
LDL  are atherogenic lipoproteins and increase platelet activation  [9]. Also, familial 
hypercholesterolaemia is associated with increased platelet activity, such as hyperaggregability, and 
the application of a lipid -lowering drug resulted in a reduction of pla telet reactivity [10]. 
Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody targeting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 
9 (PCSK9) that is administered subcutaneously  (s.c.)  at a dosage of 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 
mg once monthly  [11]. In clinical trials in pat ients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], evolocumab was more effective than placebo and/or ezetimibe in reducing LDL 
cholesterol, includi ng when added to statin therapy  [11-13]. Importantly, in an exploratory analysis , 
the use of evol ocumab plus standard therapy, as compared with standard therapy alone, significantly 
reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events  [13]. Whether the reduction in cardiovascular events 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/[ADDRESS_95127] of 
investigation . Although LDL reduction with statin therapi[INVESTIGATOR_87244], to date the effects on platelet aggregation of adjunctive lipid lowering with 
evolocumab  has not been explored.  
 
Study aims  
The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of evolocumab in addition 
to statin therapy on platelet reactivity in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular d isease  
(ASCVD ) while on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87237] . Secondary aims will include the effects on cholesterol 
levels.

Research Design  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/2018  
6 
 The proposed investigation will be a prospective , randomized , parallel -design , double -blind , 
placebo -controlled,  PD study conducted in patients with ASCVD  and HPR (PRU>208) or NPR  
(PRU 85 -208) on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] . Patients with low platelet reactivity (PRU<85) will be excluded given 
that their distribution p rofile of platelet reactivity would be unlikely to unravel a  platelet inhibitory 
treatment effect of evolucomab . The study will be performed at the University of [LOCATION_012] Health 
Science Center at UF Health Jacksonville - Division of Cardiology. Patients wil l be recruited in the 
Cardiology Clinics of our institution and will be screened by [CONTACT_8288], who will 
verify that all candidates meet inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results from blood tests performed 
within the last 90 days will be con sidered valid for screening purposes. If these are not available, a 
blood sample will be collected for the screening phase.  
After providing written informed consent, patients meeting study entry criteria will be 
randomly assigned to receive either evolocumab 420 mg s.c. or placebo ( 0.9% sodium chloride s.c. 
injection) . Blood sampling for PD testing will be conducted at 3 time-points: baseline , and 14 ±2 
days and 30±[ADDRESS_95130] ed before the morning dose of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] , in order to measure trough levels of platelet 
inhibition. During study treatment major adverse cardiac events (death, MI, stroke, and urgent 
revascularization proce dures) and serious adverse events (bleeding and other adverse events) will be 
collected . A flow diagram of the study design is illustrated below.

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/[ADDRESS_95131] 2 -4 mL of blood will be discarded to avoid spontaneous plat elet activation. Blood sampling 
will be performed at 3 time points as indicated above in the study design section. Various PD assays 
will be performed as described below : 
 
1. VerifyNow P2Y12  
2. Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA)  
3. Thrombelastograph Coagulatio n Analyzer TEG 6s Series system (CORA® system)  
 
Description of laboratory assays  
 
1) VerifyNow (VN) P2Y12 : The VerifyNow System is a turbidimetric based optical detection 
system which measures platelet induced aggregation as an increase in light transmittance 
(Accumetrics, San Diego, CA) and will be utilized according to manufacturer’s instructions, as 
previo usly described [14]. The assay is based on microbead agglutination and uses specific reagents 
for the pathways of interest. The VN -P2Y12 assay, by [CONTACT_8293]+PGE1, measures changes in 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/2018  
8 
 platelet function specific to P2Y12 receptor inhibitors. The assay is  based upon the ability of 
activated platelets to bind fibrinogen. Fibrinogen -coated microparticles aggregate in proportion to 
the number of GP IIb/IIIa receptors expressed. Microbead aggregation is more rapid and 
reproducible if platelets are activated; t herefore the reagents are incorporated into the assay channel 
to induce platelet activation without fibrin formation. Light transmittance increases as activated 
platelets bind and aggregate fibrinogen -coated beads. The instrument measures this change in 
optical signal and reports results in P2Y12 Reaction Units (PRU). HPR will be defined as PRU>208  
and NPR  as PRU 85 -208 [4]. 
2) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) : Platelet aggregation will be performed using LTA 
according to standard protocols. Blood wil l be collected in citrated (3. 2%) tubes. LTA will be 
assessed using platelet rich plasma (PRP) by [CONTACT_8294] a 2 -channel aggregometer 
(Chrono -Log 490 Model, Chrono -Log Corp., Havertown) as previously described [14]. Platelet 
agonists will include arachidonic acid ( AA, 1 mM), collagen (3µg/ml), ADP (5 and 20 µM), TRAP 
(15 μM) . PRP will be obtained as a supernatant after centrifugation of citrated blood at 1000 rpm 
for 10 minutes. The isolated PRP will be kept at 37° C before use. Platelet po or plasma (PPP) will 
be obtained by a second centrifugation of the blood fraction at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. Light 
transmission will be adjusted to 0% with the PRP and to 100% for the PPP for each measurement. 
Curves will be recorded for 6 minutes and pla telet aggregation will be determined as the maximal 
percent change (MPA) in light transmittance from baseline using PPP as a reference.  HPR will be 
defined as MPA with 20 µM ADP > 59% and MPA with 5 µM ADP > 46% [4]. 
3) TEG 6s Series system (CORA® system) : the TEG 6s system (Haemonetics Corporation, 
Braintree, MA, [LOCATION_003]) will be used according to manufacture instructions [15]. In brief, the CORA® 
system is a new generation portable thrombelastography technology able to evaluate all phases of 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/[ADDRESS_95132] received platelet inhibiting dru gs. The 
PlateletMappi[INVESTIGATOR_8264] a set of agonists, ADP and AA platelet agonists together with 
ActivatorF, which can measure the inhibition of platelet function. This assay specifically determines 
the MA (Maximum Amplitude, a measure of clot strength) and the reduction in MA due to 
antiplatelet therapy and reports it  as a percentage of reduction in clot strength. The assay uses AA 
and ADP agonists to generate test results that reflect the inhibiting effects of antiplatelet agents such 
as TxA2 Inhibitors (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) and ADP P2Y 12 inhibitors (e.g., clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]). Sin ce thrombin 
(present in blood samples) is the primary and most potent activator of platelets, its activity must be 
inhibited with heparin so that the platelet activating effects of ADP and AA can be measured. Since 
thrombin has been rendered inactive by [CONTACT_87254], activatorF is used to replace thrombin’s role in the 
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa. Thus, with this cross -linked fibrin 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/[ADDRESS_95133] provides 
measures of R (Reaction time; the amount of time between the start of the test and the beginning of 
coagulation), K (the speed of formation of the clot from R time to a specific clot strength), Angle 
(the speed of clot  strengthening), LY30 (Percent lysis 30 minutes after MA is finalized) and MA 
parameters; The activatorF test provides the contribution of fibrin to the overall strength of the clot.  
This test value is used in the calculation of aggregation/inhibition for  MA ADP and MA AA . The 
AA and ADP test provide measures of MA, percent inhibition and percent aggregation.  HPR will be 
defined as MA ADP > 47 mm [15]. 
 
Genetic testing  
 Spartan RX rapid genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : Spartan RX (Spartan Bioscience Inc., Ontario, Canada) is t he 
rapid genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_87246]2C19 (*1,*2,*3,*17) allele status wi thin 1 hour  [16]. 
This test consists  of four separate steps intended to be done in less than 8 minutes: acquisition of a 
buccal swab; insertion of the swab into the cartridge ; insertion of the reaction solution into the 
device; and analysis of CYP2C19 genotype triggered b y a button on the device . 
 
Lipid profile and PCSK9 levels  
Blood for the evaluation of the effects on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_87247]. Cholesterol measures will include a standard lipid profile  
and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] , which  will be measured by [CONTACT_87255] 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/[ADDRESS_95134] protocols.  At each time point, blood samples s amples will also be stored for 
measurement of PCSK9 serum levels and for possible future analyses . PCSK9 levels will be 
measured by [CONTACT_6431]  [17].  
 
Study endpoints and sample size calculation  
The primary end point of our study is the reduction in platelet reactivity, as defined by [CONTACT_60487], 
between evolocumab and placebo at 30 days after randomization  in each cohort . We hypothesize 
that evolocumab therapy will be associated with a reduction of 30 PRU  in patients with HPR  and 
NPR . The rationale for considering a reduction of 30 PRU is because  this value approximates that 
observed with more intense lipid lower therapy using statin therapy [18]. Statistical assumptions 
were derived for each cohort of patients based on  distribution of their PRU levels  from a cohort of 
subjects on maintenance clopi[INVESTIGATOR_60469] (HPR: 247 ± 29 ; NPR : 150 ± 35 ). In patients with 
HPR, 17 patients per group (34 total)  are needed to detect a 30 PRU difference with 80% power . In 
NPR patients, 23 patient s per group (46 total) are needed to detect a 30 PRU difference with 80% 
power . Therefore, u nder the assumption of a 30 PRU  reduction with evolocumab compared with 
placebo  in each cohort , 80% power and α of 0.05 , 80 total  patients with a valid primary end point 
will be needed . Considering a possible dropout rate of 10%, up to 90 patients will need to be 
randomized. We anticipate that up to 500  patients will need to be scree ned to reach our sample size. 
Given the absence of preliminary studies exploring the effects of PCSK9 inhibitors on platelet 
aggregation the expected reduction in PRU  was arbitrarily defined.  
Other endpoints will  include the comparisons between evolocumab  and placebo  of all PD 
parameters measured by [CONTACT_87256] , and of cholesterol levels at each time point . Exploratory 
analyses will assess the differential response to evolocumab treatment according to the presence of 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/2018  
12 
 LOF genetic polymorphism s as well a s the levels of PCSK9 . We will also investigate different 
response profiles in patients with and without aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
 
 
Statistical analysis plan  
Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Continuous 
variables will be presented as  mean ± SD  or median [IQR] . An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
method with a general linear model will be used to evaluate the primary end point as well as all 
between -groups comparisons of platelet reactivity, cholesterol levels and HS -CRP.  The Fisher’s 
exact test or Pearson’s chi square test will be used to evaluate t comparisons of HPR and NPR rates 
between groups.  
A 2-tailed p value of < 0.05 will be  considered to indicate a statistically significant 
difference for all the above  analyses. Sta tistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_87257] 
v22.0 sof tware (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL).  
 
Publication Strategy/Additional Information   
Study subjects will be identified first (months 1 -24): we expect to enroll 3-4 subjects 
monthly and complete enrollment in 24 months (total: 90 subjects randomized ). Month 25 will be 
implied for statistical analysis and months 26-27 for manuscript preparation. We intend to present 
data at a major scientific meeting at completion of the study.  
 
Possible Discomforts and Risk  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/[ADDRESS_95135] commonly reported adverse events with evolocumab included 
nasopharyngitis (4.0% of evolocumab recipi[INVESTIGATOR_87248]. 3.9% of controls), arthralgia (1.8 % vs. 1.6%), 
myalgia (2.0% vs. 1.8%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] i nfection (2.1 % vs. 2.2%), back pain (2.3 % vs. 
2.2%), and nausea (1.8 % vs. 1.2 %). Injection -site reactions were reported in 3.3 % of evolocumab 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 3.0 % of controls. Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of evolocumab -
treated and placebo -treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash 
(1.0% vs. 0.5% for evolocumab and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% vs. 0.2%), erythema 
(0.4% vs. 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% vs. 0.1%)  [19]. 
All clinical events described above,  if they were to occur, as well as death, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and urgent revascularization procedure with PCI or coronary artery by[CONTACT_87258]. Clinical events will be evaluated by a local committee, comprised of 2 
faculty mem bers (2 cardiologists), not directly involved in the research. In the event of a report of a 
serious adverse event , the local committee will meet and treatment management will be managed 
accordi ng to physician recommendation.  
 
Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any unintended or undesirable experience that occurs during the course 
of the clinical investigation whether or not it is considered to be therapy related.  This includes any 
newly occurring event or previous condition that has increase d in severity or frequency since the 
initiation of study treatment.  Adverse events will be followed until resolution while the patient 
remains on -study.  Once the patient is removed from study, events thought to be related to the study 
therapy will be fol lowed until resolution or until the patient starts a new treatment regimen.  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/2018  
14 
 Serious Adverse Events (SAE): An adverse event occurring while on study that results in 
any of the following outcomes:  
- Death  
- A life -threatening adverse experience.  
- A persiste nt or significant disability, incapacity, or is  a congenital anomaly, or birth  
defect.  
- Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
All SAEs will be collected, recorded and reported, whether or not considered causally  related to the 
study drug, or to the study procedure(s).  Study related SAE is defined as SAE occurring while on 
study and considered  related (reasonable possibility that the study treatment caused the adverse 
experience) to the study treatment . 
The defin ition of serious adverse event also includes ‘important medical event’.  Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate 
in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immedi ately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8266]/or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These 
should also usually be considered se rious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug depende ncy or drug abuse.  
All suspected unexpec ted serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) related or possibly related to 
evolocumab and their follow -up reports will be reported to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours of submission to 
the regulatory agency, IRB or IEC. A copy of any safety report involving an [COMPANY_010] drug ( e.g. 
evolocumab) submitted to the regulatory agency, IRB or IEC, will be faxed to [COMPANY_010], within 24 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   Version 10/17/2018  
15 
 hours of such submission. All pregnancies and pregnancies occurring in the partner of a patient 
participating in the study will be reported within 10 calenda r days of Investigator’s awareness.  
 
Possible benefits  
The present investigation is aimed to evaluate the PD effects of evolocumab  as an add -on 
therapy to standard antiplatelet treatment  in patients with CAD . This study is not designed to 
evaluate differences in clinical benefit. However, differences in antiplatelet profiles may potentially 
prompt further investigation s of the clinical implication of this difference by [CONTACT_3553] a larger scale 
clinical study.

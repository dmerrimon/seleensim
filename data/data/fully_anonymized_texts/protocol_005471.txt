Page 7 Study Design This will be an open-label, randomized, 2-part study in adult smokers.  
All subjects will participate in both study parts. Part  2 will begin 
immediately after Part  1. 
Screening procedures will be performed within 28  days prior to study 
procedures on Day -2. 
Subjects who successfully complete the screening procedures and 
meet the eligibility criteria will be eligible to check in to the clinical 
research uni t (CRU ) on Day -2 and will complete all subjective effects 
questionnaires for the purpose of familiarization with the questions, scales, and computerized tablet.  Subjects will also participate in a 
brief trial on Day  -2 (approximately 30 minutes) using the myblu™ 
device with a 0% nicotine e -liquid, to familiar ize with the use of the 
device.  Baseline study assessments , including BoE, BoPH, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
(Day  -1 only) , BP, HR, and puff topography  (in a subset of 16 subjects 
[2 subjects from each sequence in Part 1] on Day -1 only ) will be 
performed on Days  -[ADDRESS_285399] use on Day 1. Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 8  sequences 
(Part  1) on Day -1. 
Part 1 (Days  1 to 9) 
On Days 1, 3, 5, and 7, subjects will use the study product they are assigned to use the following day according to the randomization scheme. Subjects will use the assigned study product ad libitum  until 
the start of the abstinence period (i.e., at least [ADDRESS_285400] use session on the next day). A fully charged battery and a fresh pod will be provided on each day. Additional pods will be provided as needed. Pods will be weighed within [ADDRESS_285401] use on each day.
 On 
Day 1, puff topography measurements will be performed in the same 
subset of 16 subjects (2  subjects from each sequence in Part  1) for 
[ADDRESS_285402] use. Puff topography should be 
performed withi n ± [ADDRESS_285403] (controlled) product use 
session, subjects will use the assigned study product under controlled conditions (i.e., 10 puffs taken at 30 -second intervals, with puffs 
3 seconds in duration). Blood samples for nicotine pharmacokinetic 
(PK) assessment will be collected prior to and for [ADDRESS_285404]

and Future Intent to Use questionnaires following the first product use 
session . Following collection of the last PK blood sample (180- minute 
time point) and completion of the subjective effects questionnaires, subjects will start the second ( ad libitum ) product use session , during 
which they will use the same assigned study product  ad libitum  (with 
no limits on puff duration or inter -puff interval ) until approximately 
23:00. Subjects will complete the Urge to Smoke, Product Liking, PES, and Future Intent to Use questionnaire s at least [ADDRESS_285406] use session . On Day  8, puff 
topography measurements will be performed in the same subset of 
16 subjects (2  subjects from each sequence in Part  1) for 1  hour during 
the second  (ab libitum ) product use session. Puff topography will be 
performed at least 4  hours after the start of the second ( ab libitum ) 
product use session and should be within ±  2 hours of the time of the 
baseline assessment on Day  -1.  
On Day  9, subjects may  use all or any of the  4 study products (used 
previously on Days  1 to 8) ad libitum  until approximately 23:00. For 
BoE and BoPH assessments, b lood samples will be collected on Day  9 
and urine samples will be collected over 24  hours (starting on Day 8 
after completion of the second [ ab libitum ] product use session ). BP 
and HR measurements  will be taken  throughout the period of 
ad libitum  product use. Subjects will complete the Questionnaire on 
Smoking Urges -Brief (QSU -Brief), the Minnesota Tobacco 
Withdrawal Scale- Revised (MTWS -R), and the Penn State 
[Electronic] Cigarette Dependence Index (PSCDI/PSECDI)  
questionnaires at least [ADDRESS_285407]

Day 9 and pod weights will be measured. 
Depending on the availability of topography equipment, puff topography may not be performed at all scheduled time points and may not be performed for some or all assigned subj ects. 
Part 2 (Days  10 to 1 4) 
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 3 study arms (Part  2) on Day 10. 
Subjects will use any or all of the 8  study products and/or smoke their 
usual brand combustible cigarettes ad libitum  for 5  days  (until 
approximately 23:00 on each day) according to the randomization 
scheme.  For BoE and BoPH assessments, blood samples will be 
collected on Day  14 and urine samples will be collected over 24  hours 
(starting on Day [ADDRESS_285408] use for that day ). On 
Day 14, BP and HR measurements  will be taken  throughout the period

Page [ADDRESS_285436] of a battery, heating component, and a reservoir (often referred 
to as a pod, cartridge, or tank) containing tobacco- derived nicotine in a s olution composed of 
glycerin and/or propylene glycol and flavorings. Upon activation, the heating element heats the solution and the consumer inhales the resulting vapor.  
Because e-cigarette use does not involve the combustion of tobacco, it is expected th at 
e-cigarette consumers will experience reduced exposure to most biomarkers of tobacco 
exposure compared to combustible cigarettes. Previous studies have shown that switching from combustible cigarettes to e- cigarettes with high rates of compliance result s in large 
reductions in a number of cigarette smoke toxicants ( Cravo  2016, Goniewicz  2017, 
O'Connell  2016, McRobbie 2015, Hecht  2015).  
Therefore, to be of greatest benefit, e- cigarettes must provide smokers with an experience 
that would allow for maximal displacement of combustible cigarettes while at the same time not serve as a gateway to other more t oxic products for nonsmokers. Key elements that 
contribute to an acceptable initiating experience include the nicotine content in the products as well as the response that consumers have in terms of satisfaction and prevention of symptoms of withdrawal. 
1.2 myblu™ Previous Clinical Experience  
One previous clinical study has been conducted with the myblu™ closed system 
(FON-01blu- 2018). Fifteen healthy adult smokers enrolled in an open-label, 6-period 
crossover study to characterize nicotine uptake and subjectiv e effects during a 10 -puff 
controlled exposure (puffs 3 seconds in duration, taken at approximately 30- second intervals) 
relative to usual brand combustible cigarettes and the blu PRO open system product and to 
determine the potential impact of a nicotine salt e -liquid (with lactic acid).  
Blood samples for plasma nicotine analysis were collected approximately [ADDRESS_285437] use and included 6  questions presented on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 7 
(extremely).  
Nicotine overall exposure over 30 minutes (AUC0 -30) and peak exposure (Cmax) increased 
with increasing nicotine content in the myblu™ products (16 - 40 mg nicotine), and was 
higher in the 25 mg nicotine salt formulation compared to the non- salt formulation. The time 
to reach maximal plasma nicotine concentrations (Tmax) ranged from approximately 6.0 - 7.9 minutes following use of myblu™ and blu PRO products with nicotine salts and 
approximately 8.0 minutes following use of myblu™ non- salt formulation. AUC0- [ADDRESS_285438] products

3. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Design and Proce dures  
This will be an open -label, randomized, 2- part study in adult smokers. All subjects will 
participate in both study parts. Part  2 will begin immediately after Part  1. 
Screening procedures will be performed within 28  days prior to study procedures on D ay -2. 
Forty (40) adult, male and female, self -affirmed smokers (smoke an average of [ADDRESS_285456] 12 months  prior to Screening), who successfully 
complete the screening procedures and meet the eligibility criteria, w ill be eligible to 
check -in to the CRU  on Day -2. Every attempt will be made to enroll no more than 60% of 
either sex.  
Following check- in, subjects will complete all subjective effects questionnaires for the 
purpose of familiarization with the questions, s cales, and computerized tablet. Subjects will 
also participate in a brief trial on Day  -2 (approximately 30 minutes) using the my blu™

and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a study product, whether or not related to the study 
product. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring  
The subjects will be instructed to inform the Investigator  or staff of any AEs and intercurrent 
illnesses experienced during the study. Additionally, a specific inquiry regarding AEs  will be 
conducted prior to each product use and at discharge ( or upon ear ly withdrawal ). The inquiry 
will be posed in a non- specific manner using open -ended questions so as not to bias the 
response (e.g., How are you feeling  today?). 
A subject who has any clinically significant AE or clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
test value will be evaluated by [CONTACT_235763]/or followed up until the symptoms or values return to normal or acceptable levels (as appropriate in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] ), or until the subjec t is lost to follow -up. 
Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of the event(s).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting  
All AEs occurring during this clinical trial after the subject has received  the first study 
product must be recorded on the eCRF, including the date and time of onset, action taken, 
outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown/lost to follow -up), 
duration, relationship to product administration, and severity for each event. AEs will be listed . 
Even ts captured between S creening  and the first study product use will be documented as 
baseline signs and symptoms.  
The Investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to product administration 
as unrelated, unlikely, possibl y, probabl y, or likely.  
In addition, each sign or symptom reported will be graded on a 3- point severity scale using 
mild, moderate, or severe . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event ( SAE) is any AE that in the view of either the Investigator (or 
designee) or Spons or, results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life threatening AE, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functi ons, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon

Page [ADDRESS_285520] and m ay require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. 
Life threatening is defined as an AE that in the view of the Investigator (or designee) or 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate ri sk of death. It does not include an 
AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not consistent with the known risk information 
associated with the study product . 
All SAEs, whether or not c onsidered study -related , must be reported by [CONTACT_235764] e-mail to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the CRU ’s learning of the SAE or, at the latest, 
on the following workday. The Sponsor’s representative to contact [CONTACT_235765] . The Investigator 
must also inform the IRB, in compliance with GCP  reporting guidelines, and the site monitor 
of any SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy  
A pregnancy occurring in a female study subject during the study will be documented in the clinical conduct study report to the IRB. Pregnancy itself is not an AE . The Investigator or 
designee will discontinue the pregnant subject from the study and will adv ise her to seek 
prenatal care and counseling from her primary care provider. Advice given will be documented in the subject’s source document.  
The CRU staff will request the pregnant subject to notify the CRU of the outcome of the 
pregnancy ( e.g., birth, l oss, termination). To help ensure this, the CRU staff will follow up 
with the subject until the end of pregnancy, if in compliance with the CRU ’s standard 
operating procedures (SOPs) and with the subject’s consent. This request and the subject’s response w ill be documented in the subject’s source document.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Smoking Cessation Information 
At Screening and prior to discharge  from the study (or upon e arly t ermination ), all subjects 
will be advised that to reduce the health effects of smoking, the best thing to do is to quit, and will be encouraged to contact a qualified medical  professional for advice on smoking 
cessation.  
7. DATA ANALYSIS  
Data will be handled and processed according to  and/or the site’s SOP s, as 
appropriate, which are written based on the principles of GCP . A brief description of the 
statistical analysis is included below, detailed methodology for all summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial will be documented in a statistical analysis plan

[CONTACT_235767], time point, and sex using descriptive statistics appropriate for the endpoint. Figures will be used to display the data graphically.  
Missing data will not be imputed. Where individual data points are missing because of dropouts or other reasons, the data will be considered missing at random and summarized based on reduced denominators.  
7.3.1 Nicotine Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Individual nicotine concentrations will be adjusted for baseline nicotine (“bas eline -adjusted”) 
and all PK parameters will be calculated based on the adjusted concentrations. Baseline 
adjustment will be performed by [CONTACT_235768]- existing nicotine concentration from 
each nicotine concentration obtained after test product adm inistration in that period/day for

validated PK software (e.g., Phoenix® WinNonlin® version 6.3 or higher).  
For each study product and each first product use session on Days  2, 4, 6, and 8, the 
following PK parameters will be calculated from the baseline- adjusted nicotine 
concentration -time data:  
AUC0-180 Area under the nicotine concentration -time curve from time 0 (defined as the 
start of the first product use session) to the 180- minute time point as 
calculated by [CONTACT_235769] -adjusted plasma concentration.  
Tmax  Time to reach the maximum baseline- adjusted plasma concentration. If the 
maximum value occurs at more than one time point, Tmax is defined as the first time point with this value.  
Plasma concentrations below the limit of quantitation will be set to on e-half of the lower 
limit of quantitation for the calculation of descriptive statistics of unadjusted plasma nicotine concentrations and for the calculation of baseline- adjusted nicotine concentrations.  
Nicotine concentrations and PK parameters will be lis ted by [CONTACT_235770], by [CONTACT_235771]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Variance 
A linear mixed model for analysis of variance will be performed on the log -transformed PK 
parameters Cmax and AUC following the first product use session on each of Days  2, 4, 6, 
and [ADDRESS_285524] -squares means (LSM) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided for the PK parameters of Cmax and AUC by

Biomarker concentrations reported as below the limit of quantitation (BLQ) will be reported 
as “BLQ” in the listings and set to one -half of the limit of quantitation for summarization and 
statistical analysis.  
The following variables will be determined and summarized for each urine biomarker.  
• Measured concentration  
• Total biomar ker mass excreted per 24 hours  
• Creatinine -adjusted excretion level  
Absolute and percent change- from-baseline will be determined for the mass excreted and 
creatinine- adjusted values. The total urine biomarker mass excreted per 24  hours 
change -from-baseline value will be used as the primary variable in the statistical analysis.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Urine  Nicotine Equivalents  
Nicotine equivalents will be calculated as the molar sum of nicotine and 5  major nicotine 
metabolites. Values of individual components reported as BLQ will be set to one- half of the 
limit of quantitation prior use in the calculation below. Missing urine data will not be 
imputed. 
Nicotine equivalents (µg/mL) =  (nicotine [ng/mL]/162.23 [mg/mmol] + nicotine -gluc

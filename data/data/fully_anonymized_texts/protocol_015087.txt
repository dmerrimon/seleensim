    1    RTOG 0712 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1  Background 
Selective bladder preservation using trimodality therapy has been established as a safe and 
effective alternative to radical cystectomy in appropriately selected patients with muscle invasive 
bladder cancer.  Single institution and RTOG prospective studies demonstrate high rates of 
bladder preservation with no decrement in overall survival or rates of distant metastasis when a 
prompt cystectomy is performed for incomplete responders or patients with locally recurrent 
disease.  The treatment paradigm that has evolved consists of a thorough transurethral resection 
followed by [CONTACT_914597].  Patients with a complete response 
to induction therapy receive additional consolidation chemoradiation using the same sensitizing 
drugs.  Others undergo a prompt cystectomy. 
 
This randomized phase II study evaluates both the RTOG regimen incorporating BID radiation 
sensitized with 5-FU and cisplatin into the selective bladder preservation paradigm and the 
regimen developed at the University of Michigan which incorporates QD radiation sensitized with 
gemcitabine.1-3 The RTOG regimen has demonstrated a high response rate and acceptable 
toxicity in a phase I/II trial (95-06).  A subsequent randomized phase II trial (0233) demonstrated 
the response rate and the rate of distant metastasis equal to a similar radiation schedule 
combined with cisplatin and paclitaxel with lesser rates of toxicity.  A phase I trial performed at the 
University of Michigan established the safety of a regimen using concurrent twice weekly 
gemcitabine and QD radiation to a total of 60 Gy. Twenty-four patients were enrolled on this study 
and 23 were assessable for toxicity and response.  All patients were male.  All patients had T2 
tumors that were amenable to TURBT.   Median age was 62 (range 46-83).  Median follow-up is 
5.6 years.  The MTD of gemcitabine was 27 mg/m2.   The toxicity by [CONTACT_914598]: At 10 mg/m2, 3 patients were treated and none experienced dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT).   At 20 mg/m2, 6 patients were treated.  There was one DLT (a grade 3 LFT 
elevation) and one non-DLT (grade 3 neutropenia). At 33 mg/m2, DLT occurred in 2 of 3 
consisting of grade 4 diarrhea in one patient, who also had a non-DLT of hematochezia and rectal 
stricture, and grade 3 edema in another patient, who also had a non-DLT of grade 3 
hematochezia.  At 27 mg/m2, 5 patients were treated without the occurrence of a DLT, but one 
patient had mild radiation cystitis with a stricture that required dilation.  The At 30 mg/m2, there 
were 3 DLTs in 6 treated patients.  There were no life-threatening complications.  There was one 
significant late complication. The patient who had radiation cystitis during treatment had 
persistent hematuria unresponsive to conservative measures. This patient ultimately was 
successfully managed with hyperbaric oxygen.  No patient has required a cystectomy due to 
complications of therapy.   There was a high rate of bladder preservation with a clinical CR rate of 
91 as assessed by [CONTACT_113511], cytology and imaging studies 4 weeks after completion of 
radiation. At 5 years, the overall survival and disease specific survival rates were 76% and 82%, 
respectively.   
 
Distant metastases remain the most common mode of treatment failure for patients with muscle 
invasive bladder cancer.  In recognition of this risk, adjuvant chemotherapy has been an integral 
component of RTOG protocols since 1995. In this study, patients will receive adjuvant 
chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin, an effective and well tolerated doublet in the 
metastatic setting.  A multi-institutional randomized phase III trial demonstrated similar survival 
rates with a better safety profile and tolerability for this regimen as compared to MVAC 
(methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin).4, [ADDRESS_1285228] the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy may result in 
lower rates of distant metastasis than reported by [CONTACT_914599]. 
 
1.2 Biomarkers in Bladder Cancer  (4/14/11) 
A number of biomarkers have shown promise in predicting the outcome of bladder cancer 
patients. In particular, her2/neu, EGFR1, p53, p21, pRb, p16, and bcl2.6-11 These markers and 
others are under investigation through the RTOG genitourinary translational research program 
using patients from prior RTOG bladder preservation trials. Markers which are targets for 
therapeutics, such as Her2/neu, VEGF and EGFR, will be prioritized. Special efforts will be made 
 
    2    RTOG 0712 to obtain the tissue from diagnostic/pretreatment TURB and cystectomy specimens, when 
salvage cystectomy is performed. 
 
Novel biomarker screening technologies are emerging. Mass spectrometry based metabolomics 
and proteomics approaches and second generation sequencing based whole transcriptome 
analysis or whole genome sequencing are among them. RTOG 0712 tissue, blood, and urine 
biospecimens will be used as validation sets for results obtained through profiling of institutional 
based biosample discovery sets. 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary 
To estimate the rate of distant metastasis at 3 years of two induction chemoradiotherapy 
regimens including 5-Fluorouracil, cisplatin, and BID irradiation (FCI) or gemcitabine and QD 
irradiation (GI). Induction chemoradiotherapy will be followed by [CONTACT_914600], 
and both will be followed by [CONTACT_72625].  
  
2.2 Secondary  (4/14/11) 
2.2.1  To estimate the completion rate of  two treatment regimens with either FCI or GI.   
2.2.2 To estimate acute and late grade 3+ GU, GI, and hematologic toxicities of two treatment 
regimens with either induction FCI or GI followed by [CONTACT_72625].   
2.2.3 To estimate the efficacy of transurethral surgery with either induction FCI or GI in achieving a 
complete response of the primary tumor. 
2.2.4  To estimate the efficacy of transurethral surgery with either FCI or GI in preserving the native, 
tumor-free bladder five years after therapy. 
2.2.5  To estimate the value of tumor histopathologic, molecular genetic, DNA content, metabolomic, 
and proteomic parameters as possible significant prognostic factors for initial tumor response 
and recurrence-free survival. 
2.2.6       Explanatory analysis for AUA Symptom scores at baseline and at 3 years from patients on both 
arms. 
2.2.7  To find potentially predictive biomarkers for cystectomy-free survival. 
2.2.8  To find potentially predictive biomarkers for acute and late toxicities.

5.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
5.1 Pre-Registration Requirements for 3DCRT Treatment Approach (4/14/11)  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1285234] met the technology requirements may enter patients to this study. 
5.1.2 The new Facility Questionnaire one per institution, available on the ATC website at 
http://atc.wustl.edu ) is to be sent to RTOG Headquarters for review prior to entering any cases. 
Upon review and successful completion of a ― Dry-Ru n‖ QA test, the ITC will notify both the 
registering institution and RTOG Headquarters that the institution has successfully completed 
this requirement. RTOG Headquarters will notify the institution when all requirements have 
been met and the institution is eligible to enter patients onto this study. Institutions that have 
previously enrolled patients on 3D-CRT trials of this same disease site may enroll patients on 
this study without further credentialing. 
 
5.2 Regulatory Pre-Registration Requirements (2/28/12) 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1285235] fax copi[INVESTIGATOR_914566] 
([PHONE_030]), along with the completed CTSU-IRB/REB Certification Form, 
https://www.ctsu.org/public/CTSU-IRBcertif_Final.pdf , prior to registration of the institution’s first 
case: 
 IRB/REB approval letter; 
 IRB/REB approved consent (English and native language versions*) 
*Note: Institutions must provide certification/verification of IRB/REB consent translation to 
RTOG Headquarters (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] below) 
 IRB/REB assurance number. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Translation of documents is critical. The institution is responsible for all translation costs. All 
regulatory documents, including the IRB/REB approved consent, must be provided in 
English and in the native language. Certification of the translation is optimal but due to the 
prohibitive costs involved RTOG will accept, at a minimum, a verified translation. A verified 
translation consists of the actual REB approved consent document in English and in the 
native language, along with a cover letter on organizational/letterhead stationery that 
includes the professional title, credentials, and signature [CONTACT_914633] a neutral third party. The 
professional title and credentials of the neutral third party translator must be specified as 
well. 
5.2.2 Pre-Registration Requirements FOR CANADIAN INSTITUTIONS 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Prior to clinical trial commencement, Canadian institutions must complete and fax to the 
CTSU Regulatory Office ([PHONE_030]): 
 Health Canada’s Therapeutic Products Directorates’ Clinical Trial Site Information Form,  
 Qualified Investigator Undertaking Form, and  
 Research Ethics Board Attestation Form.  
5.2.3 Pre-Registration Requirements FOR NON-CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For institutions that do not have an approved LOI for this protocol:  
 
    [ADDRESS_1285236] receive written approval of submitted LOI forms from RTOG 
Headquarters prior to submitting documents to their local ethics committee for approval. See 
http://www.rtog.org/Researchers/InternationalMembers.aspx  . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For institutions that have an approved LOI for this protocol:  
 All requirements indicated in your LOI Approval Notification must be fulfilled prior to enrolling 
patients to this study. 
 
5.3 Registration (4/14/11)  
Online Registration 
 Patients can be registered only after eligibility criteria are met.   
 
 Each individual user must have an RTOG user name [CONTACT_914634]. To get a user name [CONTACT_2383]: 
 
The investigator and research staff must have completed Human Subjects Training and been 
issued a certificate (Training is available via http://phrp.nihtraining.com/users/login.php ). 
 
A representative from the institution must complete the Password Authorization Form 
http://www.rtog.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=-BXerpBu5AQ%3d&tabid=219 , and fax it to 215-
923-1737.  RTOG Headquarters requires 3-4 days to process requests and issue user 
names/passwords to institutions. 
 
 An institution can register the patient by [CONTACT_744011] ( http://www.rtog.org ), 
going to ― Data Center Logon" and selecting the link for new patient registrations.  The system 
triggers a program to verify that all regulatory requirements (OHRP assurance, IRB approval) 
have been met by [CONTACT_8236]. The registration screens begin by [CONTACT_744012], the identification of the person who completed the 
checklist, whether the patient was found to be eligible on the basis of the checklist, and the 
date the study-specific informed consent form was signed. 
 
 Once the system has verified that the patient is eligible and that the institution has met 
regulatory requirements, it assigns a patient-specific case number. The system then moves to a 
screen that confirms that the patient has been successfully enrolled.  This screen can be 
printed so that the registering site will have a copy of the registration for the patient’s record.  
Two e-mails are generated and sent to the registering site:  the Confirmation of Eligibility and 
the patient-specific calendar. The system creates a case file in the study’s database at the 
DMC (Data Management Center) and generates a data submission calendar listing all data 
forms, images, and reports and the dates on which they are due.  
 
 If the patient is ineligible or the institution has not met regulatory requirements, the system 
switches to a screen that includes a brief explanation for the failure to register the patient.  This 
screen can be printed. 
 
 Institutions can contact [CONTACT_744013]: 
[EMAIL_9988]  or [PHONE_13665] ext. 4189 or 215- 574-3189.  
 
 In the event that the RTOG web registration site is not accessible, participating sites can 
register a patient by [CONTACT_914602], at ([PHONE_15514], Monday through Friday, 
8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET. The registrar will ask for the site’s user name [CONTACT_2383]. This 
information is required to assure that mechanisms usually triggered by [CONTACT_914603] (e.g., 
drug shipment, confirmation of registration, and patient-specific calendar) will occur.

6.1 Dose Specifications (01/21/10) 
6.1.1   Induction Treatment 
[IP_ADDRESS]  FCI Regimen (Arm 1)   
On the FCI induction regimen, radiation treatment is delivered twice per day (BID).  The first 
daily treatment consists of 1.[ADDRESS_1285241] (20.[ADDRESS_1285242]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  GI Regimen (Arm 2)   
On the GI induction regimen, radiation treatment is delivered one time per day (QD).  For the 
first [ADDRESS_1285243] ([ADDRESS_1285244]). 
6.1.2   Consolidation Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS] FCI Regimen (Arm 1)   
On the FCI consolidation regimen, radiation treatment is delivered to the CTV pelvis at 1.5 Gy 
per fraction twice per day (BID) over [ADDRESS_1285245] will be 
64.3 Gy over 9 weeks in 42 fractions. The total dose to the CTV pelvis will be 44.8 Gy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] GI Regimen (Arm 2)   
 
    7    RTOG 0712 On the GI consolidation regimen, radiation treatment is delivered to the CTV pelvis at 2 Gy per 
fraction one time per day (QD) over [ADDRESS_1285246] will be 64 
Gy over 10 weeks in 32 fractions. The total dose to the CTV pelvis will be 44 Gy.  
6.1.3   Radiation Dose Prescription  
The dose should be prescribed at the center of each treatment volume (CTV pelvis, CTV bladder , 
CTV boost), or the mid-plane of the patient if only AP/PA beams are used. Criteria for dose 
coverage are specified in Section 6.7.3. 
 
 6.2 Technical Factors  [Equipment, energies] 
Linear accelerators with beam energy of  [ADDRESS_1285247] cystogram is recommended. 
 
6.4 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes  
6.4.1  Small Pelvic Fields (Appendix V) 
These fields should encompass the entire bladder (CTV bladder ), the bladder tumor volume 
(CTV boost), prostate and prostatic urethra (in men), and the regional lymph nodes. These lymph 
nodes include the internal and external iliacs and the obturator lymph nodes. All of these 
structures constitute the CTV pelvis. 
 
Four shaped anterior, posterior and lateral fields will be used.  In the cranio-caudal dimension, 
these fields will extend from the lower pole of the obturator foramen to the mid-sacrum (the 
anterior aspect of S2-S3 junction).  Laterally, the anterior-posterior opposed fields will extend 
1.[ADDRESS_1285248]-void residual.  For any of these anatomic variations, the variation 
should be encompassed within the defined CTV bladder  which in turn is used to define the 
CTV pelvis, and the field edge adjusted to extend 2 cm beyond the modif ied CTV pelvis. 
6.4.2  Whole Bladder Field 
The CTV bladder  includes the gross tumor volume (GTV) plus the whole bladder volume including 
the bladder wall thickness.  This volume is covered using a four-field arrangement.  Field edges 
extend [ADDRESS_1285249] Fields (Appendix V) 
The gross tumor volume (GTV=CTV boost) is derived from information available from bimanual 
examination, cystoscopic bladder mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], intraoperative reports and radiographic studies.  
Close cooperation with the treating urologist is essential. Cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_914567] 
 
    [ADDRESS_1285250] field weighting in the other phases of treatment such that final doses to the femoral 
heads and posterior rectum are within specified limits. 
 
6.5 Critical Structures (01/21/10) (01/ 29/10) 
The rectum volume is defined on CT from the anus (at the level of the ischial tuberosities) for a 
length of 15 cm or to the rectosigmoid flexure. A DVH for the rectum, bladder, and both femoral 
heads should be submitted. The following DVH criteria should be achieved. 
 
Rectum: 
No more than 50% of the volume above 30 Gy 
No more than 10% of the volume above 55 Gy 
 
Femoral heads: 
No more than 20% of the volume above [ADDRESS_1285251] be submitted to ITC (see 
Section 12.2): (1) the CT plan, (2) Digitally reconstructed radiographs of all treatment fields and 
(3) the initial approved small pelvis port films. 
 
6.7 Compliance Criteria   
6.7.1  Field Borders 
Variation : Actual field borders and/or PTVs are within 2 cm beyond those stated in the protocol 
and include the target structures described above. 
Deviation : Actual field borders and/or PTVs transect a target structure or are greater than 2 cm 
beyond the borders stated in the protocol.   
6.7.2  Specified Radiation Dose (Critical structures) 
 Variation : Planned dose is within 10% of the specified protocol dose. 
 Deviation : Planned dose deviates by [CONTACT_726] 10% from the specified protocol dose.   
 6.7.3  Minimum Isodose Coverage (Applies to each CTV independently)  
 Generally the minimum dose to any target should be 95 % of the prescription dose to that 
target. To address the single pi[INVESTIGATOR_914568] D 99% is used as the dose 
specifier.  
 Per protocol : D99% > 95%. Dose covering 99% of the volume of any target volume is no less 
than 95% of the prescribed dose.   
 Variation : D 99% < 95% but D 99% > 90%. Dose covering 99% of the volume of any target 
volume is no less than 90% of the prescribed dose. 
 Deviation : D99% < 90%. Target structures coverage falls below 90% of the prescribed dose.  
6.7.4  Maximum Dose (Applies to each CTV independently) 
 Generally the maximum dose to any target should be less than 107% of that target’s 
prescribed dose.  
 Per protocol : V 107% < 0.12 cc. Less than 0.12 cc of the CTV receives a dose exceeding 
107% of the prescribed dose.  
 Variation : V107% > 0.12 cc but this dose does not exceed 110% of this dose.  
 Deviation : The maximum dose to the 0.12 cc volume does exceed 110% of the prescribed 
dose.  
6.7.5  Interfraction Interval – Only applies to FCI A rm 
 Per protocol : All treatments delivered BID with minimum interfraction interval of 4 hours 
Variation : No more than one QD treatment delivered during each phase of chemoradiotherapy; 
interfraction interval between 3.5 hours and less than 4 hours 
Deviation : More than three QD treatments during either phase of chemoradiotherapy; any 
interfraction interval less than 3.5 hours 
 
 
    9    RTOG 0712 6.7.6  Elapsed Days 
 Per protocol : No more than 3 break days  
 Variation : 4 to 7 break days 
 Deviation : 8 or more break days  
 
6.8 Treatment Interruption  (4/14/11)   
If a grade 3 hematologic toxicity (ANC or platelets) develops during chemoradiotherapy, all 
treatment (both radiation and chemotherapy) should be discontinued for a minimum of 1 week. 
Treatment may be resumed when the hematologic toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 2. If these 
laboratory values have not been reached after a 1-week delay, they should be checked weekly 
until they become acceptable. If after [ADDRESS_1285252] not recovered, all protocol 
treatment should be discontinued and the patients should be treated on an individual basis. 
 
For a grade 3 acute colitis, cystitis, or any other grade 3 infield (radiation-related) toxicity during 
any treatment week, treatment should be delayed until the toxicity subsides to the grade [ADDRESS_1285253]. These reviews will be ongoing and performed remotely.

unbalanced growth and death of the cell. 
7.4.3  Administration: 5-Fluorouracil (400mg/m2) is to be administered as a 24-hour infusion. 
Administration of 5-FU should be only by [CONTACT_914606]. 
7.4.4  Storage: Although 5-FU solution may discolor slightly during storage, the potency and safety 
are not adversely affected. Store at room temperature (49°-86°F). Protect from light. If a 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_914569], resolubilize by [CONTACT_86987] 140°F with 
vigorous shaking; allow to cool to body temperature before using.  
7.4.5  Adverse Events:  
 Hematologic:   Myelosuppression 
 Gas
trointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting; diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, pharyngitis, 
increased liver function tests (SGOT, SGPT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase ), biliary 
sclerosis, or acaculous cholecystitis 
 Cardiac:  Myocardial infarction (MI), angi na 
 Neurological:  Sensory (taste), peripheral neuropathy, seizures, mood swings, hepatic 
encephalopathy, encephalopathy, sensation of flashing lights; blurred vision, scintillating 
scotoma 
 Allergy: Anaphylactoid and urticarial reactions (acute); rash, pruritis 
 Other:  Alopecia, fatigue, disorientation, dizziness, lack of coordination, visual changes, 
photosensitivity (eyes and skin); nail changes including loss of nails, skin thickening, 
cracking, dryness or sloughing; vein pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] 
7.4.6  Supply:   Commercially available.  
 
7.5  Cisplatin (Platinol ®) 
7.5.1  Dose Formulation: Cisplatin is available as 10 mg and 50 mg vials of dry powder which are 
reconstituted with 10 ml and 50 ml of sterile water for Injection USP, respectively. Cisplatin is 
also available as a 1 mg/ml solution in 50 and 100 mg vials. 
7.5.2  Pharmacology: The dominant mode of action of cisplatin appears to involve the formation of a 
bifunctional adduct resulting in DNA crosslinks. How this kills the cell remains unclear. There 
are data to indicate that its mode and sites of action are different from those of nitrogen 
mustard and the standard alkylating agents.  Plasma levels of cisplatin decay in a biphasic 
mode with an initial half-life of 18 to 37 minutes and a secondary phase ranging from 44 to 190 
hours. This prolonged phase is due to protein binding which exceeds 90%.  Urinary excretion is 
incomplete with only 27 to 45% excreted in the first five days. The initial fractions are largely 
unchanged drugs. 
7.5.3  Administration: Cisplatin should be given immediately after preparation as a slow intravenous 
infusion. 
7.5.4  Storage: The intact vials should be stored at room temperature. Once reconstituted, the 
solution should be kept at room temperature to avoid precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332]. Due to a lack of 
preservatives, the solution should be used within 8 hours of reconstitution. The solution may be 
further diluted in a chloride containing vehicle such as D5NS, NS, or D5-1/2NS (ppt. Occurs in  
 
    12    RTOG 0712 D5W). Cisplatin has been shown to react with aluminum needles, producing a black precipi[INVESTIGATOR_914570] 30 minutes. 
 
7.5.5  Adverse Events:  
 Hematologic:   Myelosuppression 
 Gas
trointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting; anorexia 
 Renal: Elevation of BUN and creatinine, hyperuricemia, renal tubular damage  
 Cardiac:  rare cardiac abnormalities 
 Neurological:  Sensory (taste), peripheral neuropathy, seizures 
  Allergy: Anaphylactoid and urticarial reactions (acute);, rash 
 Other:  Fatigue, otoxicity including hearing loss or tinnitus, loss of muscle function 
7.5.6  Supply: Commercially available.  
 
7.6  Gemcitabine 
7.6.1  Chemistry: Gemcitabine (2’-deoxy-2’2’-difluorocyti-dine monohydrochloride) is a purine analog 
structurally similar to cytarabine and an analog to deoxycytidine.  Gemcitabine has two fluoride 
atoms in the geminal position of the second carbon of the ribose sugar. 
7.6.2  Dose Formulation: Gemcitabine is supplied in 200 mg and 1000 mg vials. Two hundred mg 
vials are reconstituted in 5 cc sodium chloride then diluted to a concentration of as low as 0.1 
mg/ml if necessary for infusion. One thousand mg vials are reconstituted with 25 cc sodium 
chloride. 
7.6.3  Mechanism of Action: Gemcitabine inhibits DNA synthesis in tumor cells by [CONTACT_914607]. Gemcitabine metabolites also inhibit 
enzymes in DNA synthesis.  Finally, gemcitabine is masked from DNA repair enzymes with the 
addition of one additional nucleotide after gemcitabine is in the DNA chain. 
7.6.4  Pharmacokinetics: Gemcitabine is metabolized into active metabolites gemcitabine 
diphosphate and gemcitabine triphosphate. It is also metabolized to inactive compound, 
gemcitabine difluorouridine.  Ninety-nine percent of the dose is excreted in the urine and there 
is negligible protein binding. The serum half-life is significantly affected by [CONTACT_914608].  However, there is no schedule for dose reduction in renal dysfunction. 
7.6.5  Administration: Gemcitabine at the appropriate dose and dilution will be administered over 30 
minutes. 
7.7.5  Storage: Gemcitabine is stored at room temperature until given.  
7.6.7  Adverse Events: 
 Hematologic:   Myelosuppression, neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia 
 Gas
trointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting; anorexia, stomatitis, diarrhea, constipation,  
elevation of liver function tests 
 Renal: Rare decrease in creatinine clearance, edema  
   Allergy: Anaphylactoid and urticarial reactions (acute); rash 
 Othe
r: Fatigue, fever, alopecia, pain, dyspnea 
 7.6.8  Supply:  Commercially available.  
 
7.7 Paclitaxel  (Taxol®) 
7.7.1  Formulation: Paclitaxel is a poorly soluble plant product from the western yew, Taxus brevifolia . 
Improved solubility requires a mixed solvent system with further dilutions of either 0.9% sodium 
chloride or 5% dextrose in water.  Vials will be labeled with shelf life.  All solutions of paclitaxel 
exhibit a slight haziness directly proportional to the concentration of drug and the time elapsed 
after preparation, although when prepared as described above, solutions of paclitaxel (0.3-1.2 
mg/ml) are physically and chemically stable for 27 hours. 
7.7.2  Preparation: A sterile solution concentrate, 6 mg/ml in 5 ml vials (30 mg/vial) in 
polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) 50% and dehydrated alcohol, USP, 50%.  The 
contents of the vial must be diluted just prior to clinical use.  Paclitaxel for injection must be 
diluted before administration with 5% dextrose USP, 0.9% sodium chloride USP, or 5% 
dextrose in Ringer’s injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2 milligrams/milliliter.  This 
solution is stable for 27 hours under ambient temperature (25 degrees Celsius) and room 
lighting (Prod Info Taxol , 1997) . Use 5% polyolefin containers due to leaching of 
diethylhexphthalate (DEHP) plasticizer from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags and intravenous 
tubing by [CONTACT_8244].  Each bag/bottle should be 
 
    13    RTOG 0712 prepared immediately before administration.  NOTE: Formation of a small number of fibers in 
solution  has been observed after preparation of paclitaxel (NOTE: acceptable limits established  
by [CONTACT_8245]’s). Therefore, in-line filtration is necessary for 
administration of paclitaxel solutions. In-line filtration should be accomplished by [CONTACT_8246] 
a hydrophilic, microporous filter of pore size not greater than 0.22 microns (e.g.: Millex-GV 
Millipore Products)  into the i.v. fluid pathway distal to the infusion pump. Although particulate 
formation does not indicate loss of drug potency, solutions exhibiting excessive particulate 
matter formation should not be used. 
7.7.3  Administration: Paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose and dilution, will be given as a one-hour 
infusion. The paclitaxel is mixed in non-PVC containers and infused via polyolefin-lined 
nitroglycerin tubing or low absorption AVI i.v. administration with 0.22 m in-line filter. Paclitaxel 
will be administered via an infusion control device (pump) using non-PVC tubing and 
connectors, such as the i.v. administration sets (polyethylene or polyolefin) which are used to 
infuse parenteral Nitroglycerin. Nothing else is to be infused through the line through which 
paclitaxel is administered. 
7.7.4  Storage: Paclitaxel vials should be stored between 2°-25°C (36°-77°F). 
7.7.5  Adverse Events: 
 Hematologic:   Myelosuppression 
 Gas
trointestinal:  Nausea and vomiting; diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, pharyngitis, 
typhlitis, ischemic colitis, neutropenic enterocolitis, increased liver function tests (SGOT, 
SGPT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase ); hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis 
 Heart: 
Arrhythmias, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, myocardial infarction (MI), 
bradycardia, atrial arrhythmia, hypotension, hypertension, lightheadedness 
 Neurological:  Sensory (taste), peripheral neuropathy, seizures, mood swings, hepatic 
encephalopathy, encephalopathy, sensation of flashing lights; blurred vision, scintillating 
scotoma 
  Allergy: Anaphylactoid and urticarial reactions (acute); flushing, rash, pruritis 
 Other:  Alopecia, fatigue, arthralgia, myopathy, myalgia, infiltration (erythema, induration, 
tenderness, rarely ulceration); radiation recall reaction.

NCI guidelines. 
  
7.9 Dose Modifications for Induction/Consolidation  (4/14/11) 
7.9.1  A complete blood count and serum creatinine will be drawn at the start of each week of 
induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Dose modifications for the drugs given that week 
will be based upon these results. Dose reductions based on CBC and creatinine during 
induction do not carry through to consolidation unless the blood abnormality persists. Dose 
reductions based upon clinical problems, such as neurotoxicity, may involve discontinuation of 
the drug altogether and are specified in the text below. 
 
If a grade 3 hematologic toxicity (ANC or platelets) develops during chemoradiotherapy, all 
treatment (both radiation and chemotherapy) should be discontinued for a minimum of 1 week. 
Treatment may be resumed when the hematologic toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 2. If these 
laboratory values have not been reached after a 1-week delay, they should be checked weekly 
until they become acceptable. If the blood counts have not recovered after 3 weeks, all protocol 
treatment should be discontinued and the patients should be treated on an individual basis. 
 
The guidelines above apply to cisplatin, gemcitabine, and 5-fluorouracil.

[IP_ADDRESS]  The following guidelines should be followed: 
 
    17    RTOG 0712  Doses of gemcitabine and paclitaxel cannot be escalated above the starting dose. 
 Absolute neutrophil count must be greater than 1.2 x 109/L, and platelet count must be 
greater than 100x109/L to proceed with the next cycle.  
 If day 8 is held for a grade 3 or grade 4 hematologic toxicity, subsequent cycles will be 
dose reduced by 25% and the reduction will be maintained for the duration of treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hematologic Toxicity 
 Patients who sustain either febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia associated with new-onset gross hematuria or other clinical evidence 
of bleeding should be dosed at 50% of the starting dose of gemcitabine delivered in the 
previous cycle, the latter to apply to each gemcitabine dose administered during that 
cycle.  Subsequent dose escalation of gemcitabine only by 50% (e.g., from 500 mg/m2 
to 750 mg/m2) will be allowed in subsequent cycles provided the patient tolerates the 
initial dose of adjustment. 
 
7.13 Modality Review 
 The Medical Oncology Co-Chair, Donald S. Kaufman, M.D., will perform a Chemotherapy 
Assurance Review of all patients who receive or are to receive chemotherapy in this trial. The 
goal of the review is to evaluate protocol compliance. The review process is contingent on timely 
submission of chemotherapy treatment data as specified in Section 12.1. The scoring mechanism 
is: Per Protocol/Acceptable Variation, Not Per Protocol, and Not Evaluable .  A report is sent 
to each institution once per year to notify the institution about compliance for each case reviewed 
in that year. 
   
 T
he Medical Oncology Co-Chair, Donald S. Kaufman, M.D., will perform a Quality Assurance 
Review after complete data for the first [ADDRESS_1285264]. 
 
7.14 Adverse Events (2/6/14) 
 Beginning October 1, 2010, this study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4 .0 for grading of all adverse events. A copy of the CTCAE version 4 .0 
can be downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). All appropriate treatment 
areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4. 0. All AE reporting on the study 
case report forms will continue to use CTCAE version 3.0. 
   
 All adverse events (AEs) as defined in the tables below will be reported via the CTEP Adverse 
Event Reporting System (CTEP-AERS) application accessed via the CTEP web site 
(https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task?rand=1389817585865 ).  
 
 Serious adverse events (SAEs) as defined in the tables below will be reported via CTEP-AERS .  
 
 In order to ensure consistent data capture, serious adverse events reported on CTEP-
AERS reports also must be reported on an RTOG case report form (CRF). In addition, sites 
must submit CRFs in a timely manner after CTEP-AERS submissions. 
 
7.14.1  Adverse Events (AEs)  
 Definition of an AE : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
hum
ans, whether or not considered drug related.  Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of unrelated, unlikely, 
possible, probable, or definite). (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH], E2A, E6). 
[CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements ; 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/adverse_events.htm ] 
. 
 
 
    18    RTOG 0712  The following guidelines for reporting adverse events (AEs) apply to all NCI/RTOG research 
protocols. AEs, as defined above, experienced by [CONTACT_914609] (see Section 12.1). Note: AEs 
indicated in the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting Requirements in text and/or table in 
Section 7. [ADDRESS_1285265] be reported via CTEP-AERS. 
 
NOTE: If the event is a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) [see next section], further reporting 
will be required. Reporting AEs only fulfills Data Management reporting requirements .  
7.14.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  — Serious adverse events (SAEs) that meet expedited 
reporting criteria defined in the table in Section 7.[ADDRESS_1285266] the CTEP-AERS Help Desk if assistance is required.  
  
Definition of an SAE : Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of 
the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience; 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Important medical events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64961], when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
  
Due to the risk of intrauterine exposure of a fetus to potentially teratogenic agents, the pregnancy 
of a study participant must be reported via CTEP-AERS in an expedited manner. 
 
7.14.3 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) 
AML or MDS that is diagnosed as a secondary malignancy during or subsequent to treatment 
in patients on NCI/CTEP-sponsored clinical trials must be reported via the CTEP-AERS system 
within 30 days of AML/MDS diagnosis. 
 
Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under 
an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP-AERS. Three options are available to describe the 
event: 
  
 Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
 Treatment-related secondary malignancy 
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be 
reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
Second Malignancy   
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting 
via CDUS unless otherwise specified.    
  
7.15 CTEP-AERS Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  (2/6/14) 
All serious adverse events that meet expedited reporting criteria defined in the reporting table 
below will be reported via CTEP-AERS, the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System, accessed 
via the CTEP web site,  
https://eapps-ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers/pages/task?rand=[ADDRESS_1285267] be made to 
the RTOG Operations Office at 1- [PHONE_13665], ext. 4189, for instances when Internet fails. 
Once internet connectivity is restored, an AE report submitted by [CONTACT_914610]-AERS. 
 
 CTEP-AERS-[ADDRESS_1285268] be followed by a CTEP-AERS 5 Calendar Day Report. 
Serious adverse events that require 24 hour CTEP-AERS notification are defined in the 
expedited reporting table below. 
 Supporting source document is not mandatory.  However, if the CTEP-AERS report 
indicates in the Additional Information section that source documentation will be provided, 
then it is expected.  If supporting source documentation accompanies an CTEP-AERS 
report, include the protocol number, patient ID number, and CTEP-AERS ticket number 
on each page, and fax supporting documentation to the RTOG dedicated SAE FAX, 
[PHONE_19610].  
 A serious adverse event that meets expedited reporting criteria outlined in the following 
table but is assessed by [CONTACT_16656]-AERS System as ― expedited reporting NOT require d‖ 
must still be reported to fulfill RTOG safety reporting obligations. Sites must by[CONTACT_261347] 
― NOT Required ‖ assessment; the CTEP-AERS System allows submission of all reports 
regardless of the results of the assessment.  
 
CTEP defines routine AE reporting requirements for phase 2 and 3 trials as described in the table 
below. Important:  All AEs reported via CTEP-AERS also must be reported on the AE section of 
the appropriate case report form (see Section 12.1).

8.0 SURGERY  
8.1 P re-Induction Chemoradiotherapy Evaluation :  Endoscopic evaluation must include: 
8.1.1  Cystoscopy with tumor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_914571] (Appendix VI); 
8.1.2  Transurethral resection (TUR) of the tumor as thoroughly as is judged safely possible.  Tumor 
specimens should be sent to the RTOG Biospecimen Resource as described in Section 10.0; 
8.1.3 Bimanual examination before and after TUR to evaluate possible residual tumor bulk using the 
following criteria: exam not performed, no pelvic mass, mobile pelvic mass, fixed pelvic mass;  
8.1.[ADDRESS_1285272]-Induction Chemoradiotherapy Endoscopic Response Evaluation  (4/14/11) 
This evaluation will take place in 3-4 weeks following the completion of the induction 
chemoradiotherapy. Evaluation will include: urine cytology, cystoscopy, tumor site transurethral 
biopsy, and bimanual examination after biopsy. 
 
Operative reports and pathology reports from TUR specimens should be submitted (see Section 
12.1). Operative reports should describe the surgeon’s assessment of the tumor burden in the 
bladder and prostatic urethra as well as the overall clinical stage at the conclusion of the 
resection. Moreover, it should document the findings of the bimanual examination. The pathology 
report should include the gross and microscopic description of tumor location, tumor grade and 
tumor stage using the T-classification of the TNM staging system. Specifically, pathology reports 
should include a description of the depth of tumor invasion, 
 
8.3 Radical Cystectomy  (4/14/11) 
Operable patients who have a pT1 or worse tumor response on re-evaluation following initial TUR 
and induction chemoradiotherapy will have a radical cystectomy 3-[ADDRESS_1285273]-
induction response evaluation.  In the male, radical cystectomy will include a complete en bloc 
resection of the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and intramural ureters as well as associated 
peritoneum and perivesical fat. In the female, radical cystectomy will include resection of the 
bladder along with the intramural ureters, perivesical fat and peritoneum associated with the 
bladder. Depending on the local extent of tumor and urinary diversion choice of the patient, a 
resection of the urethra, anterior and lateral walls of the vagina, uterus, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_914572]. Orthotopic diversion, continent cutaneous diversion, and 
incontinent cutaneous diversions are all permissible after induction chemoradiotherapy, as jointly 
 
    21    RTOG 0712 determined by [CONTACT_914611].  
 
When feasible, total lymphadenectomy should be performed. The dissection should include 
resection of nodal tissue from the bifurcation of the common iliac vessels to the inguinal ligament 
and from the genitofemoral nerve to the hypogastric artery.   
  
Operative reports and pathology reports from cystectomy specimens should be submitted (see 
Section 12.1). The pathology report should include the gross and microscopic description of 
tumor location, tumor grade and tumor stage using the TNM staging system. Specifically, 
pathology reports should include a description of the depth of tumor invasion, involvement of 
other organs or pelvic structures, summary of the margin status and the location and total number 
of lymph nodes resected and involved with carcinoma.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_1285274]-Consolidation Endoscopic Evaluations  (2/28/12) 
The first post-therapeutic evaluation will be in 8-[ADDRESS_1285275]. Surgical reviews will require detailed operative 
and pathology notes. 
 
9.0 OTHER THERAPY 
9.1 Permitted Supportive Therapy 
9.1.1  For patients who are treated with attempted bladder preservation using consolidation FCI or GI, 
either radical cystectomy or intravesical drug therapy will be promptly considered for a local 
persistence or local re-occurrence if it occurs in patients without evidence of distant 
metastases. Intravesical drug therapy should be administered for patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_914573], but not for muscle 
invading tumors. This subsequent therapy will be given at the discretion of the primary 
physicians. The rates of local recurrence and/or distant metastases will be reported. 
9.1.2  For patients who develop distant metastases, additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_914574]. 
9.1.3  Anti-emetic regimens, which may include ondansetron, granisetron, metoclopramide, 
lorazepam, dexamethasone, diphenhydramine hydrochloride and/or prochlorperazine, are 
recommended before and after cisplatin and gemcitabine. 
9.1.4  Growth factors 
 
10.0 TISSUE/SPECIMEN SUBMISSION    
 The RTOG Biospecimen Resource at the University of [LOCATION_004] San Francisco acquires and 
maintains high quality specimens from RTOG trials. Tissue from each block is preserved through 
careful block storage and processing. The RTOG encourages participants in protocol studies to 
consent to the banking of their tissue. The RTOG Biospecimen Resource provides tissue 
specimens to investigators for translational research studies. Translational research studies 
integrate the newest research findings into current protocols to investigate important biologic 
 
    22    RTOG 0712 questions. The RTOG Biospecimen Resource also collects tissue for Central Review of 
pathology. 
  
In this study, primary tumor tissue from the pretreatment TUR as well as two biopsies obtained 
from the tumor periphery will be submitted to the RTOG Biospecimen Resource for the purpose 
of central review (required) and  tissue banking for biomarker studies (highly recommended but 
not required ). 
 
10.1 Central Review: Required  
H&E slides from the pre-treatment tumor  TUR, and a biopsy sampling the mucosa and prostatic 
stroma should be sent.  Also, the cystoscopy report, and the pathology report will be reviewed by 
a central pathologist to determine if there is unequivocal proof of invasion of the muscular propria  
plus other possible histopathologic factors including tumor grade, the presence or absence of 
tumor-associated carcinoma in situ , the presence or absence of vascular space invasion, and the 
tumor configuration (papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], solid or mixed).  There will be  no restaging of the patient's clinical 
stage based only on the apparent depth of invasion of the muscularis propria  from the  tumor  TUR 
specimen. However if there is no tumor invasion of the muscularis propria documented in the 
specimens resected by [CONTACT_914612],  slides from the original tumor TUR from the 
outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914575]. 
See Section 10.3.1 for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_22026].

second year, q 6 months for years 3, 4, and 5, then annually until year 10 of follow- up: 
history/physical examination, weight, and Zubrod performance status; CBC/differential, 
platelets; serum creatinine; BUN. The following radiological evaluations should be done q 6 
months: abdominal/pelvic CT and chest CT.  
  
The following will also be assessed q [ADDRESS_1285285] year after completion of 
consolidation treatment, q 4 months during the second year, q 6 months for years 3, 4, and 5, 
then annually until year 10 of follow- up: cystoscopy, urine cytology, bladder biopsy. If after two 
re-evaluations, where the post-induction re-evaluation may be considered the first of the two, in 
which the tumor site re-biopsies have been negative and the urologist observes nothing 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665], cystoscopy and cytology without biopsy is permitted. 
Note: Only if cystectomy is not done within the first 6 weeks after consolidation 
chemoradiotherapy. Please read Section 8.4 which allows biopsies to be omitted after the 
second follow-up evaluation under the described circumstances. 
  
An urodynamic evaluation (cystometrogram + uroflow, pressure flow study, or fluorouro-
dynamics study) and AUA symptom score are recommended in the third post-treatment year for 
patients who still have a native bladder. This will incorporate measures of average and peak 
urinary flow rate, bladder functional capacity, compliance, and leak pressures (continence). 
 
After completion of [ADDRESS_1285286]-treatment follow-up, required assessments and schedule 
are at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
 If patient was discontinued due to progressive disease, required assessments and schedule 
are at the discretion of the treating physician. 
  
11.4 Measurement of Response  (4/14/11) 
11.4.1 Definition of Complete Response Immediately after Induction Treatment 
 
    27    RTOG 0712  Examination under anesthesia, cystoscopy, and biopsy of all previously positive tumor sites will 
be utilized to evaluate the tumor status (response) 3-4 weeks  following completion of induction 
chemoradiotherapy. In some patients, radiographic or cystoscopic evaluation will reveal 
abnormalities at the bladder tumor-site (such as thickening of the wall, ulcerations, or possible 
nodularities ) which contain no identifiable tumor cells histologically. Patients will be considered 
as having a clinical complete response when all biopsies are negative for any tumor at the 
site(s) of the pretreatment tumor (s). If, at a site distant from the original tumor, severe 
dysplasia, a Ta tumor or carcinoma in situ  is documented by [CONTACT_914614], this will 
not prevent the patient from being declared a complete response at the tumor site. The protocol 
guideline will be for that patient to undergo consolidation TCI or FCI according to original 
randomization. 
11.4. 2 Distant metastasis: The first appearance of disease in a non-regional lymph node, solid organ 
or bone.   This may be identified on a routine follow-up CT scan or bone scan or a study 
performed to work-up a specific patient complaint.  Additional radiographic studies or biopsies 
may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician in equivocal cases but are not 
required.  Radiographic evidence of metastasis is sufficient for evaluation of this endpoint.  
Time to development of distant metastasis will be defined as the time to the first appearance of 
distant metastasis.  
11.4.3 The objective response of the local bladder tumor will be described as follows: 
 Complete Response (a CR or a pT0 response)  requires the absence of any tumor in the 
tumor-site biopsy. For a primary tumor response following consolidation, a urine cytology 
specimen that is not positive is also required. 
 Partial Response (PR) requires that all response criteria of a CR except that the urine 
cytology remains positive or C IS is seen in the biopsy. 
 No Response (NR)  requires the continued presence of the tumor (T≥1) in the tumor-site 
biopsy specimen. 
 Progression requires the increase of 50% or more in the largest diameter of the 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_914576]-site biopsy specimen , the development of 
new bladder tumors, or the development of metastatic disease. 
 
11.5 Criteria for Discontinuation of Protocol Treatment  (4/14/11)  
 Progression of disease; 
 Intolerance of therapy as judged by [CONTACT_172276]; 
 Patient-initiated discontinuation or refusal to follow protocol-specified treatment; 
 A delay in protocol treatment, as specified in Sections 6.0 and/or 7.0; 
 Delay of more than 3 weeks due to an adverse event. 
 
 If protocol treatment is discontinued, follow up and data collection will continue as specified in the 
protocol.

13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Study Endpoints  (4/14/11) 
13.1.1  Primary Endpoint 
The rate of distant metastasis at 3 years of induction chemoradiotherapy regimens including 5-
Fluorouracil, cisplatin, and BID irradiation (FCI) or gemcitabine and QD irradiation (GI), followe d 
by [CONTACT_914618] (depending on response) with adjuvant 
chemotherapy. 
13.1.2  Secondary Endpoints 
 Completion rate of induction and consolidation chemoradiotherapy regimens including 5-
Fluorouracil, cisplatin, and BID irradiation (FCI) or gemcitabine and QD irradiation (GI) plus 
adjuvant chemotherapy. 
 Grade 3 or more GU, GI, and hematologic toxicity  of two treatment regimens using CTC AE v. 
3.0.  
 The efficacy of transurethral surgery with either induction FCI or GI in achieving a complete 
response of the primary tumor. 
 The efficacy of transurethral surgery with either FCI or GI in preserving the native tumor-free 
bladder five years after therapy. 
 To estimate the value of tumor histopathologic, molecular genetic, DNA content, 
metabolomic, and proteomic parameters as possible significant prognostic factors for initial 
tumor response and recurrence-free survival. 
 To find potentially predictive biomarkers for cystectomy–free survival. 
 
    30    RTOG 0712  To find potentially predictive biomarkers for acute and late toxicities. 
 Descriptive analysis for AUA Symptom score. 
 
13.2 Sample Size  (2/6/14)  
The primary goal of this study is to determine if either of the two treatment arms under 
consideration is promising enough to be pursued in a subsequent phase III study with respect to 
the rate of distant metastasis free at 3 years. The sample size is calculated with  Clopper -
Pearson ’s exact binomial confidence intervals  methods12 with type I error of 0.1. If either of the 
two arms has at least 75% of distant metastasis  free rate at 3 years, then we conclude that the 
treatment is promising enough for a phase III study with or without the adjuvant chemotherapy.  
We hypothesize that the lower boundary of one-sided 90% confidence interval of the rate of 
distant metastasis free at 3 years  is 0.75. Due to the well -known non -monotonic (― sawtoot h‖-type) 
boundary of Clopper -Pearson confidence interval, the study now requires 32 analyzable patients 
in each arm, which also warrants a 10% chance of observing a 3 -year distant metasta sis free rate 
of less than 75% if the true rate is 86%. Therefore, 32 analyzable patients for each arm, or 64 
analyzable patients in total, are needed for this study to retain the original study design objective.   
   
13.3  Accrual and Duration  (2/6/14) 
 Based on patient accrual in previous RTOG studies, the initial [ADDRESS_1285295] been between 1.5 and 2 patients per mon th. The analysis for the February 
2014 NRG Oncology semi-annual meeting showed that the average accrual rate is lower than 
expected. The modified sample size calculation may ensure the study is completed within the 
projected time frame without compromising statistical integrity. 
 
13.4  Randomization 
Patients will be randomized to one of two treatment arms in order to avoid any patient selection  
  bias. The treatment allocation scheme described by [CONTACT_453801]13 will be used because it balances  
  patient factors other than institution. Additionally, patients will be stratified by T-stage (T2 vs. T3-  
  T4a)  
 
13.5  Analysis Plan  (2/6/14) 
13.5.[ADDRESS_1285296] distant metastasis failure by 3 years among all eligible patients in each arm. If the rate for 
either arm is greater than or equal to 75%, then it will be strongly considered as a potential arm 
in a subsequent phase III study, assuming treatment delivery and adverse events are 
acceptable. If both arm s meet the criteria, then the treatment arm  that has less toxicity will be 
chosen. The confidence interval of th e rate will be calculated by [CONTACT_94532] -Pearson ’s exact 
binomial confidence intervals  methods12 with one-sided type I error of 0.1.  
13.5.2  To estimate the completion rate 
The treatment completion rate is defined as the proportion of patients who complete the 
protocol treatment among all eligible patients in each arm. The following descriptive statistics 
are reported: the number of patients who complete induction chemotherapy, the number of 
patients who complete consolidation chemotherapy or have a cystectomy, with four cycles of 
gemcitabine and cisplatin. 
13.5.3 To estimate the grade 3+ adverse event 
Tabulation of acute and late GU, GI, and hematologic adverse event s and the number of 
patients who complete adjuvant chemotherapy will be reported by [CONTACT_24975], grade, and attribution 
of adverse event based on the CTCAE v3.0. in each arm. Acute adverse events are defined as 
toxicities that occur from the start of treatment to the end of treatment. Late adverse events are 
defined as toxicities that occur from the end of treatment to 180 days . Late adverse events will 
be evaluated at 180 days from the end of treatment . The grade 3+ adverse event rate is 
calculated as the proportion of patients who have acute or late adverse events among all 
eligible patients. 
 
 
    31    RTOG 0712 Logistic regression will be used to model the distribution of grade 3+ acute adverse events. 
Both unadjusted and adjusted odd ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be 
computed. 
 
The time to late grade 3+ adverse events will be estimated using the cumulative incidence 
method. Death without a grade 3+ adverse event will be considered as a competing risk. Alive 
patients without late grade 3+ adverse events will be censored at the time of the analysis.  
13.5.4 To estimate the efficacy of transurethral surgery with either FCI or GI in achieving a complete 
response of primary tumor (See Section 11.4.3).  Logistic regression will be used to model the 
distribution of the complete response of the primary tumor. Both unadjusted and adjusted odd 
ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be computed. 
13.5.[ADDRESS_1285297] gender, age. Both unadjusted 
and adjusted odd ratios and the respective 95% confidence interval will be computed. 
13.5.[ADDRESS_1285298] of specific correlative aims 
with appropriate statistical considerations.  At minimum, her2/neu, EGFR1, p53, p21, pRb, p16, 
and bcl2 will be explored since these markers have shown promise in predicting the outcome of 
bladder cancer patients.6-[ADDRESS_1285299] the prognostic vales of biomarkers.  A 
genomic, proteomic, or metabolomic biomarker will be categorized into two subgroups (not 
receiving cystectomy vs. receiving cystectomy) based upon previously defined (or 
hypothesized) cut-off points and these two groups will be referred to as favorable and 
unfavorable risk groups.  The patients with genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic biomarkers 
will be compared with the patients without a value for that biomarker to determine if there are 
any differences with respect to distribution of baseline.  We also want to know if there is a 
difference in time to distant metastasis and time to death due to any cause between these two 
groups. The null (H 0) and alternative (H A) hypotheses for survival distribution (S) are  
 
  H 0: S0 (t) ≥ S 1(t)  vs.  H A: S0 (t) < S 1(t) , where t is time   
 
 Tests will be performed to see if one group is statistically significantly better than the other in 
the absence of distant metastasis and overall survival.  However, the selection of the cut-off 
point for each biomarker is not established.  If the hypothesized cut-off points do not yield 
statistical significance, other cut-off points may be evaluated. Therefore, various cut-off points 
are evaluated for their statistical significance. To correct the problem from the multiple testing, 
the Bonferroni correction will be used.  The overall survival functions will be estimated by [CONTACT_17680]-Meier method14 and will be tested for the overall survival difference between the 
favorable and unfavorable groups using the log-rank test15,16.  We will use the cause-specific 
hazard rate approach17,[ADDRESS_1285300] of the biomarkers.  This approach will be employed to account for as much 
variation as possible for each outcome before it is tested.  It is entirely possible that factors 
shown to be prognostic in other published series may not be found prognostic here. 
13.5.7     Descriptive analysis for AUA Symptom score  
It will be collected at baseline and at 3 years for information regarding bladder capacity,   
compliance, detrusor instability and leak pressures, and a partial assessment of "bother factor" 
from the symptom score. The change from baseline to 3 years for each patient will be 
calculated and descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) will be computed. 
13.5.8  Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_914578] (see Section 13.5.9) will be prepared every [ADDRESS_1285301] (DSMB) for their review every 6 months, and they will make a 
 
    32    RTOG 0712 recommendation regarding continuation of this study. Also, this study will be monitored by [CONTACT_914619] 3.0. If at any time a grade 5 adverse event definitely, probably, or possibly 
related to treatment is reported, it will be reviewed by [CONTACT_20985], the study statistician, the 
RTOG GU Cancer Committee chair, and the RTOG Executive Committee. CRFs, source 
documentation, and a statistical report summarizing the study data will be reviewed as soon as 
possible. During this review, accrual will be suspended if necessary. Following this review, the 
study chairs, the study statistician, the RTOG GU Cancer Committee chair, and the RTOG 
Executive Committee will discuss the findings and make a decision about amending the 
protocol and/or continuing the study. 
13.5.9 Interim Reports 
Interim reports will be prepared every six months until the final analysis. In general, the interim 
reports will include information about: 
 patient accrual rate with projected completion rate; 
 pretreatment characteristics of patients accrued; 
 compliance rate of treatment per protocol; 
 the frequencies and severity of adverse events due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 
13.5.10  CDUS Reporting  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS) version 3.0. 
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due 
January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31. 
 
13.6 Gender and Minorities  (2/6/14) 
In conformance with the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of [ADDRESS_1285302] to the 
inclusion of women and minorities in clinical research, the possible difference in any of the above 
endpoints between men and women, or whites and non-whites, will be investigated. The prior 
RTOG bladder cancer trial, 0233, accrued about 7% non-white patients and 19% women. With 
the proposed [ADDRESS_1285303] 
the difference in the primary endpoint between race groups and/or gender groups. Nonetheless, 
the descriptive statistics for each of these groups will be reported.

A Phase II Randomized Study For Patients With Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer 
Evaluating Transurethral Surgery And Concomitant Chemoradiation By [CONTACT_914622] B ID 
Irradiation Plus 5- Fluorouracil And Cisplatin Or QD Irradiation Plus Gemcitabine 
Followed By [CONTACT_914592]/Cisplatin Adjuvant 
Chemotherapy 
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to you.   
Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision 
about taking part.  You may discuss your decision with your friends and family.  You can also discuss it 
with your health care team.  If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more 
explanation.  
 
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have  bladder cancer.  
 
Why is this study being done? 
The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and /or bad) chemotherapy combined with external 
radiation therapy and possible removal of your bladder has on you and your cancer. The chemotherapy drugs 
(cisplatin, 5-Fluorouracil [5-FU], and gemcitabine) used in this study are not experimental drugs. These drugs 
have been used in the treatment of many patients with tumors such as yours. This research is being done 
because we do not know whether one combination of drugs with radiation is superior to another in the treatment 
of your disease. 
 
The usual treatment for your type of bladder cancer is surgical removal of the bladder and the surgical 
construction of an alternative bladder that usually requires a permanent opening (stoma) in your abdomen for 
urine drainage.  Also, with the standard treatment, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be recommended 
following surgical removal of the bladder. 
 
This study uses similar therapi[INVESTIGATOR_914580], but chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given 
before removal of the bladder is considered. In this study, bladder removal is advised if, after chemotherapy and 
radiation, your tumor has not completely disappeared, if your tumor comes back, or if it gets larger. 
 
There are 2 treatment groups in this study: 
1) Patients who receive cisplatin and 5-FU chemotherapy and radiation twice per day. 
2) Patients who receive gemcitabine chemotherapy and radiation once per day. 
 
If you agree to participate in this study, you will receive one of these 2 treatments. 
 
How many people will take part in the study?  (2/6/14)  
 
About 64  people will take part in this study.   
 
What will happen if I take part in this research study?   (4/14/11)  
If you take part in this study, you will have a surgical procedure called a transurethral bladder resection. Under 
sedation (anesthesia), a lighted tube is inserted through the urethra (the small tube-like structure that allows urine 
to empty from the bladder) into the bladder. The surgeon examines your bladder tumor through this fiberoptic 
scope. The surgeon then will remove your tumor as thoroughly as is safely possible using an electric current. 
Some of your tissue around the tumor also will be removed for biopsy.  
 
    35    RTOG 0712  
Before you begin the study …  
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures. These exams, tests or procedures are part of 
regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study.  If you have had some of them recently, 
they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor. 
 History and physical exam  
 Cystoscopy, which is a bladder exam through a fiberoptic scope (a short procedure done in your 
doctor’s office) 
 Bladder biopsy (a small outpatient surgery requiring anesthesia) 
 Blood tests 
 For women who are able to have children, a test prior to study entry to see if you are pregnant 
 Urinalysis, which involves the collection and examination of your urine. It involves a number of 
tests to detect and measure various compounds that pass through the urine. 
 Transurethral bladder tumor resection (TURBT): Some patients will require more than one 
TURBT surgery if the TURBT surgery that is performed prior to study entry does not remove the 
entire tumor. (If the tumor was removed completely at that time, no further surgery will be 
required).  
 Bone scan  
 CT scan of your pelvic and abdominal area: A CT scan is a study using x-rays to look at one part 
of your body. 
 Chest CT scan 
 Your bladder function may be test ed 
 You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire on urinary symptoms and function (AUA), which will 
take approximately 10 minutes to complete.   
  
During the study … 
 
You will be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below. Randomization means that you 
are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364]. Neither you nor your study doctor can choose the group you will be in.  
You will have approximately an equal chance of being placed in one of the two groups below, and your 
treatment will begin within 8 weeks after the transurethral bladder resection (removal of your tumor). 
 
If you are in group 1 (often called "Arm 1 ") you will receive the drugs cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-
FU). You will receive cisplatin three days a week by [CONTACT_914623] a vein (intravenously) 
along with special fluid treatment. You will also receive 5-Fluorouracil three days a week by [CONTACT_914624] 
24 hours into a vein (intravenously) during the first and last week of your radiation treatment. You will 
receive two radiation treatments each day, Monday through Friday, at least [ADDRESS_1285304] daily radiation treatment. The chemotherapy and radiation therapy will take about 2 ½ 
weeks to complete.  Chemotherapy will be delivered on an outpatient basis.  There will be 26 radiation 
treatments delivered over this period of time.  
 
If you are in group 2 (often called "Arm 2 ") you will receive the drug gemcitabine. You will receive 
gemcitabine two days a week by [CONTACT_914624] 30 minutes into a vein (intravenously) along with special 
fluid treatment. You will receive one radiation treatment each day, Monday through Friday. Each radiation 
treatment will be approximately [ADDRESS_1285305] one of the following treatments: 
 If your tumor has completely disappeared, you will receive the chemotherapy and radiation therapy 
you received before the re-examination of your tumor for an additional 2-[ADDRESS_1285306] 4 months of additional chemotherapy (with cisplatin and gemcitabine) to 
reduce the chance of cancer spreading to other parts of your body. 
 
 If your tumor has not completely disappeared, and you are medically fit for surgery, surgical 
removal of your bladder within 3-[ADDRESS_1285307] 4 
months of additional chemotherapy (with cisplatin and gemcitabine) to reduce the chance of cancer 
spreading to other parts of your body. 
 
If your bladder is not removed , you will undergo careful and frequent evaluations of the bladder through 
a fiberoptic scope  (cystoscopy), a test that allows your doctor to look at the in ner lining of the bladder and 
the urethra ( a small tube-like structure that allows urine to empty from the bladder) . Should the bladder 
tumor c
ome back or get bigger, then surgical removal of your bladder may be recommended. 
 
During chemoradiotherapy: 
 Weekly measurement of your weight  
 Weekly blood tests  
 Fiberoptic scope evaluation  
 Urine cytology (a series of tests that are done to identify all the different types of cells and other 
substances in your urine)  
 
When you are finished receiving chemoradiotherapy (consolidation) and before additional 
chemoradiotherapy:  
You will need these tests and procedures 8- 10 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy: 
 History and physical exam  
 Bladder exam through a fiberoptic scope 
 Urine cytology (a series of tests that are done to identify all the different types of cells and other 
substances in your urine) 
 Bladder biopsy 
 Blood tests 
 CT scan of your abdominal and pelvic area and your chest 
 Bone scan 
 
During additional chemotherapy: 
You will need these tests during additional chemotherapy. They are part of regular cancer care. They are being 
done more often because you are in this study: 
 Weekly measurements of your weight 
 Weekly blood tests 
 Assessment of your ability to carry out activities of daily living 
 
When you are finished with protocol treatment:  
You will need these tests and procedures during follow-up visits after the completion of chemoradiotherapy: 
 History and physical exam, blood tests, a bladder exam through fiberoptic scope, cystoscopy, urine 
cytology, and bladder biopsy of the original area every [ADDRESS_1285308] scan will be 
performed every 6 months after completion of treatment. 
 If two tumor site biopsies are negative, repeat biopsies are not needed.  
 For patients who still have their bladder, your bladder function may be tested in the third year afte r 
completion of treatment

    38    RTOG 0712 Can I stop being in the study? 
 
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell your study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_241342].  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.  
 
It is important to tell your study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_914581]/her.  Another reason to tell your study doctor that you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_914582]-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. 
 
Your doctor may decide to take you off this study at any time if your doctor believes it is in your medical best 
interest, if funding for this study is stopped, if your condition worsens,  if you do not follow the study rules, or if the 
study is stopped.  You may also be taken off this study if new information becomes available about how to better 
prevent growth of bladder cancer.  
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
 
You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any 
side effects.  However, researchers don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or 
very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side effects. Many side effects go 
away soon after you stop chemotherapy or radiation. In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or 
may never go away.    
 
In general, there is a higher risk of complications for you when surgery follows radiation and chemotherapy.  
Surgery and bladder reconstruction can be more difficult and the choices for bladder reconstruction are limited. 
 
 In addition, if chemotherapy fails to decrease the size of the tumor, your cancer can be more 
advanced at the time of surgery. 
 
You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.    
 
Risks and side effects related to radiation therapy to the pelvis include those which are:

    41    RTOG 0712 Risks of Surgery  
If removal of your bladder is necessary: 
In men, after radiation, the operation generally includes removal of the bladder, the pelvic lymph nodes, the 
seminal vesicles, and the prostate.  As a result, there is likely to be loss of erections. In wom en, the operation 
may include removal of the bladder, vagina, uterus, tubes, and ovaries.  As a result, women will not be able to 
have children and may find intercourse difficult due to vaginal dryness, shortening or narrowing. Also during 
surgery, a urinary diversion procedure is necessary; this probably will include placement of a permanent opening 
(stoma) created in the abdomen and a bag placed over it to collect the urine.  In some circumstances other types 
of urinary diversion may be possible, based on the judgment of your surgeon. 
 
After bladder removal, the major complications that can occur include infection, heart attack, stroke, severe 
bleeding, blood clots in the legs or the lung and injury to the rectum or other areas of the intestine. This type of 
injury may require a second temporary stoma to allow the intestine to heal. Injury to the intestine may also lead to 
abnormal connections (fistulas) between the intestines and other organs.  Minor complications include wound 
infection and delayed hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914584] (ileus).  
 
Reproductive risks:  You should not become pregnant or father a baby [CONTACT_914627]. Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035]. It is 
important you understand that you need to use birth control while on this study. Check with your study doctor 
about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them. Some methods might not be approved 
for use in this study.  
 
As described above, radiation therapy to the pelvis will result in sterility. Surgery to remove the bladder and other 
organs also will result in loss of erections, and women will not be able to bear children.  
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. 
 
Are there benefits to taking part in the study? 
 
Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better.  While researchers hope chemotherapy plus 
radiation and removal of the bladder (for some patients) will be more useful against bladder cancer compared to 
the usual treatment (surgical removal of the bladder with or without chemotherapy and radiation after tumor 
removal), there is no proof of this yet. It is also not clear what constitutes the ideal regimen of chemotherapy and 
radiation.  We hope that concurrent gemcitabine with once a day radiation will be more effective than cisplatin and 
5-fluorouracil with twice a day radiation, but there is no proof of this. We do know that the information from this 
study will help researchers learn more about the use of chemotherapy plus radiation and possible removal of the 
bladder as a treatment for bladder cancer. This information could help future cancer patients. 
 
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study? 
 
Your other choices may include: 
 Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study . This could include the following 
options, either alone or in combination with each other:  
o Radiation therapy 
o Chemotherapy 
o Bladder removal  
 Taking part in another study 
 Getting no treatment . (With this choice, your tumor could continue to grow and your disease could 
spread.) 
 
Talk to your study doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.

Consent Form for Use of Tissue, Blood, and Urine for Research 
 
About Using Tissue, Blood, and Urine for Research (4/14/11) 
 
You have had or you will have a biopsy (or surgery) to see if you have cancer. Your doctor has removed or will 
remove some body tissue to do some tests. The results of these tests will be given to you by [CONTACT_914629].  
 
We would like to keep some of the tissue that is left over for future research. If you agree, this tissue will be kept 
and may be used in research to learn more about cancer and other diseases. Please read the information sheet 
called "How is Tissue Used for Research" to learn more about tissue research. This information sheet is available 
to all at the following web site: http://cdp.cancer.gov/humanSpecimens/ethical_collection/patient.htm  . 
 
In addition, if you agree to participate in this part of the study, you will have blood drawn and urine collected 
before you start chemoradiation, three times during your treatment, at your 1-year follow-up visit, and in case your 
tumor comes back when this is detected. We would like to keep about [ADDRESS_1285311] us and let us know that you do not want us to use your tissue, blood, and urine. Then any 
tissue, blood, and urine that remain will no longer be used for research and the tissue will be returned to the 
institution that submitted it. Blood and urine would be destroyed.  
 
 
    44    RTOG 0712 In the future, people who do research may need to know more about your health. While the study doctor/ 
institution may give them reports about your health, they will not give them your name, address, phone number, or 
any other information that will let the researchers know who you are.  
 
Sometimes tissue is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in families). Even if your 
tissue, blood, and urine are used for this kind of research, the results will not be put in your health records.  
Your tissue, blood, and urine will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your 
tissue, blood, and urine may help to develop new treatments for cancer in the futur e.  
 
Benefits   
 
The benefits of research using tissue, blood, and urine include learning more about what causes cancer and other 
diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them.  
 
 
Risks  
 
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records. We will do our best to make sure that your 
personal information will be kept private.  The chance that this information will be given to someone else is very small.

 FFPE Specimens: 
o Slides should be shipped in a plastic slide holder/slide box. Place a small wad of padding in top of the 
container. If you can hear the slides shaki ng it is likely that they will break during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
o FFPE Blocks can be wrapped with paper towel, or placed in a cardboard box with padding. Do not wrap 
blocks with bubble wrap. Place padding in top of container so that if you shake the container the blocks 
are not shaking. If you can hear the slides shaking it is likely that they will break during shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   
o Slides, Blocks, or Plugs can be shipped ambient or with a cold pack either by [CONTACT_744054] (USPS) to the USPS address ([ZIP_CODE]) or by [CONTACT_280573] ([ZIP_CODE]). Do NOT 
ship on Dry Ice . 
 
 Frozen Specimens:  
o Multiple cases may be shipped in the same cooler, but make sure each one is in a separate bag and 
clearly identified. 
o Place specimens and absorbent shippi[INVESTIGATOR_660414] (at least 7 lbs). 
There should be plenty of dry ice under and above the specimens. If the volume of specimens is 
greater than the volume of dry ice then ship in a larger Styrofoam box, or two separate boxes. Any 
Styrofoam box can be used, as long as it is big enough. 
o Specimens received thawed due to insufficient dry ice or shippi[INVESTIGATOR_743989].  
o Send frozen specimens via overnight courier to the address above. Specimens should only be shipped 
Monday through Wednesday (Monday-Tuesday for Canada) to prevent thawing due to delivery delays. 
Saturday or holiday deliveries cannot be accepted. Samples can be stored frozen at - 80 C until ready 
to ship.

Protocol Title: Evaluating the addition of obturator nerve block to adductor canal block for total knee 
arthroplasty  
Research Question: Does the addition of obturator nerve block to a regional anesthesia technique with 
adductor canal block and local infiltration analgesia for total knee replacement surgery reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_219110]?  
 
Primary objective: Compare the rate of IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_219111] a combination of 
adductor canal block, obturator nerve block, and local infiltration analgesia at the surgical site versus 
patients who receive adductor canal block and lo cal infiltration analgesia.  
 
Secondary objectives:  
a. Measure the severity of pain at rest using an [ADDRESS_263335] -operative nausea/vomiting in patients who receive adductor canal block, 
obturator nerve block, and local infiltration analgesia versus patients who receive adductor can al block 
and local infiltration  
d. Measure time to ambulation in patients who receive adductor canal block, obturator nerve 
block, and local infiltration analgesia versus patients who receive adductor canal block and local 
infiltration   
e. Compare analge sia satisfaction score at time of first postoperative followup visit in patients who 
receive adductor canal block, obturator nerve block, and local infiltration analgesia versus patients who 
receive adductor canal block and local infiltration.  
 
Background  
The management of postoperative pain after total knee arthroplasties remains a challenging issue.  Even 
though postoperative pain typi[INVESTIGATOR_219112], patients are encouraged and 
expected to start physical therapy and ambulate as soon as possible because early rehabilitation may 
lead to improved long -term functional status of the knee.[ADDRESS_263336] been employed for postoperative pain management; the aim of such strategies is to utilize 
different mech anisms of action to provide superior analgesia while limiting side effects and adverse 
events.[ADDRESS_263337] examined this particular combination of regional 
anesthetic techniques.

Description of the Study Design  
If you agree to participate in this research study, the following information describes what may be 
involved.  
You study involvem ent will begin on the day of your surgery at Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Prior to starting 
surgery, you will undergo two regional anesthesia blocks. You will receive an intravenous medication 
called midazolam to reduce anxiety and help tolerate the procedures. O ne of them is called the 
adductor canal block, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_219113]. An 
ultrasound will be used to identify the location of nerves in your upper leg, and a numbing medication 
called bupi[INVESTIGATOR_219114]. The other is called the obturator nerve 
block, which is being evaluated in this research study. Once again, an ultrasound will be used to identify 
the location of nerves in your upper leg close to the groin area, wh ich will be appropriately draped. Once 
this area is identified, a solution will be injected which is either bupi[INVESTIGATOR_219115]. Once these procedures are completed, the rest of the anesthesia for the 
surgery w ill proceed the same as if you are not part of the research study. This includes a spi[INVESTIGATOR_219116], and any sedation given by [CONTACT_219121].   
After your surgery, you will be taken to a surgery recovery area before you are able to go to your own 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223]. There, you will be given a button to push to receive an intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]. 
You will have the freedom to decide  when to receive the medication but it will be set up so that you 
cannot receive more than your doctors intended. You will also have nausea medications available. The 
study doctor will ask you about your pain level and nausea level. The doctor will also re view how much 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_219117].   
You will periodically be asked questions regarding your pain and nausea and vomiting during the rest of 
your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. Your performance during your physical rehabilitation sessions will also be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_219122].  
At your first postoperative visit with your surgeon after your discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], you will be 
asked about your pain levels after your discharge and your overall satisfaction with your pain control.  
The st udy treatment you get will be chosen by [CONTACT_3364], like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. Neither you nor the study 
doctor will choose what study treatment you get. You will have an equal chance of being given each 
study treatment. Neither you nor the study doctor will know w hich study treatment you are getting. This 
information could be obtained in an emergency, however.   
 
Description of Procedures Being Performed  
Subjects who consent to and are scheduled for total knee arthroplasty under regional anesthesia will be 
invited to participate in the study during a routine preoperative visit prior to surgery. The details of the 
study will be reviewed and written informed consent will be obtained.  
The patient will be randomized into the study group or the placebo group. On the day  of surgery, the 
group allocation will be revealed to an anesthesiologist not part of the research study, who will receive 
specific instructions to prepare a injectate solution for the obturator nerve block, which will consist of 
0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_219118].  
The patient will receive midazolam for anxiolysis at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. An 
adductor canal block with 10mL 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_219119]. An obturator nerve block will be 
performed with the previously prepared injectate solution. Patients will undergo spi[INVESTIGATOR_57276] 
a 3mL solution of 0.75% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. Sedation may be administered during surgery at the discretion of 
the anesthesiologist.  
Total knee arthroplasty will b e performed by [CONTACT_219123] a standard medial parapatellar approach and hand -mixed cementing 
techniques. A local intraarticular injection will be performed intraoperatively by [CONTACT_11065], as is 
routinely done for total knee arthroplasties by [CONTACT_219124], regardless of research 
involvement.  
In the Post Anesthesia Care Unit, the patient will be administered hydromorphone using intravenous 
patient -controlled  analgesia (PCA). Fentanyl will be administered if hydromorphone is not tolerated. 
Additional oral oxycodone consumption will also be recorded.  
Relevant preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data will be obtained from the anesthesia 
record, the EPIC electronic medical record. The patient will also be interviewed by [CONTACT_219125] -discharge follow -up visit to obtain analgesia satisfaction scores.  
 
Description of the Source of Records that will be used to collect data about s ubjects  
As part of this research project, the research team at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307](s) involved in the research will collect 
your name, date of birth, telephone number, date of surgery, date of discharge, and medical record 
number.  
The researchers will also get i nformation from your medical record including your electronic anesthesia 
record and electronic medical record that documents your postoperative care at Mount Sinai. They will 
also get information from your first postoperative visit with your surgeon.    
During the study the researchers will gather information by [CONTACT_219126].  
Description of data that will be collected including long -term follow -up 
In all disclosures outside of  Mount Sinai, you will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, 
address, telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier unless disclosure of the direct 
identifier is required by [CONTACT_2371]. Some records and information disclosed may be identi fied with a unique 
code number. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_219120] a locked file, 
or will be securely stored electronically. The code will not be used to link the information back to you 
without your permission,  unless the law requires it, or rarely if the Institutional Review Board allows it 
after determining that there would be minimal risk to your privacy. It is possible that a sponsor or their 
representatives, a data coordinating office, a contract research o rganization, may come to inspect your 
records. Even if those records are identifiable when inspected, the information leaving the institution 
will be stripped of direct identifiers.  Additionally, when applicable, the monitors, auditors, the IRB, the 
Offic e of Human Subjects Protection (OHRP) of the Department of Health and Human Services as well as 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be granted direct access to your medical records for 
verification of the research procedures and data. OHRP and FDA are authorized to remove information 
with identifiers if necessary to complete their task. By [CONTACT_219127]. We may publish the results of this research. However, we will keep your name [CONTACT_219130].  
 
Your authorization for use of your protected health information for this specific study does not expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312].  
 
Description of instruments created by [CONTACT_219128], 
intraoperative, and postoperative data relevant to the study. Preoperative data to be collected includes 
patient demographics including age and gender. Intraoperative data include duration of surgery, total 
narcotics administered durin g surgery, and total fluids administered. Postoperative data include total 
narcotics administered, pain scores at regular various intervals, incidence of postoperative nausea and 
vomiting, and time to ambulation. Data will also be extracted from the patien t's first completed physical 
therapy session, including total distance ambulated, pain at time of assessment, and functional mobility 
impairment percentage. Post -discharge data to be collected include total dosage of narcotics used after 
discharge, pain sc ore, and any complications.

1.1 Study Disease  
 
Premalignant vulvar lesions are extremely common with the incidence increasing over 
400% in the past 30 years, totaling up to 7,500 case s in the [LOCATION_002] annually.1 Surgical 
excision is recommended when invasive carcinoma cannot be excluded. Depending on 
lesion(s) size and locat ion, in order to achieve a 1 cm disease -free margin, some excisions 
can be extensive and at high -risk for wound separation and/or surgical site infection (SSI).[ADDRESS_826278] predominantly been studied in the context of radical vulvectomie s performed for 
cancer staging. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_620810] (57%), there is a lack of data regarding the risk of 
infection following conservative vulvar excisions.1 As such, there are no evidence -based 
guidelines regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for this patient population.    
To address this gap in the literature, we performed a retrospective cohort study at our institution which included all vulvar surgeries performed for premalignant lesions from January 2007 to 2017. Of 534 patients included, the overall wound complication r ate was 
30%. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends prophylactic antibiotics for procedures such as anterior colporrhaphy which likely confer a similar infection risk to simple vulvectomies, but makes no recommendations about vulvar excision. If baseline wound complication rates approach 30% as demonstrated in our preliminary data, clinical practice of antibiotic administration should be addressed. Before clinical practice recommendations change we propose to test the cen tral 
hypothesis  that antibiotic prophylaxis will reduce the incidence of a composite wound 
complication (wound breakdown, SSI, seroma, and/or hematoma) within 30 days postoperatively. We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_620811] a double -blinded randomized 
control led clinical trial of women who undergo a vulvar excision for a premalignant 
lesions. 
 
1.2 Study Rationale  
 
The use of antibiotics in common gynecologic procedures such as hysterectomy, laparoscopy, and surgical abortion is well established and has been descri bed in many 
randomized control trials and meta -analyses.
3-5 The rate of wound infection after vulvar 
excision for premalignant lesions (7.5%) i s equal to or greater than that of vaginal 
hysterectomy (7 -14%), abdominal hysterectomy (1- 6%) for which antibiotic prophylaxis 
is routinely used. With the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative infection rates 
decrease greater than 20% for vaginal h ysterectomy and 15% for abdominal 
hysterectomy.[ADDRESS_826279] regarding antibiotic prophylaxis.  
Protocol Version: 09/10//[ADDRESS_826280] antibiotic adminis tration is associated with antibiotic -resistant 
bacteria, and over 15% of patients will have adverse reactions to antibiotics ranging from skin rashes and diarrhea to anaphylaxis.
[ADDRESS_826281] the use of antibiotic 
prophylaxis for these excisions would improve evidence -based practice standards for 
women’s health.  
 
We conducted a  single -center, retrospective cohort study evaluating all vulvar excisions 
performed for a benign indication at our institution from 1/2007- 1/2017. 534 patients 
were included, 227 patients who received preoperative antibiotics and 310 who did not. The over all wound complication rate was 28.8% with an infection rate of 6.9%. There 
was no difference in wound complication rates between patients who received preoperative antibiotics and those who did not (30.4% vs 27.4%, p=0.45). However, because this was a ret rospective study it is possible that confounders such as inherent 
differences in the patient populations, clinical practice of the surgeons, or confounding by [CONTACT_620826]. Curr ent tobacco use (aOR 1.90, 95% CI 1.26- 2.87), and concomitant 
reconstructive flap or graft (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.02 -2.73) were associated with increased 
wound complications. In short, the wound complication rate following vulvar surgery for nonmalignant lesio ns is substantial. It is well established that patients with wound 
complications require increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_464931], and decreased quality of life .
[ADDRESS_826282] reliable data to determine the role of 
prophylactic antibiotics to decrease the wound complication rate. We plan to perform a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_620812] 50 patients. Relying on retrospective data is difficult given documentation of wound complications and we only had <50% of patients who received antibiotics.  
 
 
 
Protocol Version: 09/10//2020   Page 8 of 25  2.0 OBJECTIVES  
 
2.1 Primary Objective  
Evaluate for the difference in wound complications between women who receive 
antibiotic prophylaxis and those who do not:   
a) Wound complication will be  defined as  a composite outcome that includes  wound 
breakdown, sterile site infection, hematoma, seroma di agnosed within 30 days 
after excision.  
• Sterile Site Infection (SSI)  – defined as purulent drainage, cellulitis, 
abscess, or a wound that requires drainage, debridement or antibiotics 
associated with a clinical diagnosis of infection.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
Determine the clinical risk factors that correlate with vulvar wound complications.  
b) Demographic variables that predispose  patients  to infection  including medical 
history of diabetes, liver disease, human immunodeficiency virus, chronic kidney 
disease, cong estive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
peripheral vasculature disease, dementia, connective tissues disease, leukemia, lymphoma, peptic ulcer disease, or hypertension. We will also record steroid use or the use of other immunosuppress ive medications.  
c) Evaluation of vulvar hygiene through physician and patient survey  
d) Incidence of adverse events to antibiotic use  
 
2.3 Tertiary Objectives  
Evaluate for differences in the followi ng outcomes between women who receive 
antibiotic prophylaxis and those who do not : 
 
a) Inpatient re -admission for postoperative wound care within 30 days of surgery  
b) Antibiotic safety measures including allergic reaction type and severity

Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study.  Patients will also be identified by [CONTACT_22705], middle, and last initials.  If the pa tient has no middle initial, 
a dash will be used . 
 
4.[ADDRESS_826285] the opportunity to opt out of the study  over the next two weeks  in which case their 
patients will not be screened for eligibility. If they agree to participation their patients will be included in the recruitment process noted below.   All potential women who are scheduled with OBGYN faculty or fellows for vulvar surgery will be identified and screened for eligibility prior to their preoperative appointme nt. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_620813] (eligibility checklist). PHI is obtained from the electronic medical record and if not available from the  electronic medical record than physician operating room schedules 
will be used to determine eligibility. The attending physician will be emailed by a research assistant regarding the patient’s eligibility for the study. Attending physician emails will be obtained from a Washington University ListServs. During their preoperative or anesthesia appointment, the patient will receive a pre- surgical packet 
which is given to all patients undergoing gynecologic surgery at Washington University. This packet will include a brief description (Appendix A) of the study and contact 
[CONTACT_620827] a member of the research team who will be available if the patient should have any questions about the study. At either of these appointments, or otherwi se 
on the day of surgery, a member of the research and surgical team will discuss the study with the patient and assess their willingness to be enrolled in the study. It will be emphasized to the patients that other than receiving antibiotics or not there will be no 
differences in their medical care regardless of whether they choose to participate in this study. All potential participants will be given the opportunity to have all of their questions regarding the research study answered prior to making a dec ision to participate.  
 If the patient  consent s to the study an informed consent form will be signed with the 
patient  at any of these encounters and she will be given a copy of the signed, dated 
consent . The PI [INVESTIGATOR_620814].   
We are not offering any incentives or financial remuneration  for participation in the 
study .  Patients who decline participation will receive prophylactic antibiotics as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_620828].

when require d. The research assistant will then document the results in a source 
document that will rem ain in the patient's research record.  Once a participant consents to 
be enroll ed in the study  and is deemed eligible , the research assistant will  randomize the 
patient using REDCap.   
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_620815]. The patients 
will not be aware if they receive antibiotics given the antibiotics are flushed through the 
patient’s IV line which they will have regardless of their assigned study arm. The 
research assistant will disclose the randomization grou p to the anesthesiologist who will 
screen the patient for allergies and then obtain the appropriate antibiotics from the 
pharmacy and administer the antibiotics as appropriate. These will be administered prior 
to the procedure and so the surgeon will remai n blinded to the administration. Standard 
practice regarding antibiotic prophylaxis is not clear, and therefore some surgeons use 
antibiotics preoperative and some do not. Thus, this study will not result in increased cost 
to the patient.   
 
5.0 RESEARCH /TREATM ENT  PLAN  
 
5.1 Intervention  
 
The administration of pre operative prophylactic antibiotics will be as per the 
randomization protocol. Women randomized to prophylactic antibiotics will receive a cefazolin  as per ACOG guidelines. If she has a penicillin allergy the n clindamycin will be 
used. Prophylactic antibiotics  should be administered prior to skin incision. A traditional 
surgical timeout will be performed. During the timeout it will be announced that the patient is on study. The surgeon will then turn to anesthesia and ask “whichever arm we are randomized to are we okay to proceed?”. Once the anesthesia team answers yes indicating the antibiotics have been infused if appropri ate, t he surgical procedure will  
then be performed in the normal fashion. The skin and subcutaneous tissues will be 
opened either with a scalpel or with Bovie  electrocautery  on cutting current. Closure of 
subcutaneous tissue and skin will be performed at t he discretion of the attending surgeon. 
Suturing will be performed under the supervi sion of the attending, fellow, or  a member of 
the surgical team considered to have received appropriate training.  At the time of surgery 
an operative  data collection sheet (Appendix B ) will be filled out by [CONTACT_620829](s), method of incision and skin closure, 
suture used, if the subcutaneous tissue is closed,if local anesthesia was used, and if so, the type and when injection was placed (before incision or after closure) .  
Protocol Version: 09/10//[ADDRESS_826288] operative vi sit 7- 30 days postoperatively. D ata from the patient’s 
physical exam assessment (Appendix C)  and administered patient survey (Appendix D) 
will be collected  at this postoperative visit. If a patient is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_620816] c linic follow -up, the physical exam, assessment and surveys will be 
administered as an inpatient as per the protocol. The required follow -up data will be 
collected in telephone calls and/or at clinic visits until 30( +/- 10) days postoperatively. If 
patients present greater than 40 days postoperatively  they will be considered los t to 
follow -up. All data from admissions to outpatient facilities prior to 30 (+/- 10) days 
postoperatively will be included in our analysis . 
 
5.3 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women with amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding and women who have had a tubal ligation) are required to have a negative serum/urine pregnancy test within seven days of surgery.  
 
5.4 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue the study , involvement in 
the study should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented appropriately.  
 Follow -up assessment may continue for 30 days (+/- 10) after surgery  or until one of the 
following criteria applies: 
 
• Death  
• Loss to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as per 
standard of care for a post operative patient .

surgery. This rate will be calculated as a composite from the postoperative follow -up forms  as well 
as from chart review of the electronic medical record including up to 30 (+/- 10) days

Protocol Version: 09/10//2020   Page 19 of 25  11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Study design overview : This study is designed as a randomiz ed phase II  clinical 
trial. This design will provide a direct assessment of the null hypothesis that there 
is no improvement in vulvar wound complication rate s associated with  antibiotic 
prophylaxis . All patients on this study will be randomized by [CONTACT_620832].  The sequence of treatment 
assignments will be concealed from the patients , the surgeons, the Principal 
Investigator, and the research staff performing the analysis . Blocked 
Randomization with equal probabilities to the two treatment regimens will be 
carried out following study registration.   
 
Randomization will not be stratified by [CONTACT_31453].    
12.0 Data collection: The principal parameters to be collected, analyzed and reported to determine the relative efficacy of the tw o treatment regimens are:  
12.1.1 Outcome measure: Wound disruption or infection occurring within 30( +/- 10) 
days of the primary surgery.  Incidence of wound infection (defined as purulent 
drainage, cellulitis, abscess or a wound that requires drainage, debridement or antibiotics associated with a c linical diagnosis of infection ). Demographic factors 
as well as secondary outcomes such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715], antibiotic safety measures  will be collected . Data regarding vulvar hygiene will be obtained from 
patient surveys.   
 
12.2 Accrual rate, sample size and duration : According to institutional data about 60 
patients undergo simple vulvectomy or wide local excision for benign or 
premalignant indications annually. We anticipate it will take approximately one year to accrue the 50 e valuable patients necessary for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  This accounts 
for the possibly number of refusals and screen failures.   
 
12.3 Hypotheses, planning parameter s, and sample size justification:  
 
Primary hypothesis:  This study will determine the effectiveness of antibiotic 
prophylaxis in reducing the rate of SSI after a vulvar excision for a premalignant lesion. We hypothesize  that women who receive antibiotic prophylaxis will have 
lower rates of composite wound compl ications than their counterparts who do not 
receive antibiotics.  The design of this study will provide evidence of benefit with 
regard to wound complication rate.   
 Planning parameters : The patient population selected for this study is all women 
undergoin g vulvar surgery for benign or premalignant lesions.  
 Sample size justification : The total sample size of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9962] 50 evaluable 
women (prophylactic antibiotics, n=25 vs. no antibiotics, n=25) to provide preliminary data for grant funding for a l arge adequately powered RCT. This 
study will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_620822]: 09/10//2020   Page 20 of 25  how long it takes to recruit 50 patients. Based on our prior analysis, we see an 
average of 53- 55 patients per ye ar who meet our study criteri a. Ultimately w e 
estimate a sample size of 293 women per group will be needed for 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful 33% difference in wound complication rates between study groups. See trial design in section 11.5.  
12.4 Trial design and Statistical analyses :  
 
The null hypothesis is that there is no improvement in wound com plication rate 
associated with antibiotic prophylaxis  (H
0: p_antibiotic -p_noantibiotic =0), where 
p stands for wound complication rate. The one -sided alternative hypothesis is that 
there is improvement (H a: p_antbiotic -p_noantibiotic  < 0).  Anecdotal evidence 
suggest up to a 35 % decrease in wound complication rate association with 
prophylactic antibiotics. The power analysis is based on detecting a 33 % 
reduction in wound complication rate from 3 0% (no antibiotic) to 20% 
(antibiotic) a t a significance level of 0.05.  
 
In order to conduct the larger multicenter trial we propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_609011] 50 evaluable women in order to establish the feasibility of our study.  
 
Statistical analysis :  
Statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_573476]. However, if there are a large number of patients who are treated with prophylactic antibiotics off protocol or if patients follow -up greater than 30 days postoperatively we will 
perform a sensitivity analysis and will analyze per protocol.   
Descriptive statistics will characterize and investigate baseline clinical and surgical characteristics between groups  as well as evaluate the difference in adverse events . 
Categorical fa ctors will be compared between groups by [CONTACT_209566] -squared or 
Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Independent t -test and Mann -Whitney U -test will 
be used to compare normally and non -normally distributed continuous variables, 
respectively. The primary o utcome will be compared between groups by [CONTACT_2329] a 
Chi-squared test . We will calculate common relative risks and 95% confidence 
intervals associated with the primary outcome. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Does antibiotic prophylaxis reduce wound complications after vulvar excision of 
premalignant lesions:  
A Double -Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial  
 
We are currently studying  the use of antibiotics to decrease wound complication rates in women 
undergoing vulvar surgery for noncancerous indications. Given the location of this surgery we 
know women who undergo vulvar surgery are at a high risk for wound complications after 
surgery including wound infections and skin separations which can require special care for 
closure, including special dressings, nursing care and sometimes  antibiotics.  This represents a 
burden for patients , and family memb ers who assist with wound care. Receiving antibiotics prior 
to your surgery may lead to a decreased complication rates . As such, we are performing a study 
to determine if our patients would benefit from the use of preoperative, preventativ e antibiotics .

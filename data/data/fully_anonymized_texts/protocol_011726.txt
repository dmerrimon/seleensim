2.0 OBJECTIV ES AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS 
 
Primary Objective: To determine the effectiveness of acupuncture for the treatment of breast 
cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) as measured  by [CONTACT_653863] 6 weeks of 
acupuncture treatment. 
 
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
 To assess differences between treatment group in  bioimpedience sc ores 
 
 To determine the safety of acupuncture treatment for BCRL

  To determine whether changes in lymphedema resulting from 6 weeks of acupuncture 
treatment are sustained over a 3-month follow-up period 
 
 
 To determine whether time since lymphedema diagnosis affects response to acupuncture 
 
 
 To determine whether stage affects response to acupuncture 
 
 
Our working hypothesis, that acupuncture will decrease objective measures of BCRL, is based on 
our preliminary pi[INVESTIGATOR_653857] 1/[ADDRESS_877310] a 3 0% reduction in lymphedema following acupuncture treatment. [ADDRESS_877311], up to 50% of patients who undergo axillary lymph 
node removal develop lymphedema,  and the World Health Organization estimates that 3-[ADDRESS_877312] frequent arm infections, 
often requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653858].  Lymphedematous  arms are heavy, swollen and stiff, 
with thickened, rough skin.  Courses of daily, intensive physiotherapy lasting 6 weeks at a time are 
usually required to massage the lymphatic fluid out of the affected arm. These treatments often need 
to be repeated if lymphedema recurs. In addition, patients are obligated to wear tight, uncomfortable 
elastic s tockings on their arm to prevent worsen ing of the swelling (Figure  1). These garments 
serve as a constant reminder to patients of their cancer diagnosis, decreasing quality of life and 
increas ing anxiety.9-15 
 
Lymphedema is a significant source of biomed ical expenditure. Managing 
lymphedema-related problems increas es overall treatment costs by [CONTACT_726] 
$10,000  a year per patient.16 These costs are a significant source of hardship for 
many patients as insurance coverage is limited and often inadequate for the 
lifetime palliative treatments currently available.

effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for lymphedema in a larger, randomized trial. 
 
Because cu rrent treatment options for lymphedema are time consuming, expensive and pa lliative, 
there is pressing need for effective means to treat this problem.  Our preliminary research 
demonstrates that acupuncture decreases lymphedema by [CONTACT_47071] 30% in patients with BCRL.[ADDRESS_877314] cancer-related lymphedema. Per the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_401930] (at least 40% 
of patients achieved at least 30% reduction in comparative arm circumference), the pi[INVESTIGATOR_653859] N=9 and the data pub lished 1. We continued the trial up  to the total of 33 patients on 
whom the preliminary data are reported here. Patients were identified, screened, and, following 
informed consent and their oncologists’ approval, enrolled in the trial. Inclusion criteria included 
women  age >18 years, unilateral lymphedema (>2cm circumference difference be tween affected 
and unaffected  arms) resulting from surgery and/or radiation therapy for breast cancer, and clinical 
diagnosis of lymphedema for at least 6 months and no  more than 5 years. The >2cm c ircumference 
difference  between the affected and unaffected arms was used as the cutoff for lymphedema 
because a difference of 2cm  or more at any point comp ared with the unaffected  arm is considered to 
be clinically significant by [CONTACT_653864]7,49.  The 6 month – [ADDRESS_877315] range of cases, and 
has been used as  a timeframe in several s tudies. 7 48 
 
Acupuncture technique. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupuncture treatment was 
performed by [CONTACT_211627], licensed MSKCC staff acupuncturists with extensive clinical experience in 
treating ca ncer patients. Alcohol swabs were applied pri or to insertion of sterile single-use filiform 
needles (32-36 gauge; 30-40mm in length) that penetrate 5-[ADDRESS_877316]. The selected  acupuncture points 
(Figure  2) were based on historical context, the published literature, and the co nsensus of our 
experienced group of MSKCC staff acupuncturists.17-19,32,35 Many of these local points are used to 
treat pain, weakness and motor impairment; others are traditionally used to drain “dampness”, a 
TCM concept similar to edema. Each treatment was 30  minutes in duration and acup uncture was 
performed twice weekly for 4 consecutive weeks.

Lymph edema meas urement s. We selected two arm c ircumference measurements for our 
objective ana lysis because this is the most widely used method  to diagnose upp er-extremity 
lymphedema,  and based on data that 2-point measures  have high sensitivity and spec ificity (80% 
and 71%, respectively) with high correlation with limb volume calculations using water d isplacement

the need for sterile technique for each measurement).  Based on these considerations, 
circumference  measurements of the affected and unaffected  arms were performed before initiation 
of treatment and after each treatment session us ing our previously published methods.1,7,40 
Measurements were performed by [CONTACT_653865]10cm above (upper arm) and 5cm 
below (lower arm) the olecranon process using non-stretch tape measures. 
 
 
We used our published technique to calculate the extent of lymphedema by [CONTACT_653866] a percentage of pre-treatment levels.1,7    This measure enables us  to determine the 
response to treatment and adjusts outcomes for baseline arm c ircumference.  Monthly phone calls 
were made for 6 months to determine whether patients developed any complications.

Results of preliminary study. 
1.  31 of the 33  patients showed decrease in lymphedema.  
2.  11 of 31 pts (35%) showed decrease of 30% or more compared to unaffected  arm. 
3.  the remaining 20 pts showed a decrease of an average of 16% compared to unaffected arm. 
4.  no reversion back to pre-acupuncture treatment circumference occ urred over time. 
5.  no SAEs. 
 
 
There were no serious adverse events (infections or severe exacerbation) after hundreds of 
treatment sessions and 6-month follow-up interviews.  Complaints were minor and comprised 
prima rily of mild bruising or minor pain/tingling in the arm, shoulder, or acupuncture site. Two 
patients had slight transient swelling of the lower arm.  In summary, our preliminary work 
demons trates that acupuncture for the treatment of BCRL is safe, well tolerated, and may decrease 
lymphedema.

related lymphedema. Therefore, a randomized trial is warranted. 
 
Successful completion of the propos ed research could lead to significant benefits: 
 
 Study subjects may see a reduction or disappearance of lymphedema. 
 A novel, effective, inexpensive modality may be added as a treatment option. 
 Reduction of health care costs (as noted, lymphedema treatment costs average $10,000 a 
year per patient).16 
 Patients may experience a decrease in related p hysical and emotional problems.

research, the Integrative Medicine Service has a history of safe and effective clinical 
acupuncture work with MSKC C outpatients and inpatients for over a decade. 
 
 
The length of treatment for the proposed study was increased to six weeks from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]’s four 
weeks. This increase is intend ed to maximize treatment effectiveness ba sed on  the co nsensus of 
our experienced ac upuncture faculty plus preliminary study patient interviews. 
 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC  AGENTS 
 
Acupuncture treatment will be given by [CONTACT_211627], licensed MSKCC staff acupuncturists.  All have 
extensive clinical experience in treating canc er patients. Alcohol swabs are applied pri or to 
insertion of sterile, single-use, filiform needles (32- 
36 gauge; 30-40mm in length) that penetrate 5-10 
mm into the skin.  The adjacent photo indicates 
the relative size of acupuncture needles. 
 
 
A total of 14 needles will be inserted in the 
affected and unaffected limbs (Fig. 2). The points 
will be s timulated manually by [CONTACT_653867]. These points are 
easily accessible with the patient lying supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The 
point prescription, described in the table below 
(Table 3), is based on  that used in our p ilot study, 
historical context, the published literature and the consensus of our experienced group of MSKCC 
staff acupuncturists.17-19,32,35 Many of these points are used to treat pain, weakness and motor 
impairment; others are traditionally used to drain “dampness”, a Traditional Chinese Medicine 
concept similar to edema. Acupuncture treatments will be given twice a week for [ADDRESS_877321] Control group will 
wait approximately six weeks from baseline and then cross-over to receive acup uncture treatment. 
All patients will be as ked not to receive acup uncture treatment, other than that performed for the 
study, while they are on study.

7.0 REC RUITMENT P LAN 
 
Recruitment  Plan (with Limited waiver of Author ization) 
 
Patients will be identified and referred to the study RSA for accrual and consent by a member of the 
patient’s treatment team or by [CONTACT_591402].  Patients may also be  self-referred, referred by 
[CONTACT_39785] c linicians, or referred by  a physician from other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Information abo ut the pr otocol will 
appear in lay language on MSKCC’s web site and clinicaltrials.gov.  Printed material (flyers, shown 
in Appendix 1) will be p osted in MSKCC clinic areas  and distributed to potential referral sources. In 
addition, patients with a diagnosis of lymphedema (identified via MSKCC’s DataLine) will be se nt a 
standard letter (Appendix 2) to introduce the study.  The recruitment letter to patients states that we 
are conducting a trial of “Acupuncture for the Treatment of Chronic Lymphedema” and if interested  
in learning more, the patient should contact [CONTACT_653870]. This 
recruitment method, similar to that used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (IRB# 09-136), is widely applied.  It is 
known to increase  recruitment and decrease physician workload. Integrative Medicine RSAs will 
schedule and complete screening and consenting appointments.  Because a large number of brea st 
cancer patients are treated at MSKCC, and because our p ilot study was co mpleted in short order, 
reflecting patient interest, we do not anticipate accrual difficulties for this trial. 
 
Initial co ntact with prospective subjects typi[INVESTIGATOR_591374] a member of the treatment team, a 
study investigator or research staff in consultation with the treatment team. The recruitment process 
presents  no more than minimal risk to patient privacy, and minimal PHI will be maintained on 
screening logs.  For these reasons, we seek a (partial) limited waiver of authorization to (1) review 
medical records to identify potential research subjects and obtain information relevant to the 
enrollment proce ss; (2) converse with patients regarding possible enrollment; (3) handle PHI 
contained in those records and provided by [CONTACT_52893]; and (4) maintain minimal PHI 
information in a screening log of patients approached. 
 
8.0 PRETR EATMENT E VALUATION 
 
Attendings will approve potential patients per eligibility requirements noted above.  Baseline 
measures  to assess lymphedema (arm circumference, bioimpedance) , and BMI will be co llected  by 
[CONTACT_653871].  A pregnancy test will be p erformed for women  of child-bearing potential. There 
is no known risk of bioimpedance testing for pregnant women  but the device has  not been approved 
for use on  pregnant women so women  who are  pregnant or intend ing to become  pregnant during the 
course of the study will be excluded.   Lymphedema staging will be p erformed by  [CONTACT_30588]’s Certified 
Lymphedema Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  In addition, type of surgery (mastectomy/limited), type of axillary surgery 
(SLNB alone or followed by  [CONTACT_653872]), age at axillary surgery and at study

Lymphedema Staging. All participants will be e valuated and their lymphedema will be staged by  a

 months of the onset of acupuncture treatment, or an ass essment by a Certified Lymphedema 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_360639]’ s Evelyn H. Lauder Breast and Imaging Center (BAIC ) will be co nducted. All 
lymphedema evaluations in the EMR are  performed by  [CONTACT_653874][INVESTIGATOR_653860] .  Participants who are  classified as stage II or higher will be e ligible to 
participate in the study. 
 
Arm Circum ference will be measured in the standard fashion.  Patients’ upper arm and forearms 
will be measured  for both the affected and unaffected arms. The greater difference  between 
affected and unaffected arms (either the forearm or the upper arm) will be us ed to determine 
eligibility.  This measurement will also se rve as the baseline measure of arm c ircumference for 
enrolled patients. Measurement frequency is detailed below in sec tion 10.0, ”Evaluation During 
Treatment/Intervention.” 
 
Bioimpedance measurement will be p erformed using the Impedimed L-Dex U400.  This device 
measures  the rate of electrical current transmission through tissues and  estimates fluid content in a 
lymphedematous limb compared with the normal limb.  Bioimpedance h as high inter and intra-rater 
reliability, is highly sensitive and spec ific for lymphedema (100% and 98%, respectively), and is 
highly correlated with circumference measurements making it an excellent method  to confirm our 
objective findings.42-[ADDRESS_877325] of analyzing subclinical ch anges in

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
 
Acupuncture treatment will be given at the Integrative Medicine Outpatient Center on 74th Street and 
First Avenue and/or at MSKCC’s Breast and Imaging Center ([ADDRESS_877327] 
and Sec ond Avenues). Each treatment will be [ADDRESS_877328] the RSA should any 
side effects occur, and at each study visit, the RSA will ask patients about side effects and abo ut the 
any other  lymphedema treatments they are using. 
 
All Integrative Medicine Service acup uncturists are licensed, credentialed employees of MSKCC . 
 
 
10.0 EVALUATION D URING TREATMENT/INT ERVENTION  
 
The study schema is presented in Section 1.0. Table 2.  For participants in the acupuncture 
treatment group,  followup objective assessments (limb circumference, bioimpedanc e) of 
lymphedema will be performed after 6 weeks of acupuncture treatment (within [ADDRESS_877329] 
acupuncture treatment) and again about three months after conclusion of treatment (3 months +/- [ADDRESS_877330] acupuncture treatment).  For participants in the wait-list control group, follow-up 
objective assessments of lymphedema will be performed after approximately [ADDRESS_877331] 
(6 weeks +/- 1 week from the patient’s consent), before ons et of acupuncture treatment, following 6

 weeks of acupuncture treatment (within [ADDRESS_877332] acupuncture treatment) and about 3 
months after completion of treatment (3 months +/- [ADDRESS_877333] acupuncture treatment). 
BMI will be measured at the same timepoints. Other treatments for lymphedema used by [CONTACT_653877],  as will side effects; other lymphedema treatments tend to be 
consistent across most MSKCC patients, as all are enco uraged to receive manual lymph drainage, 
exercis e, etc..   All assessments, including circumference  measurements of the affected and 
unaffected arms, bioimpedanc e, and BMI will be p erformed by [CONTACT_653878]. 
Study staff responsible for measuring sub jects’ arms will not be blinded to treatment assignments for 
logistic reasons and because it is not possible for patients themselves to be blinded. 
 
11.0 TOXICITIE S/SIDE EFFECTS  
 
Patients will be monitored for side effects at each visit.  Any adverse events will be reported 
according to standard procedures. Although the only published studies of acupuncture for 
lymphedema found neither infection nor other side effects [ADDRESS_877334] common side effects (<5%): 
 
 Minor bleeding at acupuncture sites 
 Bruises at ac upuncture sites 
 Pain or an unfamiliar sensation at ac upuncture sites (local or radiating) 
 
Less Common side Effects (<1%): 
 
 Local allergic reaction (urticaria) 
 Drowsiness, sleep disturbances (insomnia) 
 Anxiety, nervousness 
 Vasovagal reaction (fainting, dizziness, nausea, vomiting) 
 
Rare but more serious side effects (<0.1%): 
 
 Local skin Infection 
 Organ puncture 
 
Severity will be graded as "serious" or "non-serious". Serious AEs are those that require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], lead to death or disability or require urgent medical attention to prevent death or 
disability. The intensity of non-serious AEs will be graded as mild, moderate or se vere. 
 
Causality will be ass essed as follows. The AE will be described as "Probable" if all of the following 
apply: there is a rational relationship between the occurrence of the AE and the time of treatment; 
the AE has already been described as an  AE of acupuncture or could reasonably be anticipated to 
be an ac upuncture AE; regression or disappearance of the AE (unless p ermanent) after 
discontinuation of treatment or dose reduction; AE cannot be p lausibly be explained in terms of other 
caus al factors. The AE will be d escribed as "Possible" if all of the following apply: there is a rational

 relationship to the time of treatment administration; the AE has already been described as an  
AE of acupuncture; the AE could be explained by [CONTACT_40131]. The AE will be described as 
"Improba ble" if the following apply: there is no rational relationship to the time of treatment 
administration; the AE has not b een reported so far as a side effect of treatment and cannot 
reasonably be expected as an  acupuncture side-effect and any of the following: non-permanent AE 
persists after discontinuation of the treatment or dose reduction; repeated exposure does not lead to 
reappearance of the AE; AE could be explained by [CONTACT_653879]. The AE will be 
described as "No relationship" if all of the following app ly: there is no rational relationship to the time 
of treatment administration; AE is evidently caused by  [CONTACT_40131], e.g. symptom of a concomitant 
disease. The AE will be d escribed as "Unable to evaluate" if the amount and co ntent of data do not 
permit a judgment of the relationship to the treatment. 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THE RAPEUTIC  RESPONS E/OUTCOME  ASSES SMENT 
 
Patients will be co nsidered evaluable if they provide both a base line and follow-up arm 
circumference  measure. Patients will be a nalyzed according to randomization allocation regardless 
of the number of treatments received. 
 
13.[ADDRESS_877335] to 
withdraw from the study. Patients who withdraw will be as ked for their reasons. These will be 
defined as: ac upuncture treatment inconvenience; belief that treatment is ineffective; data collection 
inconvenience; medical reasons; other. Patients who discontinue participation in the study will be 
asked if they are willing to provide follow-up data or whether they wish to withdraw comp letely. 
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Primary Aim 
 
The primary aim is to establish the difference in the extent of lymphedema between patients 
receiving acupuncture and patients receiving no treatment.  Extent of lymphedema is defined as the 
greater difference  between the affected  and unaffected  arms (either the forearm or the upper arm). 
The extent of lymphedema post-treatment and at the 3 month follow-up timepoint will be from the 
same  site as that determined at baseline. The difference in  the extent of lymphedema between 
groups will be ass essed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with extent of 
lymphedema after 6 weeks as the outcome with treatment group and  baseline extent of 
lymphedema as covariates. We will report a two-tailed p-value and a 95% confidence interval for 
the difference  between groups. 
 
Based on a previous study, we expect the baseline extent of lymphedema to be 4cm.  In the sample 
size calculation, however, we assu me the baseline extent to be 3.6cm due to regress ion to the 
mean. The observed correlation between extent of lymphedema at baseline and after [ADDRESS_877336] deviation is e stimated to be 2.23cm. To be conservative this inflated

Page  17 of 24 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER  CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 12-210A(13)  
 standard deviation was used in the sample size calculation.  To detect a minimally significant 
difference  of 0.5cm in the extent of lymphedema, a trial with 90% power and an a lpha of 5% requires 
[ADDRESS_877337] of patient withdrawal on the primary 
analysis.  Towards this end, we will impute a spectrum of possible outcomes for the missing values 
and see h ow/if our inference ch anges. 
 
Because of its clinical relevance, we will also report the proportion of patients in each group  whose 
extent of lymphedema decreases  30% or more from baseline.  The 30% goal was de rived from our 
extensive clinical experience, in the absence of any consistent definition found in the clinical 
literature, and because that result or better was ach ieved in our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], where 1/[ADDRESS_877338] a 3 0% reduction in lymphedema following acupuncture treatment. [ADDRESS_877339] cancer patients are treated at MSKCC , we do not anticipate 
difficulties ac cruing patients to this trial.  Over 1300 patients currently in the MSKCC database meet 
the basic eligibility criteria for the study (Initial diagnosis of lymphedema no more than [ADDRESS_877340] cancer, Age ≥18 years, Alive Status=Alive, and Pt did not participate in our p ilot 
study).  Based on accrual rates in our previous study, we anticipate that it will require approximately 
1 ½ years to accrue the required sample. 
 
Secondary Aims 
 
ANCOVA models will be us ed to assess differences be tween treatment group for bioimpedance. 
The 6-week score  will be the outcome and treatment group,  baseline sc ore, and randomization 
stratum will be included as co variates. We will report the two-tailed p-value and a 95% confidence 
interval for the difference between groups. 
 
To assess how the effects of acupuncture on lymphedema change after the cess ation of 
acupuncture, we will calculate a difference in the extent of lymphedema and 95% confidence interval 
after [ADDRESS_877341] of acupuncture on BCRL. An interaction term between treatment group and  stage will be

 added as a covariate to a model with extent of lymphedema after 6 weeks as the outcome 
and treatment group, baseline lymphdema stage, and base line extent of lymphedema as covariates. 
The p-value for the interaction term will be reported along with mean differences in  BCRL from 
baseline to 6 weeks by [CONTACT_653880].

patient data. The co nfidentiality of patient information will be car efully protected. Following data 
entry by [CONTACT_591422], data will be maintained in a secure location in 
the Integrative Medicine offices. 
 
16.1 Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accrua ls and comp leteness of 
registration data.  Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual rates and  extent and accuracy  of evaluations and follow-up will be 
monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will be bro ught to the 
attention of the study team for discuss ion and action. Random-sample data quality and protocol 
comp liance aud its will be co nducted by [CONTACT_3476], at a minimum of  two times per year, more 
frequently if indicated.  
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center were 
appro ved by  [CONTACT_30589]  2001. The plans address  the new policies 
set forth by [CONTACT_193091] “Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and 
Safety Monitoring of Clinical Tri als” which can  be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html.  The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
estab lished and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591].  The MSKCC Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plans can be  found on  the MSKCC Intranet at:  http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm 
 
There are several d ifferent mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety and 
quality. There are institutional process es in place for quality assurance (e.g., pr otocol monitoring, 
comp liance and d ata verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff education on  clinical 
research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus there are two institutional 
committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs. The 
committees: Data and  Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center’s 
Research Council and Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol  will be ass essed for its level of 
risk and degree of monitoring required.  Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, in-house 
sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be a ddressed and  the monitoring 
proced ures will be estab lished at the time of protocol acti vation. 
 
 
17.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Benefits: Study subjects may see a  reduction or disappearance of lymphedema. 
 
Risks: We know of no reports of serious adverse events from ac upuncture in the research literature. 
In the more than ten-year experience of Integrative Medicine acupuncture treatment, we have never 
had a serious AE. 
 
Side-effects: It is conceivable that a patient may feel some  discomfort from the ac upuncture nee dles, 
or that the needles may cause a minor bruise. However, these would likely be very minor, as 
acupuncture needles are filiform and hair-thin, much smaller than standard hypodermic needles.

adolescent and young adults with desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT ) and 
other non- carcinomas

                                                                                                                   2009-[ADDRESS_305073] -operative chemotherapy  regimens 
are only useful if a complete response (CR) is evident. For sarcomatosis as is found 
in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), if residual disease is present there 
have been no survivors after intensive chemotherapy even with stem cell rescue.  (1) 
This may be related to the difficulty in obtaining cytotoxic concentrations of 
chemotherapy within the tumor parenchyma. A regional approach to treating the 
intraperitoneal tumor is appealing as a means of delivering high concentrations of 
chemother apeutic agents directly to the tumor while limiting systemic toxicity.  (By 
[CONTACT_250867])  (2)  This 
approach has been demonstrated to be very effective for advanced ovarian cancer, 
appendiceal carci noma and has become the standard care for adults in many cancer 
centers.  (3)  In phase I and II clinical trials, this strategy has also been found to 
improve disease free survival in mesothelioma and gastric cancer. (4- 6) 
DSRCT primarily presents in childr en and young adults age 5- 30, 90% male, 
with dozens to hundreds of abdominal tumor implants.  Less than 200 cases are 
reported in the world literature and therefore treatment options are limited. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_250852], aggressive tumor debulking and radiotherapy, 3 year survival is 20 -
30%. After aggressive tumor debulking of Desmoplastic round cell tumor (DSRCT), 
various strategies have been employed which direct therapy toward the peritoneal 
disease because of the characteristic loco- regional pattern of spread . Such 
approaches have included intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) and hyperfractionated radiation therapy.  (7-10) Some chemotherapy and radiation 
responses have been documented, but local abdominal recurrence shortly follows.  While these approaches attest to the acknowledged importance of controlling intra -
abdominal disease, they have not been uniformly successful in the long term 
complications of secondary tumors. (11 -13)   
Other rare pediatric tumors which can recur and metastasize in the abdominal 
cavity include Wilms’ tumor, colon carcinoma, sarcoma, and malignant ovarian germ 
cell tumor. With advanced intraperitoneal disease, these tumors are usually fatal 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_250853].  In a novel approach to these 
aggressive tumors, here at UT MDACC, an investigator initiated phase I  study found 
that continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion, also known as HIPEC, is safe in children.   
HIPEC is a technique for combining hyperthermia and chemotherapeutic 
agents delive red intraoperatively to the peritoneal and retroperitoneal surface via a 
recirculating perfusion circuit. (14)  In addition to adult clinical trials, the support for this concept comes from in vivo and in vitro laboratory studies.  The selective lethal 
effect of supranormal temperatures on human and murine neoplastic cells has been 
well established in laboratory models. (15- 17) A variety of cell lines including colon 
carcinoma and melanom a have been shown to be sensitive to temperatures ranging 
from 42 to 45°C  when exposed for a period of [ADDRESS_305074]. Hayes -Jordan    
                                                                                                                  14 Nov.  2013 
response of normal and tumor microcirculati on in response to hyperthermia. (18)  In 
response to hyperthermia,  normal tissue will show a dramatic and temperature 
dependent increase in blood flow at temperatures up to 50°C. In contrast , blood flow 
through neoplastic tissue will increase to a much smaller extent and stasis occurs at 
lower temperatures which are well tolerated by [CONTACT_250868]. Therefore, there 
appears to be two fundamental mechanisms by [CONTACT_250869].  
As mentioned, for drugs administered into the peritoneal cavity, the 
simultaneous systemic administration of neutralizing agents can provide protection 
against the systemic toxic effects of drug whi ch leaks into the circulation. Systemic 
sodium thiosulfate has been shown to covalently bind and inactivate cisplatin in the 
systemic circulation and obviate the expected renal toxicities. The use of sodium 
thiosulfate allows the administration of high doses of intraperitoneal cisplatin which 
might result in blood levels comparable t o an intravenous administration of drug.  (19)  
A loading dose of sodium thiosulfate,  followed by [CONTACT_250870] 270 
mg/M2 administered intraperitoneally wi th a [ADDRESS_305075] 
with cisplatin.   
In adult studies of carcinomatosis, there were no procedure related mortalities; 
morbi dity included renal impairment, ascites, and pancreatitis. Dose limiting toxicity 
included grade III leukopenia, grade IV neutropenia and grade II I and IV 
thrombocytopenia at the higher doses only (greater than 800 mg/M
2). (20, 21)  
Specifically, no patient had a prolonged postoperative ileus and no adverse e ffect on 
wound healing was observed. Following surgery, the median time before tolerating 
enteral feeds was 5 days (range 1- 7 days ), and patients could tolerate a regular diet 
at a medi an of 7 days (range 4- 8 days). Neither patient who had undergone bowel 
resection and anastamosis followed by [CONTACT_250871] c omplication. 
One patient suffered a subfascial hematoma incurred from trauma to the left inferior 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44224].  (20) In the mesothelioma study, the MTD of cisplatin was 300 
mg/M2. Above this dose there were significant rises in creatinine and one patient 
required temporary hemodialysis.  (21)  There have not been any untoward effects of 
the HIPEC on the ability of these patients to heal incisional wounds and convalesce uneventfully.  
This intraoperative treatment using HIPEC in children has provided some very 
encouraging results.  The phase I  study of HIPEC in children done here (protocol 
#2005- 0917) proved to be safe. There were no protocol related deaths.  Two SAE’s 
included temporary cardiomyopathy likely related to the 4 kg+ tumor resected and 
supraventricular tachycardia likel y related to centra l venous catheter malposition. 
Several children had temporary increased creatinine, up to 1.9. However, no 
problems were seen with urinary output; serum creatinine returned to normal within 1-

Rationale 
Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare diseas e of children, 
adolescents and young adults, which begins in the abdominal cavity.  Less than [ADDRESS_305079] was only recently described in 1991 
and since then multimodality treatment including chemotherapy, ra diation and 
aggressive surgery, has not improved outcome.  Here at UT MDACC the PI [INVESTIGATOR_250854] a phase I trial in children with 'carcinomatosis' who underwent continuous 
hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion using cisplatin after cytoreductive surgery. (This  
was an investigator initiated trial and we were the only center in the North America 
embarking on this effort)  
 For continuity, we propose to open the phase II study on the subset of patients 
with t he best prognosis after HIPEC, those with DSRCT. In data  not yet published, we 
compared the [ADDRESS_305080] at UT MDACC who had chemotherapy +/ - 
radiation therapy only and no HIPEC and found a survival advantage of 41 weeks in the patients undergoing HIPEC, a 3 year median survival of 26% for those not 
undergoing HIPEC and 71% for those who had HIPEC. This is very preliminary data 
with few patients and follow up is only 1- [ADDRESS_305081] is 
warrant ed. The surgical study plan and delivery of hyperthermic chemotherapy are 
the same as the previously approved phase I protocol. The maximum tolerated dose, 
the safe dose of cisplatin found in phase I, is 100 mg/M2. Pediatric and adult patients 
with other non- carcinoma tumors wi th extensive peritoneal disease will be eligible if 
no standard HIPEC treatment has been established for these patients.  Results of the 
research analysis will not be shared with the patient during the conduct of this study 
nor will th e results influence the clinical strategy.

 3.0 Study Implementation: Surgery  
 3.1 Procedures and therapeutic agents  
 3.1.1  Each operation will be carefully planned and informed 
consent obtained from the patient 18 or older or the parents (and assent from chi ld if age appropriate)  after a 
detailed discussion of possible complications, risks and possible benefits.   
Page [ADDRESS_305091]. Hayes -Jordan    
                                                                                                                  14 Nov.  2013 
 3.1.2  A general anesthetic is administered and the patient is 
placed on a cooling blanket that will initially not be turned 
on).  Esophageal and b ladder temperature probes will be 
inserted.  Unless already in place upon arrival to the OR; a central venous catheter, large bore IV ’s and an arterial line 
will be placed.  An exploratory laparotomy will be performed.  If the surgeon determines the operat ion to be 
feasible and safe, a debulking operation will be performed which will include all disease possible, leaving tumor 
nodules no greater than [ADDRESS_305092] is placed over the dome of 
the liver for perfusion influx and a second catheter is 
placed so that the tip lies in th e pelvis for perfusion efflux. 
Up to  eight temperature probes are placed beneath the  
peritoneal surface or at the influx and efflux catheters . The 
abdominal incision is closed and HIPEC is performed.  
 3.1.4  HIPEC and Cisplatin - Thirty minutes before HIPEC  is 
begun, body t emperature is cooled to 35°C. During the 
procedure, the cooling blanket and ice packs at the patients head and legs will be adjusted as necessary to 
maintain core body temperature below 38.5°C (as 
measured by [CONTACT_250874]). The catheters are 
connected to a perfusion circuit. The perfusate passes 
from a reservoir through a roller pump, heat exchanger and t hen into the abdominal cavity. Efflux from a second 
catheter is then recirculated t hrough the reservoir and 
pump. The perfusion flow rate will be maintained to distend 
the abdomen 5 (+2) liters/minute, and a perfusate volume 
will be maintained which moderately distends the 
abdominal cavity.  Before the instillation of Cisplatin, the 
peritoneal cavity is warmed to a target of 40°C  (+1°C) as 
estimated by [CONTACT_250875]/efflux catheter or peritoneal probe 
and the anesthesiologist will hydrate the patient with 
isotonic solution.  The perfusion is continued for 90 
minutes after adding the cisplatin. Cisplatin at 100 mg/M2 
(1mg/1mL concentration in syringes)  is to be added to the 
perfusate. The total maximum dose will  not exceed  
Page [ADDRESS_305093] be maintained at 1- 2 cc/kg/hr. Post-
operative hydration will include 1.[ADDRESS_305094] 1cc/kg/hr  and replacing urine output cc/cc every 
hour with normal saline, for the first 4 8 hours to prevent 
hypovolemia and renal failure.  
 3.1.5  Retroperitoneal tumors - In the case of a retroperitoneal 
tumor, after tumor debulking, exposure of the entire 
retroperitoneum in the area of the tumor bed, will be 
maintained. The remainder of the procedure will be the 
same as above.  Stable perfusion parameters are obtained 
and the peritoneal cavity is warmed to a minimum of 40°C  
(+1°C), prior to adding the cisplatin.  The perfusion is 
continued for 90 minutes after adding the cisplatin. At the 
end of the perfusion the perfusate is irrigated from the 
abdominal cavity and the abdominal wall is closed in the 
usual fashion.   
 3.1.6  Sodium thiosulfate-  In order to limit the systemic toxicity of 
cisplatin,  sodium thiosulfate will be administered by 
[CONTACT_250876] a 12 hour  continuous intravenous 
infusion. A loading dose of 7.5 gm/ M2 (maximum 12.5 gm) 
of sodium thiosulfate will be diluted in 20 ml/kg of 0.9% normal saline up to 500 mL. This loading dose will be 
infused over 20 minutes beginning 30 minutes  (+ 15 
minutes)  after the addition of cisplatin to the peritoneal 
perfusion circuit. Then maintenance infusion of sodium 
thiosulfate 1.275 gm/ M2/hr for 12 hours will be  delivered by

 4.2 Response Criteria and Statistical Considerations  
 4.2.1  This is a phase II study of continuous hyperthermia 
peritoneal perfusion (HIPEC) in patients with desmoplastic round cell tumor (DSRCT)  and non- DSRCT patients . The 
primary objective is to assess the efficacy of this treatment, with a primary endpoint of ti me to relapse. The 
historical median time to relapse for DSRCT patients without HIPEC treatment was about 1.[ADDRESS_305096]. It would be encouraging 
if the median time to relapse could increase to 3.2 months 
with the HIPEC treatment. The toxicity and efficacy will be 
monitored during the study, and all the data will be used to 
update the prior distributions for toxicity and efficacy 
parameters. The study will be stopped for toxicity and 
futility based on the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].   
 4.2.2  The primary endpoint TTP will be monitored using the 
method of Thall et al. (23). Denote median (TTP) = m H for 
patients without HIPEC treatment and m E for patients with 
HIPEC treatment. We assume that TTP is distributed 
exponentially with mean of m H and m E, respectively,  in 
patients without and with HIPEC treatment.  Under a Bayesian model, we will further assume that m
H has an 
inverse gamma (IG) prior with parameters (16.2, 24.3), with a mean of median TTP=1.6 months and variance = 
0.18. We also assume that m
E follows IG prior (2.03, 1.64) 
with the same median TTP as m H but with a much larger 
variance (100) to reflect much greater uncertainty about 
TTP in patients with HIPEC treatment. The TTP data will 
be monitored continuously , and the study will be 
terminated early if Pr (mH + d < m E | data) < 0.05, where d= 
1.6 month. Specifically, the trial will be stopped early if, 
given the current data, there is less than 5%  chance that 
the median TTP will improve by [CONTACT_726] 1.6 month in 
patients treated with HIPEC, compared to t hose without 
HIPEC treatment. The operating characteristics of this 
decision rule are summarized in Table 1.  
 4.2.3  In addition, toxicity will be monitored closely in all patients. 
The evaluation of the  toxicity data will begin after 
enrollment of  8 patients . Denote the probability of toxicity 
by θE, where toxicity is defined as any Grade 3 or greater 
renal, cardiac, respi[INVESTIGATOR_026] G rade 4 hematologic 
complications attributable to HIPEC.  We assume θ E ~ 
beta (0.6, 1.4).  Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_250856]: Pr  (θE > 0.30 | data) >0.8. That is,

determine that there is more than 80% chance that the 
toxicity rate is more than 30%. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_250857] (# G rade 3 or greater rena l, cardiac, respi[INVESTIGATOR_250858] 4 hematologic complications) / (# patients

4.2.4 Analysis Plan: For discrete or categorical data, descriptive 
statistics will inclu de tabulations of frequencies. For 
continuous data, summary statistics including n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum will 
be computed. The median time to progression and its 95% 
confidence interval will be estimated.  Kaplan -Meier 
method, Log rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling will be utilized to analyze time to 
progression and overall survival. The study will use

4.9       Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse r eaction is considered “serious”   
if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of         
the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that 
places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an 
adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that m ay not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in

• Important medical events as defined above may also be considered 
serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and should 
be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_250882] r or the IRB . 
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the 
timeframes and procedures outlined in "University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson 
Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy on Reporting Serious 
Adverse Events".  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, 
expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IRB , regardless of 
attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event).  
• All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and relate d to the 
study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next 
working day) of knowledge of the event to the IRB.    
• The MDACC "Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting" will be 
used  for reporting to the IRB .  
• Serious adverse events wi ll be captured from the time the patient 
signs consent until [ADDRESS_305107] returned to baseline, progression of the 
event has stabi lized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the 
event.  
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_305108] be reported to 
the IRB . This may include the development of a secondary

when appropriate, the child, prior to treatment and prior to 
obtaining a signed informed consent as well as assent 
from the child. These discussions will take place in the 
clinic setting as well as the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. During the initial 
consultation, the parents are presented a forthright and 
detailed overview of the experimental nature of the 
procedure, its theoretical advantages and disadvantages

therapy, without any assurance of benefit, the aggressive 
nature of the treatment and the likelihood of serious or 
potentially life threatening complications are presented. 
The adult patient (>/=18 year old) and/or parents will be 
informed that this therapy could make the patient or the 
child extremely ill and the risks of experi encing short or 
long term adverse effects from this treatment are high. The adult patient (>/=18 year old) and/or family is asked to 
review the informed consent document, encouraged to 
make notes, and a follow up discussion is scheduled either 
by [CONTACT_250884]. At the time 
of consent and again the day of surgery, the family is reassured that participation in the trial i s entirely voluntary 
and that they can withdraw or decide against treatment at any time without adverse consequences. Signed consent 
will be verified by [CONTACT_250885].  A child life advocate will be a part of the 
informed consent process when the patient is a child.

 6.0 Pharmaceutical Information 
 6.1 Cisplatin (cisplatin)  
 6.1.1  General  
Cisplatin will be purchased from the Pharmacy for the use 
in this trial. Commercial supply of FDA approved Cisplatin 
will be used. For drug information: Cisplatin Aqueous 
formulation 1mg/ml concentration (Various Vendors). Lot 
numbers will be tracked per drug accountability 
requirements.  It will be purchased by [CONTACT_250886].  
 6.1.2  Stability and Storage  
Cisplatin is stable at controlled room temperature 15° - 
25°C protected from light and 7 days under fluorescent 
room light. Further dilution at 0.05 or 0.5 mg/mL with 0.9% 
sodium chlorine injection (NS), USP, yields a solution that 
is stable for at least  [ADDRESS_305112] 
unopened container  from light.  
 6.1.3  Preparation  
The total dose of cisplatin will be injected into a bag of 
0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP, to make 500 mL 
of final volume ( + 10%) prior to administration.  
 6.1.4  Administration  
Cisplatin  100 mg/ M2 {up to 130 mg/M2 maximum dose} (in 
500 mL) will be added to a stable perfusi on system . 
 6.1.5  Toxicities  
Cisplatin  produces renal tubular toxicity’s associated with 
renal insufficiency and electrolyte, (i.e. magnesium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, carbon dioxide) wasting 
which may result in significant hypomagnesaemia and 
hypokalemia. Neurotoxicity manifests as both sensory and 
motor peripheral neuropathies. Cisplatin is also toxic to the 8
th cranial nerve producing ototoxicity which consists of 
primarily deficits in high frequency auditory acuity, but may include vestibular abnormalities. Systemic administration 
of cisplatin at doses similar to those planned in this study 
is associa ted with significant nausea and     
thrombocytopenia. Transient moderate elevations of 
hepatic transaminases and acute systemic allergic 
reaction including anaphylaxis may also occur. The prior 
phase I study of HIPEC with heated cisplatin has not 
identified any regional intraperitoneal toxicity from cisplatin and the dose to be used is 100 mg/ M
2. The heat may 
cause a prolonged gastroparesis .

OBJECTIVES:
We will adapt  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a technology-enabled, primary care strategy for routinely 
monitoring medication use and adherence among older adults with multiple chronic conditions 
and polypharmacy. As part of the monitoring process, we will phenotype adherence challenges 
and link patients to appropriate clinic-based resources to address identified concerns. The study 
we will be adapting from is an ongoing trial (TAKE IT), IRB approved as STU00204465. Our 
specific aims are:

HRP-593 /  v10222021Aim 1:  Adapt the PATTERN intervention for use in primary care using input from key 
stakeholders
In months  [ADDRESS_716283] key informant interviews with primary care patients (up to 
N=15), clinicians and administrators (up to N=15) to learn how the intervention, originally 
designed for a resourced, subspecialty setting, should be refined to meet new user needs. 
These activities will be guided by [CONTACT_547530]’s MCC Model 
and informed by [CONTACT_547531]’s Design, Measurement, and 
Analytics Cores. 
Aim 2:  Assess the PATTERN intervention’s feasibility and acceptability for use in primary care.
In months  9 to 24, we will implement a 2-arm, patient-randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_547511]. Adults over 65 (N=80) with an upcoming primary care visit  
(within the next ~1 week, with MCC and polypharmacy, defined as taking ≥8 chronic 
medications, will be recruited over 6 months, and followed for 6 months (n=40 per study arm). 
Interviews will evaluate participants’ experiences with the PATTERN intervention, regimen 
knowledge, and adherence (via self-report) utilizing a post-visit survey. The specific flags per 
question on the survey (the point at which someone is classified as having a phenotyped 
adherence concern) will be determined by [CONTACT_547532]. Fidelity (receipt of portal 
assessment and time to completion, care response to adherence concerns, etc.) and clinical 
outcomes will be captured in the EHR. 
BACKGROUND:
The population  of adults over [ADDRESS_716284] 
multiple chronic conditions (MCC), and associated polypharmacy (often defined as taking ≥ 5 
prescription medications). As a result, problems with treatment adherence are common; prior 
estimates have found 30 to 50% of community-dwelling, older adults over [ADDRESS_716285] also shown that inadequate 
adherence is associated with poorer health-related quality of life, higher healthcare costs and 
increased mortality risk. 
The Model of  Medication Self-Management, co-developed by [CONTACT_547533], has 
facilitated the deconstruction of patient medication use and was further developed to 
categorize adherence barriers as cognitive (e.g., forgetfulness), psychological (e.g., health 
literacy, depression, motivation), medical (e.g., acute illness), regimen (e.g., side effects, 
complex dosing schedules), social (e.g., transportation, support) and economic (e.g., cost). 
Given this heterogeneity, interventions should be informed by a patient’s own report of 
perceived barriers to address their specific concerns. 
An ongoing  Northwestern trial (‘TAKE IT’; R01DK110172) has been able to leverage an 
electronic health record (EHR) platform and its linked patient portal (Epic, MyChart [MyNM]) to: 
1) routinely engage new adult kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_547512]-based adherence

HRP-593 /  v10222021assessments; 2)  flag and phenotype reported adherence concerns; 3) alert care teams via 
secure messaging of the specific adherence concern(s); and 4) mobilize available resources 
tailored to identified barriers (e.g. SMS text reminders for cognitive barriers, a comprehensive 
medication review via phone or video telehealth to address regimen complexity, social work 
referral for social or economic concerns, etc.) following a standard protocol. A planned, 
preliminary review of the TAKE IT strategy’s fidelity has found that most (83%) intervention 
participants complete the assessments, with 35% reporting one or more adherence barriers 
(regimen-related (45%), cognitive (27%), medical (20%), and psychological (16%)). Among 
patients reporting barriers, the care team was mobilized in 96% of cases with an acknowledged 
response. No disparities have been found by [CONTACT_547534] .
While the TAKE  IT trial is still active, it shows promise as a feasible and acceptable means to 
engage patients beyond the point of care, specifically in the context of monitoring regimen 
adherence, and mobilizing care teams. Another recent PCORI trial co-led by [CONTACT_547535] a similar means of monitoring treatment adherence, including 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_547513]. Intervention 
participants exhibited significantly better medication adherence and quality of life at 12 
months. 
We will adapt  the already-built TAKE IT strategy for use in primary care, targeting older adults 
with MCC and polypharmacy (using Medicare Part D medication therapy management criteria 
of ≥8 medications). This intervention, renamed as the PATTERN study (Phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_547514]-Enabled Reports and Navigation) will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_547515] (NM) primary care practices to determine its acceptability, feasibility, 
and preliminary fidelity.

HRP-593 /  v10222021Secondary outcomes  include clinical outcomes (e.g. A1c, blood pressure, cholesterol panel). 
Relationships between adherence and potential confounders (age, comorbidity, regimen 
complexity, internet use, dose of intervention, health literacy, patient activation, social support) 
will also be examined. Acceptability and fidelity/feasibility will also be examined. This may 
include examining how many participants in the intervention arm completed the adherence 
questionnaire and how many of those indicating an adherence challenge were responded to in 
some way by [CONTACT_3652]. 
STUDY INTERVENTION
The goal of TAKE  IT is to optimize adherence and to detect problems earlier to improve health 
outcomes in kidney transplant centers. TAKE IT includes the following intervention components 
that will be adapted and pi[INVESTIGATOR_547516] 65 and older with polypharmacy and multiple chronic conditions:
1. An  adherence assessment that requests patients to report on their medication use, 
providing a link between the health center and patient beyond routine in-person visits. This 
assessment will identify patients at risk of non-adherence and categorize their adherence 
concern(s) as: cognitive, psychological, regimen, medical, social, economic.
2. Care Alert  Notifications directed to the health center (i.e. to a nurse coordinator or 
whomever the health center prefers) if an adherence related problem is identified by [CONTACT_547537]. This person can then activate appropriate staff to respond.
PROCEDURES INVOLVE D:
For PATTERN,  the goal is to phenotype medication adherence challenges of patients aged [ADDRESS_716287] an upcoming primary care visit (within the next ~1 week) and are 
prescribed 8 or more medications to treat multiple chronic conditions in primary care. The 
processes for our key informant research activities (Aim 1) and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (Aim 2) are 
described in detail below.
Aim 1  is  cross-sectional and qualitative. During Aim 1, the Northwestern research team will 
solicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_547517] (clinicians, administrators, patients) about the adaptation 
of the TAKE-IT intervention to the PATTERN study. Using feedback from those individuals, one-
time interviews, the research team will work with EHR analysts to adapt the platforms used in 
TAKE IT to meet the needs of PATTERN. 
Aim 1:  Key Informant Interviews with Clinicians and Administrators (up to N=15)
Specifically, this will entail:  
1) Individual,  one-time interviews with eligible clinician and administrator participants, lasting 
~45 minutes. 
2) Participants  will be screened and provide an online informed consent prior to participation.

HRP-593 /  v102220213) Trained  Northwestern research assistants will use semi-structured interview guides to 
conduct the interviews; interviews will be conducted over a secure video-based web platform 
(either Zoom or Microsoft Teams), as some questions may ask participants to view and 
respond to potential PATTERN study materials (e.g., adherence assessment).
4) In  general, questions will explore participants opi[INVESTIGATOR_158337]: whether the assessment should 
be conducted among any patient meeting previously described eligibility criteria, or if it 
would better to focus on a smaller subset of patients with multiple morbidities more likely to 
result in medication adherence challenges; how clinicians prefer to address phenotyped 
adherence challenges, and whether they think their practice is ready to implement such an 
intervention.  Additional questions related to intervention adaptation may be iteratively 
added should new topi[INVESTIGATOR_547518]. 
5) At the conclusion  of the interviews or online after the consent is completed, participants will 
complete a brief demographic questionnaire.
6) All  participant responses to the demographic questionnaire will be recorded on a RedCap 
survey.
7) Audio-recordings  of the interviews will be used for analysis purposes using a rapid approach 
to qualitative analyses previously used by [CONTACT_5051].
8) The  research team will then synthesize the data from recordings and RedCap and update the 
intervention adaptation.
Aim 1:  Key Informant Interviews with Patients (up to N=15)
Specifically, this will entail:  
1) Individual,  one-time interviews with eligible patient participants lasting ~45 minutes. 
2) Participants  will be screened and provide verbal informed consent prior to participation.
3) Trained  Northwestern research assistants will use semi-structured interview guides to 
conduct the interviews; interviews will be conducted over a secure video-based web platform 
(either Zoom or Microsoft Teams), as some questions may ask participants to view and 
respond to potential PATTERN study materials (e.g., adherence assessment).
4) In  general, questions will explore participants opi[INVESTIGATOR_547519]: the acceptability of monthly 
assessments; the perceived likelihood that pi[INVESTIGATOR_547520]; the utility of health center resources that could be linked to identified and 
phenotyped adherence challenges. Additional questions related to intervention adaptation 
may be iteratively added should new topi[INVESTIGATOR_547518]. 
5) At the  conclusion of the interviews, patients will complete a brief demographic questionnaire 
and validated measures of health literacy and patient activation.
6) All  participants’ responses to the questionnaire will be recorded on a RedCap survey.
7) Audio-recordings  of the interviews will be used for analysis purposes using a rapid approach 
to qualitative analyses.
8) The  research team will then synthesize the data from recordings and RedCap and update the 
intervention adaptation strategy further.
Aim 1:  Key Informant Audio Recording
All key  informant interviews (Aim 1) will be audio recorded using the Zoom or Microsoft Teams 
videoconferencing software. Prior to recording the interview, study participants will be asked to 
IRB #: STU00217555-MOD0015 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 7/17/2024
STU#: STU00217555
Version Date:   07.09.24 Page 6 of 17
HRP-593 /  v10222021turn their video  cameras off so only their audio is recorded. Specifically, the Northwestern 
research team will record the interview portions where participants are offering suggestions or 
giving us feedback on the adaptation of the TAKE IT intervention into the PATTERN study (as 
described above). We will not record any identifiable information (ex: medical records or 
responses to demographic questionnaires). Due to Zoom recording recommendations made by 
[CONTACT_37123], interviews conducted with the Zoom software will be recorded to the Zoom Cloud. 
Recording to the Zoom Cloud, rather than directly to one’s computer, prevents the recorded files 
from becoming corrupted and diminishing the quality of the recording (ex: failed recording where 
not everything is recorded).
The Zoom  Cloud or Microsoft Teams recordings will be downloaded and saved onto secure FSM 
department servers. Only authorized research personnel will have access to the data. The 
recordings may be used solely by [CONTACT_547538]. 
Recordings from the qualitative research activities will be analyzed using a rapid approach to 
qualitative analysis. De-identified notes may be taken as needed. The recordings and notes will 
be stored on the FSM department servers for the duration of the study. At the conclusion of the 
study, all recordings will be destroyed.
If a  participant is not willing to be audio recorded, then they will be unable to participate in the 
Aim 1 study activities. No pi[INVESTIGATOR_547521]; those activities 
will take place   over the phone through a Northwestern phone line.
Aim 2:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (N=80; n=40 per arm)
For Aim [ADDRESS_716288] a patient-randomized controlled trial at one Northwestern Medicine 
primary care practice and followed for 6 months. A total of 80 participants will be recruited and 
randomly assigned via REDCap once a primary care appointment is scheduled to either the 
PATTERN arm or usual care (N=80, n=40 per) arm. Usual care refers to the normal standard 
clinical practices at the participating practice(s). 
Research activities  (described in detail below) will include an adherence assessment (for those 
in the Pattern arm) and a post-visit survey (for both arms) which will be conducted over the 
phone via a Northwestern phone line. 
Adherence assessments  (part of the intervention)
Adherence assessments  will be automatically delivered to patients randomized to the 
intervention arm with an upcoming appointment to report medication challenges via MyChart. 
Post-visit interviews
1) Potential  participants who have an upcoming primary care visit (within the next ~1 
week) will be called via a Northwestern telephone line to be recruited for the study. 
After confirming eligibility via phone, the participant will provide an electronic informed 
consent or verbal consent prior to participation. Individuals for whom have technology 
issues and electronic consent is not practical due to technological challenges, will be 
subject to verbal HIPAA/Alteration of HIPAA. The RC will schedule the post-visit survey

STU#: STU00217555
Version Date:   07.09.24 Page 7 of 17
HRP-593 /  v10222021about 2  to 4 weeks after the patient attended their primary care visit and will inform the 
participant that it will be about a ~30 minute phone interview.
2) The  RC will schedule interviews at the convenience of patients.
3) Patients  may receive a phone call as a reminder to attend their scheduled study visit.
4) At the  end of the phone interview there are open-ended questions for participants 
randomized to the intervention. These will be audio recorded, with the participant’s 
permission, using a handheld audio recorder, Zoom, or Teams. The participant will be 
reminded that only that portion of the interview will be audio recorded. 
5) The  RC will turn off the audio recording, thank the patient, and confirm the delivery 
process for compensation.
6) The  RC will thank the patient and confirm the delivery process for compensation.
Aim 2:  Audio Recording
All participants randomized  to the intervention will be asked a short series of open-ended 
questions to assess their acceptability of the intervention. These open-ended questions will be 
audio recorded using a hand-held audio recorder,  Zoom, or Teams. Prior to recording the 
interview, study participants will be reminded that a portion of the interview will be audio 
recorded. Specifically, the Northwestern research team will record the end of the interview 
where participants are discussing their acceptability of the intervention. We will not record any 
identifiable information (ex: medical records or responses to demographic questionnaires). 
All audio  recordings will be downloaded and saved onto secure FSM department servers. Only 
authorized research personnel will have access to the data. The recordings may be used solely by 
[CONTACT_547538]. Recordings from the qualitative 
research activities will be analyzed using a rapid approach to qualitative analysis. De-identified 
notes may be taken as needed. The recordings and notes will be stored on the FSM department 
servers for the duration of the study. At the conclusion of the study, all recordings will be 
destroyed.
If a  participant is not willing to be audio recorded, then detailed notes will be taken.

RECRUITMENT METHODS
Aim 1:  Recruitment of clinicians and administrators
We will  identify potentially eligible medical directors and administrators via internal systems. 
Members of the Northwestern team, which may include members of the Northwestern Pepper 
Center, will send an email to potential participants describing the study. Potential participants 
may contact [CONTACT_547540]. They 
will also be given the opportunity by [CONTACT_547541]. Those 
who express interest or do not opt out will be called or emailed by a research coordinator (RC), 
introduced to the study, screened, and scheduled for an individual, one-time interview to be held 
remotely over Zoom or Microsoft Teams. Online consent will take place prior to the interview.
Aims 1  and 2: Recruitment of patients
Potentially eligible  patients will be identified via the EHR. A report containing contact [CONTACT_3031] 
(name, dob, gender, phone number, address, email, medical record number, clinic name, clinic 
date ( Aim 2), and primary care provider name) will be downloaded from the EDW. An RC will 
review the report and then mail a letter to patients on the list, notifying them that a trained 
Northwestern RC will be telephoning to invite them to participate in a study. Patients will be 
given the opportunity to opt out of being contact[CONTACT_92966] a hotline number and leaving a 
message. Seven days after the letters have been mailed, an RC will call patients who did not opt 
out to ask screener questions to determine eligibility and, if eligible and interested, schedule their 
one-time interview (Aim 1).  
An RC  will contact [CONTACT_547542] a Northwestern phone line to invite 
them to participate in a study. Potential participants will be informed about the study and if

Aim 2: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_547525] $50 (post-visit interview)
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS
There are  no anticipated circumstances when a participant would be withdrawn from the study 
without their consent.   
Participants can  choose to withdraw from the study at any time.  If a participant chooses to 
withdraw from the research, any data collected up until the point of withdrawal will still be 
utilized as it will not include identifying information.  They will then not be contact[CONTACT_547543].  
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS
Participation in  this study puts subjects at a minimal risk of discomfort or inconvenience, as they 
are primarily responsible for providing their own opi[INVESTIGATOR_547526] (Aim 1), or experiences with their prescribed medication taking behaviors (Aim 2). 
Nevertheless, some of the questions may be upsetting or make participants feel uncomfortable; 
participants may experience a sense of unease or shame while they complete measures of health 
literacy (Aim 2). Finally, participation may result in a loss of privacy, since research and oversight 
staff may review research findings. 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO  PARTICIPANTS
It is  possible that subjects enrolled in the study may directly benefit from this study by [CONTACT_7661] a 
better understanding of medication challenges and resources available for support. The results 
of this study may provide important information regarding how strategies can be implemented 
via available technology (e.g., the EHR) to phenotype and provide appropriate support to 
identified medication adherence challenges.

HRP-593 /  v10222021DATA MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY
The proposed  pi[INVESTIGATOR_547527] a 1:1 randomized design that assigns patients to PATTERN or usual 
care. We will accrue 80 patients (to allow consenting to occur until we have 80 interviews ), 
anticipating 90% retention for follow-up at about [ADDRESS_716292]-visit survey as measured by [CONTACT_547544]-
D and/or ASK-[ADDRESS_716293]. Secondary outcomes include clinical 
outcomes (e.g. A1c, blood pressure, cholesterol panel). Relationships between adherence and 
potential confounders (e.g., age, comorbidity, regimen complexity, internet use, dose of 
intervention, health literacy, patient activation) may also be examined. 
As a  small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], appropriate bivariate analyses (chi square, t-test) will be performed to 
compare outcome by [CONTACT_30157]. Exploratory analyses will apply generalized linear models 
(GLMs), adjusting for confounders, specifying the logit link function for binary outcomes and 
identity link for continuous outcomes. Treatment group will be the independent variable of 
primary interest, with usual care specified as reference group. We will also include baseline value 
of the outcome and any potential confounding covariates noted in bivariate analysis. For 
outcomes measured per medication as described in the Measurement table above, a generalized 
estimating equation (GEE) approach will be employed to adjust standard errors for within-patient 
correlation.  Should PATTERN demonstrate a significant - or non-significant trend suggesting an 
effect on outcomes, secondary analyses will examine if any of the potential confounders 
considered exhibit any effect modification. 
 
To understand  the fidelity of PATTERN, we will determine the extent to which the intervention 
was implemented as planned to optimize it for a future multi-site trial. We will capture data from 
patient self-report and the EHR. Patients receiving PATTERN will be asked whether they received 
the EHR message and visited the portal. From the EHR, we will determine if the portal assessment 
was completed, the prevalence and type of patient-reported adherence concerns, whether the 
clinic read portal responses, and the average time from assessment submission to clinician or 
staff review, and/or response. We will examine if receipt and completion of EHR assessments 
and deployment of adherence support tools increases participant knowledge and medication 
taking behaviors.  
Data Safety  and Monitoring Board (DSMB).  Because this is a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], a formal DMSB is not 
required. However, we will identify two members of the Northwestern Pepper Center who will 
be given responsibility to review protocols, procedures, and concerns related to research 
integrity, including an approval of the methods and analysis plan. The DSMB will be organized 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Pack and include an appropriate research biostatistician with related expertise. Meetings 
will take place via video/teleconference.
We will register  the trial protocol at ClinicalTrials.gov.

HRP-593 /  v10222021Measures 
Patient Characteristics.  We  will include a socio-demographic/health questionnaire, and the
Tangible Social Support  survey to assess the extent/quality of social connections. The Consumer 
Health Activation Index (CHAI) will be included, and patients will be asked about their internet 
use.  
Regimen Complexity.  EHR data will identify the number of prescription medications an 
individual has been prescribed. This will serve as a proxy for medication regimen complexity. 
Fidelity (Process  Measures).
Receipt of  adherence assessments.  During the post-visit survey, the RC will ask whether
patients received  the adherence assessments. We are only collecting these 1-time at the 
follow-up interview (not longitudinally).
Use of Patient  Portal. During the post-visit interview, the RC will inquire whether patients used 
the portal to complete the adherence assessment which will be verified using EHR data.
Care Alert Notification.  We  will review EHR data on care alerts, and nurse follow up to identify 
whether adherence concerns were addressed by [CONTACT_61745]. The RC will also ask patients if 
they received follow up, by [CONTACT_20898], and what services were provided.
Effectiveness Outcomes.  We will collect data on an array of knowledge,
behavioral, and  clinical outcomes.
Medication Adherence.  Adherence will be measured using: 1) ARMS-D and/or ASK-12.  
Clinical Outcomes.  Blood pressure (continuous SBP; control (y/n): SBP<140 & DBP<90) and 
glycemic control (HbA1c) will also be examined in those with hypertension and diabetes. The 
cholesterol panel will also be included. 
PROVISIONS TO  MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS
NA: This  study does not include more than minimal risk. 
PROVISIONS TO  PROTECT THE PRIVACY INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS
Participants will  be informed in all cases about their rights as research subjects. They may 
withdraw at any time during the study without penalty or loss of any healthcare benefit or service 
to which they are entitled. Patients will be assigned a unique identification number. We will also 
attempt to reduce shame and performance anxiety as a result of interviews through extensive 
training of the interviewer(s).
Data collected  includes online and verbal consent forms for Aim 1 and for Aim 2. It also contains 
information collected during the study interviews (demographics, audio recordings of key 
informant interviews (Aim 1), survey/interview information (Aims 1 and 2), as well as clinical data 
from the EDW (Aim 2).

CONSENT PROCESS
Aim 1:  Because this research places participants at minimal risk, and because Aim 1 is designed 
to solicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_547528], verbal or online consent will be obtained for all Aim 1 
participants, prior to their participation in the adaptation phase of the PATTERN study. For 
patient interviews, after contact[CONTACT_547545], but prior to conducing the 
one-time, individual interview over Zoom or Microsoft Teams, a trained RC will read the 
consent form aloud to the potential participant and reiterate key requirements (e.g., that the 
interview will be audio recorded). The potential participant will be informed that they are free 
to skip any questions or end the interview at any time without penalty. All information will be 
provided to the subjects in terms that they can fully understand. There will be no exertion of 
any overt or covert coercion. Once the RC is satisfied that the potential participant understands 
the consent process and the nature of their participation in the research study, the potential 
participant will be asked if they consent to participate. After verbal consent is obtained, the 
consent date and name [CONTACT_547553] [CONTACT_547546]. For clinician or admin interviews, eligible 
participants will receive an email with information on who to contact [CONTACT_547547]. The email will also have a link to an online consent, where 
they can review more information about the study. After consent, they will be contact[CONTACT_547548].
Aim 2:  Electronic or verbal consent with a HIPPA authorization will be obtained for all Aim [ADDRESS_716294] to verbal HIPAA/Alteration of HIPAA. Participants will

HRP-593 /  v10222021be provided  with a copy of the consent form by [CONTACT_547549]. Once complete, the RC will reiterate the key aims 
and participant requirements (1 phone interview and the one adherence assessment), before 
giving the potential participant the opportunity to ask any questions they might have. The 
potential participant will be informed that they are free to withdraw at any time without 
penalty and all information will be provided to the subjects in terms that they can fully 
understand. There will be no exertion of any overt or covert coercion. Once the RC is satisfied 
that the potential participant understands the consent process and the nature of their 
participation in the research study, the potential participant will be asked to sign and date the 
online consent form. Participants will receive a signed consent form for their records by [CONTACT_6968]. 
If an online consent cannot be obtained, we will proceed with a verbal consent. The consent 
date and name [CONTACT_547554] [CONTACT_547546].  Participants will receive a copy of the consent 
form for their records by [CONTACT_547550]. 
If a  patient is unable to complete an electronic consent due to inability to use technology for
electronic consent,  we request a waiver of documentation of informed consent and an 
alteration to obtain verbal HIPAA Authorization, since this study presents no more than minimal 
risk of harm to participants. For patients that are unable to complete electronic consent, 
research cannot practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration. Obtaining written 
consent is not feasible since this clinic-randomized study will recruit patients from clinics all 
over the Chicagoland area (including North and West suburbs). In order to maintain the sample 
size necessary for meaningful data, we need to request a waiver of documentation of informed 
consent and alteration to obtain verbal HIPAA Authorization. Additionally, it is important that 
we do not exclude older adults solely based on inability to use technology, decreasing the 
diversity of the population. After verbal consent and HIPAA Authorization is obtained, the 
consent date and the name [CONTACT_547555] [CONTACT_547551].

The Center  for Applied Health Research on Aging (CAHRA) directed by [INVESTIGATOR_71661], MA, MPH, 
PhD, CAHRA serves as a research and education hub for geriatricians, gerontologists and aging 
health services researchers. This Center unites >70 faculty across clinical disciplines and from 
cognitive, behavioral, social and public health sciences throughout the university and the 
Northwestern Medicine health system. CAHRA’s mission is to promote informed decision 
making and actions leading to optimal health and well-being among individuals and families 
over the life span.
Building off  of [CONTACT_91778]’s highly successful Health Literacy and Learning Program (HeLP), which 
was founded in 2004 to create a network of multidisciplinary faculty that could partner 
together to generate applied, innovative research that would help transform the delivery of 
healthcare for vulnerable patients (older adults are a specific target), CAHRA was launched in 
2019 through an institution-created endowment and is now formally linked to IPHAM and the 
Department of Medicine. The Center is physically and strategically co-located on the same floor 
of the Arthur Rubloff Building as the Division of GIMG, as well as the Center for Behavioral 
Intervention Technologies (CBITs) and encompasses approximately 2,500 square feet of office 
space, in additional to dedicated research interview space.
The establishment  of CAHRA demonstrates Northwestern’s commitment to prioritizing aging 
research and to pursuing a leadership position in the field. The Center’s six research programs 
are a reflection of the wide-ranging research portfolio of the Center’s core faculty members: 1) 
Health Literacy & Learning, 2) Cognitive Aging, 3) Psychosocial Support, 4) Life Course Health, 5) 
Treatment Adherence, and 6) Measurement & Analysis. Together, CAHRA leads a robust 
research agenda to explore and understand the many factors that affect a person’s ability to 
manage health throughout their life and use that knowledge to develop and disseminate 
interventions that support better health.

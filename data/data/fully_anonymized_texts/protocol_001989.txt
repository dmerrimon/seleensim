[ADDRESS_1125313] of a Non -Opi[INVESTIGATOR_812585] (NOMO) P rotocol in Decreasing N arcotic  Use after 
Urogynecologic S urgery  
A. Objective  
The objective of this study is to evaluate narcotic use  after implementation of a Non -Opi[INVESTIGATOR_812585] (NOMO) 
protocol in patients who are undergoing  a urogynecologic procedure.  NOMO protocols seek to reduce the opi[INVESTIGATOR_812586]. Patients will receive multiple pain medications (usually referred to a s a “pain cocktail”) 
that work on various pain receptors throughout the body. These medications are approved for pain control; but they have 
few side effects and less addictive properties.  The study will also evaluate secondary outcomes, including: post-operative 
pain rating, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], postoperative antiemetic use, bladder catheterization at discharge, number of post -
operative phone calls, and rate of reported side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (nausea/constipation). Study participants will be aske d 
to utilize the validated Brief Pain Inventory (appendix A) scale to assess post -operative pain levels . Based on inpatient 
post-operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_812587], an attempt will be made to develop an 
algorithm for re commended opi[INVESTIGATOR_748520].  
Background  
Mortality from prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], heroin, and s ynthetic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (Fentanyl) has  increased six-fold since 1999. In 2017,  
more than 47,000 individuals died from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], with 36% of those deaths caused by [CONTACT_812599]/unintentional overdose 
from prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]1. Although  the overall prescribing rate  has declined since 2012, the amount of number of 
morphine milligram equivalents (MME) prescribed per patient is still [ADDRESS_1125314] decade to support  the use of multimodal pain regime ns in colorectal, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], bariatric, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and gynecology/oncology surgeries. Utilization of these pain regimens has been shown to decrease 
immediate post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]4, reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_27293] (nausea/constipation), and improve post -operative p ain 
scores. Our study aims to evaluate a Non -Opi[INVESTIGATOR_812585] (NOMO) protocol in the Urogynecology population.  
B. Methods  
This randomized control led trial will take place at Prisma Health – Upstate , a single tertiary -care institution. The trial will 
be registered at Clinicaltrials.gov. Recruitment will occur from July [ADDRESS_1125315]  (1:1) .  In a previous study the response within each subject group was normally 
distributed with standard deviation 20 ( 4).  If the true difference in the experimental and control means is 20, we will need 
to study [ADDRESS_1125316] the null hypothesis that the population means 
of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8.    The Type I error probability associated 
with this test  of this null hypothesis is 0.05.

 The study aims to enroll 20  patients in each arm  and accounts for a 15% dropout rate . Patients will undergo enrollment, 
randomization, and informed consent in the outpatient setting at a preoperative appointment. Consent will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_423]’s operating surgeon in the Division of Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. A research 
coordinator will assist in  identifying potential subjects for enrollment and data collection, consent collection/storage, 
marking medical records to reflect a patient’s research status , and follow up phone calls as outlined below . The coordinator 
will also perform monthly audits to ensure consents are within policy.  
Randomization will occur via a computer generated block randomization scheme in groups of [ADDRESS_1125317] postoperative pain regimen group will  undergo routine induction of anesthesia prior to surgery. 
They will not receive a pre -operative pain cocktail. These patients will receive  a postoperative regimen of  scheduled 
acetaminophen (Tylenol) 650mg orally every 6 hours, scheduled ibuprofen (Motrin) 600mg orally every 6 hours, 
oxycodone 5mg every 6 hours orally PRN moderate to severe pain  (pain rated as 4 -7 on a scale of 1 -10), IV morphine 4mg 
every 4 hours PRN breakthrough pain  (pain rated >7 on a scale of 1 -10), and diazepam (Valium) 5mg every 6 hours orally 
PRN rectal spasms/pressure.  
Patients randomized to  the NOMO treatment arm will receive a pre -operative pain cocktail in the pre-operative holding 
area prior to induction of anesthesia. This cocktail will include Celebrex PO 400mg, Lyrica PO 75mg, and Tylenol PO 
1000mg. These patients will receive intra -operative ketamine bolus of 0.5mg/kg over a ten minute period. Anesthesia teams 
will manage the administra tion of these medications per their standard protocols  that are already in place . These patients 
will receive a postoperative regimen of scheduled Lyrica 75mg orally every 12 hours, Celebrex 200mg orally every 12 
hours, and acetaminophen (Tylenol) 650mg or ally every 6 hours. As needed medications will be based on routine nursing 
assessment and evaluations. Patients reporting pain of 1 -3 will receive no medications as this will be acceptable for 
postoperative period. Patients reporting pain of 4 -7 will recei ve Toradol 15mg IV; pain of greater than 7 will warrant one 
time narcotic administration, starting with oxycodone 5mg  by [CONTACT_1966] .  
NOMO  patients will not be prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_812588] -stay unless they report a pain score of > 7  (on a scale 
of 1-10) as ascertained by [CONTACT_812600].  They will not be prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_812589] 5 doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_812590]. Patient s who require an opi[INVESTIGATOR_812591] a 3 -day opi[INVESTIGATOR_812592]. Their prescription will then 
be converted in morphine milligram equivalents for data analysis.  
Based on inpatie nt opi[INVESTIGATOR_812593] , an attempt will be made to develop an algorithm 
for recommended opi[INVESTIGATOR_748520].  A Brief Pain Inventory will be completed by [CONTACT_812601]#1 (>/= 12 hours after co mpletion of surgery) and again on POD#7. Patients will be contact[CONTACT_812602] [ADDRESS_1125318] -operative routine care in patients undergoing a scheduled  extended 
stay observation or inpatient  urogynecologic procedure.  Regimens are described as above.   
C. Outcomes  
Primary outcome: Use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_812594] ,  
Ver 0721 2019    4 
 Secondary outcomes : post-operative pain scores on Days 1, and [ADDRESS_1125319] -operative phone calls, and rate of reported side effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (nausea/constipation) . 
D. Inclusion Criteria  
The study population  includes English -speaking  females  greater than 18 years old scheduled for a urogynecologic 
procedure at GHS requiring inpatient stay or extended observation.  
E. Exclusion Criteria  
Exclusion criteria includes: Patients under [ADDRESS_1125320] six weeks, patients with current liver disease, kidney disease  (defined as GFR <60),  malignancy, 
or patients with a sulfa allergy.  
F. Data Collection  
Demographic data, medical and surgical history, and degree of prolapse will be abstract ed from the medical chart. Data 
will be collected from chart review of primary and secondary end points  (opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], prescription 
refills, and number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_812595] a prescription at the two week post -operative follow -up appointment, antiemetic use, 
bladder catheterization, rate of readmission, number of phone calls, and rate of r eported side effects. Post -operative pain 
will be evaluated with the validated Brief Pain Inventory Survey .  
Analytic Plan  
Patients will be randomized to either the standard routine care ar m or the NOMO arm via a block randomization scheme 
in blocks of 4 ; data will be stored on Redcap . Subjects within these two arms will then be stratified by [CONTACT_58314] 
(laparoscopic surgery, total vaginal surgery, or abdominal surgery) based on surgery selected by [CONTACT_812603] a shared deci sion making process. Data analyzed with an intention -to-treat analysis using an Obstetrics and 
Gynecology departmental statistician.  The statistician will be blinded to treatment arms.  
G. Risks  
Potential risks include: Loss of confidentiality  
H. Benefits  
Potential benefits include: Decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_812596],  reduced cost to the health system and patient, improved 
quality of care and overall patient satisfaction.

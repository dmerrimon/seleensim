TITLE
A Phase 4, Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety of 2 New 6:2 Influenza 
Virus Reassortant s in Adults
HYPOTHESIS
The hy pothesis for this study is that 2 new live attenuated influenza strains based on Ann Arbor master donor 
viruses (MDVs) ( Maassab, 1968 ; Maassab et al, 1985 ) will have a safety and tolerability profile consistent with 
previously evaluated strains produced using this technology.
OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study is to assess the safety of a bivalent influenza virus vaccine of 2 new 6:2 influenza 
virus reassortants in healthy adults prior to the release of the quadrivalent vaccine (FluMist®Quadrivalent) 
containing them.
STUDY ENDPOINTS
The primary endpoint of this study is fever (Days 1 through 8), defined as oral temperature ≥101°F.
The secondary end points of this study are:
1.Solicited symptoms that occur within 7 days after vaccination (Days 1 -8)
2.Adverse events (AEs) that occur within 7 days after vaccination (Days 1 -8)
3.Solicited symptoms that occur within 14 days after vaccination (Days 1 -15)
4.AEs that occur within 14 days after vaccination (Days 1 -15)
5.Serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur within 28 days after vaccination (Days 1 -29) 
6.New onset chronic diseases (NOCDs) that occur within 28 days after vaccination (Days 1-29) 
7.SAE s that occur within 180 days after vaccination (Days 1-181)
8.NOCDs that occur within 180 days after vaccination (Days 1 -181)
STUDY DESIGN   
This prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled release study will enroll approximately 
300health y adults 18 through 49 years of age (not yet reached their 50th birthday). Eligible subjects will be 
randomly  assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of bivalent vaccine or placebo by [CONTACT_24514]. 
This study will be conducted at 2 sites in the [LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]). Randomization will be stratified 
by [CONTACT_3725].
Each subject will receive one dose of investigational product on Day 1. Subjects will be followed through 
180days after receipt of investigational product.
TARGET SUBJECT POPUL ATION
The subjects in this study will be healthy adults 18 through 49 years of age (not yet reached their 50th birthday).
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSAGE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION
Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to receive a single dose of either bivalent vaccine 
(240 subjects) or placebo (60 subjects) by [CONTACT_24515] 1.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
General Considerations
Data will be provided in data listings sorted by [CONTACT_24516]. Tabular 
summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_24517]. Continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086],

3of [ADDRESS_23765] deviation , median, minimum, and maximum. Confidence intervals (CIs) will be 
two-sided, unless otherwise stated.
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all subjects that are randomized and treated with 
investigational product. All analyses will be perfor med on the ITT population unless otherwise specified.
Sample Size and Power Calculations
Based on the solicited event rates following FluMist®and placebo vaccination in healthy adults 18 to 64 years 
of age in Study AV009, the currently proposed study wit h 300 evaluable subjects (240 bivalent vaccine and 
60placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) will provide at least 98% power to rule out a rate increase of 5 percentage points 
assuming the true difference between the treatment groups is zero and the true fever rate is ≤ 1%. Power is lower 
if the true difference is different from zero. For example, if the true fever rates are 2% and 1% in vaccine and 
placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], respectively, the power will be 77%. For other solicited symptoms with 300 evaluable 
subjects (240 bivalent vaccine and 60 placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]), the currently proposed study provides at least 87% 
power to rule out a 20 percentage point increase, assuming the true difference between the 2 treatment groups is 
zero. Power is lower if the true difference is greater t han zero.
Assessment of Endpoints
The primary endpoint of this study is fever (Days 1 through 8), defined as oral temperature ≥101°F. 
Comparison of the rate of fever between the 2 treatment groups will be based on the upper limit of the two -sided 
95% exac t CIs for the rate increase (bivalent vaccine minus placebo) evaluated against the pre -specified 
equivalence criterion of 5 percentage points.
This corresponds to the null hypothesis of:
H0:  Rate difference ≥ 5 percentage points.
The alternative hypothes is is:
HA:  Rate difference < 5 percentage points.
A two -sided 95% CI will be constructed using the exact method based on the score statistic proposed by 
(Chanand Zhang, 1999 ). This method computes the lower and upper c onfidence limits by [CONTACT_24518] [ADDRESS_23766] statistic is based on the score statistic that is 
computed as the observed difference of the 2 binomial event rates minus the hypothesized value of the rate 
difference (observed rate difference) divided by [CONTACT_24519]. This test assures that the Type I error does not exceed the pre -specified level. Due to discreteness 
when the sample size is rela tively small compared to the expected event rate, the associated Type I error rate 
could be quite conservative, that is, smaller than the pre -specified level.
Secondary endpoints of the study include other reported solicited symptoms and AEs that occur wit hin 7 day s 
after vaccination (Days 1 through 8), and all solicited symptoms and AEs that occur within 14 days after 
vaccination (Days 1 through 15). Additional secondary endpoints include SAEs and NOCDs that occur within 
28 days after vaccination (Days 1 t hrough 29) and within 180 days after vaccination (Days 1 through 181).
Fever will be summarized according to the following thresholds:
• Oral > 100°F
• Oral ≥ 101°F
• Oral > 102°F
• Oral > 103°F
A secondary analysis comparing rates of other solicited symptoms (Day s 1 through 8) between the [ADDRESS_23767] two -sided 95% CIs ( Chan and Zhang, 1999 ) on the rate difference (bivalent 
vaccine minus placebo) will be constructed. There are no pre -specified e quivalence criteria for the secondary 
analy ses.

antipy retic and analgesic agents within 7 days after vaccination (Days 1 through 8) and 14 days after vaccination 
(Day s 1 through 15) wi ll be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].
Interim Analysis
A safety analysis will be conducted after all subjects have been followed through Day [ADDRESS_23768] Day 8 are locked. The analysis for Days 1 through 15 will include the primary endpo int of this study (fever 
for Day s 1 through 8, defined as oral temperature ≥101°F), as well as analysis of safety data (solicited 
symptoms and AEs), and antipyretics and analgesic use reported within 7 days and within 14 days after dosing.

10of [ADDRESS_23775]®Quadrivalent i s an intranasally administered influenza vaccine that was developed as 
a successor vaccine to FluMist®seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. FluMist contained 3 live 
reassortant strains of influenza virus, includin g 2 type A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and 
1typeB strain. Developed to address the issues of cocirculat ion of B strains fro m [ADDRESS_23776] Quadrivalent contains 4 live reassortant strains 
of influenza virus: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and [ADDRESS_23777] except that a fourth strain 
is blended into the final vaccine. The 2 vaccines are produced by [CONTACT_24521], beginning with the preparation of the Master Virus Seed (MVS) for each strain. The 
MVS for each strain contains 6 gene segments from the co ld-adapted ( ca) Master Donor Virus 
(MDV) and the hemagglut
inin and neuraminidase gene segments fro m a wild -type vi rus 
isolate and is called a 6:2 reassortant. In the [LOCATION_002] of America ([LOCATION_003]), the strains used 
for influenza vaccines each season are recommended annually  by [CONTACT_24522] (VRBPAC) to the Center for Biologics Evaluat ion 
and Research (CBER). The wild -type strains chosen for a given year are then provided to 
influenza vaccine manufacturers by  [CONTACT_24523] f or Di sease Control  and 
Prevent ion for preparation of vaccine. 
Num erous safet y tests are conducted for FluMist Quadrivalent during the manufacturing 
process of the vaccine including tests for absence of microorganisms; tests for absence of 
advent itious agents; and confirmat ion of the vaccine virus phenoty pe (col d adaptati on, 
temperature sensit ivity, and attenuat ion). Addit ionally , after new reassortants are m ade to 
match selected strains for the upcoming influenza season, their safet y profile is evaluated in a 
clinical study  in adults in order to provide further safet y data pri or to the rel ease of the 
commercial vaccine.
The design of this clinical study will ensure that any  new influenza vaccine virus reassortant 
has sufficient attenuation in humans, as dem onstrated by  [CONTACT_941] l ow incidence of fever ≥ 101°F 
(oral or equivalent). In previous clinical studies, the rate of fever in adults following 
administration of FluMist has been low and similar in both vaccinees and placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
For example, in Study AV009 conducted in 4,561 healt hy adults 18 through 64 y ears of age 
(3,[ADDRESS_23778] recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 1,520 placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]), fever ≥ 101°F occurred in 0.57% and 
0.60% of FluMist and placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], respectively. In Study  MI-CP185 conducted in 
1,800 a dults 18 through 49 y ears of age (1,[ADDRESS_23779] reci pi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) fever > 101.3°F occurred in 0.8% and 0.3% of FluMist Quadrivalent 
and FluMist recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], respectively. Thus, in a placebo -controlled study  in healt hy adult s to

11of [ADDRESS_23780] Quadrivalent is briefly described below. Refer t o the current package insert for details 
(Appendix 3). 
The active agents of FluMist Quadrivalent consist of 2 ca, tem perature -sensit ive (ts), 
attenuated ( att) reassortant influenza strains of ty pe A (i e, A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), 1 ca/ts/att
reassortant influenza strain of ty pe B-Victori a, and 1 ca/ts/att reassortant influenza strain of 
type B-Yamagata. The ty pes A and B MDVs, from which the reassorta nt strains are derived, 
were adapted to grow in primary chick kidney cells at 25°C by  [CONTACT_24524]. During the process of co ld adaptation, each virus acquired 
mutati ons that conferred unique bio logical  phenotypes o f cold adaptati on, tem perature 
sensit ivity, and attenuati on, which dist inguish these viruses fro m wild-type influenza viruses.
While the commercial formulat ion of FluMist Quadrivalent can be stored at 2°C to 8°C, the 
vaccine to be used in this study
 will r equire storage in a freezer.

1) Fl uMist Quadrivalent differs from FluMist only  in the number of influenza v irus strains; 2) 
both Fl uMist and FluMist Quadrivalent are manufactured in an ident ical manner; 3) both 
FluMist and FluMist Quadrivalent are based on the same MDV strains; 4) the total viral 
content of FluMist Quadrivalent does not exceed the maximal calcu lated viral content of 
FluMist; and 5) inactive components of FluMist and FluMist Quadrivalent are ident ical. 
Because of these similarit ies, only select nonclinical pharmaco logic studies were conducted 
with FluMist Quadrivalent, with FluMist as comparator. Repeat -dose and reproductive and 
developmental toxico logy studies were repeated wit h FluMist Quadrivalent.
Primary pharmacodynamic studies in ferrets have been conducted to evaluate the replicat ion 
and immunogenicit y of live, attenuated FluMist strains. R esults of replicat ion, 
immunogenicit y, and challenge studi es in ferrets demonstrated that vaccinat ion with FluMist 
protected animals fo llowing challenge with wild- type virus; vaccine -induced immunit y in 
these animals substant ially decreased replicat ion of the wild -type vi rus in the l ungs as well as 
the upper airways. Studies with FluMist Quadrivalent demonstrated that it was equally

14of 74 Template 16.21.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study
The Worl d Heal th Organizat ion (WHO) has made the fo llowing recommendation to vaccine 
manufacturers, effect ive 22Feb2018, regarding the influen za vaccine com position for the 
2018- 2019 influenza season:
A/Michigan/45/2015 -like virus H1N1pdm09
A/Singapore/INFIMH -
16-0019/2016 -like virus (H3N2)
B/Phuket/3073/2013 -like virus (Yamagata lineage; for quadrivalent formulat ions)
B/Colorado/06/2017 -like virus (Vi ctoria lineage)
Thus, in accordance wit h this change and these guidelines ( Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevent ion [CDC], 2016) , MedImmune has selected the fo llowing strains to be FluMist 
Quadrivalent components in the 2018- 2019 influenza season:
A/Slo venia/2903/2015 V8 (H1N1)
A/Singapore/INFIMH -
16-0019/2016 V2 (H3N2) 
B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage)
B/Colorado/06/2017 (Victoria lineage)
B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage) has been [ADDRESS_23790] since 
the 2015 -2016 season, and A/Slovenia/2903/ 2015 (H1N1) was a new strain in the 2017 - 2018 
season. 
As a result, this study , conducted in healthy adults, will evaluate the safet y of a bivalent 
vaccine containing 2 new influenza virus reassortan ts A/Singapore/INFMH -16-0019/2016 and 
B/Colorado/06/2017 prior to the release of the quadrivalent vaccine (FluMist Quadrivalent) 
containing them.
1.6 Research Hypothesis
The hypothesis for this study  is that 2 new live attenuated influenza strains based on Ann
Arbor MDVs ( Maassab, 1968 ; Maassab et al , 1985 ) will have a safet y and tol erabili ty profile 
consistent with previously evaluated strains produced using this technology.
2 OBJECTIVE
2.1 Primary Objective
The obj ective o f this study  is to assess the safet y of a bivalent influenza virus vaccine of 
2new 6:2 influenza virus reassortants in healt hy adults prior to the release of the quadrivalent 
vaccine (FluMist Quadrivalent) containing them.

popul ation. The study’s eligibilit y criteria are intended to prevent enrollment of individuals 
with medical  condi tions in who m FluMist Quadrivalent is not indicated, to minimize 
confounding circumstances that would impair the abilit y to interpret the study  resul ts, and to 
maximize the proportion of enro lled subjects complet ing the study.

17of 74 Template [IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Endpoints
Fever has been chosen as a primary  endpoint, because i t is a commo n and object ive 
consequence o f infect ion with wild -type influenza. Fever occurring at a greater rate in the 
vaccine group than the placebo group would, therefore, suggest that new influenza vaccine 
virus strain smight not be sufficient ly attenuated. Regulatory authorit ies have accepted this 
measure of attenuation of new influenza vaccine virus strains over many years and have 
requi red thi s testing pri or to thei r authorizing release of the FluMist or FluMist Quadri valent 
vaccine containing any  new influenza strains each year.
Secondary  endpoints of the study  include other reported solicited symptoms and AEs that 
occur wi thin 7 days after vaccinat ion (Days 1 -8), and all so licited symptoms and AEs that 
occur wi thin 14 days after vaccinat ion (Days 1 -15). Addi tional secondary  endpoints include 
SAEs and NOCDs that occur within 28 days after vaccination (Days 1 -29) and wi thin 180 
days after vaccinat ion (Day s 1-181).
The reporti ng period of 14 day s (Days 1 through 15) for s olicited symptoms, including fever, 
and AEs is consistent with the incubat ion peri od of influenza.

4.1 Subjects
4.1.1 Number of Subjects
This study  will enroll approximately 300 healthy adults 18 through 49 y ears of age (not y et 
reached their 5 0th bi rthday). Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:[ADDRESS_23795] m eet all of the fo llowing cri teria:
1Age 18 through 49 y ears at the tim e of screening (not yet reached their 50 thbirthday).
2Written inform ed consent and any  locally requi red authori zation (ie, Heal th Insurance 
Portabilit y and Accountabilit y Act [HIPAA] in the [LOCATION_003]) obtained from the subject/legal 
representative prior to perfo rming any protocol -related procedures, including screening 
evaluat ions.

acceptable methods of contraception.
Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically  sterile 
(ie, surgi cal sterilizati on includes bilateral  tubal  ligati on, bilateral  oophorectomy , or 
complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses 
without an al ternat ive medical caus e).
A highly effect ive method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low 
failure rate (ie, less than 1% per y ear) when used consistent ly and correctly. 
Examples of acceptable methods of contraception are described in Table 1. 
4Nonsterilized male subjects who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing 
potenti al must use a m ale condom  with spermicide from  Day  [ADDRESS_23798] occurs on Day  1.

Study  parti cipat ion begins (ie, a subject is “enro lled”) once written informed consent is 
obtained. Once informed consent is obtained, a subject ident ificat ion (SID) number will be 
assigned by  a central  system  (eg, an interactive web response system, IWRS) , and the 
screening evaluat ions m ay begin to assess study  eligibilit y (inclusio n/exclusio n) cri teria. The 
SID number will be used to ident ify the subject during the screening process and throughout 
study  participati on, if applicable. 
Subjects will be rand omized at a 4:1 ratio to receive either a single dose of bivalent vaccine or 
placebo by  [CONTACT_24529] . Randomizat ion will be stratified by  [CONTACT_3725].
A master log of all consented subjects will be maintained at the site and will document all 
screening failur es (ie, subjects who are consented but do not meet study  eligibilit y criteria 
and/or are not randomized), including the reason(s) for screening failure.
Subjects who fail to meet the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria (ie, screening failures) should not be 
rando mized (if applicable) or receive invest igational product.
4.1.5 Withdrawal from  the Study
Subjects are at any  time free to wi thdraw from  the study  (invest igational product and

Invest igational product should be brought to room temperature by  [CONTACT_24538] o f the hand and supporting the plunger rod with the thumb (see Appendix 3). 
The invest igational product should be administered immediately thereafter.
A single administration co mprises intranasal delivery  of approximately 0.5 m L total  
volume (0.25 mL into each nostril). Each sprayer has a divider that allo ws delivery of 
approximately  half the contents of the spray er into one nostril. Remo val o f the divider 
allows delivery  of the rem aining vo lume into the other nostril.
The individual administering the invest igational product should depress the plunger rod a s 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24506] a fine mist. Half of the contents of each sprayer will be 
spray ed as a fine mist into each nostril while the subject is in an upright posit ion.
After administration, used study  sprayers must be placed immediately  after use into 
locked containers or sealed bags.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring of Dose Administration
After vaccination, all subjects will be observed for a minimum of 15 minutes by [CONTACT_8702]. Emergency management supplies (eg, AMBU bag, adrenaline [epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]],

4.7.3 Endpoints............................
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Endpoint
The primary  endpoint of this study  is fever (Days 1 through 8), defined as oral temperature 
≥101°F. Comparison of the rate of fever between the 2 treatm ent groups will be based on the 
upper limit of the two- sided 95% exact CIs for the rate increase (bivalent vaccine minus 
placebo) evaluated against the pre -specified equivalence criterion of 5 percentage points.
This corresponds to the null hypothesi s of:
H0:  Rate difference ≥ 5 percentage points.
MedImmune Protocol D2560C0001 5
MEDI3250 (FluMist®Quad rivalent) 27Mar2018; Final
33of 74 Template 16.2The al ternat ive hypothesis is:
HA:  Rate difference < 5 percentage points.
A two -sided 95% CI will be constructed using the exact method based on the score statistic 
proposed by  (Chan and Zhang, 1999 ). This m ethod com putes the l ower and upper confidence 
limits by [CONTACT_24518] [ADDRESS_23830] ic that is co mputed as the observed d ifference of the 
2binomial event rates minus the hypothesized value of the rate difference (observed rate 
difference) divided by [CONTACT_24544]. 
This test assures that the Ty pe I error does not excee d the pre -specified level. Due to 
discreteness when the sample size is relat ively small co mpared to the expected event rate, the 
associ ated Ty pe I error rate coul d be qui te conservative, that i s, sm aller than the pre -specified 
level.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoints
Secondary  endpoints of the study  include other reported solicited symptoms and AEs that 
occur wi thin 7 days after vaccinat ion (Days 1 -8), and all so licited symptoms and AEs that 
occur wi thin 14 days after vaccinat ion (Days 1 -15). Addi tional secondary  endpoin ts include 
SAEs and NOCDs that occur within 28 days after vaccination (Days 1 -29) and wi thin 
180days after vaccinat ion (Days 1 through 181).
Fever will be summarized according to the fo llowing threshol ds:
Oral > 100°F
Oral ≥ 101°F
Oral > 102°F
Oral > 103° F
A secondary  analysis co mparing rates of other solicited symptoms (Days 1 -8) between the 
2treatm ent groups will be performed. Exact two -sided 95% CIs ( Chan and Zhang, 1999 ) on 
the rate difference (bivalent vaccine minu s placebo) will  be constructed. There are no pre -
specified equivalence criteria for the secondary analyses.
The number of days of so licited symptoms and the proportion of subjects experiencing each 
event by  [CONTACT_24545]. The distribut ion of 
the number of days with each individual event will also be summarized without formal 
statist ical comparison. The proporti on of  subjects using ant ipyretic and analgesic agents 
within 7 days after vaccination (Days 1- 8) and 14 days after vaccinat ion (Day s 1 -15) will  be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_3227].

5 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
5.1 Definition of Adverse Events
The ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6(R1) defines an AE as:
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical i nvest igation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a causal  
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (incl uding an abnorm al laboratory  finding), symptom, or dis ease tem porally 
associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE includes but is not limited to any  clinically  significant worsening of a subject’s pre -
exist ing condit ion. An abnormal laborat ory finding (including electrocardiogram finding) that 
requi res medical intervent ion by [CONTACT_3170], or a finding judged by [CONTACT_24548]. If clinical sequelae are associated with a 
laboratory  abnorm ality, the di agnosis or m edical condit ion should be reported (eg, renal 
MedImmune Protocol D2560C0001 5
MEDI3250 (FluMist®Quad rivalent) 27Mar2018; Final
35of 74 Template 16.2failure, hematuria) not the laboratory  abnorm ality (eg, el evated creatinine, urine red blood cell 
increased). Abnormal laboratory  values that are not, in the invest igator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, medically  
significant and do not require intervent ion shoul d not be reported as AEs.
Adverse events may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after init ial receipt of invest igational 
product) or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment- emergent AE is any new sign or 
symptom , disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written informed consent 
has been obtained but before the subject has received invest igational product. 
Elect ive treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery  (that was scheduled prior to 
the subject being enro lled into the study ) for a docum ented pre -existing condit ion that di d not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). An untoward medical 
event occurring during the prescheduled elect ive p rocedure or routinely scheduled treatment 
shoul d be recorded as an AE or SAE.
5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE that:
Results in death
Is immediately life -threatening
Requi res inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24508] 
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y 
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect in o ffspring of the subject
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcom es listed above
Medical or scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in this situat ion. Examples of medically important events are 
intensive treatm ent in an emergency  room  or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509]; or development of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse.

limited to di abetes, asthm a, autoimmune disease (eg, lupus, rheumatoid a rthritis), and 
neuro logical disease (eg, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , auti sm). Events that would not be considered NOCDs are 
mild eczema, diagnosis of a congenital ano maly present at study  entry , or acute illness (eg, 
otitis media, bronchit is). An NOCD should also be reporte d as an SAE if it meets the 
definit ion in Sect ion 5.2. If an NOCD occurs within [ADDRESS_23836] dosing, the event should also 
be reported as an AE (Se ction 5.1).
5.[ADDRESS_23837], possible etio logies, and whether the event 
meets cri teria of an SAE and therefore requires immediate notificat ion to MedImmune Patient 
Safety. See Section 5.2for the definit ion of SAEs and Appendix 2for guidelines for 
assessment of severit y and rel ationship. If an AE evo lves into a condit ion that m eets the 
regul atory  defini tion of  “seri ous,” i t will be reported on the SAE Report Form.
5.5.[ADDRESS_23838] dosing (Days 1 
through 15).
All SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent through [ADDRESS_23839] dosing 
(Day s 1 through 181).
5.5.2 Recording of Solicited Symptoms
Solicited symptoms will be reported using the terms as defined in this protocol (Section 5.3). 
Oral therm ometers and safet y assessment worksheets will be distributed to subjects on the day  
of investigational product administration. Beginning on the evening of the day  of 
investigat ional product administration th rough [ADDRESS_23840] 
(Day s 1 through 15), the subject will record on the worksheets his/her temperature and the

judged ne cessary .
5.[ADDRESS_23842], or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of th e study , then Invest igators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate Sponsor representative(s) within [ADDRESS_23843] igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) sy stem , an au tomated em ail alert is sent to inform the designated Sponsor 
study  representative(s).
If the EDC system is not available, then the Invest igator or other study  site personnel  reports a 
SAE to the appropriate Sponsor study  representati ve by [CONTACT_756]. The Sponsor study  
representative will advise the Invest igator/study  site personnel how to proceed.

5.7.1 Overdose ……………………
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of invest igational product in excess of 
that specified in the Package Insert ( Appendix 3), unless otherwise specified in this protocol.
An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diag nosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the overdose eCRF 
module. If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune study  drug occurs i n the course 
of the s tudy, then the Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate Sponsor 
study  representatives immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_23844] igator to e nsure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the Sponsor’s Patient Safet y data entry  site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting t imelines apply (see Section 5.6). 
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 day s.
5.7.2 Pregnancy
……….
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancies should be reported to the Sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Maternal Exposure
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unles s there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_24510] n that the 
investigat ional product under study  may have interfered with the effect iveness of a 
contraceptive medicat ion.  Congenital abnormalit ies/bi rth defects and spontaneous 
miscarri ages shoul d be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elec tive abortions without 
complicat ions should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarri age, el ective terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormalit y) 
shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the s ubject was discont inued from the study.
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate Sponsor study  representatives wi thin [ADDRESS_23845] igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the Sponsor’s Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 5

7.[ADDRESS_23854] Data Protection
The Informed Consent Form will incorporate (or, in so me cases, be acco mpanied by a 
separate document incorporating) wording that complies wit h relevant data protection and 
privacy  legislat ion.
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identi ty of the subject. In except ional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal ident ifiers of a subject. For example, in the case of a 
medical emergency, a MedImmune Medical Monit or or an invest igator might know a 
subject’s ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data. Also Regulatory Authorities 
may require access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the 
genet ic files would remain physically separate.
7.3 Ethics and Regulatory Review
An IRB/IEC should approve the final study  protocol , including the final versio n of the 
Inform ed Consent Form and any  other written info rmation and/or materials to be provided to 
the subjects. The invest igator will ensure the distribut ion of these documents to the applicable 
IRB/IEC, and to the study  site staff.
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the IRB/IEC should be given in writing. The invest igator should submit the 
written approval  to MedImmune before enrolment of any subject into the study . 
The IRB/IEC should approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study .

an imminent risk of death or with ph ysical or mental disabilit ies 
that affect or limit the abilit y of the subject to perform activit ies 
of daily living (eat ing, ambulation, toilet ing, etc).
Grade 5 (fatal) Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.
It is important to dist inguish between serious cri teria and severit y of an AE. Severit y is a 
measure of intensit y whereas seri ousness is defined by  [CONTACT_24554]5.2. A Grade [ADDRESS_23862].
An event will be considered “not r elated” to use of the investigational product if any of the 
following tests are met:
MedImmune Protocol D2560C0001 5
MEDI3250 (FluMist®Quad rivalent) 27Mar2018; Final
48of 74 Template 16.2An unreasonable temporal relat ionship between administration of the invest igational 
product and the onset of the event (eg, the event occurred either before, or too long after, 
administration of the investigat ional product for it to be considered product- related)
A causal relat ionship between the investigational product and the event is bio logically  
implausible (eg, death as a passenger in an automobile accident)
A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the event is present (eg, ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_24513] a concomitant drug and/or ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_5194] -related event)
Individual AE/SAE reports will be considered “related” to use of the investigational product if 
the “no t related” cri teria are not m et. 
“Related” implies that the event is considered to be “associated with the use of the drug” 
meaning that there is “a reasonable possibilit y” that the event may  have been caused by  [CONTACT_24555] (ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest possible 
causat ion).
Relationship to Protocol Procedures
The invest igator is also required to provide an assessment of relat ionship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatme nt-emergent SAEs (ie, SAEs 
that occur prior to the administration o f investigational product) as well as treatment -emergent 
SAEs. A protocol -related SAE m ay occur as a result of a procedure or intervent ion required 
during the study  (eg, bl ood collect ion, washout of an exist ing medicat ion). The fo llowing 
guidelines shoul d be used by  [CONTACT_24556]:
Protocol  related: The event occurred due to a procedure/intervention that was described 
in the protocol for whic h there i s no al ternat ive et iology  present in the 
subject’s medical record.
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etio logy other than the procedure/ 
intervent ion that was described in the protocol (the alternative et iology 
must be documented in the study  subject’s m edical record).

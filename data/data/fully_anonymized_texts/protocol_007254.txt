B. Indication  Metastatic HER2 -negative breast cancer ; no more than three prior lines of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy  for metastatic disease  
C. Clinical Phase  Phase II   
 
D. Summary of 
Rationale  
 
 Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal 
antibody designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 (programmed 
death -1) and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. A strategy of combining 
chemotherapy with immunotherapy is a promisi ng approach for treatment of 
HER2 -negative breast cancer.  There is little known about the optimal sequence 
of administration of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in breast cancer. This 
study will evaluate the safety of a phased regimen , paclitaxel only for 2 cycles 
then pembrolizumab and paclitaxel, and a concurrent regimen , 
pembrolizumab given concurrently with paclitaxel upfront.  
E. Study 
Objectives  The primary objective of  this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the 
two regimens . 
 
Secondary objectives are to assess overall survival (OS), progression -free 
survival (PFS) , objective  response rate (ORR ), duration of response (DoR), and 
disease control rate (DCR) .   
 
Exploratory objectives include assessment of PD -L1 status and genomic profile 
of tumors.

2. BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
2.1. Metastatic HER2 -negative Breast Cancer  
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096788] cancer .1  
Single agent or combination chemotherapy produces response rates of 40 -70% in the 
treatment of advanced breast cancer.  Although numerous regimens are effective in palliating 
symptoms and inducing tumor regression, the complete response ra te is less than 20%.  
Moreover, the median duration of response is nine months  with a median survival of [ADDRESS_1096789] responses are of limited duration and nearly all patients with stage IV disease 
eventual ly die of disease progression .  Therefore, the treatment of patients with metastatic 
human epi[INVESTIGATOR_141736] 2 ( HER2 )-negative breast cancer warrants 
investigation of novel therapeutic strategies.  
The treatment algorithm for patients with metastatic breast cancer  (MBC ) is based on several  
factors which include clinical, pathologic, and histologic characteristics such as the presence 
or absence of human e pi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] [ADDRESS_1096790] cancer that is estrogen receptor (ER) - 
negative, proge sterone receptor (PR) -negative, and HER2 -negative, chemotherapy at present  
is the mainstay of treatment.  
 
2.2. Taxanes in Breast Cancer  
Taxanes are among the most active of chemotherapy agents for the treatment of M BC in 
terms of response rates or survival, ba sed on a metaanalysis of three randomized trials 
comparing a taxane - with an anthracycline .[ADDRESS_1096791] 
cancer has been well established  in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings.  The response 
rates for paclitaxel administered as a  single agent to patients with M BC are approximat ely 
25% in firstline - treatment .3,[ADDRESS_1096792] common practice is to administer paclitaxel on a weekly schedul e based on the 
results of a 2010 meta -analysis, which showed that compared wit h every three -week 
treatment, weekly administration of paclitaxel resulted in an improvement in overall survival 
(OS, hazard ratio [HR] 0.78, 95% CI 0.67 -0.89) .[ADDRESS_1096793] institutions, s teroid premedication ( IV dexamethasone  8-12 mg 30 
minutes prior to the paclitaxel dose ) is administered, although it can usually be discontinued 
if the first tw o or three doses are tolerated.

2.3. Programmed Death -1 (PD -1) Check point Inhibitor as a Strategy for Treatment 
of Breast Cancer  
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have 
demonstrated  that therapi[INVESTIGATOR_795124] - responses against cancer can result 
in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies .7-[ADDRESS_1096794] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548] .10 The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T 
cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD-1 is an immunoglob ulin (Ig) superfamily 
member related to CD28 and Cytotoxic T -Lymphocyte  Associated Protein 4 (CTLA -4), 
which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of 
its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2). PD-1 and family members are t ype I transmembrane 
glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding 
and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules . 
Following T cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine pho sphatases Src -Homology 2 
domain -containing phosphatase -1 and -2 (SHP -1 and SHP -2) to the ITSM within its 
cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules, such as CD3ζ, 
Protein Kinase C theta (PKCθ ) and Zeta -chain -Associated Protein kinase 70 (ZAP70), which 
are involved in the -Homology 2 domain -containing phosphatase -1 and -2 (SHP -1 and SHP -
2) to the ITSM within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of e ffector 
molecules, such as CD3ζ, Protein Kinase C theta (PKCθ) and Zeta -chain -Associated Protein 
kinase 70 (ZAP70), which are involved in the CD3 T cell signaling cascade . PD-1 was 
shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ a nd CD8+ T 
cells, B cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Natur al Killer (NK) cells .12 CD3 T cell signaling 
cascade. PD -1 was shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes, including peripheral 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B  cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells.  
The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induce d in a 
variety of cell types . PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, 
most  notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed 
on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chroni c inflammatory 
environments .13   
Binding of either PD -1 ligand to PD -1 inhibits T cell activation triggered through the T cell 
receptor. PD -L2 is thought to control immune T cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas 
PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T cell function in peripheral tissues.  Although healthy 
organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demo nstrated to express 
abundant levels of  this T cell inhibitor,  which, via its interaction with the PD -1 receptor on

 tumor -specific T cells, plays a critical role  in immune evasion by [CONTACT_15198] .14 As a 
consequence, the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway is  an attractive target for therape utic intervention  in 
cancer .[ADDRESS_1096795] cytotoxic agents, 
and includes the observation that cancer immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_795125], enabling 
them to be given for longer periods of ti me and in combination with other agents without 
added toxicity.  There also is p otentially less likelihood to develop resistance to 
immunotherapy because of the immune system’s ability to simultaneously target multiple 
cancer antigens and adapt to mutating  cancer cells.  
 
2.4. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 
and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  This blockade  enhances functional activity of the target 
lymphocytes to facilitate tumor regression and ultimately immune rejection.  
 
2.4.1.  Nonclinical Studies  
The noncl inical strategy of the pembrolizumab  program was to demonstrate in  vitro  and 
in vivo activity, to determi ne in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior, to demonstrate an 
acceptable safety profile, and to identify a Phase I starting dose.  Comprehensive 
pharmacology, PK, and toxicology evaluations were thus undertaken with 
pembrolizumab . 
The safety, pharmacokinetic s, and toxicokinetics  of pembrolizu mab were investigated in 
mice and cynomolgus monkeys to support IV  administration and to aid in  projecting the 
appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the high amino acid homology of the 
extracellular regions of PD -1 between cynomolgus monkey and human, the cynomolgus 
monkey was selected as the primary and relevant n onclinical model for understanding the 
toxicology of pembrolizumab.  
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxic okinetics observed for 
pembrolizumab  supported entry into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety 
factors for the proposed Phase I starting doses.  T he results of the preclinical program 
were consistent with the anticipated  activity of pembrolizumab to enhance the functional 
activity of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes to induce tumor regression and ultimately 
immune rejection by [CONTACT_632734] -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and

Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies .16 
 
2.4.2.  Clinical Studies – Approval  of Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab  was approved in the [LOCATION_002] o n September 4, 2014  by [CONTACT_795157], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF 
inhibitor.  This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor 
response rate and durability of response.  
Approval was based on the results of a multicenter, open -label, randomized (1:1), dose -
comparative, activity -estimating cohort conducted within Trial P N001, which was the 
first-in human  dose cohort escalation study of pembroliz umab that enrolled subjects into 
4 parts (Parts A -D, A = any advanced solid tumor, B = melanoma, C =  NSCLC, and D = 
melanoma, 2 dos es of pembrolizuma b). 
 
In this cohort, [ADDRESS_1096796] dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation 
positive, prior treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, were randomized to receive 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=89) or 10 mg/kg (n=84) intravenously once every 3 weeks 
until disease  progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
  
Key exclusion criteria were an autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required 
immunosuppression, and/or a history o f severe immune -mediated adverse reactions from 
treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Seve re immune -mediated adverse reactions were defined as 
any CTCAE Grade 4 toxicity requiring treatment with corticosteroids or Grade 3 toxicity 
requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent d ose) 
for greater than 12 weeks . 
 
The major efficacy endpoints were confirmed o bjective  response rate (ORR) according to 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) as assessed by a blinded 
independent review committee and duration of response (DOR).  In the lower dose that 
was ultima tely appr oved, 2 mg/kg, the ORR was 26 % (95% CI, 1 7-37%). A total of 21 
patients showed a response, including one patient with a complete response. Three of the 
patients (14%) had disease progression at 2.8 months, 2.9 months, and 8.2 months after 
the initial response. The other 18 patients (86%) showed durable responses of 1.4 to 8.5 
months. Of note, eight patients (38%) had ongoing responses of ≥ 6 months. Similar 
ORR results were observed in the 10 mg/kg arm.17 Treatment was well tolerated, with 
similar safety profiles in the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups and no d rug-related deaths. 
The most common drug -related adverse events of any grade in the 2 mg/kg and 10  mg/kg 
groups were fatigue (33% vs 37%), pruritus (26% vs 19%), and rash (18% vs 18% ). 
Grade 3 fatigue, reported in five (3%) patients in the 2 mg/kg pembroli zumab group, was 
the only drug -related grade 3 to 4 adverse event reported in more than one patient.

 Additionally, two multicenter, randomized, controlled therapeutic confirmatory trials in 
patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_795126] (KEYNOTE -
002/Trial P002) and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -naive (KEYNOTE -006/Trial P006), evaluated co -
primary endpoints of progression -free survival and overall survival, and have results .   
 
In the KEYNOTE -002 trial, 540 patients with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -refractory advanced melanoma 
were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg (n = 180), 10 mg/kg (n = 181), or 
chemotherapy (n = 179) .18  Chemotherapy was selected by [CONTACT_795158], paclitaxel, carboplatin, dacarbazine, or 
temozolomide. Pembrolizumab was administered every 3 weeks.  Both pembrolizumab 
arms were significantly superior to chemotherapy ( P <.0001). At the recommended 2 -
mg/kg dose, pembrolizuma b demonstrated a PFS of 34% at 6 months and 24% at 9 
months. In the chemotherapy arm, the PFS was 16% and 8%, at the 6 - and 9 -month 
analyses, respectively.  
 
At the 2 -mg/kg dose, the ORR with pembrolizumab was 21% with a median duration of 
respo nse that was not yet reached. The ORR in the chemotherapy arm was 4%, the 
median response duration was 37 weeks. At the analysis, 63% of responses were 
ongoing. Treatment was relatively well tolerated, with grade [ADDRESS_1096797] common pembrolizumab -related adverse events 
were fatigue,  pruritus, and rash. Grade 3 immune related toxicity was reported in two 
patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (hepatitis, hypophysitis), and in eight 
patients given pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, and iritis or 
uveitis).  
 
In the phase III KEYNOTE -006 trial, pembrolizumab  demonstrated significantly longer 
PFS and improved overall survival compared with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_795127] .19 This trial included 834 pat ients with unresectable 
stage III or IV advanced melanoma who had received no more than one prior systemic 
therapy. Patients were randomized to receive four cycles of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg every 
3 weeks (n = 278), 10 mg/kg of pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (n  = 277), or 10 mg/kg of 
pembrolizumab every 2 weeks (n = 279 ). Patient  response in KEYNOTE -[ADDRESS_1096798] 1.1. Median follow -up was 
8 months. Both doses of pembrolizumab were found to be superior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134].  At a 6 -
month assessment, the PFS with pembrolizumab was 47% and 46% in the 2 - and 3 -week 
arms respectively. For ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the PFS rate was 27%. At 9 months, PFS rates were 
40% and 42% compared with 16%, in the 2 -week, 3 -week, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_795128], 
respectively. In  the 3 -week pembrolizumab arm, the 1 -year OS rate was 68% compared 
with 58% for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (HR, 0.69). In the 2 -week arm, the 1 -year OS rate was 74% 
(HR, 0.63). The objective response rates (ORR) were 33.7 % and 32.9%, in the 2 - and 3 -
week  arms. In the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772], the ORR was 11.9 %. The  toxicity profiles of the 
agents were consistent with other reported studies of the two checkpoint agents. Though 
pembrolizumab was administered for a longer duration, rates of grade 3 -5 adverse e vents 
were  numerically lower th an in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_44772] (11.7% vs 19.9%). There were no 
differences in efficacy parameters in any patient subsets, with the exception of a lack of

Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096799] cancer, a multi -center, non -randomized p hase Ib trial (Keynote  012) showed that 
single -agent pembrolizumab given at 10 mg/kg Q2W is a well -tolerated and effective 
treatment with significant  therapeutic activity in a subset of heavily pre -treated patients 
with metastatic triple -negative breast cancer  (TNBC)  20.  
 
The phase Ib study enrolled 32 patients with TNBC who had recurrent or metastatic 
disease (47% of which had more than three lines of previous chemotherapy) with PD -L1 
expression in their  tumor (58% of all patients screened had PD -L1- positive tumors .). 
Pembrolizumab was administered 10 mg/kg intravenously every [ADDRESS_1096800] v1.1 every 8 weeks. Treatment with PD -1 
blockade was tolerable, with 56% of patients reporting an adverse event, but only 16% 
with grade 3 –5 toxicity. There was one treatment -related death caused by [CONTACT_795159]. The ORR was 19% (27 patients were evaluable for response) 
with one (4%) complete response, four (15%) partial responses, and seven patients (26%)

There is an international, multi -center phase II clinical trial of pembrolizuma b as 
monothera py that is currently enrolling patients with metastatic triple -negative breast 
cancer (Keynote 086;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  The results of this trial and others that are 
evaluating checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer  will help 
further the clinical development of immunotherapeutic agents in this breast cancer 
subtype.  
 
2.4.4.  Rationale for  Flat Dosing of  Pembrolizumab  
An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) has been conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent pembrolizumab.  The dose escalation portion of that trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered e very 2 weeks 
(Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated 
and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
8 
 pembrolizumab showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor 
size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has 
been identified to date.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the pembrolizumab 
program has shown that a lower dose of pembrolizumab and a less frequent sch edule may 
be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity. The currently approved dose of 
pembrolizumab is 2 mg/kg IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks.   
 
PK data analysis of pembrolizumab administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limi ted volume of distribution, and a long half -life16.  Pharmacodynamic data 
(IL-2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  
This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for evaluating a 
Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed us ing serum concentration 
time data from [ADDRESS_1096801] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indicat ion.  The 
differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body 
weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure 
margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for pembrolizumab in the melanoma indication. The expo sure 
margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg 
Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and 
exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of 
tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and 
melanoma indications. Therefore, we do not anticipate  changes in exposure between 
different indication settings.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W dose of pembrolizumab (fixed  dosing) is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that 
the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally 
consistent with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2 ) will maintain 
individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated 
with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patient ’s exposure in the 
exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated  and safe.

Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096802] cancer.22  Paclitaxel therapy has been shown to increase tumor -associated 
macrophages (TAMs) infiltration in breast tumors.[ADDRESS_1096803] cancer, 
potentially suppressing an anti -tumor response.25 
 
Paclitaxel therapy has demonstrated the ability to induce apoptosis and impair these T 
regulatory cells (potential drivers of peripheral tolerance) preferentially, but not effector T 
cells (potential drivers or effectors of tumor -cell killing), which could potentially shift the 
balance to anti -tumor immune activa tion. In addition, immune activation in lung cancer 
patients after paclitaxel treatment was reported and the generation of pro -inflammatory 
cytokines IFN - and IL -2, as well as the expression of T -cell activation markers was 
increased in lung cancer patients after paclitaxel treatment.24 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096804], paclitaxel has also been show to upregulate PD -L1 expression, ultimately 
reversing its p otential tumor immune activation.24 PD-1 expression is induced when T cells 
are activated.27 An important role of PD -1 is to limit T cell effector activation and enhance T 
regulatory mechanisms.28 
 
Pembrolizumab blocks the binding of PD -1 expressed on immune cells to its ligand (PD -L1) 
expressed in tumors, blocking of which potentially reverses down -regulation of cellular 
immunity to the tumor. Pembrolizumab has demonstrated promising anti -tumor ac tivity in a 
variety of tumors, including known immunogenic tumors (i.e. melanoma), as well as tumors 
previously considered less immunogenic ( i.e., NSCLC).  Chemotherapy in combination with 
anti-PD-[ADDRESS_1096805] several mouse tumor models 
(Pembrolizumab IB) and clinical results support this combination approach.29  
 
When combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy, it is important to determine the 
optimal dose, schedule and sequence. There is some data on the optimal timing and dose  of 
immunotherapy with chemotherapy. Results from two multicenter phase II lung cancer trials 
showed that a “phased regimen” in which immunotherapy begins after chemotherapy 
resulted in improved progression -free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone.  
 
Combining ipi[INVESTIGATOR_795129],  significantly improved immune -
related progression -free survival (irPFS) compared with chemotherapy alone in a phase II 
study in patients with NSCLC and extensive disease SCLC.29,30 However, the improvement 
in irPFS was only evident when the drugs were given on a phased schedule (e.g., two doses 
of placebo plus paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by [CONTACT_477305][INVESTIGATOR_452683]/carboplatin), not when they were given concurrently. Phased ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
concurrent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and control, respectively, were associated with medi an irPFS of 5.7, 
5.5, and 4.6 months in patients with NSCLC, and 6.4, 5.7, and 5.3 months in patients with 
SCLC. The overall incidence of treatment -related grade 3/4 adverse events was similar 
across the arms, and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_795130] e adverse events associated

patients who have not experienced an infusion hypersensitivity reaction with the first two

The primary safety objective of this trial is to characterize the safety and tolerability of 
pembrolizumab and paclitaxel (phased vs concurrent) in subjec ts with HER2 -negative 
metastatic breast cancer.  The primary safety analysis will be based on subjects who 
experienced toxicities as defined by [CONTACT_3989], Version 4.0 criteria. The attribution to 
study  drug(s), time -of-onset, duration of the event, its resolution, and any concomitant 
medications administered will be recorded.  AEs will be analyzed including but not 
limited to all AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and laboratory changes.  
 
2.6.2.  Rationale for Use of irRECIST Criteria  
Immunotherapeutic agents may produce ant itumor effects by [CONTACT_795161] -specific immune responses, which may be functionally anergic prior to treatment. 
The response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typi[INVESTIGATOR_795132], and can manifest as a clinical response 
after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions (transient 
tumor flare). Thus, standard RECIST criteria may not provide a complete response

[IP_ADDRESS].  Patient -Derived Xenografts  (PDX) Models  
Cancer research and drug development have historically relied upon the use of in 
vitro cell lines and in vivo models such as genetically -engineered mice and cell line -
injected mice (i.e., cell line xenografts).  These models lack critical elements such as 
tumor heterogeneity and its associated microenvironment and therefore do not 
provide an accurate representation of a patient’s tumor.   
 
PDX models have been established by [CONTACT_277994] a fragment of a patient’s fresh 
tumor tissue into immune -deficient mice.   Tumors are allowed to engraft and grow 
before they are resected and subsequently implanted into a second generation of mice.  
Once growth is observed in the second generation of mice, the PDX model is 
considered successfully established and can be mainta ined and passaged into 
subsequent generations of mice or cryopreserved for future use.  Extensive 
characterization of PDX models with regard to histopathology, gene expression and 
genomic sequence has shown high fidelity of the molecular characteristics of  the 
original patient tumor. Therefore, these models have a distinct advantage over other 
models and have become an important in vivo model for oncology research and drug 
development.   
 
The use of PDX models as a robust research platform for optimizing on cology drug 
development efforts has been well recognized; however, until recently data was 
lacking to support the accuracy of these models to predict clinical response.  
Champi[INVESTIGATOR_795135] h degree of accuracy of personalized PDX models in predicting response of 
individual patients across a variety of tumor types.  
 
For this study, the objective is to collect tumor tissue in metastatic triple -negative 
breast cancer subjects  to create patient -derived xenograft mouse models for 
translational research purposes.  This will give potential insight to mechanisms of 
response and resistance, pre - and post -treatment, with this combination regimen.    
 
Fresh tumor tissue will be obtained through a biopsy  during screening . To maximize 
the success of tumor engraftment in the immune -deficient mouse, it is requested that 
approximately 0.5 cm3 or a minimum of 3 core biopsies using an  18 gauge needle (or

by [CONTACT_795162] a panel (≥40 genes).  This will be 
collected pre -treatment  and at the timepoints as defined in Section 5.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  BRCA Mutations  
A phase II study identified the first genomic marker —mismatch repair 
deficiency —to predict clinical benefit of immune checkpoint blockade with the 
anti–PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. Among 28 patients with colorectal cancer, 
40% of the 10 patients with mismatch repair –deficient tumors responded to 
pembrolizumab, but no responses were seen among the 18 mism atch repair –
proficient patients. The difference in disease control rates (response plus stable 
disease) was even greater: 90% in the mismatch repair –deficient group and only 
11% in the mismatch repair –proficient group.[ADDRESS_1096825] not had germline testing performed.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3.  Biomarkers in the Blood  
A pre-treatment  blood sample will be collected with additional blood collected at 
subsequent time points according to the study calendar  in Section 5 , using one 
serum separator tube (SST) and two cell preparation tubes (CPT) for blood cells 
separation and storage.  Samples will be delivered to the CHS Bio Specimen 
Repository to be processed and stored for batch analysis at the end of the study. 
The anal ysis will include but no t be limited to immunotypi[INVESTIGATOR_795137]. David Foureau’s LCI Immune Monitoring Core Laboratory.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].4.  Optional and Future Studies  
All study participants will be invited to provide blood sample s for future 
unplanned stud ies.  Participation will be optional for all subjects  entering the 
study. A subject ’s acceptance of unplanned future analyses will not be a 
requirement of their participation in the main study.  Subjects will have the 
opportunity to consent or refuse the collection of these samples for additional 
unplanned studies. If the subject agrees to this collection, t wo 10 ml tubes of 
blood will be collected  pre-treatment  and other timepoints  as defined in Section 5 ,

4.5. Treatment  
4.5.1.  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for any new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Study Calendar and more frequently if clinically 
indicated.  Adverse events will be graded and recorded throughout the study from  
randomization  through  [ADDRESS_1096826] treatment tumor imaging assessment s should be performed at the time points 
specified in the Study Calendar in Section 5 .  The same modality used at screening 
should be used at all follow -up imaging assessments.

If no bone lesions were identified at Baseline, bone scans will only be repeated as 
clinically indicated (i.e . showing signs or symptoms of new or progressing bone 
metastases). Subjects with bone metastasis present at Baseline will have bone scans at 
the same time point as study tumor imaging (CT/MRI), based on how long subjects  have 
been on study as defined in S ection [ADDRESS_1096827] follow -up imaging time -point (prior to pembrolizumab). 
Pembrolizumab -treated s ubjects who have unconfirmed radiographic disease progression 
may continue on treatment until progression is confirmed (or possibly even later) 
provided they have met the conditions detailed in irRECIST ( Table 10). 
 
For s ubjects with new symptoms of osseous metastasis [e.g., new bone pain and/or new 
persistently elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP)] a bone scan should be obtained.   
 
4.6. End of Treatment  
An end of treatment visit should be completed after study treatment is discontinued.  End 
of treatment visit is  outlined in the Study Calendar.   
 
Subjects will be tracked for at least [ADDRESS_1096828] of care.   
 
Note: In the event a subject is discontinued from pembrolizumab, but  is experiencing 
benefit (in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) from the paclitaxel, continuation of paclitaxel will 
not be considered protocol -directed therapy or start of new or subsequent anticancer 
therapy.  
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096829] to follow -up, or until the criteria defined for the final analysis 
(Section 12.4.1 ) are reached.  However, in the event the criteria for the final analysis are 
met, and there are subject s who have not yet been discontinued from study treatment, 
subjects in follow up will continue to be followed until all subjects have discontinued 
study treatment (see Section 6.6) and completed the required 30 day safety monitoring 
period (see Section 4.5.1).  Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_5143] , in writing, or during 
clinic visits after treatment discontinuation for collection of follow -up information . 
Follow -up clinical information may also be obtained through chart reviews.  Death 
information from p ublic sources i.e. death registry, obituary listing, etc. can also be used 
when available and verifiable.  
 
4.8. Subject Withdrawal  and Off Study  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be removed from the trial 
at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.   
 
In this trial, a subject may discontinue from study treatment but continue to participate in 
the regularly scheduled activities, as long as the subject does not withd raw consent  for 
participation . 
 
A subject will  be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
• The subject withdraws consent  for participation on the study  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject from study , which may 
include noncompliance with study treatment or procedure requirements   
• Subject death  
 
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal and/or subject going Off Study must be 
documented in the subject’s medical records and/or research record and recorded  in the 
eCRF . 
 
4.9. Screen Failures/Subject Replacements  
A subject who, for any reason (i.e. failure to satisfy the eligibility criteria or withdraws 
consent), terminates their participation in the study before being randomized is regarded 
as a “screen failure.”

Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096836] due to a paclitaxel -related toxicity or the subjec t has received 
maximum benefit from paclitaxel as deemed by [CONTACT_539176] -Investigator,  paclitaxel may 
be discontinued.  
11. ONLY subjects randomized to Cohort B will receive pembrolizumab on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 before 
paclitaxel. 
12. Optional within 5 days of C5D1 (strongly encouraged for subjects in Cohort A) . If subject discontinues treatment  
due to disease progression , a biop sy will be performed   within [ADDRESS_1096837] has 
confirmed disease progression but remains on treatment, a biopsy will not be performed.   
13. This will be collected at pre -treatment and then within 72 hours prior to Day 1 of every 2 (odd-numbered) cycles  
starting with Cycle [ADDRESS_1096838] follow -up imaging timepoint should be 6 weeks (+/ - 7 days) from C1D1 . Subse quent fo llow-up imaging 
frequency as referenced in the calendar and below (based on length of time the subject has been on the study) 
should be based on the timepoint of  the previous scan , not C1D1 . If a subject  has been on study for ≥ 6 months, the 
treating physician may decide to lengthen the interval to every 9 weeks (63 days ± 7 days)  from previous scan , or 
more frequently, if clinically indicated. The las t scan performed at the [ADDRESS_1096839] occur on or after the 6 
month on study date; subsequent scans can be scheduled at the [ADDRESS_1096840] occur on or after the 12 month on study date; subsequent  scans can be scheduled at the 12 week 
interval.  After 12 months, imaging frequency can be reduced to every 12 weeks (84 ± 7 days)  from previous scan , 
or more frequently if clinically indicated.   
18. Imaging should follow calendar days and not be delayed for any dose interruptions that may occur  until 
progression . 
19. May be collected anytime during screening prior to study treatment initiation . Subjects for whom tumor biopsies 
cannot be obtained during screening due to  inaccessible tumor or subject sa fety concern may submit an archived 
tumor specimen from primary tumor or metastatic biopsy collected within [ADDRESS_1096841] to 
follow -up, or until the criteria defined for the final analysis (Section 12.4.1) are reached .   
22. For surviving subjects who receive subsequent anti -cancer therapy prior to documented disease p rogression, collect 
start date of first subsequent anti -cancer therapy.  In the event a subject is discontinued from pembrolizumab, but is 
experiencing benefit from the paclitaxel, continuation of paclitaxel will not be considered protocol -directed therapy 
or start of new or subsequent anticancer therapy.  
23. To include baseline conditions  present at the time of study treatment initiation  
24. VS to include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure  
25.  Adverse event s will be foll owed for [ADDRESS_1096842] administration of study treatment . 
 
6. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
6.1. Drug Dosage and Administration  
6.1.1.  General Considerations  
Trial treatment should begin on the day of or within 72 hours of randomization. 
Study treatment should be administered after all procedures/assessments have been 
completed as detailed in the Study Calendar.  A cycle is defined as an interval of 21 
(+/- 3) days (delays due to holidays, weekends and bad weather will be pe rmitted 
and will not be counted as a protocol deviation ). No investigational or commercial 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096843] ’s malignancy may be administered 
while the subject is receiving study therapy, other than those described below.  
 
6.2. Paclitaxel  
Subjects  will receive paclitaxel  80 mg/m2 as an IV infusion over 60 minutes on 
Days 1  and 8  every 21 days. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from 
site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted.  In the event of a 
dosing delay, a make -up dose of paclitaxel may be given as outlined in Section 7.2 . 
A window of +/ - 3 days is allowed for the Day 1 dose and a + 2 day window is 
allowed for the Day 8 dose (it may be given up to 2 days later than Day 8) bu t 
paclitaxel doses should not be administered any closer than 7 days apart.  
Paclitaxel is commercially available. Anaphylaxis precautions should be observed 
during administration.  
Premedications for possible hypersensitivity reactions involving paclitaxel and/or 
its components will be given approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to paclitaxel.  
The following is suggested:  
• Dexamethasone 8 mg IV (or equivalent) * 
• Diphenhydramine 25 mg IV (or equivalent)  
• Famotidine 20 mg IV (or equivalent)  
*A suggested regimen to  taper dexamethasone is the following: dexamethasone [ADDRESS_1096844] ’s most recent 
weight during  screening  (baseline weight) . If the subject’s weight changes >10% 
from baseline weight, recalculate that total dose  per standard clinical practice .  
 
6.2.1.  Treatment Criteria  
On Cycle [ADDRESS_1096845]  meets the following criteria:  
• ANC ≥ 1,000/l 
• Platelets ≥ 75,000/l 
 
If paclitaxel  is held, follow guidelines for dosing pembrolizumab. It is possible for 
subjects  to continue on pembrolizumab even if paclitaxel  is held, when  appropriate.  
 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21

 6.3. Pembrolizumab  
Subjects  will receive 200 mg pembrolizumab as  an IV infusion over 30 minutes  on Day 1             
of every 21 days (+/ - 3 days) .  
 
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as 
possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a w indow of 
-5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted . 
 
A sterile, non -pyrogenic, low -protein binding 0.2 to 5 µm in -line filter made of 
polyethersulfone (PES) must be used during administration of pembrolizumab to remove 
any adventitious particles.  If the inf usion set does not contain 0.2 to 5 µm in -line filter, it 
is recommended to use 0.2 to 5 µm add -on filter which may contain an extension line 
(Note: the materials of the extension line and filter should be as mentioned above).  
 
Pembrolizumab 100 mg/ 4mL so lution for injection  will be supplied by [CONTACT_44873].  
 
The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain 
appropriate records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution and 
usage of study  treatments in accordance with the protocol and any applicable law s and 
regulations.  
 
6.4. Treatment Administration  
6.4.1.  Cohort A, Phased Pembrolizumab  
For subjects  randomized to Cohort A, paclitaxel will be administered per Section 
6.[ADDRESS_1096846] due to a paclitaxel -related toxicity  
(e.g., subject develops a hypersensitivity reaction o r grade 3 or grade 4 neuropathy),  
the subject  may be allowed to continue on protocol with single -agent 
pembrolizumab.   
 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096847] has rec eived maximum benefit from paclitaxel as deemed by [CONTACT_47806] , and in consultation with the Sponsor -Investigator, which could 
include a situation of complete response, partial response, or stable disease ≥ 6 
months, paclitaxel can be discontinu ed, and treatment with pembrolizumab alone 
may be continued.  Safety asse ssments, including  physical exam, vital signs, 
laboratory assessments, and monitoring for the occurrence of adverse events will be 
performed according to Section 5 .  The dosing of pembrolizumab will be given 
once every 3 weeks as described above.

the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, intranasal 
influenza, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine.  
• Gluco corticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event 
of suspected immunologic etiology or as premedication for paclitaxel.   
o Note: The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved 
after consultation with the Sponsor -Inves tigator.  
o Note: Inhaled steroids are allowed for management of asthma.  
o Note:  Use of prophylactic corticosteroids to avoid allergic reactions (i.e., 
to IV contract dye) is permitted.  
 
6.6. Definition of Pembrolizumab Overdose  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 
1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available 
on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should 
be provided if clinical ly indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be 
observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be 
provided if clinically indicated.  
 
6.7. Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), study treatment will 
continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Disease progression in subjects who have not yet received pembrolizumab 
(Cohort A)  
• Confirmed disease progression  in subj ects receiving pembrolizumab  
• Disease progression if clinically unstable  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Subject decides to withdraw from  study  treatment or protocol  
• General or specific changes in the subject’s condition render the subject 
unacceptable for fu rther study treatment in the judgment of the Investigator.  
 
Note: In the event the criteria for the final analysis are met, and there are subjects who 
have not yet been discontinued from study treatment, they will continue to receive

 therapy beyond the dat e the criteria for the study final analysis are met and until one of 
the above criteria applies.  
 
6.8. Drug Accountability  
All investigational study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance 
with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufa cturing Practices (GMP) 
requirements and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.  
 
An adequate record of receipt, distribution, destruction, or return  of all investigation al 
study drugs must be kept in the form of a Drug Accountability Form. The Investigator, 
or responsible party designated by [CONTACT_737], will maintain a careful record of the 
inventory using the Drug Accountability Form.  
 
6.9. Destruction  
The investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_795139],  including the amount remaining at the conclusion of 
the trial. Upon completion or termination of the study, all unused and/or partially used 
investigational product will be destroyed at the site according  to LCI IDS pharmacy 
policies. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to arrange for disposal of all empty 
containers, provided that procedures for proper disposal have been established according 
to applicable federal, state, local and institutional guide lines and procedures, and 
provided that appropriate records of disposal are kept.  
 
7. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
7.1. Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab dose reductions are not applicable to this study.  However, pembrolizumab 
must be withheld for drug -related toxicities and se vere or life -threatening AEs as described 
in Table 2 below. Held doses will not be replaced.  When pembrolizumab is restarted, this 
dose would be considered Day 1 of the subsequent cycle and should be in alignment with the 
new schedule.  If pembrolizumab i s held, paclitaxel may continue, when appropriate.  
 
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first 
dose or several months a fter the last dose of  study  treatment. See Section 8 for supportive 
care guidelines, including use of corticosteroids, for treatment -related adverse events.

 Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons 
not related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, subject  vacation, 
and/or holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study th erapy within 3 weeks of the 
scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor -Investigator. The reason for 
interruption should be documented in the patient's study record . 
See Section 8.1 for supportive care measures to be taken for poten tial immune -related 
toxicities associated with pembrolizumab.  
  
7.2. Paclitaxel  
Each paclitaxel cycle is defined as two paclitaxel treatments given during a 21 -day period.  If 
paclitaxel is held for ≥ 2 weeks, the following instructions apply:  
 
If paclitaxel is held, resume with the missed treatment dose, e.g., if day 1 paclitaxel is held 
for 7 days, treatment will resume  with the "day 1" paclitaxel dose on calendar day 8 and the 
"day 8" paclitaxel dose will be given on day 15.  (In this case, there is no break in therapy 
during the last week of the cycle.  Paclitaxel doses should be given at least 7 days apart. )  
 
If two paclitaxel treatments have not been given by [CONTACT_4475] 21  (+/- 3 days) , proceed with 
treatment day 1 of the next cycle (if toxicities have resolved according to requirements in the 
dose modification sections/tables).  
 
If paclitaxel is discontinued for neuropathy or musculoskeletal pain or other toxicity, 
pembrolizumab may continue.

8. TREATMENT -RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.1. Adverse Events Related to Pembrolizumab  
8.1.1.  General Considerations  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care measures for the 
management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are outlined 
below. Where appropriat e, these guidelines include treatment with  oral or 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
4 
 intravenous corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if 
symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several 
courses of steroid tapering may be necessar y as symptoms may worsen when the 
steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out 
other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care. The treatment guide lines are intended to be 
applied when the investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance as outli ned below. Refer 
to Section 7 for dose modification.   
 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, 
endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
 
8.1.2.  Pneumonitis  
• For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic cort icosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks.  
• For Grade 3 -4 events, immediately treat with intravenous steroids. Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.   
• Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged 
steroid administration .  
 
8.1.3.  Diarrhea/Colitis  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis 
(e.g., diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus i n stool, with or without fever) and 
of bowel perforation ( e.g., peritoneal signs and ileus).  
   
• All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.   
• For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, co nsider gastrointestinal (GI) consultation and 
endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
• For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis administer oral corticosteroids .  
• For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , treat with intravenous steroids followed by [CONTACT_458531].  
• When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.

 8.1.4.  Type 1 Diabetes  (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ 
Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or  metabolic 
acidosis (DKA)  
For T1DM or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
• Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus 
and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or 
ketonuria.  
• Evaluate subjects  with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine 
ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, an d C-peptide  
 
8.1.5.  Hypophysitis  
• For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 
4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the  steroid 
dose is tapered.  
• For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by 
[CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper 
should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacemen t of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered .  
 
8.1.6.  Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor subjects  for 
changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, 
and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms 
of thyroid disorders.  
 
• Grade 2 hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroid ism):  
o In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
o In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyronine, is in dicated per standard of care.  
• Grade 3 -4 hyperthyro idism  
o Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_79918].  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
o Replacement of appropriate hormones may be require d as the steroid dose 
is tapered.  
 
8.1.7.  Hepatic

 • For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
o Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
• For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticostero ids for 24 to 48 hours.  
• When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
8.1.8.  Renal Failure or Nephritis  
• For Grade 2 events, treat with corticosteroids.  
• For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
• When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
8.1.9.  Management of Infusion Reaction s 
Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and 
generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. Table 7 
below shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion reaction 
associated with  administration of pembrolizumab.  Subjects who experience an 
infusion reaction associated with administration of paclitaxel should be treated per 
institutional policy.

8.1.10.  Reproductive Risks  
Pembrolizumab may have adverse effects on a fetus in utero.  Furthermore, it is not 
known if pembrolizumab has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.   
For this trial, male subjects will be considered to be of non -reproductive potential if 
they have azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an 
underlying medical condition).   
 
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are either:  
1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses w ithout an 
alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a high follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) , luteini zing hormone (LH), and estradiol levels  
in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal 
state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy.  
OR  
2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_795142]/occlusion.  
OR  
3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.

following:  
   
1) practice abstinence from heterosexual activity;  
OR  
2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual 
activity.   
 
Acceptable methods of contraception are:  
  
Single method (one of the following is acceptable):  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• Contraceptive rod implanted into the skin  
  
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
• Diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with cervical 
cap/spermici de) 
• Cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• Contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• Male condom or female condom (cannot be used together)  
• Hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (estrogen/progestin pi[INVESTIGATOR_401115] -only pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), contraceptive skin patch, vaginal contraceptive ring, or 
subcutaneous contraceptive injection  
 
Note: Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole 
method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s 
preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_795164].  Periodic  abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -
thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.  
 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study therapy  may involve unknown 
risks to the fetus (unborn bab y) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In 
order to participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the 
contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study medication 
initiation (or 14 days prior to the ini tiation of study therapy  for oral contraception) 
throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_1096862] dose of study  therapy.  If

adverse events (AEs) for all grades and attributions, serious adverse e vents (SAE s)], study  
treatment  administration, and validity/integrity of the data.  Documentation of these meetings 
will be kept with study records.  SAEs will be reported to the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and the IRB per their requirements.  Major protocol deviations that result in a threat to 
subject safety or the integrity of the study will be reported to the FDA and IRB per their 
requirements.  The Spons or-Investigator will submit data to the LCI Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee according to the overarching LCI Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 
9.2. Data Quality Assurance  
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the study pr otocol, 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the Levine Cancer Institute and Atrium Health  
Office of Clinical and Translational Research, the FDA, and other applicable regulations and 
guidelines (e.g. GCP).  
 
Subject data will be monitored by [CONTACT_795165].  This monitoring will be done by [CONTACT_795166].  Any variation between the two data sets will be discussed with the Sponsor -
Investigato r and/or appropriate research personnel.  
 
The study database will be reviewed and checked for omissions, apparent errors, and values 
requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures.  Data queries

Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096864] the validity/integrity of the study data to the Sponsor -Investigator.    
AEs will be reported within [ADDRESS_1096865] 
values, regular measurement of vital s igns, and performance of history and physical 
examinations.  These assessments should be performed per the study calendar . Adverse 
events  will be evaluated continuously throughout the study. Safety and tolerability, 
relationship to  study treatment and intensity will be assessed according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 . All adverse events (Grades 1 
– 5) will be documented in subject study charts, and recorded in the eCRF.  
 
10.1. Unanticipated Problem De finition  
An UAP is any incidence, experience or outcome that is unexpected, given the information 
provided in research -related documentation ( e.g., Investigator’s brochure, informed consent) 
and the study population characteristics that is related or possi bly related to participation in 
the research study and places the participant at an increased risk.   
 
10.2. Adverse Event  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event or adverse experience is any untoward medical occurrence in a study 
subject who is administered a  study drug that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this study treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study 
drug, whether or not con sidered related to the study drug.  Pre -existing conditions that 
increase in frequency or severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of use of 
a drug in human clinical trials are also considered adverse events.   
 
Any continuing medical condit ion or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an 
onset date before the first date of study treatment  administration should be considered 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096866]’s medical records and /or in the 
study chart  at baseline . If the medical condition or clinical ly significant laboratory 
abnormality worsens while the patient is on study, it should be documented as an adverse 
event.  
 
10.2.2.  An Adverse Event does not include  
An AE does not include:  
• relapse or progression o f the underlying malignant disease; however, the 
associated  signs, symptoms, or diagnoses should be recorded as adverse 
events  (e.g., “jaundice” due to new or increasing liver metastases, or “tumor 
pain” or “bone pain” due to progressive disease);  
• medical  or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion).  The condition that leads to the procedure is the adverse event;  
• situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795143] y, social and/or convenience admissions);  
• overdose of paclitaxel or concomitant medication without any signs or  
symptoms unless the subject  is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_795144] n 
 
 
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as adverse events; however, signs  
and/or symptoms that are associated with laboratory findings requiring study 
withdrawal, dose modification, or medical intervention (e.g., anemia requiring 
transfusions or hyperglycemia requiring treatment) or other abnormal assessments 
(e.g., ECG, radiographs, vital signs) must be recorded as adverse events if they meet 
the definition of an adverse event.  In addition, laboratory abnormalities marked as 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_795168].  The investigator will record all clinically significant grade s for laboratory 
abnormalit ies and will evaluate their relationship to the study treatment  and subject’s 
clinical condition if/when a clinically significant laboratory abnormality occur s. 
 
10.2.3.  Relationship to Study  Treatment  
The relationship to study treatment  therapy should be assessed using the following 
definitions:   
 
Not Related:   Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study  treatment  
(i.e., pre -existing condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
medication).  This includes events that are considered remotely or unlikely related t o 
study  treatment .

Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
12 
 Related:   A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and administration of the 
study  treatment .  It cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In t he case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the 
event abates or resolves and reappears upon rechallenge.  It should be emphasized that 
ineffective study treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of 
AE reporting.  This in cludes events that are considered possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to study  treatment . 
 
All adverse events (including event name, grade, start/stop date and attribution) will be 
documented in the medical record and on the case report form for  this protocol.  
 
The Investigator is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all 
adverse events and assigning the attribution for each event for all subjects enrolled on the 
trial. 
 
10.3. Suspected Adverse Reaction Definition  
A SAR is an adverse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the study treatment  
caused the adverse event as defined by 21 CFR 312.32.  The Investigator is responsible for 
judging whether it is a reasonable possibility that the study  treatment  caused the adverse 
event.  
 
10.4. “Unexpected” Definition  
An AE or SAR is to be considered unexpected if the event is not listed in the current 
Investigator Brochure, package insert or label or is not listed in the severity or specificity 
observed.  
 
10.5. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse events may also be considered serious adverse events. Serious adverse event or SAE 
shall mean any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject who is administered the study 
treatment  that results in :  
• Death;  
• Life-threatening situation (subject  is at immediate risk of death);  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] ( excluding 
those for study  treatment  administration, protocol -related procedures , palliative or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677], or placement of an indwelling catheter , unless associated with other 
serious events);  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
13 
 • Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient who received study  
treatment ;  
• A new cancer if the cancer is the condition of the study ; or 
• Other:  Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment,  they may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.    
o Examples of such events are:  
▪ Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospa sm;  
▪ Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
▪ Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
 
The following events do not meet the criteria for seriousness per ICH definition, but must be 
reported in the same manner as SAEs. Therefore, these events are considered serious for 
collection purposes:  
• Pregnancy or lactation  
• Overdose of pembrolizumab, as defined in Section 6.[ADDRESS_1096867]’s participation. In addition, once study treatment is initiated,  SAEs 
that are determined to be related to pembrolizumab  or a study procedure  (regardle ss of 
expectedness)  are reportable  through the duration of the subject’s participation on the trial  
(treatment and follow -up). SAEs will be followed until clinical recovery is complete and 
laboratory tests have returned to baseline, until progression has b een stabilized, or until there 
has been acceptable resolution of the event. This may at times cause the follow -up period for 
SAEs to be greater than [ADDRESS_1096868] lives elsewhere 
or has been released from his or her care and is being treated under another service at LCI.  
10.7. Safety Reporting to the FDA  
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
14 
 For investigator -initiated studies where the Sponsor -Investigator holds an IND, sa fety 
reporting requirements for the FDA apply in accordance with the guidance set forth in 21 
CFR312.32. The Sponsor -Investigator, or research designee, will be responsible for notifying 
FDA (using a MedWatch form) and all participating Investigators of an y unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 
calendar days after the Sponsor's initial receipt of the information. For all other serious and 
unexpected safety events, the Sponsor -Investi gator, or research designee, will notify the FDA 
within [ADDRESS_1096869], and FDA policy.  
 
Planned protocol deviations will be submitted to the FDA for prior approval only if the 
deviation affects the scientific validity of the study and/or the rights, safety, or welfa re of 
subjects.  
 
10.8. Safety Reporting to the IRB  
All UAPs , protocol deviations  and SAEs occurring during the conduct of a protocol will be 
reported to the IRB per IRB reporting requirements . 
 
10.9. Safety Reporting to [COMPANY_006]  
All SAEs meeting the definition of an SAE in Section 10.[ADDRESS_1096870] be reported 
immediately to the Sponsor -Investigator  and to [COMPANY_006].  
 
SAE reports and any other relevant safety information are to be forwarded to [COMPANY_006]  by [CONTACT_429] -Investigator  to Global Safety facsimile number:  +1 -[PHONE_833]  
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
15 
  
If the Sponsor -Investigator holds an IND, a  copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress 
Reports are to be submitted as required by [CONTACT_795169]. Investigators 
will cross reference this submission according to local regulations to the [COMPANY_006] 
Investiga tional Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of submission.  
Additionally , investigators will submit a copy of these reports to [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc. (Attn: 
Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) at the time of submission to the appropriate 
regulat ory agency . 
 
10.9.1.  Evaluating Adverse Events  
The treating  investigator or qualified designee  will evaluate all adverse events 
according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 
4.0. Any adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_795145] c ase report 
forms/worksheets.  
 
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for 
seriousness.  
 
11. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
11.1. Anti -tumor Effect – Solid Tumor  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised response 
evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1.  
 
11.1.1.  Disease Parameters  
For the purposes of this study, subjects  should be reevaluated for response  per section 
4.5.6 . In addition to the baseline scan(s), confirmatory scans should a lso be obtained 
not less than [ADDRESS_1096871] diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions , or shortest 
axis for lymph nodes, are used in the RECIST criteria.   
Note:  Lesio ns are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided 
below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it 
does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
 
Target lesions:  When more than one measurable l esion is present at baseline , all 
lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per 
organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and 
will be recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
16 
 basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that,  on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend 
itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion 
which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Lymph nodes merit special 
mention since they are normal anatomical struct ures which may be visible by [CONTACT_118581]. Pathological nodes , which are defined as measurable 
and may be identified as target lesions , must meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_1096872] in which the image is obtained (f or CT scan this is almost 
always the axial plane). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. All other 
pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered 
nontarget lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are cons idered 
nonpathological and should not be recorded or followed. A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will 
be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum. 
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any 
objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target les ions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be followed as 
‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.  
 
11.1.2.  Methods  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of  study treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_1096873] of a treatment.  The 
Sponsor -Investigator or designee will be responsible for performing tumor 
measurements.  The tumor measurements will be recorded  on the eCRF.  
 
11.1.3.  Response Criteria  
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096874] 1.1 Criteria.  
 Complete Response : 
• Target lesion: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph   
 nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to   
 <10 mm. 
• Non-target lesion: Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph nodes   
 must be non -pathological in size (<10  mm short axis).  
 
Partial Response : 
• Target lesion: At l east a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target,  
 taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Non-target lesion: Not applicable  
 
Stable Disease : 
• Target lesion: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a partial response,   
 nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference   
 the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
• Non-target lesion: Not applicable.  
 
Progressive Disease : 
• Target lesion: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target   
 lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the   
 baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative   
 increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at  
 least 5  mm. ( Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).  
• Non-target lesion: Unequivocal progression  (as described in RECIST version   
 1.1) of existing non -target lesions. ( Note:  the appearance of one or more new   
 lesions is also considered progression).  
 
Non-Complete Response / Non -Progressive Disease : 
• Target lesion: Not applicable  
• Non-target lesion: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s)

In determin ing whether or not the tumor burden has increased, decreased or stayed stable, site  
investigators should consider all target lesions as well as non -target lesions.  
 
Any subject deemed clinically unstable should be discontinued from study  treatment at first  
evidence of progressive disease by [CONTACT_795170].  
 
For a clinically stable subject with fir st radiologic evidence of progressive disease (i.e.,  
unconfirmed progression of disease), it is at the discretion of the site investigator to continue  
treating the subject with the assigned study treatment per protocol until progression of disease is  
confirmed at least [ADDRESS_1096877] will be discontinued from study  treatment.  
 
NOTE: If a subject with confirmed progression by [CONTACT_566171] (i.e. two scans at leas t 28 days  
apart demonstrating progressive disease) is clinically stable or clinically improved, and there is  
no further increase in the tumor burden at the confirmatory scan, an exception may be considered  
to continue study treatment upon consultation w ith the Sponsor. Subjects exhibiting intolerable 
toxicity from trial therapy may NOT continue to receive trial therapy.  
 
NOTE:  In subjects who discontinue study therapy without documented disease progression, 
every effort should be made to continue monit oring their disease status by [CONTACT_795171]:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001

 outlined in Section 4.5.6 until (1) the start of new anti -cancer treatment, (2) disease progression 
(3) death, or (4) the end of the study, whichever occurs first. The same imaging modality (i.e., 
CT or MRI), acquisition and technical parameters should be used throughout the study  for a 
given subject.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATION  
 
12.1. Sample Size  
This is an open -label randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_795146] (Cohort A [phased regimen] and Cohort B 
[concurrent regimen]), in subjects  with metastatic HER2 -negative breast can cer who have 
received no more than three prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  Based on the 
Bayesian stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9228] 12.4.4, 20 subjects  per arm will enable an 
assessment for each regimen regarding whether or not  evidence  suggests  the overall grade 3 
or 4 study treatment -related adverse event rate convincingly exceeds 0.35 (the reported rate 
for weekly paclitaxel).  Randomization to this study will continue until at least [ADDRESS_1096878] possibly related to 
either paclit axel, pembrolizumab , or both.  
 
12.2.2.  Overall Survival  
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from randomization to death 
from any cause. Subjects who are alive or lost to follow -up at the time of the 
analysis will be censored at the last known date they were alive.  
 
12.2.3.  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from 
randomization to first occurrence of either progressive disease or death. Disease 
progression must  be objectively determined as p er Section [ADDRESS_1096879] 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/[ADDRESS_1096880] 
criteria as an explorat ory endpoint.  
    
12.2.5.  Duration of Response  
Duration of Response (DoR ) is defined as the duration of time from the first 
assessment that determined a CR or PR to the date of the first occurrence of 
progressive disease or death.  Progression events and the censoring mechanism for 
DoR will be the same as described for PFS in Section 12.2.3.  DoR will be 
determined for each subject  using the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1096881] overall response of CR, PR, or SD  (for 
at least 24 weeks) , as determined by [CONTACT_511811] 11.   Disease 
control will be determined for each subject  using the RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1096882] criteria as an exploratory endpoint.   
 
12.2.7.  Safety Endpoints  
Safety endpoints will include  study  treatment administration (total number of 
doses taken, and total doses taken as a percent of total number of intended doses), 
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
22 
 AEs, SAEs, deaths while on study therapy, and selected laboratory 
determinations.  
 
12.3. Analysis Populations  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) p opulation will consist of all randomized subjects .  The ITT 
population will be used for the purposes of the subject  disposition summary.  The 
evaluable population will consist of all randomized subjects  who begin study therapy.  
OS, PFS, and a ll safety analyses will be conducted on the evaluable population. 
Analyses of objective response , DoR, and disease control  will be conducted on those 
subjects  in the evaluable population who have measureable disease at baseline.  
 
12.4. Analysis Methods  
12.4.1.  Timing of  Analysis  
Analyses on this study will be conducted on a continuous basis in order to assess the 
Bayesian stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_795147] 12.4.4.  An analysis of all 
endpoints will occur after the best overall response for each subject  has been determined.  
A final analysis of the study will be conducted after the PFS censoring rate reduces to 
20% or when all subjects  have been on study for at least two years (whichever occurs 
first).  
 
12.4.2.  Subject  Disposition  
An accounting of all consenting subj ects will be provided at the end of the study. This 
will include a breakdown of subjects who consented, were randomized, treated, 
discontinued study treatment, died, and were lost to follow -up or withdrew consent.  
 
12.4.3.  Baseline Patient and Disease Characterist ics 
A summary of subject demographics and disease -related characteristics will be completed 
and subject medical history will be assessed.  
 
12.4.4.  Primary Analysis  
This study is planned to enroll approximately  [ADDRESS_1096883] chemotherapy will increase the grade 3 or 4 to xicity rate.  It 
has been reported that the rate of any grade 3 or 4 toxicity with weekly paclitaxel is 0.35 
[Budd, ASCO abstract 2013, CRA1008].  If it becomes evident that the grade 3 or 4 
toxicity rate on either arm convincingly exceeds 0.35, the study arm will be halted. The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_795148] 3 or 4 toxicity risk 
exceeding 0.35 is 0.50 or higher.  The prior distribution for this monitoring rule is beta

Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
23 
 (7,13).  This means that our prior assumption regarding the proportion of grade 3 or 4 
toxicity is 0.35, and there is 90% probability that this proportion is between 0.188 and 
0.530.  The operating characteristics of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_795149] 5000 s imulations.

[ADDRESS_1096884] ratio and 95% confidence interval will be provided .  Duration 
of response will be analyzed in a similar fashion as described for OS and PFS.  
Objective response rate and disease contro l rate will be estimated for each arm along  
with corresponding 95% Clopper -Pearson confidence intervals.  Differences between 
the arms will be assessed qualitatively using a stratified logistic regression, including 
hormone receptor status as the stratific ation variable.  Estimate s of the odds ratio s and 
95% confidence interval s will be provided.   
 
12.4.6.  Safety Analyses  
Incident rates for treatment -emergent adverse events, SAEs, and deaths while on study 
therapy will be summarized.   Treatment -emergent adverse ev ents are defined as follows:  
• An adverse event that occurs after study treatment start that was not present at the 
time of study treatment start; or  
Protocol Number:  LCI-BRE -H2N -PEPP -001 
Version 5: 4/13/20 21 
   
24 
 • An adverse event that increases in severity after study treatment start if the event 
was present at the time  of study treatment start.  
 
 
12.4.7.  Exploratory  Analyses  
Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression will be used to assess the 
correlation between additional baseline biomarkers with clinical outcomes.  The 
biomarkers identified in Section 1.4 will be assessed qualitatively as deemed appropriate.  
 
12.5. Interim Analyses  
No formal interim analysis for efficacy is planned for this study.  However, results will 
be continuously monitored for safety using the Bayesian stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_795152] 12 .4.4. 
 
13. STUDY COMPLETION  
 
13.1. Completion   
The study will be considered complete when one or more of the following conditions is 
met: 
• All subjects have completed all study visits.  
• All subjects have discontinued from the study.  
• The IRB, FDA, LCI DSMC, Sponsor -Investigator discontinues the study because 
of safety considerations.  
• The Sponsor -Investigator defines an administrative or clinical cut -off date.  
 
13.2. Termination  
The study will be terminated when one or more of the following conditions occur:  
If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example:  
• Safety findings from this study (e.g. SAEs)  
• Results of any interim analysis  
• Results of parallel clinical studies  
• Results of parallel animal studies (e.g.  toxicity, teratogenicity,  
       carcinogenicity or reproduction toxicity).  
• If the study conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop -out rate; data quality ; 
protocol compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the trial 
within a reasonable time frame.  
The Sponsor -Investigator has the right to close the trial at any site and at any time.

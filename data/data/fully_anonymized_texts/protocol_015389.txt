Title Characterizing and Predicting Drug Effects on Cognition  
 
Short Title  Drug Effects on Cognition  
Protocol Number   
Phase  R01 
Methodology  Parallel group, r andomized, double -blind, cross -over design with 
placebo  
Study Duration  Five (5) years  
Study Center(s)  Single -center  
Objectives  Our primary objective is to eluci date the relationship among drug  
exposure as measured by [CONTACT_369422], its 
neurophysiological effects measured by [CONTACT_66594], and consequent effects on the cog nitive processes observable in everyday 
language use. Using topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (TPM) as a prototype, we apply 
the tools of clinical pharmacology, computational linguistics, neuroscience, and engineering to the design and execution of  
parallel group, randomized, double blind,  crossover studies using 
three (3) single, low doses of TPM  and a placebo. In order to 
isolate the cognitive effects of TPM from those possibly arising from an underlying medical condition, subjects will be healthy adults. We will capi[INVESTIGATOR_369405] (SALSA) developed in our laboratory, to quantify the effects of TPM administration on effective language use, a crucial component of normal day -to-day 
functioning.  
Number of Subjects  Three parallel groups of 24 (12 men; 12 women; total n=72; 
enrollment target = 84 to account for dropouts),  
Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria  Healthy volunteers native English- speaking (necessary for 
language analysis), ages 18- [ADDRESS_462426], Dose, Rout e, 
Regimen  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (TPM): 100mg, 150mg or  200mg, po, 1x ;  Lorazepam 
(LZP):  2mg, po, 1x;  
Duration of administration  Only one (1) dose of each drug will be administered during the study  (3 parallel groups)  
Reference therapy  Placebo (PLA)  (non-active)  
  Page [ADDRESS_462427] for any practice effects associated with repeated testing across the entire study. This average is then used in a change score, for each measure for each participant, associated with drug conditions, computed as (drug session score - average baseline 
score)/average baseline score.  Neuropsychological and speech change scores will each be summarized by [CONTACT_369423] (0. 5, 2.5, [ADDRESS_462428] 
dose) with means and standard deviations. Change scores at 2.[ADDRESS_462429] dose are our primary outcome; change scores at 0. [ADDRESS_462430] dose will be used in exploratory analyses.  Change scores will each be independently taken as the outcome in a repeated measures ANOVA with drug group (TPM, LZP, PLA) as the primary factor of interest. The Tukey -Kramer procedure will 
be used to adjust type I error rates for the multiple comparisons among the three drug groups. All ANOVAs will be adjusted for treatment order and session number, and include a random effect for participant to control for within- person correlation across the 
three sessions. Separate ANOVAs will examine the three TPM dose groups compared to each other. As exploratory work, we will also examine whether age or gender modify any of the drug effects.  
 Each TPM dose will be used in a three- way crossover 
study with 24 participants. Detectable differences are based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_369406]- person and between- person 
variability in each of the outcomes shown; in general, within-person correlation was weak, well below 0.5. Our budget allows  
for recruiting 4 extra participants per dose study in case of dropout.  
 
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic analyses : Separately for the 
three TPM doses and for LZP, neuropsychological and speech data change scores will each be used as the outcome in a linear  
regression with the three pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, trough, maximum) as the primary predictors of interest. If AUC, trough, and maximum are highly collinear, we will consider them one at a time. With 24 participants per drug/dose combination, and t wo-sided p=0.05, we will have power 75% to detect a 
correlation of size ≥0.5, 90% power to detect a correlation of size ≥0.6, and 98% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.7. All regressions will be adjusted for session number, age, and gender. We will also compare the R -square from the model with AUC as predictor to 
the R-square from the model with dose as predictor. Population 
pharmacokinetic modeling will be used to calculate individual 
measures of exposures.

This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
accordi ng to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 or 812 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.[ADDRESS_462431] of complex cognitive processes, is disruptive to daily life.  Neve rtheless, the mechanisms underlying a drug’s impact on cognition are poorly 
understood.  This lack of understanding impedes our ability to predict both the effects of drugs in development and the degree to which an individual is vulnerable to the cognitive  impact of a particular agent.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_052] (TPM), a second- generation 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_369407] (AED) is, with increasing frequency, being prescribed for a range of conditions including migraine prophylaxis, obesity, and pain.  Moreover, it is a prime example of a  drug that causes speech and language problems  severe enough in some 
patients to result in discontinuation of therapy.  However, unlike many newer AEDs, and for reasons not well understood, TPM has a poorer cognitive profile than many of the older AEDs.   While the number and magnitude of adverse cognitive side effects have been attributed, in part, to the effects of titration rate and maintenance dose in both patients and healthy adults, these factors do not capture all inter -individual variability in 
the cognitive response to TPM.  Our rationale  for this project is that our investigations 
will offer insight into the mechanisms underlying drug- induced cognitive deficits.  It will 
also lay the foundation for a new line of research that will further delineate these 
mechanisms and provide methods to predict individual patient response.  In this study 
we compare the cognitive effects of TPM to that of the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lorazepam , as 
well as to a non- active placebo.  A majority of the preliminary data for this s tudy were 
collected under UMN IRB Study # 0805M33321 and published in a peer reviewed 
journal (Marino et al, 2012).

A 2mg dose of lorazepam was chosen since that is the most common dose that has 
been used in studies of the cognitive/memory effects of this drug in healthy volunteers [9, 10].  The doses of 100mg, 150mg and 200 mg of topi[INVESTIGATOR_369408].  In their EEG study, Salinsky et al ( 2007) titrated  
healthy volunteers to a maximum dose of 400mg/day whereas Werz et al (2006)  used a 
dose of 300 mg/day of topi[INVESTIGATOR_369409].  Since there is evidence that the titration rate of TPM is proportional to the cognitive complaints attributable to TPM use (Meador et al, 2001),  we expect that even the relatively low doses used here will produce an effect 
since the subjects are receiving the entire dose  all at once.  
2  Study Objectives  
Primary Objective:  Our primary objective is to elucidate the relationship among drug 
exposure as measured by [CONTACT_369422], its neurophysiological effects measured by [CONTACT_66594], an d consequent effects on the cognitive processes observable in everyday 
language use. We have three (3) Specific Aims:  
Specific Aim #1: Characterize TPM -induced effects on linguistic behavior. Our 
working hypothesis  is that TPM has distinct, measureable eff ects on the fluency and 
content of spontaneous speech. We will test this hypothesis by [CONTACT_369424]- recorded during a 
neuropsychological assessment that includes tests of verbal, memory and exec utive 
functions.  
Specific Aim # 2: Determine the neurophysiological mechanisms of TPM’s action 
on executive function. Our working hypothesis is that TPM -induced effects on 
language use are partly attributable to disrupted frontal executive function. We wil l test 
this hypothesis by [CONTACT_369425] a verbal working memory task. We predict 
altered frontal lobe activity and frontotemporal interactions, manifesting as changes  in 
event -related potentials (ERP) and EEG coherence.  
Specific Aim #3: Predict individual vulnerability to TPM -induced impairments in 
linguistic, memory, and executive functions. Our working hypotheses are 1. The 
extent of drug- induced  impairments in these functions is proportional to systemic drug 
exposure, as measured by [CONTACT_369422].  The area under the time- concentration 
curve (AUC), trough, and maximum drug concentration will be explored. 2. Drug 
exposure is a better predictor than dose of the degree of individual impairment.

[ADDRESS_462432]  
neurocognitive functioning including natural language comprehension and production  in 
people exposed to TPM and LZP. Healthy volunteers will be exposed to one of three (100mg, 150mg or 200mg)  single low doses of TPM. Healthy volunteers rather than 
  Page [ADDRESS_462433]- finding or fluency difficulties.  
 Each crossover study (using one dose of TPM) will consist of five (5) sessions with at least a two- week washout period in between sessions.  Sessions 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_462434] sessions are baseline sessions with no drug administered and no blood 
sample drawn  during session 1. During both sessions 1 & 5, subjects will be 
administered a single brief neuropsychological assessment (see details below) (approximately 1 hour). However, during session 1, subjects will also be required to perform a verbal memory task while having their EEG recorded (approximately 2 hours).  
 For the treatment sessions (sessions 2, 3, and 4), the sequence in which TPM, LZP, and PLA will be assigned to the three middle sessions will be determined according to a Latin square design balanced for first -order carry -over effects (6 possible sequences). A 
neuropsychological battery consisting of tests of verbal working memory capacity including the reading span test  (Session 1 only)  (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980; 
sentence comprehension), tests of executive behaviors drawn from the NIH Common Data Elements for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (www.commondataelements.ninds. nih.gov/Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].aspx), 
two discourse -level language/verbal tests and one discourse- level memory test 
(described in the next section) , as well as an assessment of postural sway ( AgiliSway  
System, Agile Medicine, Minneapolis MN:  www.agilemedicine/agilisway.com
) will be 
administered 0. 5, 2.5, 6 and either 24, 48, 72  or 96 hours after dosing for each of the 
three treatments, as well as once during each of the two baseline sessions (sessions 1 & 5).   Alt ernate versions of each test will used during each session to reduce practice 
effects.  Each testing battery is expected to take approximately 45- [ADDRESS_462435].   Blood 
samples will be collected for pharmacoki netic -pharmacodynamics analysis.  
 Pharmacoki netic (PK) -pharmacodynamics(PD) analysis:  Blood samples will be 
collected from all participants at all  [ADDRESS_462436] 
crossover studies (one for each TPM dose: 100, 150, and 200 mg). Blood sam ples will 
be collected immediately prior to drug administration (time 0),  [ADDRESS_462437] -absorption phase (at  either  approximately 24, 48,  72, or 
96 hours - randomly assigned).  Preliminary results that include intensive PK sampling 
in healthy volunteers during the whole dosing interval enables the use of sparse sampling in order  to limit the burden of additional sampling on subjects.  The time of 
drug administration and the time of each blood draw will be recorded.  Samples will be immediately centrifuged and the plasma frozen until analysis.  TPM plasma levels will be measured by a simultaneous LCMS assay, developed by [CONTACT_369426], Birnbaum

In one session only, an d with separate subject consent , a sample will be drawn from 
part of the  collected blood samples for subsequent genetic testing with the primary  
hypothesi s, related to  Specific Aim 3,  that inter -individual differences in plasma drug 
concentrations may be due to polymorphisms in metabolic genes . 
 
EEG:  EEG recording will immediately follow the completion of the  neuropsychological 
testing battery  in session 1 and after the battery  administered approximately 2.5 hours 
after drug dose  in sessions 2, 3, and 4. EEG recording will be conducted in an 
acoustically and electrically shielded chamber in the UMN Center for Neurobehavioral  
Development.   Subjects will be seated in a comfortable non- metal chair in the chamber 
and instructed to     attend to a CRT monitor during recording.  EEG will be recorded using a 128- channel Sensor Net System. EEG will be recorded during the presentation 
of the working memory paradigm.      
3.2 Primary Study Endpoints  
Our primary end point  is a composite measure of disfluency comprised of the following 
measurements:  
a. spoken discourse fluency  
i. speaker normalized duration and frequency of silent and filled pauses  
ii. speaker normalized frequency of repetitions  
iii. speaker normalized frequency of false starts  
iv. speaker normalized speaking rate (syllables per second)  
 Our secondary end points will consist of the following characteristics: 
 
For spoken samples, we will examine the following measures of linguistic fluency:  
 Average fundamental frequency fluctuations/variability  
 Average length of hesitations before noun phrases  
 Total speech duration  
 The ratio of speech to silence 
 The ratio of hesitant to fluent speech  
 Average speaker normalized length of rhythmic phrases  
 Any other promising prosodic variables identified in Aim 1.  
  We will examine the following linguistic measures computed based on the transcripts of the spoken and written samples:  
 Language model entropy/perplexity computed from the discrepancies between the distribution of three- word sequences in the transcripts to the 
general English patterns as well as patterns obtained from baseline assessments.

Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return  
5.8.1  Receipt of Drug Supplies 
The study drugs will be purchased by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_369410]. Upon receipt of the of the study treatment supplies, an inventory will  be 
performed and a drug receipt log filled out and signed by [CONTACT_17247].  The designated study staff will count and verify that the shipment 
contains all the items noted in the shipment inventory.  Any damaged or unusable study drug in a given shipment (active drug or comparator) will be documented in the study files.  
5.8.[ADDRESS_462442] session will be dispensed.  
5.8.4  Return or Destruction of Study Drug 
 At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated,  resolved, and documented prior to return or destruction of unused 
study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.  
6 Study Procedures  
6.1 Session  1 (Baseline)  
After being consented for the study, a brief demographic, medical and medication history will be taken during the first session to assure that subjects are not currently on 
any drugs that can interact with either TPM or LZP  or potentially interfere with cognitive 
  Page [ADDRESS_462443] battery  once only (see 
below) (Week 1- baseline) after which they will perform a working memory task while 
having their EEG recorded, and be randomly assigned to a study treatment  sequence 
(TPM or L ZP).   
6.[ADDRESS_462444] drug testing session will be conducted approximately 14 days after the baseline 
testing. At that time, an in travenous catheter  will be inserted  (left arm) after which he or 
she will be given either one of three doses of TPM (depending on whether they have 
been assigned to thee 100mg, 150mg or 200mg group),OR  2mg LZP  OR  placebo. Six 
blood samples will be drawn between 0 – 6 hours  after dose.  Vitals signs will also be 
recorded .  One (1)  additional sample (using a single needle stick)  will be drawn either at 
(approximately ) 24, 48, 72, or  96 hours postdose(randomly assigned) to capture a 
sampling in the post -absorption phase as well as limiting the burden of additional 
sampling on subjects. Neurocognitive and postural sway  assessments will be collected 
at times  approximately  0.5, 2.5, [ADDRESS_462445] -absorption blood sample and testing. 
 
6.3 Session  3 
Participants will re turn approximately two (2)  week s later in order to repeat the testing 
protocol after switching drugs.  
 
6.4  Session  4 
The fourth session will occur approximately two (2) weeks  after the second drug 
administration for the third drug (or placebo) treatment.   
 6.5   Session  5 (Post baseline)  
The last session  will occur approximately two (2) weeks  after the third drug or placebo 
administration. Participants will not be given any drug at this session . One blood sample 
will be drawn to determine if any drug from  the previous session is still present. The 
entire test battery will be administered. The baseline and postbaseline scores will be 
averaged in order to correct for any practice effects that might have occurred across the 
four testing sessions.  This average will be used to compute the change score of each test administered under drug conditions.  Oral samples in all tests will be audiotaped.
 
  Neuropsychological Battery 
 
We will employ a battery of neuropsychological tests that includes measures from our cognitive Anti -Epi[INVESTIGATOR_49854] (AED) protocol as well as additional language-specific 
measures:  
Verbal Working Memory :

of the set they recall the last word of each sentence in the set (see Daneman & 
Carpenter, 1980, 1983). As in the speaking span test, subjects are presented with increasingly longer sets until all sentences have been presented. Reading span is the total number of correct sentence- final words recalled.  This test will only be administ ered 
during the first baseline session (session 1).  
 
Executive function, processing speed, and word- level language/verbal tests : 
 1. Phonemic generative verbal fluency will be evaluated using the COWA test. COWA 
requires the subject to generate words other than proper names or numbers beginning with a specific letter of the alphabet; three 60- second trials are obtained, using three 
different letters, usually F -A-S or B -H-R.  
2. Semantic generative verbal fluency will be evaluated using the Animal Fluency test. Subjects are asked to generate as many different animal exemplars as they can within [ADDRESS_462446] words meeting scoring criteria normalized to individual (averaged) baseline.  
3. Trails A and B will be used to assess visual search, mental flexibility, and task alternation. The subject is required to draw lines between circles in ascending order (“connect the dots”). Trail Making Part A requires the patient to connect the numbers from 1 -25. Trail Making B requires subjects to alternate between numbered and lettered 
circles in ascending numerical/alphabetical order (e.g., 1-A-2- B, etc.) The primary 
dependent measure is time of c ompletion.  
4. Digit span subtest from the WAIS -IV will be used to assess immediate attention. It 
tests forward and backward digit span, includes a sequencing trial in which the subject is the repeat back the digits in ascending order.  
 5. Symbol Digit Modalities Test will be used to generate the Processing Speed Index 
(primary dependent measure). These are timed tasks that measure the ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_369411] (Coding).  
 
Computerized psycholinguistic assessment. Spontaneous speech will be elicited using 
two discourse level verbal tasks:  
1. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_147265], the subjects will be asked to describe a simple 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103] (e.g., The “Cookie Theft” stimulus from the [LOCATION_011] Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (Goodglass & Kaplan 1983).  
2.  Memory will be tested using a third discourse level task, the MCG Story Recall 
task, where subjects will recall a short but detailed description of a situation verbally presented to them (Meador et al 1993; Meador et al 1995).  
3. Spontaneous  narrative.  Subject will be asked to speak on one of four (4) themes 
(adapted from the Trier Test) for two minutes.   
 
Working Memory Paradigm:  A modified Sternberg working memory task (Sternberg, 
1969) will be presented to each subject during EEG recording to test the effect of TPM on verbal and executive brain functions.   A set of English (nonsense) syllables of comparable length will be presented on a CRT monitor for 1.5  seconds, followed by a 
5s retention period, followed by [CONTACT_369428].  S ubjects will be instructed to press a 
“Yes” or “No” button to indicate whether or not the probe stimulus belonged to the

paradigm consists of six blocks of 60 trials/block ( 360 trials in total). Presentation of the 
syllables and the memory loads will be randomized (12 0 trials/memory load).  A practice 
block  of [ADDRESS_462447] Assessment:   Postural sway: Sway will be measured by [CONTACT_369429] (Agile Medicine, Minneapolis MN:  www.agilemedicine/agilisway.com ) 
The dependent measures are total distance, medial/lateral distance, and anterior/posterior distance swayed.  
 A patient’s center of pressure is measured using a force platform, in this case a modified Wii balance board, that records the pressure on each of four sensors once every [ADDRESS_462448] for 10 sec in each of three positions:  with 1. feet together, 2. one foot raised and 3. in a tandem position, while several different measures of sway are calculated, including total dis tance, medial/lateral distance, and anterior/posterior distance swayed 
(all in centimeters). With additional computation, other measures such as average/maximum velocity of sway can also be calculated.  
The calculations for measuring distance swayed are:  
      P(tl) = Pressure top left (TopLeft - CalAvgTopLeft)  
      P(tr) = Pressure top right (TopRight - CalAvgTopRight)  
      P(bl) = Pressure bottom left (BottomLeft - CalAvgBottomLeft)  
      P(br) = Pressure bottom right (BottomRight - CalAvgBottomRight)  
      
      Total (T) = P(tl) + P(tr) + P(bl)  + P(br)

7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Statistical Analysis  
Aim 1 Statistical considerations: Neuropsychological and speech data will be 
analyzed on both the group and individual level.  For each individual neuropsychological and speech measure, the two baseline scores will be averaged to correct for any practice effects associated with repeated testing across the entire study. This average is then used in a change score, for each measure for each participant, associated with drug conditions, computed as (drug sessio n score - average baseline score)/average 
baseline score.  Neuropsychological and speech change scores will each be summarized by [CONTACT_369423] (0. 5, 2.5, and [ADDRESS_462453] dose) with 
means and standard deviations. Change scores at 2.[ADDRESS_462454] dose are our primary outcome; change scores at 0. [ADDRESS_462455] dose will be used in exploratory 
analyses.  Change scores will each be independently taken as the outcome in a repeated measures ANOVA with drug group (TPM, LZP, PLA) as the pri mary factor of 
interest. The Tukey -Kramer procedure will be used to adjust type I error rates for the 
multiple comparisons among the three drug groups. All ANOVAs will be adjusted for treatment order and session number, and include a random effect for participant to control for within- person correlation across the three sessions. Separate ANOVAs will 
examine the three TPM dose groups compared to each other. As exploratory work, we will also examine whether age or gender modify any of the drug effects.  
 
Aim 2 (EEG) Statistical considerations: Behavioral data (error rate) and 
electrophysiological summary data will be analyzed in a repeated measures ANOVA 
with a 3x5 factorial for memory load (1, 3, 5 syllables ) by [CONTACT_9934] (TPM, LZP, PLA, two 
baselines). The Tukey -Kramer procedure will be used to adjust type I error rates for the 
multiple comparisons among the drug groups at specific memory loads, and across memory loads. ANOVAs will adjust for treatment order and session number, and include a random effect for participant to control for within- person correlation across the three 
sessions. Electrophysiological measures (amplitudes, peak latency, will be analyzed separately with repeated measures multivariate analyses of variance (RM -MANOVA;

and adjusting variables as above. Correlations between ERP difference (e.g., TPM vs 
PLA) and drug concentration (collected as part of Aim 3, below) will be computed. With 24 participants per drug/dose combination, and two- sided α=0.05, we will have power 
75% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.5, 90% power to detect a correlation of size ≥0.6, and 98% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.7.   
 
Aim 3 (Pk/PD) Statistical considerations: For PK analyses, variables are added and a 
model chosen using a forward selection process (cutoff of p<.005), followed by a 
backward elimination process (cutoff of p<.001) to avoid type I errors due to multiple statistical tests. The estimation step of a Nonlinear Mixed Ef fects Model (NONMEM) will 
be implemented using first order conditional estimation with an interaction term. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) Bayesian post -hoc estimates of each individual’s PK 
parameter will be used to derive measures of drug exposure (e.g., AUC, steady -state 
concentrations) using standard PK equations. PD modeling will investigate if a relationship exists between outcomes of interest contained in the neuropsychological battery.  
Separately for the three TPM doses and for LZP, neuropsychological and speech data change scores will each be used as the outcome in a linear regression with the three pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, trough, maximum) as the primary predictors of interest. If AUC, trough, and maximum are highly collinear, we will consider them one at a time. With 24 participants per drug/dose combination, and two- sided p=0.05, we will 
have power 75% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.5, 90% power to detect a correlation of size ≥0.6, and 98% to detect a correlation of size ≥0.7. All regress ions will be 
adjusted for session number, age, and gender. We will also compare the R -square from 
the model with AUC as predictor to the R -square from the model with dose as predictor. 
Population pharmacokinetic modeling will be used to calculate individual measures of exposures (i.e., AUC, trough, and maximum drug concentration) to be used in the analyses above.

Safe ty and Adverse Events 
7.4 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops 
or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or 
  Page 16 
CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the University of Minnesota.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_941] s tudy sponsor  injuries should be regarded as adverse events.   Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to fur ther diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_118296]- serious.  A serious adverse 
event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment  of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non- serious adverse events.  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -up is defined 
as [ADDRESS_462457] administration of study treatment.   
Preexisting Condition A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that m eet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is 
otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator should instruct 
  Page [ADDRESS_462458] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any 
one of the following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to 
confirm  the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_369413] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and adverse event.   
 Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be 
reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it  is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5113].

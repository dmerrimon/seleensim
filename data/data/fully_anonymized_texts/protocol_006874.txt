STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Full Study Title:  Laboratory Study and Wear -Time Trial for Self -Fitting Hearing Aid  
Classification:  Pre-market  clinical investigation  
Type of Study:  There are two components to this study.  For the first, an in -lab session, a 
repeated -measures design is used to assess the reliability and validity of the 
self-fitting method.  For the second, a wear -time trial, a cross -over design is 
used with 10 -14 days of wear time for each segment of the field trial.  
Device Regulatory 
Status:  Jabra Enhance Plus  is an investigational device  
Significant / 
Nonsignificant  
Classification:  Non-Significant Risk Study (Abbreviated IDE regulations apply, 21 Code of  
Federal Regulations Part 812)  
Number of Patients:  N=36

Participation:  20-24 weeks  (3-5 weeks per patient)  
Patient Population  Adults, 18 -75 years, with mild -to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss  
Number of Sites:  3 
Duration of Study:  Approximately 90 days  
Background and 
Rationale:  Self-fitting hearing aids represent an FDA device classification that was 
recently created while implementation of the Over the Counter Hearing Aid 
Act by [CONTACT_348480].  These devices are designed for adults with 
perceived mild -to-moderate hearin g loss and the fitting is largely driven by 
[CONTACT_348481].  This trial seeks to establish the reliability and validity of GN 
Hearing's self-fitting process , as well as the  safety and efficacy of the device,  
for the company's first self -fitting hearing aid, Jabra Enhance Plus . 
Purpose:  To establish the reliability , safety and effectiveness  of GN Hearing's fitting 
process  and self -fitting hearing aid , Jabra Enhance Plus . 
Primary  Effectiveness  
Objectives/ Endpoint s: - For the effectiveness  component of the immediate in -lab session 
comparisons , Real -Ear Aided Gain (REAG) will be measured using 
both an audiology -best-practices hearing aid fitting (PRO -FIT) and a 
self-fitting method (SELF -FIT).  
o Success criterion is defined as SELF -FIT REAG is equivalent to 
PRO -FIT NAL -NL2 prescription REAG targe ts based on the 
average real -ear aided gain at 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz .  
- For the reliability component of the immediate in -lab session 
comparisons , Real -Ear Aided Gain (REAG) will be measured twice (A, 
B) using the SELF -FIT method.  
o Success criterion i s four -frequency average REAG for SELF -FIT 
B is equivalent to the REAG for SELF -FIT A  
- For the effectiveness  of the wear -time crossover field trial , the 
Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit  (APHAB ) will be measured

Protocol/Study No.: [ADDRESS_432920] -practices hearing aid fitting (PRO -FIT) 
and a self -fitting method (SELF -FIT).  
o Success criterion is defined as SELF -FIT APHAB global score is 
non-inferior to PRO -FIT APHAB global scores following completion 
of the wear -time field trial.  
 
Secondary 
Effectiveness  
Objectives/ Endpoints:  
 - For the effectiveness  component of the immediate in -lab session 
comparison , aided  Quick Speech -in-Noise test  (QuickSIN ) performance 
will be compared between SELF -FIT and PRO -FIT. 
o Success criterion is the SELF -FIT QuickSIN  speech -recognition 
threshold in noise (signal -to-noise ratio, SNR) is equivalent to that 
of PRO -FIT.  
- For the reliability component of the immediate in -lab session comparison , 
QuickSIN performance will be measured twice (A, B) using the SELF -FIT 
method to  assess test -retest reliability.  
o Success criterion is QuickSIN thresholds are equivalent for SELF -FIT 
A and B.  
- For the effectiveness  of the wear -time crossover field trial , QuickSIN 
performance will be compared between SELF -FIT and PRO -FIT. 
o Success criteri on is defined as SELF -FIT QuickSIN SNR is 
equivalent to PRO -FIT QuickSIN SNR following completion of the 
wear -time field trial.  
Primary Safety 
Objectives/Endpoints:  Tabulations of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).  
o Success criterion is no recorded device -related AEs or SAEs.  
Inclusion Criteria:  An initial telephone or internet screening of interested persons will take 
place.  
• During this remote screening, prospective subjects  will provide 
their age (subject to verification at Visit 1) and answer a Yes/No 
question as to whether they have trouble hearing in noise.  Those 
answering "No" will not be considered further for enrollment.  
• Those answering "Yes" will then be asked to describe their 
perceived hearing loss o n a 4 -point scale (no trouble, a little 
trouble, a lot of trouble, and cannot hear).  Prospects answering 
at the two extremes will not be considered further for this study.  
• Those answering "a little trouble" or "a lot of trouble" will be invited 
to the in -person Screen that immediately precedes hearing aid 
fittings in Visit [ADDRESS_432921] meet all of the following criteria:  
• Mild-to-moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss 
(thresholds from 250 – [ADDRESS_432922] one threshold 
greater than 20 dB HL  and thresholds at 500, 1000, 2000 and 
4000 Hz less than or equal to 55, 65, 70, and 80 dB HL, 
respectively ) 
• Mix of male a nd female subjects (aiming for a 
representative balance)  
• Mix of prior hearing -aid use (aiming for 70 -80% 
persons with no prior hearing aid use)  
• 18-75 years old (aiming for primarily 50 -70 years old, 
with avg. age ~65 years)  
• Able to read and comprehend Engl ish 
• Patient willing to provide informed consent  
Exclusion Criteria:  An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from 
participation in this study:  
• Hearing outside of limits noted above  
• Self-reported ear -related pathology (including chronic severe 
dizziness or chronic severe tinnitus)  
 
Sampling Frame:  The proposed sample size of n= 36 subjects will be sufficient to rule out a null 
hypothesis of non -equivalence of SELF -FITSs  A and B (reliability) or SELF -
FIT A and PRO -FIT (validity) with about 8 0% power  with 0.[ADDRESS_432923] -of-care 
measures will be generated for the primary and secondary measure and for 
the reliability and validity components of the study.  
Statistical 
Considerations:  A statistical test of hypothesis of whether the primary effectiveness endpoint 
is equivalent to the standards observed in professional fits for both the 
reliability and validity components of the study .  The mean absolute values 
of the differences between test -retest for the SELF -FITs and between the 
SELF -FIT and PRO -FIT will be report ed by [CONTACT_765].

1.0 PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AND JUSTIFICATION  
1.1 Introduction  
The objective of  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_348464]'s Jabra Enhance Plus  device .  The Jabra Enhance Plus  is a prototype 
self-fitting hearing aid . The study will also evaluate safety and effectiveness of the Jabra Enhance 
Plus device  using acoustical measures of gain and output, behavioral measures of benefit, and 
other measures of device safety which are standard in the hearing -aid industry . 
1.2 Background  
Self-fitting hearing aids are designed for adults with perceived m ild-to-moderate hearing loss and 
the fitting is largely driven by [CONTACT_348481].  This trial seeks to establish the reliability and validity of 
GN Hearing's fitting process for the company's first self -fitting hearing aid, Jabra Enhance Plus , 
and the safety a nd efficacy of the device . 
1.[ADDRESS_432924] ed result, and actual result. No bugs were 
detected that were associated with either safety or effectiveness  of the system . 
1.4 Previous Clinical Experience  
No prior clinical studies we re performed  for the Jabra Enhance Plus  device.  GN Hearing, 
however, has extensive experience conducting clinical investigations of the effectiveness and 
safety of conventional hearing aids and other ear -worn audio devices.  
1.5 Device Risk Analysis  
1.5.1  Anticipate d Clinical Benefits  
The Jabra Enhance Plus  device will provide measurable acoustic gain and , therefore , is expected 
to improve the auditory function of the wearer as measured behaviorally using a combination of 
speech -in-noise measures and self -report bene fit measures.  The individual participant will 
experience these benefits personally, but there is also a greater general benefit to all adults with 
mild-to-moderate hearing loss by [CONTACT_348482] .  The purchase price and access to the device are envisioned to be much less 
burdensome than conventional hearing aids currently available to adults with mild -to-moderate 
hearing loss.  
1.5.2  Anticipated Adverse Effects  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential risks related to using Jabra Enha nce Plus  as a treatment vs. standard of care  
Compared to the standard -of-care fitting, the only anticipated risks involve the improper self -
selection of device settings such that either too little or too much gain will be selected.  The 
maximum possible ga in, however, has been limited to minimize the risk to hearing from device 
use.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential risks associated with patient population  
Because the app used to fit and control the device requires some familiarity with such apps, the 
user may experience some frus tration when initially learning how to fit and control the device.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Possible interactions and concomitant treatments  
Because both new and experienced hearing aid users are to be included, experienced user may 
be frustrated with the differences between the J abra Enhance Plus  device and their own hearing 
aids, including differences in sound quality and adjustment.  
1.5.3  Risk/Benefit Rational e  
The risks of the Jabra Enhance Plus  device are based on data collected in a n early feas ibility 
clinical study  conducted by G N and are considered minimal . During  that  feasibility stud y, no 
device -related adverse events were observed.  
The potential benefits of the Jabra Enhance Plus  device far outweigh the possible risks.  Hearing 
aids are the treatment of choice for adults with mild  to moderate hearing loss, yet most estimates 
indicate that only 20 -30% of those who could benefit from hearing aids actually purchase them.  
The primary limitations  to purchase  pertain to the high cost and low accessibility of conventional  
hearing aids.  Self -fitting hearing aids provide a more affordable and accessible path to good 
hearing healthcare for millions of adults with mild  to moderate hearing loss. These claims are also 
based on data collected in the early feasibility stud ies using a previous device version . The 
benefits of the device include:  i) lower device cost to the end user; ii)  greater sense of self -control 
of treatment options through the self -fitting process; iii) no cost of changes to hearing aid settings 
or fitting.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Relevance of Endpoints  
For the in -lab session , the primary effectiveness endpoint  will be assessed by [CONTACT_348483] -ear aided gain (REAG), a gold -standard  measure for the acoustical function of 
hearing devices for the study popul ation.  This endpoint will be used to assess mean absolute -
value differences between two replications of the SELF -FIT method  (reliability ) and between the 
SELF -FIT and PRO -FIT methods  (validity or effectiveness) . 
For the wear -time trial, the primary outcome measure is a widely used  clinical  self-report measure 
of benefit (Abbreviate d Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, APHAB) . The APHAB is also a gold-
standard, validated assessment  of hearing  aid benefit  relevant for t he study population.  
Secondary effectiveness endpoints for both the laboratory and field -trial components will be 
assessed by a standardized measure of speech communication in noise, the QuickSIN .  This is 
a widely used clinical measure of an adult’s ability to understand speech in noise  and is closely 
tied to the wearer’s primary complaint  of difficulty commu nicating in noise.  
Overall study success will be defined by [CONTACT_348484], 
effectiveness , and safety  of the devices and the self -fitting process  in the laboratory and field -trial 
components of this study .  Effectiveness o utcomes from the SELF -FIT process should be 
equivalent to those of the PRO -FIT method in the in -lab session  and non -inferior to PRO -FIT in 
the wear -time trial for the study to be considered successful.  
2.0 INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
2.1 Identification and Description of the Investigational Device  
The Jabra Enhance Plus  (also called simply the “Earbuds”) is designed to compensate  users 
perceived mild to moderate hearing loss withou t the aid of a hearing care professional in the fitting 
of the  device. The Earbuds are provided with a dedicated smartphone application , also named 
Jabra Enhance,  and dedicated Charger.   
 
Using the dedicated smartphone application, the Earbud settings are customized based on an  
initial self -fitting workflow and user preferences. The user can monitor and control the Earbuds,  
amplify environmental sounds through the Earbuds, and wirelessly stream audio to the Earbuds. 
The Earbuds are used with mo bile devices through the dedicated smartphone application and a 
standardized  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection . 
 
The Earbuds are designed to be discrete, but stylish, and are made from premium materials for 
high wearing comfort for longer periods of ti me. They are dust and liquid resistant. The Earbuds 
can be  personalized with respect to sound settings and have a push button for control. Sound 
setting  changes can be made directly from the smartphone application. Connectivity -wise, the 
Earbuds  allow for:  
• Communication to and from the smartphone application, for:  
o The self -fitting process.  
o Limited fine -tuning adjustments in the form of spectral tilt options.  
o Controls (including volume control and microphone directionality control).  
o Battery / charg ing state, which is sent to the smartphone application.  
o Firmware updates, which are downloaded from the Internet Cloud to the 
smartphone  and applied to the Earbuds.  
• Ear-to-ear communication between the Earbuds for sending relevant control data.  
• Streaming of audio ( e.g., phone calls) from mobile devices.  
• Own voice pi[INVESTIGATOR_348465], i.e., traditional hands -free headset functionality.  
• Push to talk.  
• Connect ion to the Charger for transmission of charging and battery status  to the 
smartphon e app lication . 
 
The App allows for several different functions:  
• Self-fitting of the Earbuds.  
• Control of the Earbuds, including volume and spectral  tilt options.  
• Status monitoring, such as status of the battery and connection to the Earbuds.  
 
The Charger has a stylish appearance, and functions as a carrying case. The Charger itself is  
rechargeable, such that it can be used without having it plugged into a power source, which can 
be beneficial for instances when an outlet is not available, e.g., dur ing travel.  
2.1.1  Device Instructions  
The Jabra Enhance Plus  is intended to amplify sound for individuals 18 years of age or  
older with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment. It is adjusted by [CONTACT_348485] A/S

user’s hearing needs. No pre -programming  or hearing test is necessary. The device is intended 
for direct -to-consumer sale and use without the assistance of a hearing care professional.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pair Devices  
The flow for pairing of Earbuds for the first time is shown in Figure 2. These instructions will b e 
available to the user in written form with illustrative pi[INVESTIGATOR_499].  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Pairing flow for the Earbuds.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
Steps for device pairing are as follows:  

o The user is instructed to activate the Earbuds and Charger by [CONTACT_348486] (with  the Earbuds inserted) using the USB cable. This will wake the 
Charger and the Earbuds from  shippi[INVESTIGATOR_348466].  
o The user is instructed to take both Earbuds out of the Charger, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_348467], and then the LEDs will flash blue.  
o The left and the right Earbuds will now enter pairing mode, and they will pair to 
each other,  i.e., ear -to-ear pairing. The ear -to-ear pairing can only take place in 
the first two minutes after  the Earbuds are taken out of the Charger.   For the field 
trial, th e ear -to-ear pairing is already set up.  
o After the ear -to-ear pairing is established, both Earbuds will now be visible for the 
smartphone,  i.e., smartphone discovery mode. The smartphone discovery window 
is open for three minutes  after the Earbuds are ear -to-ear paired.  
o The user is instructed to leave the App and go to the smartphone (iPhone) settings 
to establish  the pairing of the Earbuds to the smartphone.  
o If the pairing to the smartphone is established, the LEDs on both Earbuds will light 
up solid  blue f or a few seconds to indicate that pairing is done.  
o A pairing melody will be played in both devices to indicate that pairing is 
established. This is  the traditional pairing melody already used in GN legacy 
hearing instruments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Self-fit devices  
The Earbuds c an be fitted by [CONTACT_348487], using the dedicated fitting feature on the 
smartphone  App. Before the self -fitting can be started on the smartphone, several things need to 
be in place:  
o The smartphone App must be installed, a trusted bond must be established, and 
terms,  conditions and consent must be acknowledged in the smartphone App. The 
user will then be  directed to the self -fitting feature.  
o Earbuds need to be powered on, ear -to-ear paired, and paired with the smartphone 
(per instructions above) . 
o During the self -fitting, the broadband level of background environmental noise is 
monitored  by [CONTACT_348488]. If the noise level is too loud, the user is instructed to 
repeat the self -fitting in  a quieter environment.  
 
The user initiates the self -fitting f low via the App. The Earbud presents the user with a series of 
tones  and the user marks the App on the smartphone screen to indicate when/if a tone is heard. 
Based on  the user’s responses to these tones, initial gain settings are applied according to the 
NAL-NL2 fitting  algorithm. This self -assessment of hearing loss does not provide the user with 
feedback about accuracy  of their responses,  nor does it provide the user with a diagnosis or 
information about their hearing loss.  The information obtained during this process is used only 
internally to fit the device to the NAL -NL2 prescribed gain by [CONTACT_348489]. Based on the 
initial pre scribed gain, the user will  subsequently be given the option to choose between two 
alternative gain settings, i.e., limited  adjustments of the spectral tilt based on their preference 
while listening to a streamed sound file. The  spectral tilt option that i s selected can also be 
changed at any time during device use, from the settings  menu.  
 
If the Earbuds are powered on for the first time, i.e., no fitting has been done, the Earbuds will 
start up with basic settings, and with a small amount of linear gain. User controls and streaming 
are prohibited until after the self -fitting process has been done.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Fine-tune devices  
An important element with the GN Earbuds is the possibility, after the initial fitting is complete, to  
fine-tune the devices from the smartphon e application. Although there are some differences with  
respect to the fine -tuning features, the vehicle which is used (standard features, volume control, 
etc.),  will be similar to GN legacy hearing instruments currently in commercial distribution in the 
U.S. 
 
Features that can be set from the home screen of the smartphone application include overall 
volume  and three frequency responses . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Remote firmware update  
The firmware in the Earbuds can be updated, e.g., to strengthen cybersecurity. A message can 
be pu shed from the Cloud to the smartphone App that an update is available. The update can 
then be applied.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Charge devices  
The Earbuds are charged with a dedicated Charger. Charging will not take place wirelessly but 
will take place via a physical connection ov er Pogo contact [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_348468].  
2.1.[ADDRESS_432925] -practices approach to treatment for such individuals has been to c onsult with 
one or more healthcare professionals  for assistance  in determining candidacy and acquiring 
hearing aids.  It has been estimated that only 20 -30% of adults with such difficulties seek and 
obtain hearing aids within the existing treatment  model.  The Jabra Enhance Plus  (also called 
simply the “Earbuds”  here) is designed to compensate  users  perceived mild-to-moderate 
hearing loss without the aid of a hearing care professional in fitting of the  device.

2.4 Risk Category/Rationale  
GN Hearing A/S  does not consider the Jabra Enhance Plus  device or the res ult of its use in this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_348469] a significant risk to study subjects . Per 21 CFR 812.3 , the Jabra Enhance 
Plus device and its use in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_348470] -significant risk (NSR) because:  
• It is not intended as an implant and thus does not present a potential for serious risk to 
the health, safety, or welfare of a subject;  
• It is not purported or represented to be for use in supporting or sustaining human life and 
thus does not present a potential for  serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a 
subject ; 
• It is not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating 
disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and thus does not present 
a potential for  serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; and  
• It does not otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare 
of a subject . 
Because the device  and its use in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_348471],  the abbrevi ated IDE

4.0 DESIGN OF RESEARCH STUDY  
4.1 Type of Research Study  
This study has two components to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Jabra Enhance Plus  
device  in adults with mild  to moderate sensorine ural hearing loss.  The reliability and validity of 
the self -fitting method are examined in an in -lab session with counter -balanced conditions.  A 
second component, a single -blind counter -balanced cross -over wear -time field trial, further 
evaluates the val idity of the self -fitting method .  Three sites are involved in data collection.  
4.2 Controls and Minimization of Bias  
The Sponsor , GN Hearing A/S,  should avoid improper influence on any parties participating in, or 
contributing to, the clinical study  or the in duction thereof.  The selection and treatment of subjects 
and evaluation of study  data are potential sources of bias.  Methods that are incorporated within 
the study  design to minimize potential bias include, but are not limited to, screening subjects to 
confirm study  eligibility with defined inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to enrollment; maintaining a 
log of all subjects screened  and enrolled for the study , collec ting demographics and medical 
history at baseline to later assess possible characteristics that may influence endpoints;   
standardizing data collection requirements and study  procedures; requiring  all study  investigators 
to meet the requirements of 21CFR P art 54 and a Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_6230]; 
using standardized training materials for all study  personnel; and conducting regular electronic 
monitoring to verify adherence to the protocol and source data.  
5.[ADDRESS_432928] variable of the outcome measures across all components of this study. 
When the sample size in each sequence group  in the cro ssover trial is 16 (giving a total sample 
size of 32), a crossover design will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the SELF -
FIT APHAB mean is inferior to the PRO -FIT APHAB mean based on the mean difference, in favor 
of the alternative hypothe sis that the SELF -FIT mean is non -inferior to the PRO -FIT mean, 
assuming that the expected difference in means is 0, the non -inferiority difference margin is .084 
(or 8.4%), the Crossover ANOVA √MSE is 0.115 (or 11.5%) (giving a standard  deviation of 
differences, σ, of 0.163 or 16.3%) and that the test is made at the 2.5% significance level.  
 
The overall design for the in -lab session is a repeated -measures design comparing outcomes for 
three procedures: SELF -FIT A, SELF -FIT B, PRO -FIT.  Given that SELF -FIT A and B are the 
same procedure repeated two times, this results in three possible procedu re sequences: (1) 
SELF -FIT A, SELF -FIT B, PRO -FIT; (2) SELF -FIT A, PRO -FIT, SELF -FIT B; and (3) PRO -FIT, 
SELF -FIT A, SELF -FIT B.  An equal number of subjects  will receive each sequence at each site 
to ensure full counterbalancing of order.  A total of [ADDRESS_432929] attrition or missing data .

• During th is remote screening, prospective subjects  will provide their age (subject to 
verification at Visit 1) and answer a Yes/No question as to whether they have trouble 
hearing in noise.  Those answering "No" will not be considered further for enrollment.  
• Those answering "Yes" will then be asked to describe their perceived hearing loss on 
a 4-point scale (no trouble, a little trouble, a lot of trouble, and cannot hear).  Prospects 
answering at the two extremes will not be considered further for this study.  
• Those answering "a little trouble" or "a lot of trouble" will be invited to the in -person 
Screen that immediately precedes hearing aid fittings in Visit [ADDRESS_432931] meet all of the following criteria:  
 (1) Mild-to-moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss ( thresholds from 250 
– [ADDRESS_432932] one threshold greater than 20 dB HL and thresholds at 500, 
1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz less than or equal to 55, 65, 70, and 80 dB HL, respectively ); 
 (2) Mix of male and female subjects (aiming for a representative balance) ; 
 (3) Mix of prior hearing -aid use (aiming for 70 -80% persons with no prior  
hearing aid use) ; 
(4)  18-75 years old (aiming for primarily 50 -70 years old, with avg. age ~65  
years) ; 
 (5) Able to read and comprehend English ; and  
        (6)  Patient willing to provide informed consent . 
5.5 Exclusion Criteria  
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this 
study:  
 (1) Hearing outside of limits no ted above ; or 
 (2) Self-reported ear -related pathology (including chronic severe dizziness or chronic 
severe tinnitus) . 
5.[ADDRESS_432933] for this device.  
5.7 Enrollment Screening  
Screening for eligibility of this study  will be made within 28 days prior to the treatment. If a patient 
who meets the study criteria joins the study, preliminary effectiveness and safety using  the Jabra 
Enhance Plus  in the study will be measured.  
6.0 RESEARCH STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Study Assessmen ts 
A description of all assessments being performed  are provided within Section 3.0.  
6.2 Study Procedures  
6.2.1 Pre -Fitting Procedures : After consent, otoscopy, and audiological measurements 
verifying candidacy for the study, the subject completes Pre -Fitting of the devices. If the 
subject does not have a compatible iPhone  running  iOS 14, one will be supplied for use in this 
study. The investigator will install the app on the subject's smartphone, pair the devices to the 
smartphone, and select the appropriate earbud size for each ear prior to the PRO -FIT and 
SELF -FIT procedures.  (These aspects of the fitting process for the Jabra Enh ance Plus  will 
be evaluated separately in a usability study.)  
 i. Fitting begins by [CONTACT_348492] -tube microphones in the subject’s ear canals and 
measuring the Real -Ear Unaided Response (REUR) for each ear.  
 ii. The Jabra Enhance Plus , powered off, will b e placed in the subject's ear with  
medium -sized earbuds and the Real -Ear Occluded Response (REOR) measured.  
• If measurable passive attenuation at frequencies above [ADDRESS_432934] and REOR 
will be remeasured.  
• This process will be repeated as needed until a good seal is obtained as 
verified by [CONTACT_348493].  
• The selected earbud size for each ear will be used by [CONTACT_348494].  
6.2.2 PRO -FIT: The audiologist will use t he air -conduction thresholds measured during the 
initial screening to generate REA R targets for the NAL -NL2 prescriptive procedure.  
   i. Targets will be generated for a speech input level of [ADDRESS_432935] to match N AL-NL2 targets will be 
accomplished using custom device -programming software (AlgoLabTest) to 
program the gain and compression parameters for NAL -NL2.  
iii. The Audioscan Verifit [ADDRESS_432936] .  
      GN Hearing A/S  
Jabra Enhance Plus  
  Final date d August 3 , 2021  
Protocol/Study No.: [ADDRESS_432937] will fine -tune 
the fitting to accommodate those complaints ( as was done for the predicate device 
study;  Sabin et al., 2020).  The range of adjustments to the frequency response 
will be constrained to the two alternative responses available on the device via the 
app. This will be the final fit for PRO -FIT to be worn during the wear -time trial.  
v. No additio nal fine -tuning will be made by [CONTACT_348495] -FIT fitting for 
the duration of this study, including the field trial.  Although such adjustments may 
be common practice, there is little evidence available about the benefits of such 
adjustments a nd they are not included in national best -practice guidelines for 
hearing -aid fitting. The validation study of the Bose Hearing Aid (Sabin et al., 2020) 
allowed additional adjustments by [CONTACT_348495] -FIT condition in that 
study after a brief wear -time period (M=5.3 days).  However, the gain from 500 -
4000 Hz was not adjusted in 77% of those subjects  and another 14% of their 
subjects  required adjustments of only 5 dB at one or more of those frequencies in 
either ear after this brief wear -time pe riod.  In other words, 91% of the time, no or 
very minor adjustments, within the range of adjustments that will be available to 
the user during the wear -time trial in this study, occurred.  Further, the user will 
have access to self -adjustment of volume and  choice of frequency response tilt as 
desired during the wearing period.  
6.2.3 SELF -FIT A : Once the earbuds have been selected by [CONTACT_348496], subjects  will complete the first self -fitting process ( Section 16.0 , 
Attachment A).  
i. Subjects  will open the mobile device screen, launch the app, and select from drop -
down menus to indicate age and gender. (These data facilitate the starting point 
for the fitting process, but the process can still be completed if left bla nk.) 
ii. Subjects  will be presented with step -by-step fitting instructions on their smartphone 
describing their task during the self -fitting flow (See Section 16.0, Attachment A.).  
iii. Subjects  will be presented with the “Heard It” design of the self -fitting proce dure, 
meaning that they will tap the smartphone screen to indicate when a tone is 
detected.  
iv. The self -fitting flow requires [ADDRESS_432938] tones per self -fit. This 
procedure results in settings as determined by [CONTACT_348497] "initial fit" and is designed to match NAL -NL2 targets. 
REAG targets and measures will be calculated by [CONTACT_348498].  Comparison of REAG and 
QuickSIN measures among PRO -FIT, SELF -FIT A, and SELF -FIT B in Visit 1 (in -
lab) will be made using these saved initial -fit settings for SELF -FIT. 
v. The SELF -FIT process continues uninterrupted with user -preferred adjustments of 
"filters" or frequency -gain re sponses.  These user -driven fine -tuning adjustments 
are made while streaming a sound file to the devices and comparing filter settings.  
(See Attachment 4A for details.) When the subject selects the final settings, these 
device settings are saved and becom e the new default settings for when the device 
is powered on.  These settings are referred to as the "final fit" for the SELF -FIT 
procedure.  Measurements made for SELF -FIT A and PRO -FIT at the end of each 
wear -time crossover field trial will make use of t hese final-fit settings.  
vi. Once the subject has completed the test, the app will indicate that the subject is 
finished with personalization of the devices and will return to the home screen of 
the app.  
6.2.4 SELF -FIT B : To assess test -retest reliability, subjects  will complete the self -fitting 
procedure a second time (repeat steps for SELF -FIT A above).  
6.2.[ADDRESS_432939] been tested in each of the six sequences at each site, 
six per sequence for the entire study,  and any effects of order will be equalized across 
conditions following the counterbalancing illustrated in Figure 1. 
The table below summarizes the primary and secondary outcome assessments to be 
completed during each study visit.  For Visits 2 and 3, REA G will also be established but only 
for potential explanatory purposes and not as an outcome measure.  
 
Visit  Primary Outcome  Secondary Outcome  
1 REAG from REAR ; initial fit  QuickSIN ; initial fit  
2 APHAB ; final fit  QuickSIN ; final fit  
3 APHAB ; final fit  QuickSIN ; final fit  
 
After the final in -lab measures have been completed during Visit 1, [ADDRESS_432940] will then embark on a second 10 -to-14-day wear -time 
period using the devices with the other fitting settings (SELF -FIT A settings if PRO -FIT settings 
were worn first, and vice versa).  Subjects will return after the second 10 -to-14-day wear -time 
period for completion of REAG, aided APHAB and aided QuickSIN measures with this second 
fitting,  during Visit 3.  
Subjects  will follow the instructions for the “Self -fitting flow” ( Section 16.0, Attachment A) to 
complete SELF -FIT A  and SELF -FIT B  procedures .  After the installation of software on the 
smartphone, the pairing of the devices to the smartphone, and the physical fit of the devices, 
no further assistance will be provided to the subject by [CONTACT_348499] 1.  When Visit [ADDRESS_432941] will be provided with 
the devices, the charger, the USB -C cable, and a copy of the User's Manual (Attachment A).  
The research audiologist will answer questions raised by [CONTACT_348500].  Prior to leaving for the first phase of the field trial, the subject will 
demonstrate to the audiologist that he or she can insert and remove the devices, adjust the 
      GN Hearing A/S  
Jabra Enhance Plus  
  Final date d August 3 , 2021  
Protocol/Study No.: [ADDRESS_432942] leaving with the devices.  
For the wear -time field trial, subjects will be asked to wear the devices in a v ariety of listening 
situations during the trial including while listening to music and while using the telephone.   
Subjects will be asked to wear their devices a minimum of two hours per day.  
6.2.6  REA R Measurement  and REAG Calculation  
SELF -FIT A & B : Pers onalization begins with an estimate of hearing acuity obtained through the 
Jabra Enhance Plus . The hearing acuity measurements are used internally by [CONTACT_348501]. Once this step has been completed, devices will apply NAL -NL2 gain 
prescriptions directly using the estimated hearing acuity to generate the initial fit.  Probe -tube 
microphone measures of the REAR (REAG=REAR -input ) will be obtained for a 65 -dB speech 
input using the Audioscan Verifit real -ear measurement system.  All probe -tube microphone 
measures will make use of the custom dome/probe -tube assembly supplied by [CONTACT_348491].  
(Attachment B for details.)  
PRO -FIT: Audiometric thresholds will be imported and the devices programmed using custom 
device programming software  (AlgoLabTest) for NAL -NL2 target gains. Probe -tube microphone 
measures of the REUR and REAR (REAG=REAR -input ) will be obtained for a 65 -dB speech input 
using the Audioscan Verifit real -ear measurement system.  All probe -tube microphone measures 
will make u se of the custom dome/probe -tube assembly supplied by [CONTACT_348491] . (See 
Attachment B for details.)  
6.2.[ADDRESS_432943] (at location of subject's 
head using the method of substitution). This speech level was chosen as one approximating a 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_348473] ([ADDRESS_432944]) and matching the speech input level used for the 
REAR measures ([ADDRESS_432945]). The level of t he co -located background four -talker babble 
increases across the six sentences for signal -to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from +25 to 0 dB 
SNR (in steps of 5 dB). The subject is asked to repeat each sentence. The audiologist scores 
whether the subject  corre ctly repeated the predetermined key words in each sentence. The 
resulting score is interpreted as an SNR loss where a value near 0 indicates better hearing and 
larger values indicate more difficulty listening in noise.  
There are 18 lists of the QuickSIN, b ut McArdle and Wilson (2006) found four of these to be non -
equivalent to the others.  The remaining [ADDRESS_432946] QuickSIN 
measure at the end of the initial screening (Visit 1), two lists will be presented as practice lists 
(Lists 4 and 5). For the remaining 12 lists (Lists 1 -3, 6, 8 -12, 15, 17, 18), two will be assigned to 
each of the following conditions: unaided (during initial screen; to permit measures of relative 
benefit), in -lab initial SELF -FIT A, in -lab initial  SELF -FIT B, in -lab initial PRO -FIT (the condition 
order and list  pair assigned for each condition will be randomized for each participant) , at end of 
first 10 -to-14-day wear period (Visit 2; either final SELF -FIT A or final  PRO -FIT), and at end of 
final 1 0-to-14-day wear period (Visit 3; either final PRO -FIT or final SELF -FIT A).  Each QuickSIN 
score will be based on two lists, [ADDRESS_432947] .   
[IP_ADDRESS] QuickSIN Test Procedure  
Four conditions: Unaided, Self -Fit A, Self -Fit B, Pro -Fit  
i. Listener will sit in a chair in the center of a sound -treated booth facing the 
speaker from which the test materials will be elicited (0 degrees azimuth , 1 
meter distance ).  
ii. Training : To familiarize subjects  with the speech tas k, listeners will be 
presented with two practice lists (Lists 4 and 5) before commencing with 
the experimental protocol (Visit 1, Unaided only).  
iii. The test will be presented in a sound field at [ADDRESS_432948]. 
Speech levels are automatically presented at SNRs of +25, +20, +15, +10, 
+5 and 0 dB, one SNR per sentenc e.  The signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) for 
which 50% of the presented words are intelligible is calculated by 
[CONTACT_348502] (out of 30) for a given list from 25.5 
(Killion et al., 2004).  
v. The microphone setting will be set to "Wide"  (omni -directional) during these 
measurements.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_432949]’s  unaided score to their aided score.  
Although it is possible to collect unaided a nd aided scores at the same time by [CONTACT_348503], we will obtain unaided APHAB scores during Visit 1 prior to 
initiation of the cross -over wear -time trial.  
A sample question is as follows: "When I’m at the dinner  table with several people, and I am trying 
to have a conversation with one person, understanding speech is difficult."  For each of the [ADDRESS_432950] one of the following percentages to indicate how frequently 
this occurs:  Alway s (99%); Almost Always (87%); Generally (75%); Half -the-time (50%); 
Occasionally (25%); Seldom (12%); or Never (1%).  The APHAB will be administered and scored 
via a tablet PC or iPad.  
The APHAB produces scores for 4 subscales: Ease of Communication (EC), Reverberation (RV), 
Background Noise (BN), and Aversiveness (AV). To increase reliability, only an APHAB -global 
score based on all 24 items will be used here.  
Three conditions:  Unaided (Visit 1), Aided (Visit 2), Aided (Visit 3).  These three conditions a re: 
1) prior to the onset of the wear -time field trial, 2) after the first [ADDRESS_432951] fitting settings (final -fit SELF -FIT A or final -fit PRO -FIT), and 3) after the second 10 -14-day 
wear period with the other fitting settings (fin al-fit PRO -FIT or final -fit SELF -FIT A).

(1) Northwestern University, Evanston, IL;  (2) Sertoma Speech and Hearing Center, Palos Hills, 
IL; and ( 3) Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN.  
6.[ADDRESS_432953] may  also be removed from the investigation for the following medical or 
administrative reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent  
• Request to withdraw from the investigation  
• Non-compliance (less than  85%) with, or inability to complete,  CIP procedures  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Adverse event (if the subject experiences  an AE that, in the judgment of the Site 
Investigator, presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the participant).  
If a subject is  withdrawn from treatment, the Sponsor will be notified and the date and reason(s) 
for the withdrawal will be documented. If a subject is  withdrawn, efforts will be made to perform 
all follow -up assessments, if possible. Other procedures may be performed a t the Investigator’s 
(or designee’s) and/or Sponsor’s discretion. The Investigator (or designee) may also request that 
the subject return  for an additional Follow -up visit. All withdrawn subjects  will be followed until 
resolution of all their AEs or until the unresolved AEs are judged by [CONTACT_737] (or designee) 
to have stabilized.  
Subjects  who are withdrawn for reasons not related to the investigation al treatment may be 
replaced following discussion between the Investigator and the Sponsor. Subjects  withdrawn as 
a result of AEs thought to be related to the investigation al treatment will generally not be replaced.  
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails  to return to the laboratory  for a required study 
visit: 
• The site will attempt to cont act the subject and  reschedule the missed visit within [ADDRESS_432954] wishes  to and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a subject is  deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155] ( where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the pa rticipant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s 
medical record or study file.  
• Should the subject continue  to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdra wn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
 
A subject will  be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for scheduled visits and is 
unable to be contact[CONTACT_136589].

8.0 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS  
8.1 Statistical Analysis Methods  
8.1.1  In-Lab – Test-Retest Reliability  (initial Self -Fit A vs. initial Self -Fit B)  
i. Paired -sample t -tests of equivalence of the four -frequency (500, 1000, 2000 and 
4000 Hz) average REAG and the QuickSIN comparing initial -fit settings from the 
SELF -FIT A procedure and the initial -fit settings from the SELF -FIT B procedure.  
ii. Supplementary a nalyses will include examination of the distribution of differences 
in dB between the four -frequency average REAGs and the QuickSIN threshold 
SNRs for initial -fit settings from the SELF -FIT A and B procedures, as well as

8.1.2  In-Lab REAG – Validity  (initial Pro -Fit vs initial Self -Fit A)  
i. Paired -sample t -test for equivalence of the means of the initial -fit settings of the 
SELF -FIT A procedure to the means of the initial -fit settings of th e PRO -FIT 
procedure  
ii. Supplementary analyses will include examination of the distribution of differences 
in dB between the four -frequency average REAGs for initial -fit settings of the 
SELF -FIT A procedure and initial -fit settings of the PRO -FIT procedure, as  well as 
computation of correlation coefficients between the two measures.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_432955] - Validity  (initial Pro -Fit vs. initial Self -Fit A)  
i. Paired -sample t -test for equivalence of the means of the initial -fit settings of the 
SELF -FIT A proced ure to initial -fit settings of the PRO -FIT procedure  
ii. Supplementary analyses will include examination of the distribution of differences 
in dB between the QuickSIN threshold SNRs for initial -fit settings of the SELF -FIT 
A procedure and the initial -fit setti ngs of the PRO -FIT procedure, as well as 
computation of correlation coefficients between the threshold SNRs for each 
method.  
8.1.4  Wear -Time Field Trial - Validity : APHAB (final PRO -FIT vs. final SELF -FIT A)  
i. Non-Inferiority t -Test for 2 (wear -time sequence s) X 2 (fit conditions)  
ii. Supplementary analyses will include examination of the distribution of differences 
between the APHAB -global scores for final-fit settings of the SELF -FIT A 
procedure and final -fit settings of the PRO -FIT procedure, as well as comput ation 
of correlation coefficients between the two measures. Datalogging will also provide 
details of the subject's adjustment of the devices during each segment of the cross -
over wear -time trial.  
8.1.5  Wear -Time Field Trial - Validity : QuickSIN (final PRO -FIT vs final SELF -FIT A)  
i. Non-Inferiority t -Test for 2 (wear -time sequences) X 2 (fit conditions)  
ii. Supplementary analyses will include examination of the distribution of differences

method.  
8.2 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis will be performed  for this investigation . 
8.3 Missing Data Management  
All planned data will be collected as complete and as timely as possible.  No imputat ion of missing 
data is anticipated . 
8.4 Pass/Fail Criteria of the Study  
For the in -lab session, the primary effectiveness endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_348483] -ear aided gain (REAG), a gold -standard measure for the acoustical function  of 
hearing devices for the study population. This endpoint will be used to assess mean absolute -
value differences between two replications of the self -fit method (reliability) and between the self -
fit and professional -fit methods (validity or effectivenes s). 
For the wear -time trial, the primary outcome measure is a widely used clinical self -report measure 
of benefit (Abbreviate d Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, APHAB). The APHAB is also a gold -
standard, validated assessment of hearing -aid benefit relevant for the study population.  
Secondary effectiveness endpoints for both the laboratory and field -trial components will be 
assesse d by a standardized measure of speech communication in noise, the QuickSIN.  This is 
a widely used clinical measure of an adult’s ability to understand speech in noise and is closely 
tied to the wearer’s primary complaint, difficulty communicating in noise . 
Overall study success will be defined by [CONTACT_348505], 
effectiveness, and safety of the devices and the self -fitting process in the laboratory and field -trial 
components of this study.  Effectiveness o utcomes from the  SELF -FIT process should be 
equivalent to those of the PRO -FIT method in the in -lab session and non -inferior to PRO -FIT in 
the wear -time trial for the study to be considered successful.  
9.0 DEVIATIONS  
9.1 Management of Protocol Deviations  
A CIP deviation is any n oncompliance with the CIP, ISO [ZIP_CODE] Good Clinical Practice (ISO GCP), 
or Manual of Procedures requirements.  The noncompliance may be either on the part of the 
subject , the site investigator, or the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, corrective  actions 
are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  These practices are consistent with 
ISO [ZIP_CODE] GCP 9.6 Compliance with the CIP and 8.1 Clinical quality Assurance and Quality 
Control.

Jabra Enhance Plus  
  Final date d August 3 , 2021  
Protocol/Study No.: [ADDRESS_432956] be documented and reported, the criticality of the deviation will determine the reporting path.  
Critical Deviations:  Deviations that significantly affect the safety, effectiveness , integrity or 
conduct of the study. These deviations must be reported to the Sponsor no later than 5 working 
days from awareness of occurrence and reported to the IRB per the deviation reporting policy.  
Note: If an Investigator uses a device without obtaining informed consent,  the Investigator shall 
consider this a critical deviation and report the event to the Sponsor and the IRB within 5 working 
days of the occurrence.  
Non-Critical Deviations:  CIP deviations that do not significantly affect the safety, effectiveness , 
integrit y or conduct of the study  are considered non -critical deviations. These deviations must be 
documented and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_11200].  
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to use continuous vigilance in order to identify 
deviations. All deviations must be addressed in study source documents with explanations as well 
as reported to  GN Hearing A/S  as soon as possible. CIP deviations must be sent to the reviewing 
IRB per their policies. The site investigator is responsible for knowing an d adhering to the 
reviewing IRB requirements.  
The site investigator is not allowed to deviate from the CIP  without prior authorization received 
from the Sponsor, except under emergency situations when necessary to preserve the rights, 
safety, or well -being of investigation subjects . In the event the deviation involves a failure to obtain 
a subject’s consent or is made to protect the life or physical w ell-being of a subject in an 
emergency, the deviation must be reported to the IRB as well as  GN Hearing A/S  as soon as 
possible but no later than five (5) working days from the date of the deviation occurrence.  
Larry E. Humes is responsible for analyzing deviations, assessing their significance, and 
identifying any additional corrective and/or preventive actions which may include amending the 
CIP, conducting additional training, terminating the investigation, etc. Repetitive or  serious 
investigator compliance issues may represent a need to initiate a corrective action plan with the 
investigator and site, and in some cases, necessitate suspending enrollment at that site until the 
problem is resolved or ultimately terminating the site investigator's participation in the study .  
10.0 COMPLAINT HANDLING AND ADVERSE EVENT 
REPORTING  
10.1 Foreseeable Adverse Events and Device Effects  
Adverse events (AEs) are expected to be extremely rare based on the low risk profile of the 
device. In rare cases , it is foreseeable that study subjects  may experience moderate to mild and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_348474]:  
• Psychological distress or exacerbation of existing psychological or anxiety conditions, 
related to the requirements of various features of the de vice 
• Effects related to mechanical interaction with the device, such as eye strain leading to 
headaches or in rare cases blurred vision, strain of the digits, or transient discomfort  
For the purposes of this study, the following will not be considered or r eported as AEs:  
• Unchanged, chronic, non -worsening of a pre -existing conditions  
• A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing condition, any outpatient medical or surgical 
procedures, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_348475]/ba seline visit  
• Stable, intermittent chronic conditions present prior to screening/baseline visit that do not 
worsen during the study  
• Outpatient medical or surgical procedures planned prior to screening/baseline visit  
As with any medical device that involve s electronic transfer of subject  data, use of the device may 
pose risk to study subject privacy . These risks have been mitigated by [CONTACT_348506] [ZIP_CODE] :2019 Medical Devices – Application of risk 
management to medical devices . 
These foreseeable risks are not elevated beyond levels that would have occurred within the study 
subject ’s standard care.  The site investigator or designee will be responsible for determining 
whether an adverse event is fore seeable or not foreseeable.  An AE will be considered not 
foreseeable if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study.  
As in any medical device study, defects may be discover ed during testing of the medical device. 
All defects will be documented during the course of the study  as per ISO [ZIP_CODE] and applicable 
CFR requirements.  
10.2 Adverse Event Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical inves tigation subject 
receiving  investigational treatment, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of an 
investigational medical device, whether or not related to the investigational medical device.  
Section 1. 5, Device Risk Analysis contains a list of foreseeable AEs and adverse device effects.  
Specific adverse event p rotocols are defined the by [CONTACT_348507] y, and Sertoma Speech and Hearing Center ; however, these protocols are consistent 
with the following. In addition, Device Risk Assessments and determinations will be performed b y 
the appropriate committees at Vanderbilt and Northwestern Universities  as well as Sertoma 
Speech and Hearing Center .  
Treatment -Emergent AEs  are AEs that are new -onset , or worsen in severity , and are not 
anticipated due to the nature of this study and de vice. 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that either:

• is life threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage  
• result s in an important medical event  
 
Device issue or deficiency  is an inadequacy of a medical device related to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance, such as malfunction, misuse, or use error and 
inadequate labeling.  
An Advers e Device Effect (ADE)  is an AE related to the use of an investigational medical device. 
This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, 
deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of  the investigational 
medical device. The definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional 
misuse of the investigational medical device.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)   means any serious adverse effect on health or  
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a su pplementary plan or application), or any 
other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of subjects, according to [ADDRESS_432957] will  be monitored from the time of signing the ICF to final discharge 
from the investigation. Subjects  will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their 
condition by [CONTACT_93424], such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked? ” 
at least once each day at each investigation visit. Subjects  will also be encouraged to 
spontaneously report AEs occurring at any other time during the investigation.  
All nonserious AEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_178692], or  noted on 
physical examination, will be recorded from initiation of investigation treatment until investigation 
completion. Serious AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs  the ICF until investigation 
completion. The nature, time of onset, dura tion, and severity will be documented, together with 
an Investigator’s, or designee’s, opi[INVESTIGATOR_348476].  
If an AE occurs, appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures are to be taken and the 
investigation al treatmen t must be discontinued if appropriate. Follow -up evaluations of the subject 
are to be performed until the subject recovers  or until the clinical Investigator considers the 
situation to be no longer clinically significant.  
If clinically significant laborato ry abnormalities appear at the final treatment, appropriate additional 
tests may be performed to clarify the nature of any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 
that occur.  
10.4 Assessment of Severity  
The site Investigator will be asked to provide an assessment of the severity of the AE using the 
following categories:  
Event Severity  Severity Definition  
Mild  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living.  The AE does not influence 
performance or functioning. Prescription drugs are not ordinarily 
needed for relief of symptom(s).  
Moderate  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. 
The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
participant. Performance of daily activities is influenced. Treatment 
of symptom(s) may be needed.  
Severe  Interrupts usual activ ities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. Treatment 
for symptom(s) may be given.  
10.5 Relationship to Investigation Treatment  
The site Investigator will determine the relationship of the  AE to the investigational device 
according to the following guidelines:  
 
Event Relationship  Relationship Definition  
Unrelated  The adverse event is reasonably expected to be related to (or 
caused by) a concurrent illness, effect of another device/drug or 
other cause, and is unlikely related to the investigational product.  
Possibly Related  The adverse event is reasonably expected to be related to the 
investigational product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less 
likely compared to the potential relationship to investigational 
product.  
Probably Related  There is a strong relationship to investigational product, or recurs on 
re-challenge, and another etiology is unlikely, or there is no other 
reasonable medical explanation  for the event.

has an ongoing AE that is related to the investigational medical device during visits will be followed 
up with, where possible, until resolution. This will  be completed at the site i nvestigator’s (or 
designee’s) discretion. Any subject who  has an ongoing AE that is not related to the investigational 
medical device at follow -up visits can be closed out as ongoing at the Investigator’s discretion.  
10.8 Reporting  
10.8.1  Device Issue or Deficiency  
Any issues regarding the operation of the device or any malfunctions are to be reported to the 
sponsor. All reported issues will be processed per the Manufacturer’s standard operating 
procedures outside of the study . Information about device issues to be provided to manufacturers 
will include a description of the event, dates of onset and resolution, action taken, and the 
outcome.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_348477](s) will be stored as part of the study 
record. I f additional information is needed from sites or investigators, the Sponsor or its delegate 
may contact [CONTACT_348508] -up information necessary to investigate reported device 
issue.  
It is the responsibility of the site investigator to report any issues associated with a medical device 
distributed by [CONTACT_1034], regardless of whether they are related to intended use, misuse , or 
abuse of the product. Reporting must be done as soon as possible (within 48 hours).  
10.8.[ADDRESS_432960] be filled in for each sign or symptom.  Adverse events will be reported to 
the local IRB  as required by [CONTACT_348509]’s delegated monitor.  
Persistent AEs will be recorded  once until they are resolved or if a new event must be documented 
due to deterioration. These AEs will be carefully monitored; further details of monitoring of 
persistent AEs will be provi ded in the monitoring plan. If an AE is still not resolved at the end of 
the investigation, this will be documented as ongoing.  
For recurrent AEs (i.e., AEs of the same nature, but with a different date of onset), an individual 
AE form must be completed fo r each of them.  
Adverse events occurring after the termination of the investigation individually and/or of the 
investigation in total are to be reported to the Sponsor even after the clinical investigation has 
been finished if, in the judgment of the Inves tigator, there is an association between the event 
and the previous use of the Device under investigation.  
10.8.3  Anticipated/Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
All relevant observations, including records concerning adverse device effects (whether 
anticipated or unanticipated) will be recorded of each subject's study record , per 21 C FR 812.140  
or relevant national regulation . 
The site i nvestigator will notify the Sponsor or designe e and reviewing IRB  in writing (e.g., 
facsimile) immediately, but no later than [ADDRESS_432961].  
11.0 EARLY TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION  
11.1 Study Closure, Early Termination or Suspension Criteria  
Study closure is defined as closure of a clinical study that occurs when GN Hearing A/S  and/or 
regulatory requirements have been satisfied per the protocol and/or by a decision by  [CONTACT_348491] 
A/S or regulatory authority, whichever occurs first.  Study Closure is a process initiated by 
[CONTACT_348510]. The study  closure process is complete upon 
distribution of the Final Report or after final payments , whichever occurs last.  
The study may be terminated early if the Sponsor determines that unanticipated adverse event(s) 
presents an unreasonable risk to subjects or for any other reason as Sponsor determines to be 
appropriate.  Termination shall occur no later than  five (5) working days after the sponsor makes 
the determination and no later than fifteen ( 15) working days after Sponsor first received notice  
of the effect.  
The Sponsor will promptly notify the Investigators of any determination to terminate the study 
outside of the protocol timeframe. The Sponsor will provide each Investigator with written 
guidelines/instructions on termination processes and t imelines. The Investigator is responsible for 
reporting the early termination to their local IRB. 
Possible reasons for considering study suspension or termination of the study for all centers 
include but are not limited to AEs and device deficiencies assoc iated with the system or product 
under investigation which might endanger the safety or welfare of subjects; observed/suspected 
      GN Hearing A/S

agreement to participate in the study requires the participant’s informed consent prior to continued 
participation in the study.  
12.5 Informed Consent and Privacy Requirements  
12.5.1  Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process that is init iated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be 
IRB/IEC -approved , and the subject will  be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject and  answer any questions that may 
arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participant’s comprehension of 
the purposes, pr ocedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research subjects .  
Subjects  will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions 
prior to signing. The subjects  should have the opportunity to discuss th e study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The subject will  sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. Subjects  must 
be informed that participation is v oluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, 
without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects  for their 
records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source 
document , including the date, and the form provided, before the subject undergoes  any study -
specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the subjects  will be protected by [CONTACT_348513] i f they decline to 
participate in this study.  
The informed consent forms (ICFs) will describe in detail the study intervention, study procedures, 
and risks are given to the participant , and written documentation of informed consent is required 
prior to the study start.   
The site i nvestigator or authorized designee must administer the approved ICF to each 
prospective study  patient without coercion or undue improper influence on, or inducement of, the 
patient to participate. During the consent discussion the site investigator (or designee) must fully 
inform the patient of all pertinent aspects of the study , using native non -technical language that 
is understandable to the patient. The subject must be informed about their right to withdraw from 
the study  at any  time and for any reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the 
subject is otherwise entitled and also informed that withdrawal from the study  will not jeopardize 
their future medical care. The subject must  also be informed that by [CONTACT_348514] , 
they are not waiving their legal rights. The patient must have ample time and opportunity to inquire 
about details of the study , and to decide whether or not to participate in the clinical study . All 
questions about the study  shoul d be answered to the satisfaction of the participant . All items 
discussed in the ICF must be explained.  
The ICF should be revised whenever there are changes to procedures outlined in the informed 
consent or when new information becomes available that may a ffect the willingness of the subject 
to participate. For any updated or revised ICFs, the medical file for each subject should  document 
the informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained for the 
updated/ revised ICF for continued pa rticipation in the study.

13.0 DATA AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
This study will be performed by  [CONTACT_78143] , Sertoma Speech and Hearing Center,  
and Vanderbilt University  with guidance, input, review , and approval of GN Hearing A/S , including 
development of materials, recruitment, training and management of the site, electronic data 
capture and data management.  
13.[ADDRESS_432968] out of range or anomalous data.  
The following practices are adopted to  ensure data integrity and participant safety :   
1. Data , including outcomes data,  should not be shared with GN Hearing A/S until study 
completion.   There are two components to this study: (1) in -lab session (Visit 1); and wear -
time crossover trial  (Visits 2 and 3).  Outcome data can be shared with GN Hearing A/S 
at the completion of each component to this study.  That is, the results from  Visit 1 can be 
shared with the sponsor as soon as they are available and prior to the completion of the 
entire study.  
2. The site investigator s should be blinded from the raw data and the research staff on site 
should enter the data into an electronic databa se (REDCap) . Weekly reports of completed 
data for each visit will be generated by [CONTACT_348516] . Progress reports , generated by [CONTACT_348517],  will tabulate the number of subjects 
who have complete data for Visit  1, Visit 2, and Visit 3 , for each site separately and 
combined . Such progress reports will be provided via email to GN  Hearing A/S  (Troels 
Vingborg and Todd Fortune) and shared with the site investigator s (Ricketts, Dhar) on a 
weekly basis .  
3. Larry Humes  will monitor the quality of the data exported from  REDCap.   PRO -FIT REAG 
values will be checked to determine that they are reasonable, within [ADDRESS_432969] will also be examined to assess data 
validity. Such differences should generally be less than 5 dB at a given frequency and also 
should not decrease with increasing frequency.   Concerns about the quality of data being 
gathered will be shared with each site investigator and GN Hearing A/S as soon as 
possible.  
4. Trained research staff at each site should report any concerns about the quality or validity 
of the raw data being obtained to the local site investigato r immediately and this feedback 
should be shared among the two site investigators and  Larry Humes immediately to 
determine if protocol amendments are warranted to address these concerns.  
5. At study completion at each site, Larry Humes will be primarily resp onsible for data 
reduction and analyses with drafts shared with GN Hearing A/S and that site’s PI.   When 
both sites have completed data collection, Larry Humes will complete the data reduction 
and analyses, draft a report, and share this report with both s ite PIs and GN  Hearing A/S .   
7. Any adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_348518] A/S  and the FDA  as well . See Section 10.[ADDRESS_432970] De -Identification  
At the end of the study, all study databases will be de -identified and archived at the designated 
data coordinating center.  
Data collected for this study will be analyzed and stored at the data coordinating center . After the 
study is completed, the de -identified, archived data will be transmitted to and stored at the  
designated data repository , for use by [CONTACT_21227]. 
Permission to transmit data to the data repository  will be included in the informed consent.  
When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will b e provided through the  
data repository . 
13.[ADDRESS_432971] retention will be defined by [CONTACT_348519],  Northwestern 
Universit y, and Sertoma Speech and Hearing Center .

16.0 ADDITIONAL STUDY MATERIALS  
ATTACHMENT A :  See attached clinical study  user’s manual for Jabra Enhance Plus  
 
ATTACHMENT B :  Real -ear measurement details   
 
A. SELF -FIT A & B : Personalization begins with an estimate of hearing acuity obtained through 
the Jabra Enhance Plus . The hearing acuity measurements are used internally by [CONTACT_348521]. Once this step has been completed, devices will apply NAL -NL2 gain 
prescriptions directly using the estimated hearing acuity to generate the initial fit.  For the clinical 
validation study, p robe-tube microphone measures of the REUR and REAR (REAG=REAR  in input ) will 
be obtained on the initial fit for a 65 -dB speech input using the Audioscan Verifit real -ear measurement 
system , with instructions as follows:  
 
i. Use the Audioscan Verifit (see procedure b elow) to measure Real Ear Aided Response  
(REA R) using the GN -supplied dome/probe tube assembly . 
ii. Without adjusting the gain, determine how close the [ADDRESS_432973] should include a . html or .csv file with frequency -
specific values that can be used for plotting and analyzing the results.  
 
B. PRO -FIT: Audiometric thresholds will be imported , and the devices programmed using  custom 
device programming software  (AlgoLabTest) and configured for NAL -NL2 target gains. Probe -tube 
microphone measures of the REUR and REAR (REAG=REAR -REUR) will be obtained for a 65 -dB 
speech input using the Audioscan Verifit real -ear measurement syste m, with instructions as follows:   
 
i. Use the Audioscan Verifit (see procedure below) to measure Real Ear Aided Response  
(REA R) using the GN -supplied dome/probe tube assembly . 
ii. Using AlgoLabTest  to adjust the gain, attempt to match the [ADDRESS_432974] should include a . html or .csv  file with frequency -
specific values that can be used for plotting and analyzing the results.

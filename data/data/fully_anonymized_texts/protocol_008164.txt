I. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  IMplementation of a randomized controlled trial to im Prove 
treatment with oral AntiCoagulan Ts in patients with Atrial 
Fibrillation (IMPACT -AFib)  
Research Hypothesis:  Education on stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) among AF 
patients and their providers can result in increased use of oral 
anticoagulants (OAC) for stroke prevention among those AF 
patients with guideline -based indications for oral anticoagulatio n 
(CHA 2DS2-VASc  score of 2 or greater)  
Study Schema and Length of 
Trial:  Early patient and provider* education interventions versus usual 
care (with delayed provider* education intervention at the date on 
which at least 80% of eligible study participants have at least 12 
months of follow -up time ). Duration of follow -up for the primary 
outcome (OAC treatment) will be from the date that the  early 
intervention  materials are mailed through the date on w hich at 
least 80% of eligible study participants have at least 12 months of 
follow -up time ; secondary outcomes will also be evaluated at this 
time.  
Study Objectives:  Primary:  evaluate the effect of the patient and provider education 
interventions (versus usual care with delayed provider education 
intervention) on the proportion of patients with evidence of at 
least one OAC prescription fill (defined as one OAC dispensing or 4 
INR tests) over the course of the follow -up through the date on 
which at least 80 % of eligible study participants have at least 12 
months  of follow -up time .  
Secondary:  evaluate the impact on outcomes o f the patient and 
provider education interventions over the course of the follow -up 
through the date on which at least 80% of eligible study 
participants have at least 12 months of follow -up time : 
1. Incident r ate of stroke  or transient ischemic attack (TIA) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
2. Incident r ate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745390]  
3. Time to first OAC prescription fil l  
4. Proportion of days covered by [CONTACT_745405]  
5. Proportion of patients actively on OAC at 12 months of 
follow -up

Exploratory:  
10. Evaluate the effect of the education interventions on the 
primary and secondary endpoints over the course of the 
follow -up through the date on which at least 80% of 
eligib le study participants have at least 24 months of 
follow -up time .  
11. Explore  the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) 
and the FDA supported Sentinel Data Partner s’ ability to 
successfully conduct a pragmatic trial to answer important 
questions to improve public health  
Study Design:  Prospective, randomized, open -label education intervention trial. 
Patients with AF and a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to (a) the  early  intervention arm: early 
patient and provider educational interventions for those patients 
identified at the time of randomization and (b) the delayed 
intervention arm: usual care followed by [CONTACT_745406] [ADDRESS_1019516] 80% of early intervention 
mailing ha s occurred  (eligibility status of these patients will be 
assessed  at time of delayed mailing ). All inclusion criteria, exclusion 
criteria, and outcomes will be determined through claims data . The 
primary outcome is the proportion of AF patients with evidence of 
at least one OAC prescription fill over the course of the follow -up 
through the date on which at least 80% of eligible study 
participants have at least [ADDRESS_1019517] 80% of eligible early 
intervention  participants were mailed the early intervention 
materials . The randomization will be performed by [CONTACT_745407] (Harvard Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41282]), and statistical analyses will 
be performed by [CONTACT_252724] . A second 
exploratory assessment of the primary and secondary endpoints 
will be performed once  at least 80% of participants have at least [ADDRESS_1019518] 80% of people, there will be more than 
12 or 24 months of follow -up for over 80% of people . All possible 
person -time will be used to assess participants’ outcomes (patients 
will have different duration of follow -up). 
Accrual Goal (Total number of 
participants):  Approximately 80,000 patients across all participating Data 
Partner s (Aetna, Harvard Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41282], HealthCore, Humana, and 
Optum)  
Accrual Rate (Number of 
participants expected per 
month):  All patients and provide rs will be randomized prior to the initiation 
of the early intervention . The enrollment date for all patients (early 
and delayed intervention patients) will be the date that the letters 
are mailed out to early intervention patients and providers by [CONTACT_745408].  
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Two  or more diagnoses of AF (ICD -9 and/or ICD -10 codes) 
at least one day apart and with at least one diagnosis 
within the last [ADDRESS_1019519] date in the current 
approved  data used for cohort identification  
Exclusion Criteria:  1. Evidence of OAC medication fill during the 12 months prior 
to randomization (determined at randomization for the 
early intervention cohort and [ADDRESS_1019520] -
randomization for the delayed intervention cohort)  
2. Conditions other than AF that require anticoagulation, 
including treatment of deep venous thrombosis, 
pulmonary embolism, or ever having had a mechanical 
prosthetic heart valve prior to the last date in the current 
approved data used f or cohort identification  
3. Pregnancy within [ADDRESS_1019521] use (i.e. clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], 
prasugrel, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], or ticagrelor ) within [ADDRESS_1019522] date in the current approved data used for cohort 
identification  
Criteria for Evaluation 
(Effectiveness, safety, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37626], etc.):  The primary outcome is evidence of at least one OAC prescription 
fill through the date on which at least 80% of e ligible study 
participants have at least [ADDRESS_1019523] -AFib  
Patient -Level Interventions 
(early intervention arm):  • Letters to patients that (1) explain to the patient that he or 
she appears to have AF, characterize the risk of stroke, and 
emphasize that although there may be a medical reason, 
the patient does not seem to be on an anticoagulant and 
(2) encourage the pat ient to discuss this with his or her 
provider to ask if he or she might benefit from OAC therapy 
to prevent stroke  
• Written education materials  
• Website with the patient -focused information contained in 
the letters to patients  
Provider -Level Interventions 
(early intervention and 
delayed intervention arms):  • Letters to providers:  
o Early intervention letters to providers that explain 
this project, the nature of the problem, and 
identify a list of the provider’s patients who have 
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as the provider and patient letters 
will be sent at approximately the same time; 
describe evidence and guidelines regarding oral 
anticoagulation  
o Delayed intervention letters to providers that 
explain this project, the nature of the problem, and 
identify a list of the prov ider’s patients who are at 
risk for stroke and have not been treated with an 
oral anticoagulant; describe evidence and 
guidelines regarding oral anticoagulation  
• Response mailer that gives the provider the opportunity to 
share the rationale for his or her patient(s) not being on 
OAC  
• Web portal with access to clinical practice guidelines, 
decision support tools including from professional 
societies, podcasts, and case studies targeted at improving 
the appropriate use of OAC for AF  
• Information sheet describin g top misperceptions of 
barriers to OAC use  
o Misperception of benefit and risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: it is 
neither safe nor effective  
o Misperception around risk of resuming OAC 
(months) after bleeding  
o Misperception regarding risk of OAC regarding 
patients who fall  
o Opportunities with novel OACs (NOACs) for 
patients who have not tolerated warfarin  
o Concern about lack of an antidote for the NOACs  
Statistics and Power 
Calculations:  Primary outcome: proportion of AF patients with evidence of at 
least one OAC prescription  fill through the date on which at least 
80% of eligible study participants have at least 12 months  of 
follow -up time  
Sample size and power determination assumptions:  
 
FDA-Catalyst Protocol  - [ADDRESS_1019524] -AFib  
• 33% OAC initiation rate in the delayed intervention arm 
over the first year of the study  
• 38% OAC initiation rate in the early intervention arm (a 5% 
improvement in OAC initiation  over the 33% OAC initiation 
expected  in the delayed intervention arm over  1-year  
follow -up) 
• 1-year attrition rate: 30% dropout or lost -to-follow -up 
• Two -sided type I e rror of 0.05  
• Roughly 10,000  patients will yield more than 99% power  to 
detect a 5% absolute difference  
Secondary outcome:  stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) over 
the course of the follow -up through the date on which at least 80% 
of eligible study participants have at least [ADDRESS_1019525] a reduction in stroke or TIA under assumptions 
listed below:  
• 1-year stroke or TI A rate: 18% among patients not treated 
with OAC  
• 1-year stroke or TIA rate: 7% among patients treated with 
at least 1 OAC fill  
• Duration of follow -up: 1 year  
• 33% of delayed intervention patients will have at least 1 fill 
of OAC, meaning the  1 year stroke or  TIA rate in the 
delayed intervention group would be  14.4%  
• If 38% of early intervention patients have at least 1 fill of 
OAC (meaning the 1 year stroke or TIA rate in the early 
intervention group would be 13.82%, i.e., an absolute 
reduction of 0.55%), the study will have 46% power to 
detect this 0.55% reduction. H owever, if 40.5% of early 
intervention patients have at least 1 fill of OAC (meaning 
the 1 year stroke or TIA rate in the early intervention group 
would be 13.54%, i.e., an absolute reduction of 0.83%),  the 
study will have 80% power to detect this 0.83% reduction.  
• 1-year attrition rate: 30% dropout or lost -to-follow -up 
• Two -sided type I error of 0.05  
• The sample size has 80% power to detect a 0.5% absolute 
reduction in stroke, assuming a cumulative 1 -year 
incidence of stroke of 4.2% in control (delayed inte rvention 
arm) patients and 3.7% in intervention (early intervention 
arm) patients. The assumption is that patients not on oral 
anticoagulation have an annual stroke rate of 5%, and 
stroke will be reduced by 50% (HR=0.5) in the treated 
(anticoagulated) popu lation. The 80% power requires that 
52% of early intervention arm patients are treated at 1 -
year as compared to 33% in the control arm .

II. INTRODUCTION  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia seen in clinical practice , account ing for one -third 
of rhythm -related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] .1 The prevalence of AF in the [LOCATION_002] is 1% overall and more 
than 10% in people over age 80 years, with approximately 70% of cases in patients between 65 and 85 
years of age .2 As America ns age, the number of patients with AF is expected to increase 150% by 2050, 
with more than 50% of patients being octogenarians or older .3-[ADDRESS_1019527] a five to seven fold greater risk of stroke 
than the general population .9-11 The incidence of stroke in AF patients is 4 to 5% per year .[ADDRESS_1019528] worse prognos es than patients with stroke without AF .13,14 Oral anticoagulants 
(OACs) are an important  therapy for patients with AF  as they decrease  the rate of stroke by [CONTACT_745409]-thirds .15 
The clinical benefit of warfarin is only seen in patients who consistently maintain their international 
normalized ratio (INR) values within the therapeutic range (2.0 -3.0).16 The median times in the 
therapeutic range in the ARISTOTLE17, ROCKET AF18, RE-LY19, and ENGAGE20 trials were 62%, 55%, 64%, 
and 68%, respecti vely. As part of quality improvement efforts, there is significant interest in measuring 
and improving performance of physicians in prescribing anticoagulation for patients with AF. The 
CHADS [ADDRESS_1019529] that physicians and patients are concerned about the risk of bleeding in higher -risk populations, and 
they may underappreciate the net benefit  from anticoagulants , including stroke prevention . In any case, 
approximately 40 -60% of patie nts with AF at risk of stroke are not prescribed anticoagulation 
therapy .15,24 -30 This translates to over 50,000 preventable strokes each year in the [LOCATION_002]  with a 
number needed to treat of approximately 25 patients to prevent 1 stroke .  
The s pecific reasons for not using an anticoagulant in eligible AF patients  are poorly defined . The 
AVERROES trial provided some insight into reasons for patients deemed “unsuitable for warfarin” with 
42% unable to maintain therapeutic INR, 43% unlikely to moni tor INR, and 37% refusing warfarin .31 The 
reasons for underuse of oral anticoagulation are likely related to three types of barriers: patient -level 
barriers  (i.e. overestimation of risk of bleeding, underestimation of risk of stroke, misperceptions of 
adverse events from OACs) , provider -level barriers  (i.e. overestimation of risk of bleeding, 
underestimation of risk of stroke, misperceptions of adverse events from OACs, misperceptions about a 
patient’s fall risk, misperceptions of the benefits of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_68326]) , and system -level 
barriers  (i.e. lack of time in a clinic visit to discuss stroke prevention, access to care such as an 
anticoagulation clinic, cost of OACs, feasibility of warfarin monitoring) . 
Another  issue driving under -treatment with oral anticoagulants is poor medicati on adherence , which 
may be driven by [CONTACT_745410] -level barriers. Medication non -adherence is defined as a 
patient’s passive failure to follow a prescribed drug regimen . An average of 50% of patients are non -
adherent to their prescribed treat ment regimens for chronic diseases, such as AF.[ADDRESS_1019530] to the health care system of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745394] -adherence  for all disease 
states  may be as high as  approximately $ [ADDRESS_1019531] one year, an education intervention at the patient -level and the provider -
level will increase the proportion of patients started on OAC for stroke prevention.  
IV. STUDY RATIONALE  
Preliminary data from three Sentinel Data Partners between 1/1/2006 and 6/30/2015, identified 
231,696 patients (1.4%) with at least 2 diagnoses of AF (ICD-9 codes of 427.31 or 427.32 ) over the study 
period,  among 16.2 million covered lives. Within the 231,696 AF patients, there were 201,882 w ith a 
CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater  (based on administrative claims data in the Sentinel Distributed 
Database) , which is an A merican Heart Association (A HA)/American College of Cardiology ( ACC) 
guideline indication for OAC . Over the study period  from 2006 through 2015,  52% (n=105,256) patients 
filled  at least one prescription for anticoagulation, meaning that 48% of patients with CHA 2DS2-VASc 
score of [ADDRESS_1019532] the potential for develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_14632] a health plan ( Data Partner ) 
based  education intervention to improve the quality of care.  
V. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
A. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of the patient and provider education interventions 
(versus usual care with delayed provider education intervention) on the proportion of patients with 
evidence of at least one OAC prescription fill (defined as one OAC dispensing or 4 INR tests) over the 
course of the follow -up through the date on which at least 80% of eligible study participants have at 
least [ADDRESS_1019533] 80% of eligible study 
participants have  at least  12 months of follow -up time : 
1. Incident rate  of stroke  or transient ischemic attack (TIA) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
2. Incident rate  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745390]  
3. Time to first OAC prescription fill  
4. Proportion of days covered by [CONTACT_745405]  
5. Proportion of patients actively on OAC at 12 months of follow -up  
6. Incident r ate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745395]  
7. All-cause in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745392]  
8. All-cause mortality rates among patients with accurate out -of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745393] (such as 
Medicare Advantage patients)  
9. Health care utilization for AF patients, which would be reported as counts of number of health 
care utilization events (outpatient visits, da ys hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], number of emergency department 
visits, etc.)  
C. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIV ES 
The exploratory objectives are to:  
1. Evaluate the effect of the early and delayed education interventions on primary and secondary 
endpoints over the course of the follow -up through the date on which  at least 80% of eligible 
study participants have at least  24 months of follow -up time . 
2. Explore  the CTTI and the FDA supported Sentinel Data Partner ship’s ability to successfully 
conduct a pragmatic trial to answer important questions to improve public health.  
VI. STUDY DESIGN AND DUR ATION  
The study is a prospective, randomized, and open -label education intervention trial. Patients with AF 
and a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1019534] 4 INR tests in the claims data .1 The 
claims records of the patients ra ndomized to the early intervention cohort will then be linked to “fresh” 
(i.e. about 1 -4 month s old) pharmacy claims data at the time of randomization . Patients without 
evidence of an OAC medication fill during the 12 months prior to randomization will be included in the 
patient -level and provider -level early educational intervention  (patients randomized to this early 
intervention with evidence of an OAC medication fill during the 12 months prior to randomization will 
be excluded from the trial .). In additi on to usual care, these patients and their providers2 will receive a 
                                                             
 
1Not all OAC dispensings are well captured in pharmacy claims, particularly, for warfarin. INR tests are assumed 
indicative of OAC fills that w ere not billed through the claims . [ADDRESS_1019535] sites due to the practical challenges of claims data: the patients are assig ned to wave 1 if they ha ve 
a provider easily identified in the data (i.e., the provider associated with the most recent AF diagnosis is 
an individual provider), and they are assigned to wave 2 if it is difficult to identify a provider (e.g., the 
first iden tified provider is a facility). F ollow -up time will start  on the date of the respective wave [ADDRESS_1019536] 80% of eligible study participants have at least 12 months of follow -up time , “fresh” 
pharmacy claims data for the delayed intervention cohort that was generated and locked at the time of 
randomization will be used to assess trial eligibility, and those patients without evidence of an OAC 
medication fill during the [ADDRESS_1019537] 80% of eligible study participants have  at 
least  12 months of follow -up time  in the early versus the delayed intervention arm. A total of 
approximately 80,000  patients (randomized 1:1) across all participating Data Pa rtner s (Aetna, Harvard 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41282], HealthCore, Humana, and Optum)  will be enrolled from participating Data Partners across the 
[LOCATION_002]. Similar to the early intervention cohort, the patients in the delayed intervention cohort 
will be assigned to wave [ADDRESS_1019538] 2 (“pseudo” wave assignments) depending on the difficulty in 
identifying the patient’s provider  (the intent is to handle them the same way as was done for the early 
intervention arm ). The follow -up for the delayed intervention patients will start on the date the wave [ADDRESS_1019539] for a given Data Partner ’s early intervention cohort.  The follow -up time for the 
primary outcome will be [ADDRESS_1019540] 80% of eligible stud y participates are 
enroll ed (date on which early intervention materials are mailed) .  
The providers of p atients in the delayed cohort who did not receive OAC medication during  the course 
of the 12 -month study period  and meet our inclusion criteria will receive the delayed intervention:  the 
provider -only education  intervention , a one -time mailing  administered [ADDRESS_1019541] 80% of 
early intervention mailing have occurred  (patients will not receive any educational materials  unless no 
provider can be identified for a mailing ). We intend to assess the primary and secondary endpoints again 
once  at least 80% of patients have at least [ADDRESS_1019542] 80% of people, there will 
be more than 12 or 24 months of follow -up for over 80% of people.  All participants’ outcomes will be 
assessed using all possible person -time ; patients will have differe nt duration of follow -up and that will 
be accounted for in the analyses .

VII. STUDY POPULATION  
All inclusion and exclusion criteria will  be determined by [CONTACT_745411] . For entry into the study, the 
following criteria will be met:  
A. INCLUSION CRITERIA  
1. Two  or more diagnoses of AF (ICD -9 and/or ICD -10 codes) at least one day apart and with at 
least one diagnosis within the last [ADDRESS_1019545] -AFib  
B. EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
1. Evidence of OAC medication fill (defined as 1 OAC dispensing or 4 INR tests) during the 12 
months prior to randomization (determined at randomization for the early intervention cohort 
and [ADDRESS_1019546] -randomization for the delayed intervention cohort)  
2. Conditions other than AF that require anticoagulation, including treatment of deep venous 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or ever having had a mechanical prosthetic heart valve prior 
to the last date in the current approved data used for cohort identification  
3. Pregnancy within [ADDRESS_1019547] use (i.e. clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], prasugrel, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], o r ticagrelor 
within [ADDRESS_1019548] for inclusion and exclusion criteria is accessible on the Sentinel website  
(https://www.sentinelinitiative.org/FDA -catalyst/projects/implementation -randomized -controlled -trial-
improve -treatment -oral-anticoagulants -patients ). 
VIII. INTERVENTIONS  
A. PATIENT -LEVEL INTERV ENTIONS (EARLY INTER VENTION ARM)  
• Letters to patients that (1) explain to the patient that he or she appears to have AF, characterize 
the risk of stroke, and emphasize t hat although there may be a medical reason, the patient does 
not seem to be on an anticoagulant and (2) encourage the patient to discuss this with his or her 
provider to ask if he or she might benefit from OAC therapy to prevent stroke.  
• Written education materials  about AF  and anticoagulants, including answers to commonly  asked 
questions  
• Website with the patient -focused information contained in the letters to patients  
B. PROVIDER -LEVEL INTER VENTIONS (EARLY INTE RVENTION AND DELAYED  INTERVENTION 
ARM)  
• Letters to  providers:  
o Early intervention letters to providers that explain this project, the nature of the 
problem, and identify a list of the provider’s patients who have been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as the 
provider and patient letters will be sent at approximately the same tim e; describe 
evidence and guidelines regarding oral anticoagulation  
o Delayed intervention letters to providers that explain this project, the nature of the 
problem, and identify a list of the provider’s patients who are at risk for stroke and have 
not been treated with an oral anticoagulant; describe evidence and guidelines regarding 
oral anticoagulation  
• Response mailer that gives the provider the opportunity to share the rationale for his or her 
patient(s) not being on OAC  
 
FDA-Catalyst Protocol  - [ADDRESS_1019549] -AFib  
• Web portal with access to clinical  practice guidelines, decision support tools including from 
professional societies, podcasts, and case studies targeted at improving the appropriate use of 
OAC for AF  
• Information sheet describing  top misperceptions of barriers to OAC use  
1. Misperception of b enefit and risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: it is neither safe nor effective  
2. Misperception around risk of resuming OAC (months) after bleeding  
3. Misperception around risk of OAC regarding patients who fall  
4. Opportunities with NOACs for patients who have not tolerated warfar in 
5. Concern about lack of an antidote for the NOACs  
IX. METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO AN INTER VENTION  
An electronic program, developed by [CONTACT_745412] (Harvard Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41282]), will be used by 
[CONTACT_745413] -patients who meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for this trial . The patient billing claims records will not be linked to pharmacy data until 
after randomization, so the inclusion criteri on of no OAC medication fill during the [ADDRESS_1019550] 80% of 
early intervention mailing have occurred . Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_1019551] of eligible member -patients will stay at each Data Partner, and identifiable patient -
level data will not be shared with the central coordinating center (Harvard Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41282]) or the statistical 
analysis center (Duke Clinical Research Institute) . The Data Partners will remove any individuals who 
cannot be included in research studies, wh ich includes certain Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services and Administrative Services Only  patients . There are several other reasons that could prevent 
mailing of the intervention , to members  and/or their providers  (list may not be exhaustive) : 
• Membe r is now deceased  
• Member disenrolls from health plan  
• Member transitions to a plan that does not allow for inclusion in research  
• Member has a recent anticoagulant dispensing  
• Member has an incorrect/missing/bad address  
• Member is added to a do -not-contact [CONTACT_745414]’s most recent encounter with 
an AF diagnosis as of the last date in the current approved data used for cohort identification . When the 
identified provider is  an individual,  this provider will receive the provider intervention materials . When 
the identified provider is a facility, Data Partner s will select an alternate provider or conduct a member 
only mailing based on their health plan policies and the decisio n of the health plan’s leadership . An 
alternative provider may be a patient’s PCP or other recent clinician who provided care. At least one 
health plan intends to mail letters to the member  only when an individual provider is not identified with 
the most r ecent AF diagnosis given the large volume of members . 
 
As with the member -patient list, the provider list will be kept by [CONTACT_745415], as 
each Data Partner  will be mailing the intervention materials to their respective patients and pro viders.  
 
FDA-Catalyst Protocol  - [ADDRESS_1019552] -AFib  
X. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
This study will be conducted, where appropriate, in accordance with good research practice as outlined 
by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP) and the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and in 
accordance with the ethical  principles underlying the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations, 
Title  21, Part  50 (21CFR50) . The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol  
and any amendments will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Commi ttee (IRB/IEC) 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_8594] . Study personnel involved in conducting this 
study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and experience to perform their respective tasks . This 
study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there 
has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., loss of medical licensure; debarment).  
Insurance companies do not ordinarily identify their members wit h AF who might be appropriate 
candidates for OACs , and they perform no standard outreach to either clinicians or members regarding 
treatment of AF. Individuals who are identified for this trial will have had their health care providers bill 
under the diagn osis code of AF at least twice , with at least one billed diagnosis within the last [ADDRESS_1019553] -AFib trial are insurers  (or 
affiliates of insurers ), not care providers, and the clinicians are not employees of the Data Partner s.  
There is no current evidence that the communications by [CONTACT_427646] (like those being assessed in this trial) 
will have any effect on use of anticoagulation . All eligible patie nts included in the trial  who do not 
appear to fill an  OAC  prescription  will receive an intervention, as they will either be in the early 
intervention or the delayed intervention cohort.  
XI. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD/INDEPENDENT E THICS COMMITTEE  
Before study initiation, the co-principal investigator s must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC for the protocol, and any other written information to be provided to 
prospective participants.  
The investigator s should provide the IRB/IEC  with reports, updates, and other information (e.g., 
expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory requirements 
or institution procedures.  
XII. INFORMED CONSENT  
Consent will be waived. The reasons for the waiver inclu de:  
1. The contact[CONTACT_745416].  
2. The intervention is entirely consistent with a quality improvement initiative that the health 
plans could ini tiate on their own. Thus, the intervention is very low risk for harm.  
3. The intervention only adds on to the existing care of and programs for patients. There are no 
restrictions placed on the delayed intervention group, as a result of the trial.  
4. It would b e impractical to collect informed consent on the patients included in this trial.

XIII. INDEPEND ENT ADVISORY COMMITT EE 
An independent advisory committee (IAC), consisting of members independent from the study team and 
with expertise in statistics, anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, engagement, health plan management, 
and/or in practical clinica l trials , will serve to enhance patient safety and trial integrity . The IAC will meet 
with study leadership at least twice. The first meeting will occur before intervention materials are 
mailed, and the second will take place two months after all mailings are sent. In addition, other 
meetings will occur if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_745417], study leads and/or the FDA.  The study team 
will provide the IAC with the study protocol before any intervention materials are mailed and will brief 
the IAC on any issues  (or lack thereof) that have been raised [ADDRESS_1019555] mailing has 
occurred . The IAC will advise on concerns that arise. An IAC charter describes the roles, responsibilities, 
and operations of the IAC.  
XIV. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
A. SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CALCULATIONS  
Our target sample size is 80,000  patients . All enrolled patients and/or their providers will be targeted by 
[CONTACT_478306] (early or delayed) provided they are eligible at time of mailing and able to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].   
1. Primary Endpoint  
The followin g assumptions were used to determine the sample size and power for the primary endpoint 
assessing the proportion of AF patients with evidence of at least one OAC prescription fill through the 
date on which at least 80% of eligible study participants have  at least  12 months of follow -up time : 
• 33% OAC initiation rate in the delayed intervention arm over the first year of the study  
o In a Sentinel feasibility assessment of identified health plan members meeting similar 
inclusion and exclusion criteria as this trial, 33% had evidence of OAC initiation  in a 1 
year period of follow -up. 
• 38% OAC initiation rate in the early intervention arm (a 5% absolute improvement in OAC 
initiation over the 33% OA initiation expected in the delayed intervention arm over  1-year  
follow-up) 
• 1-year attrition rate: 30% dropout or lost -to-follow -up 
• Two -sided type I error of 0.05  
• Roughly 10,000  patients (Table below) will yield more than 99% power  to detect a 5% absolute 
difference  
 
FDA-Catalyst Protocol  - [ADDRESS_1019556] -AFib  
 
Power  Total sample size (2 -arm)  Early Intervention  Delayed Intervention  
90%  5610  2805  2805  
95%  6910  3455  3455  
99%  [ADDRESS_1019557] 80% of eligible study participants have at 
least 12 months of follow -up time , under certain assumptions listed below:  
• 1-year stroke or TIA rate: 18% among patients not treated with OAC  
• 1-year stroke or TIA rate: 7% amon g patients treated with at least 1 OAC fill  
• Duration of follow -up: 1 year  
• 33% of delayed intervention patients will have at least 1 fill of OAC, meaning the  1 year stroke or 
TIA rate in the delayed intervention group would be  14.4%  
• If 38% of early interve ntion patients have at least 1 fill of OAC (meaning the 1 year stroke or TIA 
rate in the early intervention group would be 13.82%, i.e., an absolute reduction of 0.55%), the 
study will have 46% power to detect this 0.55% reduction. However, if 40.5% of ear ly 
intervention patients have at least 1 fill of OAC (meaning the 1 year stroke or TIA rate in the 
early intervention group would be 13.54%, i.e., an absolute reduction of 0.83%),  the study will 
have 80% power to detect this 0.83% reduction . 

 
FDA-Catalyst Protocol  - [ADDRESS_1019558] -AFib  
• 1-year attriti on rate: 30% dropout or lost -to-follow -up 
• Two -sided type I error of 0.05  
• The sample size has 80% power to detect a 0.5% absolute reduction in stroke, assuming a 
cumulative 1 -year incidence of stroke of 4.2% in control (delayed intervention arm) patients and 
3.7% in intervention (early intervention arm) patients. The assumption is that patients not on 
oral anticoagulation have an annual stroke rate of 5%, and stroke will be reduced by 50% 
(HR=0.5) in the treated (anticoagulated) population. The 80 % power requires that 52% of early 
intervention arm patients are treated at 1 -year as compared to 33% in the control arm . 
B. POPULATIONS FOR ANAL YSIS  
All analyses will be based on a modified intention -to-treat principl e (i.e., all identified early intervention 
patients who me et eligibility and are mailed the intervention will be included ; using “pseudo” wave 
assignments, all identified delayed intervention patients who meet eligibility at the time of 
corresponding early mailings will be includ ed in the analysis ). The primary endpoint will be calculated 
based on the proportion of patients with evidence of at least one OAC prescription fill over the course of 
the follow -up through the date on which at least 80% of eligible study participants have  at least 12 
months  of follow -up time . An as -randomized analysis will be performed for the primary endpoint as a 
sensitivity analysis.  All possible person -time will be used to assess participants’ outcomes ; patients will 
have different duration of follow -up and that will be accounted for in the analyses . Patients will be 
censored from the analysis at the time of death, disenrollment from the health plan, loss of medical or 
pharmacy coverage, or change in eligibility for inclusion in research based o n health plan membership . 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) provide d more information and outline s in detail how granular 
aggregate data will be received from each Data Partner in lieu of patient -level data.  
XV. OUTCOME DEFINITIONS  
All outcome definitions w ill be based on available claims data.  
1. Evidence of OAC start: the proportion of AF patients who have at least [ADDRESS_1019559] 80% of eligible 
study participants have at least 12 months  of follow -up time  
2. Time  to OAC start: the time to first OAC initiation, as defined by [CONTACT_745418][INVESTIGATOR_3822], 
dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxab an, or warfarin . If there was no prescription fill for these 
medications, but the patient had [ADDRESS_1019560] INR measurement will be used for initiation of OAC.  
3. OAC prescription coverage: the prop ortion of days that AF patients have OAC prescription fills 
over the duration of the study . The assumption is that a [ADDRESS_1019561] for the 
planned period, even in the case of warfarin, when the length of time that a prescription lasts 
may be less well defined . Patients will only be included in this secondary analysis, if they had a 
prescription fill for api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin.  
4. OAC rates at follow -up: proportion of patients with an active oral anticoagula nt dispensing at 
the end of the one -year follow -up. This will include patients with api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], dabigatran, 
edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin medication fills that encompass the end of the study period . 
If there was no prescription fill for these medication s, this will also include patients with [ADDRESS_1019562] -AFib  
more INR values measured over the study period, who had an INR value measured within 60 
days of the end of the approximately one-year follow -up. 
5. Rate of stroke or TIA: the incident rate of stroke or TIA related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; stroke, excluding 
transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), will also be assessed  
6. Rate of bleeding related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: the incident rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745396]  
7. Health care utilization: the total counts of health care utilizati on (number of outpatient visits, 
emergency department visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], etc.) for AF patients, including AF and non -AF 
related care  
8. In-patient all -cause mortality: patients with in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39473]  
9. All-cause mortality: in a subset of patients with  mortality status  
XVI. STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
A. DEMOGRAPHICS AND BAS ELINE CHARACTERISTIC S 
Baseline  characteristics of eligible early and delayed intervention cohorts will be based on the claims 
data at the time of randomization. Frequency distribution and summary s tatistics for demographic and 
baseline variables will be presented by [CONTACT_745419] , delayed intervention group,  and for the 
overall study population. Key demographic and baseline variables to be summarized include: geographic 
region, age, sex, risk factors for stroke, risk factors for bleeding,  and select  comorbid conditions.  
Continuous variables will be summarized as mean (±SD) and median (25th, 75th percentiles) ; the 
comparison between the two groups will be conducted using Wilcoxon rank -sum t est. For the 
continuous variables in combined study population, the mean will be summarized. Categorical variables 
will be presented as counts (percentages) and will be compared between groups by [CONTACT_717282]’s chi -
square or Fisher’s exact test, as approp riate.  
B. RESPONSES FROM PROVI DERS  
As part of the provider intervention materials, providers will have the opportunity to respond to the 
patient’s health plan and give an explanation for why their patients were not being treated with OAC via 
a postage paid po stcard. The data collected from these responses will be aggregated by [CONTACT_745420]-treatment and reported as counts (percentages) by [CONTACT_434].  Data will not be linked 
to specific patients or providers.  
C. EFFECTIVENESS ANALYS ES 
The proportion of patients with evidence of at least one OAC medication fill over the course of the 
follow -up, the primary endpoint, will be summarized and compared between the early intervention and 
delayed intervention arms. The definition for OAC medica tion fill will be an OAC medication billing in the 
pharmacy claims or at least 4 INR tests billed in the laboratory claims (indicative of OAC use that was not 
billed through the pharmacy claims data). To evaluate whether the comprehensive evaluation and 
customized multilevel (patient -level and provider -level) educational interventions increases the rate of 
use of oral anticoagulants at one year post intervention, we will evaluate the odds ratio (i.e. the odds of 
an average patient in the early intervention group taking OAC at 1 year compared to the odds of an 
average patient in the delayed intervention  group taking OAC at 1 year) using logistic regression to 
account for the effect of Data Ppartner and adjust for other potential baseline risk factors.[ADDRESS_1019563] -AFib  
present the odds ratio, 95% confidence interval , and p -value to show whether there is a difference in 
rate of use of OAC at one year post intervention between the  early  intervention and delayed 
intervention  groups . Similarly, we will analyze  the proportion of days covered with an OAC prescription 
fill over the course of the follow -up. Patients will only be included in this analysis, if they had a 
prescription fill for api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, or warfarin.  
Event rates for t he following secondary outcomes  will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] , as defined by 
[CONTACT_745411] : 
• Stroke or TIA  
• Ischemic stroke or unknown stroke  
• Hemorrhagic stroke  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745395]  
• Composite of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke  
• Composite of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745397] -to-event outcomes , Kaplan -Meier cumulative incidence estimates and log -rank test will be 
utilized.[ADDRESS_1019564] ratio, 95% confidence int erval and p -value will be presented to summarize the 
difference in the risk of clinical outcome between early intervention and delayed intervention group. In -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_745398].  Analyses will be  
performed using SAS software version 9. 4 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).  
More details on the statistical methods and analyses will be provided in the SAP . The SAP will be 
finalized prior to study database lock , [ADDRESS_1019565] 80% of the early intervention mailing s. Of 
note, all patient -level data will be maintained by [CONTACT_745421], so analyses are expected  to be 
conducted via a distributed SAS programming code developed by [CONTACT_745422], by [CONTACT_745423], in aggregate to the coordinating center. Analyses will be 
examined by [CONTACT_745424].  
XVII. DISSEMINATION PLAN O VERVIEW  
A manuscript describing the study design will be published. A manuscript will also be written describing 
the results on the primary and secondary endpoints based on the date on which at least 80% of eligible 
study participants have at least [ADDRESS_1019566] 80% of 
members have at least 24 months of follow -up time  (if 24-month aanalysis is conducted). Finally, Data 
Partner -specific results will be shared with each Data Partner at both  time points.

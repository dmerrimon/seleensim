Secondary stroke prevention by [CONTACT_501469]:  
the SUCCEED Trial  
O
bjectives  
The primary  objectives  of this study are as follows:  
(1)To develop a community -centered component  of a Chronic Care Model -based secondary strok e
pr
evention intervention.
(2)To test the impact of a sustainable Chronic Care Model -based intervention on control of systolic blo od
pr
essure (primary outcome), composite stroke risk, and each individual stroke risk factor (secondary
outcomes), among 500 adults (over 90% minority) recruited “early” - during o r shortly afte r
hos
pi[INVESTIGATOR_501448] - at one of the four Los Angeles County
safety net medical centers.
(3)To conduct a cost analysis of SUCCEED from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department
of Health Services, using intervention costs, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system
resources, and cost equivalents of observed and projected  vascular events.
D
esign and Outcomes  
The study design is a multi -center, randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to either a Care 
Management and Community Health Worker led intervention versus  Usual Care to improve management of 
stroke risk factors. The outcomes of this study will be assessed by a blinded Research Assistant. The total 
planned enrollment of this trail is [ADDRESS_645865], quality of life, adverse consequences, moderators, mediators, and a range of 
metrics of intervention program implementation and participation.

Interventions and Duration 
We will test the impact of this multi- level, multi- component intervention relative to usual care within the Los 
Angeles County public safety net healthcare system  to improve management of stroke risk factors and 
increase adoption of healthy lifestyle habits.  We will use culturally -adapted educational materials developed by 
  
[CONTACT_29436]-a cademic partnering teams in our Public Outreach and Dissemination Core.  The on study period 
is 12 months. Additional follow-u p off intervention will be every 6 months, up to 18 additional months during 
the period of center funding.  
Data sources include: 
•E
xamination s (Blood pressure, height and weight, waist and hip circumference, NIHSS for
stroke severity, Rankin for disability ): baseline, 3 months, and 12 months
•Fingerstick laboratory tests  (lipid profile, Hgb A1c, CRP ) baseline, 3 months, and 12 months
•Full s urvey : baseline, 3 months, 12 months
•Telephone survey: 8 months
•Telephone surveillance for vascular events and mortality: every 6 months, starting at 12 months,
continuing for duration of center funding
Queri

completed for LAC service and medication utilization. 
Sam
ple Size and Population  
The setting of this study is all four county hospi[INVESTIGATOR_501449] (LAC), which serves the largest, most ethnically diverse county in the [LOCATION_002].  This system, often called the Safety Net, serves more than 10 million residents and provides healthcare to 
700,000 people every year, and treats more than 300,000 emergency and trauma victims every year. Through 
an integrated network of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], health centers and clinics, the LA County Health Services System makes 
medical and preventive care services accessible in communities across the county. According to LAC 
administrative databases, more than 50% of patients use a language other than English as their primary 
language and 63% of outpatients are uninsured. 
A to
tal of 500 subjects with the onset of ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or transient ischemic 
attack (TIA) within the prior three months will be recruited from the following off -campus locations:  
•(1) Los Angeles County Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] + USC Medical Center (LAC+USC) ,
•(2) Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center (Rancho Los Amigos),
•(3) Olive View- UCLA, and
•(4) Harbor -UCLA Medical Center.
No subjects will be recruited at UCLA.  
Str
atification variables are as follows, with 24 strata:  
•Site (4 sites)
•Language (3: English, Spanish, other)
•Type of Stroke (2: ischemic/TIA, hemorrhagic)

1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1. Primary Objectives  
Primary Objective #1: To develop a community -centered component  of a Chronic Care Model -based 
secondary stroke prevention intervention. This new component includes community health workers  (CHWs) 
collaborating with healthcare system teams based at one of four Los Angeles County -Department of Health 
Services public “safety net” medical centers. CHWs - identified from the communities in which they serve - will 
receive specialized training and will conduct home visits to promote behavior change to address diet  and 
physical activity  risk factors, as well as assess for depression  and social isolation.  CHWs will use an existing, 
scalable mobile health platform specifically designed for care coordination and care teams to use by [CONTACT_501470], to assist patients in tracking selected clinical measures (blood pressure, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], weight/BMI, physical 
activity), to promote behavior change. CHWs will communicate and liaison with the healthcare provider team. The community -based  component will also include cultural - and stroke -specific adaptation of physical activity 
and self -management programs at local community venues
 including health education and senior centers.     
Hypothesis : We will develop a culturally -tailored intervention to improve stroke risk factor reduction.  
Primary Objective #2: To test the impact of a sustainable Chronic Care Model -based intervention on control 
of systolic blood pressure (primary outcome), composite stroke risk, and each individual strok e risk factor 
(secondary outcomes), among 500 adults (over 90% minority) recruited “early” - during or shortly after 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_501448] - at one of the four Los Angeles County safety net 
medical centers. We will co nduct a randomized trial of this intervention that includes the new, community -
centered component developed in aim #1, and a “re- engineered” healthcare delivery system with nurse 
practitioners or physician assistants as care managers, distribution of home blood pressure monitors, group 
clinics, and a care management software system tailored to secondary stroke prevention and interfaced with 
the mobile health platform used by [CONTACT_482234], relative to usual care.  We will include non-English speaking individuals  from Hispanic, Chinese, and Korean racial and ethnic groups, and a broad range of stroke severity.  
We will analyze potential moderators (age, gender, stroke type and severity, education, country of birth/primary 
language, diabetes comorbidity, care team composition) to understand robustness of intervention impacts 
across levels of individual and health system characteristics. We will conduct a formative evaluation to continuously improve implementation, and will measure and analyze extent of intervention implementation, as 
it is delivered for up to 12 months after stroke or TIA through transition of patients into primary care.  We will 
analyze potential mediators (life chaos, competing needs, medication adherence, knowledge of stroke risk 
factors, particip ation in self -management programs, social isolation, depression, health literacy, engagement 
with healthcare provider team, attitudes/health beliefs, self -efficacy, readiness to change, perceived risk, and 
perceptions of quality of interactions with provider) of the intervention’s impact, using both qualitative and quantitative methods.   
Hypothesis : Patients randomized to the SUCCEED intervention will achie ve 8mm greater  reduction in systolic 
blood pressure reduction and lower stroke risk scores at 1 year versus those randomized to usual care.  
Primary Objective #3:  
To conduct a cost analysis of SUCCEED from the perspective of the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, using intervention costs, cost equivalents of associated utilization of county system resources, 
and cost equivalents of observed and projected
 vascular events.  We will also develop a financial plan and 
proposal for sustainability  of the intervention if it is effective, incorporating data on cost and utilization, to 
describe potential financial arrangements or approaches – including reimbursement strategies - to support the 
intervention model in the f uture and in other settings.  We will also produce training materials and protocols for 
future dissemination.  
Hypothesis : If effective, the SUCCEED intervention will be sustainable because its community component was 
developed in partnership with the community and is culturally -appropriate, it will demonstrate a projected cost -
offset from future vascular events averted, and intervention tools and training programs will be codified.   
1.[ADDRESS_645866] predictor of a future stroke is a prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Although the risk of stroke can be substantially reduced through control of modifiable risk factors 
including hypertension, diet, physical activity, and smoking, a nd through optimal management of diabetes and 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_501450] a small 
proportion of stroke survivors, exposing hundreds of thousands of individuals each year to preventable d eath 
and disability from subsequent strokes. The situation is even more pressing among indigent, minority populations, in which knowledge about stroke is limited and barriers to accessing healthcare – transportation, 
healthcare- related costs, screening of phone communication due to concerns about immigration authorities,  
bill collectors, inability of healthcare providers to maintain current phone numbers due to patients use of prepaid phones that run out, beliefs about causes of stroke symptoms, unhealthy diets, lack of safe places to 
walk or local stores with fresh produce, homelessness, and many others - are formidable. Our group previously 
documented gaps in prevention care after stroke and analyzed barriers among the large, multi -ethnic indigent 
populat ion in Los Angeles County, where out of the entire county’s approximately 10 million residents spread 
over several thousand square miles, fewer than 30% are non- Hispanic whites.  
Bas
ed on International Classification Codes (ICD) codes generated from the Los Angeles county Department 
of Health Services (LAC -DHC) database, there are over 1000 admissions of stroke per year at the four County 
anchor hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  This eligible population is more than 20% greater than in SUSTAIN due to the inclusion of hemorrhagi c stroke.  The eligibility is further increased by [CONTACT_501471].

In addition to this eligible inpatient pool, outpatients who have had the onset of with a recent history of stroke or 
TIA are also eligible.  Rancho Los Amigos is implementing a medical home model for uninsured patients with a 
recent stroke, so patients who were admitted elsewhere for their stroke can be fast -tracked to receive post -
discharge follow -up care at Rancho Los Amigos.

Persons with language (aphasia) or cognitive difficulties are in eligible if they cannot  communicate that 
they understand the study during the informed consent process.   
4
.2.2 Clinical/laboratory indicators of current status, obtained within XX prior to randomization. List the 
specific tests to be performed and the narrowest acceptable range of laboratory values for exclusion, 
consistent for safety.   
Systolic Blood pressure > 120 mmHg

Not applicable  
4.2
.6 Specify any clinical (life expectancy, co- existing disease), demographic (age) or other characteristics 
that precludes appropriate diagnosis, treatment, or follow -up in the trail  
Young patients are excluded because the mechanism for their strokes is frequently not due to 
atherosclerosis (e.g. arterial dissections, congenital coagulation defects, etc), so the interventions in 
this proposal may not be as applic able to them.  We will also exclude persons who already meet the 
primary outcome of SBP <120 mm Hg.  We will not be able to translate written materials in languages 
other than English, Spanish, Korean, and Chinese. Patients who do not speak any of those la nguages 
will be excluded.  
4.2
.7 Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_91382], would interfere 
with adherence to the study requirements.  
If the participant exhibited active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_501454], that participant would be excluded from the study.   
4.2
.8 Serious illness (requiring systemic treatment and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) until subject either completes therapy or is clinically stable on therapy, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_91382], for at least XX prior to

unders tand the study during the informed consent process.   
4.[ADDRESS_645872]’s clinician need to obtain verbal permission from them before passing thei r name [CONTACT_1639] a member of the research team.   
In t
he inpatient setting, we have found that embedding the RA within the inpatient team during rounds 
fosters awareness about the study and prompts the study team during rounds to verbally ask patients 
for permis sion for the RA to meet the patient later.   
[ADDRESS_645873].   
4.3.2  Procedures (e.g., maintaining a screening log at each clinical site) for documenting how subjects 
learned about the trial, who referred them to the trial, reasons for ineligibility, and reasons for 
nonparticipation of eligible subjects.  
Please refer to section 4.3.[ADDRESS_645874] recruitment efforts is also provided.

.3.3 Consent (and assent) procedures  
Interaction between the RA and the potential research subject  
•Arranging initial meeting : When a clinician notifies the RA a face- to-face meeting will be arranged to
check whether the patient meets eligibility criteria for enrollment  and to describe elements require d
f
or informed consent .  The RA will read an IRB -approved script that further describes t he
S
UCCEED trial to the patient.
If
 a potential subject directly contacts the RA using the toll -free number, the RA will read the IRB -
approved script that further describes the SUCCEED trial to the patient.  If the potential subject is
interested, a face- to-face meeting will be scheduled.
•Setting: The consent process will take place in a private room .  If the meeting takes place in a
s
hared hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223], the research staff member will close the curtain when meeting with t he
par
ticipant.   The RA will describe the study.  RA will be bilingual in English or Spanish, but in th e
c
ase that a subject speaks a language other than English or Spanish, the research team will us e
v
olunteers fluent in the appropriate language to translate for the RA.
•Eligibility: If interested in continuing, the RA wil l ask potential subjects questions about age, an d
ons
et of stroke to confirm eligibility.  They will also take BP measurements.  Finally, they will ask
questions that require comprehending the basics details of the study.  If participants cannot
describe what is told to them, they will not be enrolled in SUCCEED.  For potential subjects found to
be ineligible, the reasons for ineligibility will be recorded.
•Voluntary consent: The RA will ensure that eligible subjects are given every opportunity ask
questi ons, and remind the patients that participation in SUCCEED is voluntary.  If interested, th e
pot
ential subject will sign the written consent form. Potential participants will have the opportunity t o
t
ake the consent document home and discuss participation with others before making a decision.
•Declining consent: If patients do not consent to the study, the RA will record the reason why th e
pat
ient did not consent. Further, the RA will ask permission to use the demographic information of
the patient to generate enrollment propensity weights.  Enrollment propensity weights will be us ed
t
o analyze how the tendency to participate in the RCT impacts attainment of outcomes.
•Storing consent forms.  The consent forms at each site will be stored in a locked  file cabinet within a
locked room.  Access is limited to the site’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_27235].
13 
For
 the baseline survey, the RA will enter the circumstances of the initial visit (inpatient/outpatient, 
whether clinical team called RA or subject, reasons for ineligibility, and reasons for nonparticipation).  
These data will be summarized in a monthly report by [CONTACT_501473].   
4.[ADDRESS_645875] begins, we will use computer -assisted stratified randomization of block size of 4.  The 
three stratification variables will be site, spoken language (Spanish, English or other), and type of 
stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic).  These lists have an allocation ratio of 1:1 of control and intervention.  
Permuted block randomization that stratifies by [CONTACT_501474].  The study programmer/anal yst will generate [ADDRESS_645876] baseline data 
(described below in section of Outcome Measures) before randomization so that the RA will collect data uniformly regardless of the eventual allocation of the subject.  After  an eligible participant has 
consented and completed the baseline survey, the RA will inform the Project Coordinator with the 
information  needed to choose which of the [ADDRESS_645877] the data to determine the enrollment ratios.   
•Numerator: we have developed tracking databases for the RAs to record the number of approached
patients per month.  They further document the reason for ineligibility among subjects.  For eligiblesubjects, the RAs further document which patients consent or decline to p articipate, and for those
that decline, the reasons for not participating.
•Denominator: On a periodic basis, administrators at the LAC -DHS run reports for the SUSTAIN
team that show the number of patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_501456].
Usin
g our tracking databases and the LAC -DHS reports, we can calculate the proportion of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_501457].  This will allow us to d iscern when and where and why study 
enrollment rates are lower than expected.   
Thes
e enrollment statistics will be shared among the research team and the Task Force.  If rates of 
participating are lower than expected at a site, we will investigate the reasons for doing so and develop 
strategies for overcoming barriers.  This feedback  loop has been critical for developi[INVESTIGATOR_501458].

Because NINDS strongly encourages investigators to make use of the NINDS Common Data Elements 
in developi[INVESTIGATOR_501460] (see http://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/ ), the study team will rely 
on those materials  in the development of CRFs for SUCCEED. 
B
lood Pressure (BP):  Participants are seated quietly for 5 minutes before Blood Pressure (BP) 
reading are initiated. Staff are trained to ensure that the proper cutoff size is used and that the 
participant’s arm is resting on a flat surface, with the BP cuff at heart level. Two sequential readings will be taken using the OMRON 90XL with [ADDRESS_645880] two readings 
differ by [CONTACT_726] 5mmHg, then an additional two readings are taken and recorded electronically using a laptop based data entry system developed through Core A. Average BP is calculated by [CONTACT_501477].  
N
IHSS and disability scales: Each RA will obtain certification to perform the National Institute of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin scale prior to the start of the study.  These are 
measures of stroke severity and disability.  Certification is obtained by [CONTACT_501478] a test by [CONTACT_501479] a patient.

In addition, the RA will be observ ed by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_501461].  Each RA 
will be re -observed examining a study participant 2 months later, then 4 months later.   
6.3.8  Laboratory Evaluations  
LDL Cholesterol: Point -of-service CardioChek meters will be used to collect information on LDL 
cholesterol. The meters require only a small capi[INVESTIGATOR_130935] (from a fingerprick). After cleaning the end of one finger with an alcohol wipe, a small lancet is used to prick the participant’s finger. The 
first blood spot is wiped off with gauze and the next blood spot is dropped into a special cartridge which is then simply inserted into the CardioCHek meter for the calculation of LDL cholesterol. Staff will 
record results electronically using the laptop- based data entry system.

9.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
P
ower Analysis  
Power Analyses was conducted with comparison of main outcomes ( systolic blood pressure (SBP))  between 
the control and intervention arms. Based on availability of patients and our capacity, w e plan to enroll 500 
subjects from four senior centers.  Using I ntra-class correlation (ICC) of the four centers at 0.0085 level, attrition 
after the baseline  between 20% to 30% level, mean SBP 141 mm Hg and standar d deviation (SD) 20, three 
repeated measurements: baseline, 3 months, and 12 months  (Brown and Prescott 2006), the underlying 
23  
  
statistical power of the study  comes  from two dimensions of observations: the number of unique subjects and 
the number of repeated measurements within a subject. Based on sample size and power analyses method 
proposed by D iggle et al. ( 1994) and Li u et al. ( 2005) for r epeated measures analysis w ith a t ype I e rror o f 
0.05, type II er ror of 0.2 (or equivalent t o power of 80%),  2.[ADDRESS_645884] 
(corresponding t o 20% an d 30% at trition r espectively), a nd an auto- correlation at 0. 2 level, t he effective 
sample si ze will b e 147 and 147 o ut of t he planned 250 and 25 0 participants i n each of the 2 arms ( after 
adjustin g for cl ustering e ffect), w hich will e nable us t o detect a n effect  size for S BP as sm all as 0. [ADDRESS_645885] deviation u nits or 4 .29 mm H g (for 2 0% attrition), and 0.[ADDRESS_645886] deviation u nits or 5.06 mm 
Hg (for 30% a ttrition).  
The seminal w ork for m oderator an d mediator effect  was from B aron and Kenny ( 1986). F or potential 
moderators ( e.g., age, gender, s troke  type and severity,  education, co untry o f birth/primary l anguage), w e will 
test power o f moderation using t he most  common measure of effect  size f2 (Aiken & West, 20 01), w hich equals 
the u nique varianc e explain ed by t he interaction t erm di vided by [INVESTIGATOR_87049] m of t he error a nd interaction variances.  
Cohen (1988) has s uggested that f2 effect  sizes of 0. 02, 0. 15, a nd 0.[ADDRESS_645887] si zes w ith m oderators might be 0 .005, 0. 01, a nd 0.025 for 
small, m edium, and large, r espectively.    
Due t o the low power i n tests  of moderation, t here are greater i nterests i n mediation ov er moderation 
(McClell and & J udd, 1993). T o analyze  power of p otential m ediators ( e.g., s elf-efficacy, self -management, 
social i solation, d epression, p erceived risk  of st roke), w e will use indirect effect, w hich is the product  of 
coefficient from i ndependent va riable to mediator, and mediator t o the outcome. Becaus e an indirect effect  is a 
product of two effects, t he us ual C ohen (1988) s tandards of . [ADDRESS_645888]  size woul d be .01, m edium w ould .09, and large would be .25 ( or we can use  
small .02, medium . 15, an d large .40.)  
The effect  size for S BP as small as 0. 215 in standar d deviation units or 4 .29 mm H g (for 20% at trition), a nd 
0.253 i n standar d deviation units or 5 .06 mm H g (for 30% attrition) ca n be considered cl inically m eaningful i n 
the pr esent o f both moderators a nd mediators.  Thus, the pl anned sample size shoul d be su fficient for 
analyses.

Enrollment weights based on a logistic regression model will be calculated using demographic data c ollec ted 
from eligible non-p articipants.  If needed, attrition weights will be determined from logistic  regression models 
using demographic data on participants who drop out of the study.  These two weights will be combined to 
form an overall weight (us ing the inverse of the product of the probabilities of participation).  Both raw and 
adjusted rates using the ov erall weight will be compared between SUCCEED and usual care arms .   
Intenti on to t reat analyses on all primary a nd se condary o utcomes w ill be conducted using or dinal l ogistic or 
multiple linear r egression models,  incorporating the overall w eight.  Intervention status w ill be an independent 
variable i n all m odels.   We will c ompare study o utcomes betwe en the control a nd intervention gr oups bo th with 
and without a djusting for potential co variates a ssociated with the outcome measure.   
We will test  the moderator a nd mediator effects se parately.  To assess  the moderating e ffects,  we will compare 
regression models w e fit i ncluding i nteracti on terms be tween the independent v ariables a nd each possible 
effect  modifier, a nd the models that do not i nclude t he corresponding i nteraction t erms,  using the l ikelihood 
ratio test  (LRT). T o ass ess the mediating e ffects,  we will use  Baron and Kenny ( 1986) m ethods to r un a series 
of regressi on analysis and us e the Sobel t est and Bootstrappi [INVESTIGATOR_86286] t est m ediating e ffects.  
To check  the fidelity (uptake) o f the SU CCEED intervention, w e will also analyze attendance  at SU CCEED 
clinics  and the number o f telephone co ordinati on of c are calls m ade durin g enrollment.   
Because subjects  will be recruite d from four h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_501463],  there could b e som e underlying intra- site 
correlations of outcome measures i n the collected data, w hich will have potential i mpacts on st atistical 
significant tests o f parameter estimates i n the analyses.  To take  this into account i n our analyses a nd 
modeli ng, robust  standar d errors w ill be calculated using Huber/ White/Sandwich method to ensure valid 
significance testing.  Although we w ill asse ss for the impact  of clustering data structure, w e do not e xpect  a 
large intra- site correlatio n becaus e the three sites ar e part o f the sam e county he althcare system an d we are 
not aware of di fferences o f outcomes by [CONTACT_3725]. Furthermore, we will also  include site dummies in our m odel t o

Protocol Version 4 08/06/[ADDRESS_809828] poor sustainability. Persistent improvements to daily dietary patterns are often difficult without directed guidance, and overall dietary quality in the [LOCATION_002] remains poor. The identification of a practical, daily dietary intervention to improve dietary quality and prevent diabetes in those at high risk remains unknown. We propose to enroll 40 individuals with diagnosed prediabetes into a randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_610801] a daily walnut supplementation intervention to determine feasibility and acceptability of the supplement. We will then determine preliminary efficacy on metabolic markers and will investigate associations between dietary quality and circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids. Our goal is to implement a whole-food supplement to improve dietary quality in patients with prediabetes as a tool for future type 2 diabetes prevention.

Protocol Version 4 08/06/18 Page 7 of 23  3 SIGNIFICANCE 3.1 BACKGROUND Over one-quarter of the adult population in the [LOCATION_002] has prediabetes. Prediabetes is a state of impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance that is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.1,2 Up to 30% of people with prediabetes will progress to diabetes in 5 years at current standards.2 The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is an intensive diet and exercise program that has been shown to decrease incident diabetes in those with impaired glucose tolerance,[ADDRESS_809829] demonstrated an improvement in lipid subfractions with acute and long-term intake of nuts.17-19 In short-term trials, consumption of nuts improved endothelial function20 and insulin signaling17 without

(Figure 1) Increasing nut consumption may also improve satiety, ideally displacing those foods, such as refined carbohydrates, that have been shown to contribute to the incidence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity.[ADDRESS_809831] examined dietary patterns and quality and their associations with risk factors for diabetes in a population of South Asian Americans, and found that a dietary pattern characterized by [CONTACT_610817]-saturated fat sweets was associated with higher insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and lower HDL.[ADDRESS_809832]-prandial glycemic control (Gadgil MD, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, submitted). I have an investigation currently underway to examine dietary quality, BCAA intake and incident gestational diabetes mellitus in women who are part of the Coronary Artery and Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) longitudinal cohort study, and our preliminary results show that lower dietary quality and higher BCAA intake is associated with an increase in gestational diabetes incidence. As the preponderance of prior work has shown improved outcomes and decreased incidence of diabetes with improvements in dietary quality, we believe that the next step is to create a practical, daily intervention to aid in improving overall dietary quality. 3.[ADDRESS_809833] between diet and glucose tolerance in a high-risk population. In doing so, we will identify previously unknown targets to measure the preclinical effects of dietary influence on risk for diabetes.  2.3 INNOVATION   This proposed investigation will join the burgeoning movement of dietary intervention studies that are performed in a real-world environment, without highly controlled

Protocol Version 4 08/06/[ADDRESS_809834] 5 years, she has focused her research in the areas of dietary patterns, cardiometabolic disease, and racial/ethnic disparities. Her prior work demonstrates associations of dietary quality and patterns with risk factors for metabolic disease, in both normal weight and overweight/obese individuals, and her objective for this study is to evaluate a walnut supplementation intervention in high-risk individuals with prediabetes. Her long-term goal is to identify and implement practical dietary interventions to improve dietary quality and ultimately prevent diabetes. 5 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS 5.1 Study Participants Study Population, Study Design and Eligibility criteria: We will enroll [ADDRESS_809835] eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study. 5.3 Study Intervention Participants in the Usual Care group and Walnuts groups will receive usual counseling and care, including general dietary and lifestyle counseling provided to all patients with diagnosed prediabetes, recommending a diet high in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean protein and dairy. Those in the Walnuts intervention group will receive initial dietary counseling to describe the high refined carbohydrate foods to be replaced with the

Protocol Version 4 08/06/[ADDRESS_809836] greater than usual consumption of walnuts by [CONTACT_610818], we will offer walnut supplementation at the end of the trial to these participants. Participants in the Usual Care group will be instructed to carry out usual diet and lifestyle changes for the 12-week duration, and will receive walnut supplementation, identical in dose and duration to the intervention group, after the completion of the study. The following treatment regimens will be used: • Walnuts “Now”: 28g of individually-wrapped raw, unsalted walnuts consumed daily for 12 weeks during the study period • Walnuts “Later”: Usual diet during the study period. The participants will be provided with an equivalent amount of individually wrapped walnut packets for their daily use after the study period has concluded. 5.4 Randomization and Blinding Randomization: Participants will be randomly assigned to two groups of 20 participants each: “Walnuts Now” Or “Walnuts Later”. We will block our randomization by [CONTACT_610819]: sex (female or male) and age categories (<50 or ≥50 years). We will generate stratum-specific sequential ID numbers to randomly allocate individuals to intervention groups in blocks of four. Study staff will be blinded to the linkage between ID numbers and group assignment. Upon enrollment, each participant's stratum will be identified and the next sequential ID number from that stratum was assigned. At the end of the baseline visit, the interviewer will open a sealed, opaque envelope pre-printed with the sequential ID number revealing the intervention group assignment to the participant.  Blinding Due to the objectives of the study, the identity of test and control treatments will be known to investigators, research staff, or patients.   This study is designed as a non-blinded trial, therefore to protect against greater than usual consumption of walnuts by [CONTACT_610818], we will offer walnut supplementation at the end of the trial to these participants. Participants in the Usual Care group will be instructed to carry out usual diet and lifestyle changes for the 12-week duration, and will receive walnut supplementation, identical in dose and duration to the intervention group, after the completion of the study.  Because of the behavioral nature of the intervention, study staff who administer the intervention and study participants will not be blinded to their intervention group assignment, however we will blind the outcomes assessments – clinical labs and amino acid analyses will be done by [CONTACT_610820].

Specific Aim 1:  Aim 1: Determine a) feasibility for recruitment and retention into a randomized controlled trial of daily walnut supplementation, and b) acceptability and adherence to the intervention containing 28g of walnuts daily, compared with usual care in individuals with prediabetes. Feasibility and acceptability. We will assess feasibility based on number screened and enrolled in the proposed randomized clinical trial for our goal of 40 participants. Retention over the 12-week intervention period will be assessed by [CONTACT_610823]. Palatability will be assessed by a 100mm visual analog scale. We will also assess acceptability of the walnut intervention, and its dose and frequency through a targeted questionnaire at the end of the intervention period. Adherence will be measured through self-report (food diaries) as well as the food frequency questionnaire administered at study completion. All questionnaires will be administered by [CONTACT_610824]. Aim 2: Determine preliminary efficacy measures for change in a) fasting glucose, HbA1c and lipid levels, b) dietary quality score and c) BCAA levels in the intervention group to inform a larger future randomized controlled trial. Fasting glucose, HbA1c and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]: We will obtain fasting blood samples at enrollment and at the conclusion of the study. One aliquot of serum tube of blood will be sent for fasting glucose, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], ApoA1 and B, and HbA1c measurement, and one aliquot of plasma will be sent for metabolomics analyses. Additional aliquots of plasma and serum will be frozen for future research purposes. We will establish preliminary efficacy for each of these measurements. Dietary Quality: A Block food frequency questionnaire will be administered to participants at enrollment and completion of the study period. This questionnaire will use patient recall to gather frequency and serving size data for all participants. We will use the responses in this questionnaire to determine consumption of foods grouped based on likeness and culinary usage. These categories will then be transformed into 2 dietary scores: the Healthy Eating Index-[ADDRESS_809842] congruent with the Mediterranean diet. BCAA, AAA and acylcarnitines: Targeted amino acid and acylcarnitine levels will be measured at baseline and at [ADDRESS_809843]-intervention using triple quadrupole (MS/MS) and gas chromatography instruments. We will collaborate with the West Coast Metabolomic Center on the metabolomics analyses and interpretation. Statistical Analysis: This is designed as a parallel group controlled trial, randomized on dichotomized age (<50 or > years) and sex (female or male). We will use Fisher’s exact test and Student’s t-test to compare mean baseline demographic and clinical

We will use analysis of covariance to compute the adjusted mean for our outcome variables of fasting glucose, HbA1c, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol and amino acid levels. In analysis of covariance, the baseline value of outcome variables will be used as a covariate for the computation of adjusted means between the two groups after intervention.   Expected Results: We believe that walnut supplementation will be acceptable at a dose of 28g daily. We expect to be able to recruit 40 participants within 3 months, and retain >75% for the full [ADDRESS_809845] to see a trend towards significant change in the BCAA and AAA measurements and some improvements of fasting glucose and HbA1c in the “Walnut” group compared to the “Usual care” group.  5.[ADDRESS_809846] considered using an active comparator to walnuts, however with the possibility of confounding biological activity for other whole food supplements, we elected not to include one for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_610808], acceptability, adherence and preliminary efficacy of a walnut intervention. Instead, we feel that providing walnuts for all of the trial participants, using the approach that the intervention group will receive walnuts during the main study period, and the control group will continue with usual care during the intervention period, but then receive walnuts later as a “walnuts now” vs. “walnuts later” approach will help to control for confounding. If we are successful in our primary outcomes, we will consider an active comparator for our larger randomized controlled trial. 5.9 Study limitations  Generalizability: We aim to recruit subjects who self-identify as overweight or obese, with prediabetes, and will assess their laboratory criteria for prediabetes at the first visit. Our study design is a convenience sample of volunteers who are motivated to participate in a clinical study, all factors which limit generalizability. Our study population should be representative for our target population of overweight or obese adults with prediabetes between the ages of 18 and 65. We will be unable to accommodate participants who do not speak English due to difficulties in finding qualified study personnel who speak other languages.

This may result in pain or discomfort. We do not anticipate other problems from this procedure in healthy adults.  Phlebotomy and venipuncture:  The baseline visit and study conclusion visit 3-month visit will require approximately 35-45 ml of venous blood collection. We do not anticipate any problems with anemia with a total of 45 ml of blood collection in our study of healthy volunteers. Venipuncture may result in a hematoma, which can be painful but carries no significant risks. Infections rarely occur from such brief interventions.    Walnut supplementation: There is minimal risk associated with participation in the walnut intervention. There is the possibility of an allergic reaction to the walnut supplement. We will actively exclude any participants with a known tree nut or peanut allergy from enrollment in the study. There is the small possibility that an as-yet, unknown, allergy to walnuts will occur during the course of the study. In the event of signs or symptoms of allergy, the walnut intervention will be discontinued. Participants will be educated on signs and symptoms of a walnut allergy at the baseline visit. In order to protect the integrity and freshness of the walnuts, they will be kept in cold storage at the study site, and participants will be instructed to keep them in cold storage in their private homes before use.  6.[ADDRESS_809850] Risks  6.2.a Recruitment and Informed Consent: Recruitment will be accomplished primarily through a medical records query, and through flyers at Parnassus and Mount Zion UCSF campuses. At the beginning of the baseline visit, a member of the research staff will review the consent form in detail with the patient and answer all questions before inviting the patient to sign the consent form.  A photocopy of the signed consent form with the Experimental Subjects' Bill of Rights is given to the patient.  The protocols are reviewed by [CONTACT_610825], University of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco and University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego.  All subjects will be reimbursed for the time and possible inconvenience associated with participation in the studies.  6.2.b Protection Against Risk: The specific measures to minimize each risk are described in the relevant sections above, as well as the Data Safety and Monitoring Plan that is outlined in a subsequent section.  In addition, there will be continuous safety surveillance with emphasis on the potential side effects of each procedure, as detailed above.  Participation in the study will be discontinued if the subject fails to adhere to the study requirements in a way that may cause harm to him or herself or seriously interfere with the validity of the study results; or the investigator determines that further participation would be detrimental to the subject’s health or well being.    Subjects who are injured as a result of being in this study will have treatment available.

Specifically, they will be labeled either definitely, probably, possibly or unrelated to the study intervention.  4. Expected Risks – There is minimal risk with participating in the walnut intervention. Expected risks to the subject are mild gastrointestinal symptoms due to inclusion of walnuts in a normal daily diet. These risks are considered to be minimal and are addressed in the protocol and consent form. Participants will have a contact [CONTACT_610826]. They will also have an opportunity to privately discuss any other physical complaints due to inclusion of walnuts.    5. SAE Reporting - SAEs that are unanticipated, serious (grades 3 and 4), and/or possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the Independent Monitor, IRB, CTSA at UCSF, and NIH in accordance with requirements. Anticipated SAEs or those unrelated to the study intervention will be reported to the same individuals/entities in accordance with requirements.  If abnormal lab values are discovered during the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_610810]. If fasting glucose is found to be abnormally low (greater than or equal to 40 mg/dL and below 70 mg/dL), the participant will receive a call from the study coordinator asking if they are experiencing adverse effects such as nausea or lightheadness This mild hypoglycemia will be treated with sugar intake. A severely low blood sugar (<40 mg/dL) will be flagged as a critically low value by [CONTACT_610827] [INVESTIGATOR_610811]. The participant will be called to proceed to the emergency room and will be withdrawn from the study.

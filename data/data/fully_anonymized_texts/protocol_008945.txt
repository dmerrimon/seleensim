2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted
ABBV-105 is a novel, covalent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor being developed for the treatment 
of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Btk is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in multiple immune cell types associated with the 
pathogenesis of RA and other autoimmune diseases.  Btk is required for the propagation of pro-
inflammatory signals downstream of immunoreceptors that promote autoimmune disease pathogenesis.  Compared to other Btk inhibitors, CC-292 (Celgene) and ibrutinib (Pharmacyclics/Janssen), ABBV-[ADDRESS_1051450] demonstrated:  1) complete abrogation of arthritis in the collagen-
induced arthritis model when initiated at disease onset, consistent with the effect of Btk inhibition on autoantibody production,
2,32) efficacy in myeloid-mediated animal arthritis models, consistent with the 
effects of Btk inhibition on macrophage, mast cell, dendritic cell, and neutrophil activity,2,3and 
3) marked reductions of proteinuria in mouse models of lupus, consistent with the effect of Btk inhibition on autoantibody production and/or myeloid cell activation.

Upadacitinib is a novel Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, which displays unique selectivity for the JAK1 receptor which is currently being developed for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to 
severely active RA (Phase 3), psoriatic arthritis (Phase 3), atopic dermatitis (Phase 3), Crohn's disease 
(Phase 3), ulcerative colitis (Phase 2), and axial spondyloarthritis (Phase 2).  As of [ADDRESS_1051451] received upadacitinib, which includes 469 healthy volunteers, 553 RA patients, and 210 Crohn's disease patients.  Upadacitinib was generally well-tolerated, and the types of adverse events (AEs) seen were typi[INVESTIGATOR_766518].
Clinical Hypothesis
ABBV-105 given alone or in combination with upadacitinib (as the ABBV-599 combination therapy) should be effective in decreasing signs and symptoms associated with active RA in patients with inadequate response or intolerance to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) by [CONTACT_766521]1/Btk pathways.  Concurrent inhibition of JAK1/Btk pathways in RA may increase percent of those responding as well as depth of response (relative to inhibiting either pathway alone), while maintaining an acceptable safety profile.

STUDY M16-063  |  Version 5.0 / EudraCT 2018-000666-[ADDRESS_1051452] the potential for an increased susceptibility to infection.
In Phase 1 Studies M16-356 (single doses of ABBV-105 ranging from 2 to 125 mg), M16-357 (multiple 
doses of ABBV-105 ranging from 3 - 60 mg), and M16-044 (co-administration of upadacitinib 30 mg with ABBV-105 ranging from 10 - 60 mg), ABBV-105 alone or ABBV-105 co-administration with upadacitinib was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) observed in healthy adult subjects.
Taken together, the safety data from the Phase 1 program support further development of ABBV-105 
given alone or in combination with upadacitinib (ABBV-599) in Phase 2 in subjects with RA.
For safety monitoring, the following are included in the protocol:
!Exclusion of subjects with chronic or recent infections; 
!Screen subjects for tuberculosis (TB); exclude patients with active TB or latent TB without 
history of appropriate prophylaxis: latent TB as assessed by [CONTACT_766522] (IGRA) QuantiFERON Tuberculosis (TB) Gold in Tube Test or equivalent (i.e., or T SPOT. TBtest; as 
available and if compliant with local TB guidelines) and/or a purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) test (or both if required per local guidelines).
!Subjects will also be screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C.
!If a subject develops a serious infection or opportunistic infection with study treatment, study drug should be interrupted and appropriate treatment of the infection should be initiated.
!Review SAEs of infection on a real time basis and query for additional information as clinically indicated
!A supplemental herpes zoster form will be used to collect additional information for any herpes zoster infections.
See Section 3.4for information on the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).

Choice of Control Group
This is a parallel-group study consisting of 6 treatment groups receiving ABBV-105, ABBV-599 (a 
combination of upadacitinib and ABBV-105), upadacitinib, or matching placebo to assess the safety and efficacy of ABBV-105 given alone or in combination with upadacitinib (as the ABBV-599 combination) once daily for [ADDRESS_1051456] had an inadequate response or intolerance to bDMARDs.  Placebo will serve as a reference for efficacy assessment while the additional efficacy of 
ABBV-599 combination will utilize in-study upadacitinib subjects as a reference (with/without historic 
data borrowed from Phase 2 and Phase 3 upadacitinib studies performed in similar populations).
Appropriateness of Measurements
Appropriate statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study.  All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with RA.  All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted.
Suitability of Subject Population
Adult subjects who are at least 18 years of age with a diagnosis of RA for ≥ 3 months and also fulfill the 
2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA and who have been treated for ≥ 3 months with 
≥[ADDRESS_1051457](s) due to intolerability or 
toxicity, irrespective of treatment duration, are eligible for this study.  The selection criteria relating to safety guarantee that subjects enrolled can be safely treated with ABBV-105, with or without upadacitinib, based on the current knowledge of these drugs.
Selection of Doses in the Study
The dose selection in this study is based on analysis of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and 
efficacy (upadacitinib only) data from Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers for ABBV-105 and Phase 2 
and Phase 3 studies for upadacitinib.
Given the uncertainty in correlation between blood Btk occupancy and efficacy in RA patients, the low 
and middle ABBV-105 doses are intended to target exposures that would approximate mid-level and 
near maximal Btk occupancy, respectively, in a dosing interval, and the high dose is intended to approximate exposures at or greater than those needed to achieve maximal Btk occupancy.
In the Phase 1 ABBV-105 multiple ascending dose study (Study M16-357), the Btk occupancy at steady-
state was near 100% throughout the dosing interval at the 60 mg QD dose; in the ABBV-599 multiple ascending dose study (Study M16-044), the Btk occupancy of approximately 70% and 90% was maintained throughout the dosing interval at the 10 and 20 mg QD doses, respectively.
Following once-daily dosing of ABBV-105 5 mg, 20 mg, and 60 mg, peak Btk occupancy at steady-state is 
predicted to be 67%, 93%, and 99%, respectively, whereas steady-state trough Btk occupancy is predicted to be 58%, 83%, and 89%, respectively.  Therefore, the ABBV-105 doses of 5, 20, and 60 mg were selected to satisfy the Btk-related exposure criteria, as well as to represent exposures that were found to be safe and well tolerated in the Phase 1 studies.  The selected dose of the upadacitinib component of the ABBV-599 arm is 15 mg, based on the results of the upadacitinib RA Study M13-542.

Elective and Emergency Surgeries
Elective surgery will not be allowed during the study until the primary endpoint has been assessed.  If 
the subject undergoes emergency surgery, the study drug should be interrupted as soon as possible and reintroduced once the physician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection.
5.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Subjects should continue on their stable ( ≥ [ADDRESS_1051478] dose of study drug) background 
csDMARD therapy, restricted to the following:  oral or parenteral MTX (7.5 to 25 mg/week), sulfasalazine ( ≤ 3000 mg/day), hydroxychloroquine ( ≤ 400 mg/day), chloroquine ( ≤ 250 mg/day), and 
leflunomide ( ≤ 20 mg/day).  Combinations of up to two csDMARDs are allowed except for the 
combination of MTX and leflunomide.
At any time, the csDMARD dose may be decreased only for safety reasons.  Subjects taking MTX should 
take a dietary supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent, such as folinic acid) throughout study participation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be followed according to Investigator's instructions.  [COMPANY_013] will not provide the csDMARDs (or folic acid, if taking MTX).
Subjects should continue on their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, oral 
corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day), or inhaled corticosteroids.
!If taking any of the above on a scheduled basis, they should continue to take them as they did at study entry with no change in dose or frequency, including on study visit days.

procedures outlined for the PD visit should be completed as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_1051483] dose of study drug may be completed to ensure all treatment-emergent AEs/SAEs have been resolved.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the primary reason for 
discontinuation of study drug or study participation.  The information will be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) page.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the Investigator feels are 
necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject should 
be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
If a subject withdraws from the main study, biomarker research samples will continue to be stored and 
analyzed.  A subject must contact [CONTACT_766525].  Once [COMPANY_013] is notified, no new information will be collected, no new analysis will be started, and the samples will be destroyed unless a regulatory authority requires [COMPANY_013] to keep them.

Product Complaints
A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s).
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or packaging, product 
appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the 
labeling/instructions (e.g., printing illegible), missing components/product, device not working properly, or packaging issues.
Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If any of the following AEs are reported, then the following supplemental report(s) must be completed.

Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_1051489] signs the study-specific informed consent.

Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will classify AEs according to the Rheumatology Common Toxicity Criteria v.2.0 
(Appendix F ).
If no grading criteria are provided for the reported event, then the event should be as follows:
!Mild (Grade 1):  asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.
!Moderate (Grade 2):  minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) (instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.).
!Severe (Grade 3):  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care ADL (self 
care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden);
!Life-threatening (Grade 4):  urgent intervention indicated or death related to AE.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study drug:
Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, 
clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest 
a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility – After consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_1051490] be discontinued (Section 5.5).
Information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected.
The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is 
considered a SAE and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event.

The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described in Table 4 and in the 
Operations Manual.
The toxicity management of the AEs including AESI consists of safety monitoring (review of AEs on an 
ongoing basis, and periodical/ad hoc review of safety issues by a safety data monitoring committee), interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from study drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described below.
For subjects who discontinue study drug but continue study participation and are on standard of care 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central lab) and any intolerability to standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355243].
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs and symptoms of 
infection during and after treatment with study drug.  Study drug should be interrupted if a subject 
develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an 
immunocompromised subject.  As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated, and the 
subject should be closely monitored.  Study drug may be restarted once the infection has been successfully treated.  Subjects who develop active TB or experience hepatitis B reactivation must be discontinued from study drug.  To further monitor subjects for serious infections, subjects will complete at-home weekly temperature monitoring.  If above 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), subject should inform their study doctor to assess the need for further evaluation.
Canada only:  Investigators should be advised to follow local public health guidelines in order to prevent 
subjects enrolled in these trials from acquiring TB.
Serious Gastrointestinal Events:   Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms of a serious 
gastrointestinal event should be evaluated promptly for early identification of gastrointestinal 
perforation.  If the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug.
Cardiovascular Events (MACE):   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events should be 
carefully monitored.  These events will be reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_766527].Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in situ of the cervix must 
be discontinued from study drug.  Information including histopathological results should be queried for 
the confirmation of the diagnosis.
ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be discontinued from study drug for an ECG change considered 
clinically significant and with reasonable possibility of relationship to study drug OR a confirmed 
absolute QTcF value > [ADDRESS_1051491] Laboratory Abnormalities:   For any given laboratory abnormality, the 
Investigator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for medical evaluation and treatment 
following any local guidelines.  Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values

(CMH) test controlling for stratification variables.  Non-responder imputation (NRI) will be used for primary inference purpose and as observed (AO) analyses will be used for sensitivity analysis for selected endpoints.
Missing Data Imputation Definition
Non-Responder Imputation:   An NRI approach will categorize any subject who has missing value for 
categorical variables at a specific visit as non-responder for that visit.  In addition, subjects who prematurely discontinue from study drug will be considered as non-responders for all subsequent visits after discontinuation.
As Observed:   AO analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a subject who does 
not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the AO analysis for that visit.  
Regardless of treatment switching or premature discontinuation of study drug, all observed data will be used in the analysis.
Observed Case (OC):   OC analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations and, thus, a subject who 
does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from OC analysis for that visit.  In 
addition, the OC analysis will not use values after premature discontinuation of study drug.
Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measurements (MMRM):   MMRM analysis will be conducted using 
mixed-effect model with OC analysis.  The mixed model includes the categorical fixed effects of 
treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, main stratification factors, and the continuous fixed covariate of baseline measurement.  An unstructured variance covariance matrix will be used.  The parameter estimations are based on the assumption of data being missing at random and using the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML).

All safety analyses will be performed in the safety populations.
Pre-treatment AEs will be summarized separately.All treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AESI will be 
collected during the study.  A TEAE is defined as an event with onset or worsening after the first study dose of study drug and within [ADDRESS_1051496] dose of study drug administration.  The number and percentages of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) system organ class and preferred term.  Summaries (including percentages and event per 100 patient-year) of SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AESI will be provided as well.  For selected laboratory and vital signs parameters, mean change from baseline and percentage of subject with evaluations meeting pre-defined criteria for Potentially Clinically Important values will be summarized.
7.5 Interim Analysis
An unblinded interim analysis to review safety will be conducted by [CONTACT_766531] 3 time points and ad hoc as needed:  when approximately 50% of subjects have completed Week 4 evaluation, when approximately 80% of subjects have completed Week 4 evaluation, and when approximately 80% of subjects have completed Week 12 evaluation.  The sponsor, study sites and subjects will remain blinded for the duration of the study. The details will be given in the DMC charter or related SAP.
A separate DMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and 
responsibilities of the DMC members, frequency of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed.
7.6 Sample Size Estimation
The planned total sample size is 240.  Forty patients per arm of ABBV-105 can provide approximately 83% power to detect a –0.88 difference in DAS28 (CRP) change from baseline for ABBV-105 vs 20 placebo patients combined with 20 borrowed historical placebo subjects (assuming a placebo mean change from baseline:  –0.77, and ABBV-105:  –1.[ADDRESS_1051497] deviation [SD] = 1.5) using two group t-test with a 0.05 one-sided significance level.  It can provide minimum of 85% power to detect a dose-response model for ABBV-105 and combined placebo from 6 candidate models:  Linear 
(δ= 0.01), EMax (ED50 = 5 mg), Exponential ( δ = 20), Logistic (ED50 = 5 mg, δ = 10), SigEMax 
(ED50 = 5 mg, h = 2), and Quadratic ( δ = –0.01) using MCP-Mod with a 0.05 one-sided significant level.  
In the event that placebo variability precludes historic borrowing, comparison using only the in-study 
20 placebo patients is still estimated to provide 68% power for pairwise comparison of ABBV-105 vs placebo or a minimum of 70% power in detecting a dose-response model for ABBV-105 and placebo.
The planned sample size of 60 patients treated with ABBV-599 provides about 94% power to detect a 
–1.0 increase in DAS28 (CRP) LS mean change from baseline for ABBV-599 vs the group of 40 patients treated with ABBV-105 (assuming ABBV-105 mean change from baseline:  –1.65 and ABBV-599:  –2.65

of 60 for ABBV-599 vs 40 for placebo is over powered due to the necessary power for ABBV-105 over 
placebo.
The 60 patients for ABBV-599 vs 40 for upadacitinib could extend around 0.5 from observed difference 
in mean change from baseline for a two-sided 90% confidence interval assuming the common SD = 1.5.  
Supposing the difference for ABBV-599 vs upadacitinib is –0.45, the 90% confidence interval of (–0.95, 
0.05) could be detected with given same size.

CHANGES
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date
Version 1.0 25 May 2018
Version 2.0 11 July 2018
Version 3.0 05 October 2018
Version 4.0 11 March 2019
The purpose of this Amendment is to update the following:
Protocol
!Update Section 4.1, Section 7.1, and Section 7.5to remove interim efficacy analysis wording.
Rationale:   The interim efficacy analysis is removed as the study has enrolled more slowly than 
anticipated and, as a result, the interim efficacy analysis would not save enough time to be 
worthwhile in terms of designing the next Phase of the ABBV-599 Rheumatoid Arthritis Program.
!Update Sponsor/Emergency Medical Contact [CONTACT_766533] C , List of Protocol Signatories.
Rationale: Revised due to personnel change.
!Minor typographical corrections made for clarity.

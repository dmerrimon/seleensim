 Page 4 of 17  Revis ed: October 30, 2018  2.0 Objectives * 
2.1 The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of hookah 
tobacco public health education messages among young adults between 
the ages 18 to 30, including young adults who are susceptible non- users of 
hookah tobacco and current users.   
2.2 Hypothesis 1: Messages will decrease hookah initiation am ong 
susceptible non- users and increase cessation among hookah users.  
Hypothesis 2a: Message effects will be mediated by [CONTACT_531519], message receptivity, and perceived harms of hookah tobacco.  
Hypothesis 2b: Message effects will be greater among susceptible non-users versus hookah users and among those who do not use other tobacco products versus those who do. 
3.0 Background * 
3.1 The prevalence of regular (i.e., daily) and intermittent (i.e., some 
days, rarely) hookah tobacco use among US young adul ts rivals that of 
cigarette smoking and surpasses products such as electro nic cigarettes .1,2 
Our previous work indicates nearly 30% of US young adults who do not use hookah are also at risk of initiation .
[ADDRESS_690162] 8 classes of carcinogens linked to lung, bladder, larynx, oral cavity, and esophageal cancer .
4-6 Long -term use increases the risks of 
cancer, lung disease, and other health outcomes, and hookah smoke exposure precip itates carcinogenesis in -vitro .
7,8 Hookah use among young 
people can also promote addiction: users report dependence symptoms, withd rawal, and difficulty quitting .
9, 10  Young adulthood is generally a 
vulnerable  period for tobacco i nitiation ,11 a time when addictions unfold 
and transitions to regular tobacco use occur ,11 and there is growing 
evidence t his occurs with hookah tobacco.12-14 Young adults’ hookah use 
is a critically importa nt problem for tobacco control .[ADDRESS_690163] 
authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  to regulate the 
marketing, sale, and manufacture of cigarettes, smokel ess, and roll -your-
own tobacco.16 In 2016, FDA finalized the “deeming” rule bringing all 
tobacco products under its regulatory jurisdic tion, including hookah 
tobacco .17, [ADDRESS_690164] .
16 FDA has 
launched mass media campaigns targeting youth cigarette smoking and evidence indicates they are positively aff ecting smoking behavior in target 
populations .
19 With the deeming rule finalized, FDA has announced plans 
to expand public education efforts to newly regulated products such as e -
cigarettes ,20 and is positioned to do so for hookah as well. Importantly,

Education Messages among Young Adults  
 Page 5 of 17  Revis ed: October 30, [ADDRESS_690165]: FDA must consider evidence of their 
impact on users and non- users, and especially young people. This study 
fills an important gap in the research guiding FDA public education efforts 
surrounding the risks associated with hookah tobacco use by [CONTACT_531520], the primary population where hookah use occurs.  
3.[ADDRESS_690166] step was to update message content from previous 
research
21 based on the recent literature. Then, we pretested revised 
messages with 46 young adults (Mean age 24.1, 41% female, 24% non-
white) using online crowdsourcing. Participants rated revised message content highly (1 to 7 scale) on relevance (Mean 5.5), believability (Mean 5.2), applicability (Mean 5.4), accuracy (Mean 5.6), understandability (Mean 5.6), and importance (Mean 5.2). In a separate sample of 44 young adult hookah users (Mean age 25.3, 53% female, 20% non- white), we als o 
assessed message content preferences, finding messages conveying risks of harm and addiction resonate with this group.
22 The proposed approach 
builds directly for our prior work to carefully develop education messages targeting young adults’ hookah use.  
Message Effects: Susceptible Non -Users. We experimentally examined 
effects of the revised messages in 508 young adults who never used hookah tobacco (M age 25.3, 50.1% female, 199% non- white) recruited 
online, 248 (49%) of whom were susceptible to initiati on.
23 Participants 
exposed to the messages responded favorably on measures of engagement, and those who were susceptible to using hookah tobacco indicated message content was more personally relevant than those who were not susceptible (p <.001). Overall, compared to young adults receiving no message content, those viewing study messages reported greater perceived harm and addictiveness (d = .89) of hookah tobacco, greater worry about harm and addiction (d = .30), and more negative attitudes toward hookah (d = .30). Among susceptible young adults, those viewing messages 
reported less intention to try hookah tobacco in the future compared to those not exposed to messages (d = .34, p = .035); there was no significant effect of messages on hookah use intentions  in non- susceptible young 
adults. These data support our objective to test message efficacy  among 
young adults who are susceptible non- users of hookah tobacco.  
 Message Effects: Hookah Users. We also tested message effects in 327 young adult hookah tobacco users (Mean age 24.8, 38% female, 22% non-white) recruited online.
24 Participants completed pre -exposure measures 
and were randomized to a control condition receiving no messages (n = 108), a condition receiving messages about hookah tobacco harms (n = 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized Trial Testing the Efficacy of Hookah Tobacco Public 
Education Messages among Young Adults  
 Page 6 of 17  Revis ed: October 30, 2018  107), or a condition receiving messages about hookah tobacco harms and addictiveness (n = 112). Post -exposure measures captured hookah tobacco 
perceptions and motivation to quit. Main effects for study condition were statistically significant for all outcome s (p ≤ .001) except perceived risk of 
addiction (p = .051). Pair -wise mean comparisons showed participants in 
conditions receiving study messages endorsed stronger perceived harm (d’s .74- .79) and addictiveness (d’s .47- .80), greater worry about harm 
(d’s .42- .44) and addiction (d’s .31- .47), and stronger motivation to quit 
(d’s .22- .47). Message effects on motivation to quit were mediated by

Evidence -based public education messaging is a recommended component 
of compreh ensive tobacco control efforts .
[ADDRESS_690168] packaging  are effective for preventing smoking uptake and promoting 
cessation .
28-30 Young adults’ hookah use is characterized by [CONTACT_531523], beliefs that social use poses little risk, and is fueled by [CONTACT_531524] .
31-42 
Messages aimed at these factors are needed to dissuade initiation among non-users and motivate users to quit .
43 However, hookah tobacco use 
predominantly occurs in caf és and other social settings, limiting users’ 
exposure to regulatory communications such as warni ng labels on product 
packaging .18, [ADDRESS_690169] 
is sorely needed. 
4.0 Study Endpoints * 
4.1 The primary study endpoints among susceptible non- users are 
changes in susceptibility to use hookah tobacco, curiosity (i.e., intentions) 
to use hookah tobacco, and hookah tobacco initiation. The  primary end 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized Trial Testing the Efficacy of Hookah Tobacco Public 
Education Messages among Young Adults  
 Page 7 of 17  Revis ed: October 30, 2018  points among current hookah users are motivation to quit  using hookah 
tobacco,  frequency of hookah use, and cessation.  
4.2 Secondary end points include perceived harm & addictiveness of 
hookah tobacco, perceived risk and worry about harm & addictiveness, 
and message- related outcomes including message receptivity, emotional 
response, and content recall. These will be examined as mediators of message effects. There are no safety outcomes in this trial.  
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
1.1 The study intervention is public health education messages that 
convey the health harms, addiction, social use, and/flavorings associated with hookah tobacco use.   
6.0 Procedures Involved * 
6.[ADDRESS_690170] collaboration with the study team and investigators. Study particip ants will be anonymous to 
the study team and investigators, and all data collected as part of the study will de -identified.  
 Participants will be recruited from the National Opi[INVESTIGATOR_531514]’s (NORC) AmeriSpeak consumer market research panel, screened for eligibility, and will complete a baseline assessment online. Then participants will be randomized in equal numbers to two arms: 1) hookah tobacco public education messaging or 2) control arm. On approximately a weekly basis for [ADDRESS_690171] of the study messages communicating about the health harms, addictiveness, social use, and flavorings in hookah tobacco. In response to each message, participants will complete measures of message response and hookah-related outcomes detailed below. Participants in the control condition will receive study communications with brief mes sages about health behaviors 
unrelated to tobacco (sun protection) and will complete the same measures. Study outcomes and hypothesized mediators will be assessed 2-, 4-, and 6- months after the message exposure period.

participants will be  recruited from the AmeriSpeak national consumer 
research panel maintained and operated by [CONTACT_531525]. Although recruitment and data collection procedures will be conducted by [CONTACT_531526], our team  will work 
collaboratively with NORC AmeriSpeak staff to oversee recruitment,

 Page 8 of 17  Revis ed: October 30, [ADDRESS_690173] interested panel members to the eligibility screener with items to 
confirm eligibility. Procedures will ensure potential participants are adults ages 18 and older through two steps: 1) targeting study invitations only to 
those panel members whose age is within this range; and 2) re -assessing 
age at eligibility screening and excluding those who provide inconsistent 
information (i .e., ages differ in self -reported screening compared with 
panel -based age derived from date of birth). Panel members who are 
confirmed to meet study eligibility criteria will proceed to the online baseline. AmeriSpeak  panel members who do not meet study eligibility 
criteria will be redirected to a concluding thank -you screen. Similar 
procedures will be followed when participants are contact[CONTACT_531527] 2 -, 4-, and 6 -month follow -up assessments. 
This approach is guided by [CONTACT_531528], including studies with prospective participation and 
retention rates of 70% and higher .
45-46  
The online baseline assessment includes valid measures of hookah 
and other tobacco use behavior, hookah beliefs, perceptions, and other 
constructs fr om our conceptual framework. After completing a baseline, 
participants will be randomly assigned in approximately equal numbers to one of two arms: 1) hookah tobacco education messaging ; 2) control arm. 
Randomization will be balanced by [CONTACT_531529] (susceptible non-user, current user) to ensure sufficient numbers of these characteristics across study arms . Participants in the hookah education messaging arm 
will then rece ive [ADDRESS_690174] of: 1) the 
study hookah education messages; and 2) brief post -message 
(approximately 5 minutes)  measures of hookah use behaviors, belief s and 
perceptions, and message responses. Procedures for participants 
randomized to the control arm will be similar, however communications 
will consist of non- tobacco messages communicating about sun protection 
that we have developed on our previous work and pi[INVESTIGATOR_531515] -related messaging to ensure they are an adequate contact -matched 
control . Messages will have a similar layout and structure (e.g., amount of 
text) to the hookah public education messages and will be presented in a consisten t order for all participants. We chose this contact -matched control 
arm to ensure groups are treated equivalently with only message content 
varying between arms.  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized Trial Testing the Efficacy of Hookah Tobacco Public 
Education Messages among Young Adults  
 Page 9 of 17  Revis ed: October 30, 2018  All participants will complete follow -up assessments online 2- , 4-, 
and 6- months after the mes sage exposure period. We chose these time 
points based on our team’s prior work on young adult toba cco use 
behavior and messaging ,44, [ADDRESS_690175] access to any participant identifying information as part of the study; all participants will be anonymous to the investigators protecting their privacy a nd confidentiality. Due to the nature of study, the primary potential 
source of risk is the gathering of social and behavioral information about tobacco use. We recognize that protecting participants’ privacy and confidentiality is most 
salient and have st udy procedures in place to protect this information. Although 
we will not collect identifying information and all participants will be anonymous to the research team, we have several safeguards in place to  protect participants’ 
privacy and ensure that all study data are treated as secure and confidential.   
 First, all NORC AmeriSpeak  panel members provide their consent to participate 
in research studies  that NORC conducts on behalf of clients  upon joining the 
panel and are provided with details of NORC’s privacy and d ata protection 
policies and procedures. The consent form provides  contact [CONTACT_531530]. Participants may call or email  NORC staff  with 
any questions, concerns, or problems related to the study. This consent document and NORC’s polic ies and procedures are attached to the protocol.   
 Second, a t the beginning of all study assessments, we will emphasize the 
voluntary and confidential nature of participation and that no personally identifying information will be collected by [CONTACT_531531].  
Third, in the unlikely event that  a participant in the study contacts NORC 
staff with questions or to report issues, we will work with NORC staff  to 
determine a resoluti on. Although they are unlikely and we have not 
experienced such an occurrence in our research to date, any unexpected adverse events will be recorded and reported to the Georgetown IRB as detailed below describing aspects of our  Data Safety and Monitoring Plan.  
6.4 All study data will be obtained by [CONTACT_4317]’ self -report  responses

14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects * 
14.1 AmeriSpeak panel members may choose to complete study 
procedures or not . Reasons for which participants may choose to 
discontinue participation in the study may include loss of interests or lac k 
of time to complete remaining procedures. There are no foreseeable circumstances where the investigators or research team will withdrawal participants without their consent ; we will not have the ability to directly 
communicate with participants since all participants are anonymous to the research team .

to on their own. There are no procedures for termination. 
14.3 The only manner in which participants will withdrawal is if they 
decide to on their own. There will be no partial withdrawal with continued 
data collection in this study.  
15.0 Risks to Subjects * 
15.1 This study does not involve drugs, devices, or medical procedures. 
The primary potential source of risks in this study is the social risk of 
gathering behavioral information about tobacco use and tobacco- related 
attitudes, perceptions, and beliefs. These include potential embarrassment and fear of disclosure of potentially sensitive information, and confidentiality concerns.  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects * 
16.[ADDRESS_690182] design hookah tobacco public education messages to prevent and reduce hookah use a mong young adults in the 
future.  
17.0 Data Management * and Confidentiality  
17.[ADDRESS_690183] our study hypotheses assuming a 
two tailed α  = .[ADDRESS_690184] effects of the messages on hookah initiati on among susceptible non- users44 
and cessation among current users21 based on prior studies. Among susceptible 
non-users, we estimate 8% will initiate hookah use  over the [ADDRESS_690185] 80% power to detect percent 
differences as small as 5.3%, or initiation of 8% in the control arm and 2.7% in 
the messaging arm. This equates to an odds ratio of 0.62 comparing hookah 
initiation between the messaging and control arms in a logistic regression analysis 
including covariates. Although evidence on hookah tobacco cessation rates is 
limited, 1 prio r study found that young adult hookah users exposed to risk- based 
messages were nearly 2 times more likely than those in a control condition with 
no message exposure to report cessation at 6 -month follow -up (62% vs. 33%, 
odds ratio 1.89) .21 Conservatively assuming a much lower overall cessation rate 
of approximately 10% (i.e., comparable to those of behavioral sm oking cessation 
interventions)[ADDRESS_690186] 
80% power to detect absolute differences in cessatio n between study arms as 
small as 8% (10% control, 18% messaging). In a logistic regression analytic 
framework with covariates, this equates to an odds ratio of 1.55. For analyses of continuous outcome variables, our sample will provide 80% power to detect small mean differences (d ≤ 0.10) between arms in the complete sample, and among susceptible non- users and current users separately. For testing mediating effects,

corrected bootstrap analyses .54 The sample will provide 80% power to detect 
small-  to medium - indirect (i.e., coefficients in the range of 0.20 -0.30) effects. 
Similarly, for analyses of the interaction between study condition and two- level 
moderators we will have 80% power to detect moderator effects as small as Cohen’s f ≤ 0.10 in ANCOVA analyses (i.e., differences between susceptible non-users and hookah users) and odds ratios as small as 1.[ADDRESS_690188] 30 -day

We will use repeated measures ANCOVA to compare means of the continuous outcomes by [CONTACT_531534] 6 months and Tukey’s adjustment method for the pair -wise comparisons. In exploratory analyses, we will repeat these types of 
mixed logistic and ANCOVA analyses for outcomes measured at the [ADDRESS_690190] effects of candidate mediators at 1 - and 3- months on study outcomes at 6-

17.2 NORC also takes extensive measures to ensure that all panel 
members’ privacy and personal information are treated confidentially and 
kept secure. All personally identifying records are kept secured in a separate data servers maintained by [CONTACT_531525]. NORC never provides any panel members’ personally identifying infor mation to a research partner 
without the explicit and informed consent provided by [CONTACT_531535]. For this study, all data will be de -identified and anonymous to 
the investigators and no personal information will be released to the investigators, the refore there will be no way to discern participants’

18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of Subjects*  
 Although all participants are anonymous to the study team and the procedures pose minimal risks, we have procedures in place to ensure data are treated as confidential and private and to protect participants.  
 Although they are unlikely and we have not ex perienced such an 
occurrence in our research to date,  monitoring study progress and safety of 
participants is ongoing throughout data collection.  Any unexpected 
adverse events will be recorded and reported to the Georgetown IRB . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_531517], the 
Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_531541], will actively work with NORC staff  to 
monitor  for any unanticipated adverse events. [CONTACT_531541] will be 
responsible for evaluating any unanticipated problems that arise durin g the 
study and determining whether they affect the risk -benefit ratio of the 
study, and whether modifications to the protocol are required. [CONTACT_531541] will be responsible for reporting any unexpected adverse events involving any aspect of the study to the G eorgetown IRB per institutional guidelines . 
Unanticipated problems to be assessed include adverse events, deviations from the study design or protocol, and confidentiality violations. [CONTACT_531541] will report unanticipated problems to the Georgetown IRB within  [ADDRESS_690194] NORC via email ([EMAIL_10153]).

19.1 The online consent form that AmeriSpeak panel members sign upon 
joining the panel emphasizes the vo luntary and confidential nature of panel 
members’ participation in research  conducted by [CONTACT_531538] . At the  beginning of all study assessments we reiterate the voluntary and 
confidential nature of participation, and that participants may withdraw at any

participants to their answers to survey questions. These procedures present minimal risks to participants. Given the anonymous nature of study participation , and participant recruitment and data collection through 
NORC , we will use NORC’s online informed consent process  that they 
have in place for panel members.  Additionally, w e have put into place 
rigorous procedures to treat data collected for this study as private and confidential in accordance with data management procedures.  
22.2 Waiver of Consent Justification:  The research presents no more than 
minimal risk of harm to participants.  All study procedures will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_531539] . 
Therefore  it would not be practicably feasible to obtain written  informed consent 
from participants.

4 1.  Background 
 
1.1 Salivary Gland Carcinoma 
 Salivary gland cancers (SGC) are rare neoplasm s, constituting approximately 5% of head 
and neck cancers, with an overall incidence of 1-3 per 100,000 persons.  There are multiple histological subtypes including adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucoepi[INVESTIGATOR_131715], and adenocarcinoma.  The biologic behavior of these cancers is quite variable [Laurie].  Initial therapy for patients who present with localized disease consists of surgery and/or radiation therapy.  Neutron beam radiotherapy has been demonstrated to have superior efficacy to conventional radiotherapy for the treatment of localized 
disease [Griffin].  As the University of Washington is one of only a few neutron facilities 
operating worldwide, it has become a referral center for the treatment of this rare 
neoplasm.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_130124], many patients progress either locally or with 
distant metastatic disease.  Due to the rare nature of this disease, conducting clinical trials is difficult; therefore there is li mited clinical trial data to guide systemic 
therapeutic treatments.   
 
1.[ADDRESS_908667] of care for palliative chemotherapy in patients with advanced SGC.   A recent review cited 12 sm all trials reporting the use of chemotherapy 
for salivary gland carcinomas [Laurie].   In general, objective responses to any cytotoxic 
agent or regimen are infrequent and stabilization of disease is more commonly observed. 
Agents with activity include cisplatin, mitoxantrone, vinorelbine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962], and 
paclitaxel.   Combination chemotherapy also appears to be effective. The only randomized clinical trial done in this cancer demonstrated a higher response rate with cisplatin and vinorelbine compared to vinorelbine alone [Airoldi].  Data is insufficient to 
conclude that combination chemotherapy is superior to single agent therapy and 
combination therapy certainly has more toxicity.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_672274] (c-kit) [Hotte], gefitinib (EGFR), and 
trastuzumab (HER2) [Agulnik], the results of these agents in phase II clinical trials have been disappointing. 
 1.3  Eribulin 

Eribulin mesylate is a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor. Eribulin mesylate is a 
synthetic analogue of halichondrin B, a product isolated from the marine sponge 
Halichondria okadai .  
 Eribulin inhibits the growth phase of microtubules without affecting the shortening phase and sequesters tubulin into nonproductive aggregates. Eribulin exerts its effects via a 

Version date: Dec 18, 2012 
5 tubulin-based antimitotic mechanism leading to G2/M cell-cycle block, disruption of 
mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874], and, ultimately, apoptotic cell death after prolonged mitotic blockage. 
 In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration approved eribulin mesylate under the trade name [CONTACT_248774]. Prior therapy should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting. 
2.  Rationale 
Patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic salivary gland cancers have limited treatment options.  
This trial has the potential to benefit patients with salivary gland cancers by [CONTACT_672278].  Due to the relative rarity of this disease, this has been an 
underserved population and is difficult to conduct adequately powered clinical trials. Additionally, pharmaceutical companies have not pursued drug development in this disease since it is not considered commercially viable.  
3.  Trial Objectives 
  Primary:  
x Evaluate the response rate of eribulin per RECIST criteria in patients with locally 
advanced refractory or metastatic SGC. 
 
Secondary: 
x Determine the safety and toxicity of eribulin in patients with locally advanced 
refractory or metastatic SGC.  
x Evaluate the duration of response and time-to-progression. 
 
Exploratory:  
x Evaluate overall survival. 
 
4.  Trial Design 
 
This is an open-label, single-center, phase II study of eribulin for patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic SGC. 
 
Patients will receive eribulin 1.4 mg/m
2 administered intravenously (IV push) over 2 to 5 
minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Treatment will be continued until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.  7674IRB Approved

all of the following criteria met: 
x Neutrophils are > 1.0 X 109/L, 
x Platelets > 75 X 109/L, 
x No grade 3 or 4 non-hematological toxicities. 
 The Day 8 dose may be delayed for a maximum of 1 week. 
x If toxicities do not resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, omit the 
dose. 
x If toxicities resolve or improve to ≤ Grade 2 severity by [CONTACT_2006] 15, administer eribulin 
at a reduced dose and initiate the next cycle no sooner than 2 weeks later. 
 Blood tests should be performed before starting any study treatment administration and 
if the above criteria are not met, treatment should be delayed until the criteria for start 
of treatment are met. If a delay of > 3 weeks (one cycle) is required, the patient should be removed from the study and continue to be treated in accordance with the Investigator’s standard clinical practice.  6.2.2 Eribulin administration 
Patients will receive eribulin 1.4 mg/m
2 administered intravenously (IV push) over 2 to 5 
minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle.  Treatment will be continued until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient withdraws consent. 
 
Guidelines for dose modification and dose interruption of study drug are described in Table 6-1.  
6.2.3 Dose Modi fications   
Any dose reduction or dose delay of study drug  is based upon the severity of toxicity, as 
graded by [CONTACT_672279] (NCI-CTCAE, version 4.0). Once a dose has been reduced during a treatment cycle, re-escalation will not be permitted during any subsequent cycles. 
 
All toxicity-related causes for dose reductions or dose delays, must be recorded as an AE. Please refer to Table 6-1 for recommended study drug dose adjustments. Patients requiring a delay in study treatment > 3 weeks or > 2 dose reductions, will be discontinued from study treatment.

x Target lesions: All measurable lesions should be identified and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated 
measurements (either by [CONTACT_672281]). A sum of the longest 
diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum longest diameter (SLD). The baseline SLD will be used as the reference by [CONTACT_14218]. 
 
x Non-target lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these 
lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.

be defined as: 
x Complete response (CR): complete resolution of all tumor lesions. 
x Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter 
of the target lesions (primary tumor and lymph nodes).  
x Stable disease (SD): patients with changes that would not qualify as partial 
responses or progressive diseases.    
x Progressive disease (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest 
diameter of the target lesions. 
 
8.2  Time-to-Event Measures  The following definitions for time-to-event measures will apply: 
 
x Duration of Tumor Response is measured from the date of the first objective 
assessment of PR or CR to the first date of disease relapse or death from any 
cause.  
x Time to Progression is measured from the date of enrollment to the first date of 
radiographic progression of disease per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_908691] entered this 
study and for alerting the Cancer Consortium IRB to any event that seems unusual in 
accordance with IRB policy. The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical 
care of patients during the study. The investigator remains responsible to follow, through an appropriate health care option, adverse events that are serious or that caused the patient to discontinue before completing the study. The patient should be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes. Frequency of follow-up is left to the discretion of the 
investigator. 
 Safety measurements that will be used in the study include physical examinations and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and blood chemistries). The adverse event will be graded for toxicity using the NCI CTC version 4.0. Toxicity assessment will occur at each monthly treatment visit, see Schedule of Events, Appendix 1. Any adverse events leading to a treatment interruption or dose reduction along with all adverse events that are 
grade 3 and higher will be recorded in the CRF.

tachycardia, enlarged liver).   
 
9.[ADDRESS_908693] one of the following criteria will be designated a serious 
adverse event (SAE). SAEs will be reported  to the Cancer Consortium IRB per Cancer 
Consortium policy/procedure.

x Requires initial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
x Is immediately life-threatening  
x Results in severe or permanent disability or incapacity 
x Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
x Any other important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or requires 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
Any events that are unequivocally due to  progression of disease should not be 
reported as a serious adverse event. 

9.4Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
 Adverse events will be collected after the patient has taken the first dose of study drug. After discontinuation from treatment, patients must be followed for all existing AEs for 
[ADDRESS_908694] dose of study drug or until another anti-cancer therapy is 
initiated.   
Prior to beginning study treatment, study site personnel will note the occurrence and 
nature of each patient’s medical condition(s). During the study, site personnel will again note any change in the condition(s) and/or the occurrence and nature of any adverse events. Toxicities are to be graded according to the NCI CTC version 4.0.   A description of the event, including its date of onset and resolution, any action taken should be provided along with the investigator’s assessment of causality. An event that is due to unequivocal progression of disease should not be reported as an AE. Any adverse events leading to a treatment interruption or dose reduction along with all grades [ADDRESS_908695] be recorded on a case report form (CRF).  
 
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after 
the patient has initiated study therapy and until [ADDRESS_908696] be reported to Eisai within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs experienced after this 30-day period should only be reported to Eisai if the 
investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug.


10.1  Sample Size Determination 
This is an open-label single-arm phase II study.  We will utilize the optimal two-stage 
Simon design, which minimizes the expected number of patients enrolled under the null hypothesis and given various other assumptions [Simon].  The null hypothesis is that the true response rate is 5% and the alternative hypothesis is that the true response rate is 20%.  If we additionally set the significance le vel to 0.05 (or less) and the power to be at 
least 80% (p0 = 0.05, p1 = 0.20, a = 0.05, b = 0. 20), then Simon’s design dictates that [ADDRESS_908697] stage.  If there are no responses among these 10, the study will be terminated due to lack of effica cy (i.e., this will be considered reasonably 
strong evidence against the alternative hypothesis that the response rate is 20% or more). 
If at least one response is observed among these 10, an additional 19 subjects will be 
recruited for a total of 29 subjects.  If 3 or fewer responses are seen among the 29 (an observed response rate of 10.3% or less), the regimen will be deemed to be not sufficiently efficacious for further study.  Four or more responses among the 29 will be viewed as sufficient evidence to deem the regimen as potentially efficacious (i.e., 
reasonably strong evidence that the true response rate is greater than 5%).  The expected number of patients to be enrolle d under the null hypothesis that the true 
response rate is 5% is 17.6, and the probabilit y of terminating early in this scenario (after 
the first stage, i.e., if no responses are seen in the first 10 patients) is 0.60.   
 
10.[ADDRESS_908698] 1.1 criteria. Duration of response and time to progression  will be reported as 
median values.  The disease control rate (DCR ), defined as the stable disease + partial 
response rate will be calculated.  Toxicity rates will be described as the overall percentage of patients experiencing Grade 3 or higher toxicity. 
 
10.3 Analysis of Other Endpoints  
Demographic characteristics such as patient age, gender, tumor type, and ECOG 
performance status will be tabulated.  All continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values).  All categorical data will be summarized using frequencies and percentages.  
Study drug administration will be described in terms of the total number of months 
administered, the median (range) of months administered, dose intensity, dose modifications, and reasons for the deviations from planned therapy.

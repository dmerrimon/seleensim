Objectives:  
Primary Objective : The primary  objecti ve of this study is to compare pain control and total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482731] (LIA) with EXPAREL to LIA without EXPAREL in adult subjects 
undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA).  
Secondary  Objec tives: The secondary  objecti ves of this study are to compare additional efficacy, safety, and 
health economic outcomes following LIA with EXPAREL to LIA without EXPAREL in adult subjects 
undergoing primary unilateral TKA.  
Methodology :  
This is a Phase 4 , multicenter , randomized, double -blind, controlled trial in approximately 300 adult subjects 
undergoing primary unilateral TKA under spi[INVESTIGATOR_482732] (10 -15 mg ). 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482727]; however, if the spi[INVESTIGATOR_482733], the patient 
may receive general anesthesia.  Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is then the preferred route.  If TIVA is 
contraindicated or not preferable, then inhalational anesthetics may be used.  The use of fentanyl or short -acting 
analogues will be permitted in both groups.     
The following medications will be allowed:  
• Anti-emetics may be used pre- operatively or intra -operatively.  
o Decadron [ADDRESS_620182] -operatively.  
• Lidocaine will be permitted, if used as a local anesthetic at the site of IV placement or as IV to stabilize 
heart rhythm.  
• Propofol is permitted for induction and intra -operatively, but not post -operatively.  
• Versed, [ADDRESS_620183] or present neurologic, cardiac, 
and general medical conditions that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_482734].  After the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, a  medical history, surgical history, physical 
examination, physical therapy assessment, 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, urine drug 
screen, and urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential will be conducted.  
On Day 0, all eligible subjects will receive the following medications within 4 hours prior to surgery:  
• Acetaminophen /paracetamol  975-1000 mg , orally (PO) .

discharge , the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually  as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_482796].  
Postsurgical Assessments  
Postsurgical clinical assessments will include pain intensity scores using a 10 -cm visual analog scale (VAS)  
(see Appendix 1); overall benefit of analgesia s core (OBAS) questionnaire (see Appendix 2); total postsurgical 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]; physical therapy assessment  (see Physical Therapy Assessment Manual ); nurse 's satisfaction 
with overall analgesia (see Appendix 3); and discharge readiness  (see Appendix 4).   
Adverse events will be recorded from the time the ICF is signed through  postsurgical  Day 29.  If  a cardiac AE , 
neurological AE, fall, or serious  AE (SAE) occurs during the study, a  pharmacokinetic ( PK) blood sample should 
be collected  as close as possible to when the event occurs.  Additionally, a 12- lead ECG, vital signs , and any 
appropriate clinical laboratory tests should be conducted  as close as possible to when the event occurs .  For out -
of-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400113], the medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_482797] a PK sample and ECG .   
Cardiac AEs of special interest include chest pain (angina, myocardial infarction), abnormal/irregular heart rate (bradycardia, tachycardia, extrasystoles), and shortness of breath requiring intervention.  Neurologic AEs of 
special interest include altered mental status/altered sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, seizure, trem ors, metallic 
taste, tinnitus, perioral numbness, and visual disturbance.  Additionally, the following events are of special 
interest if they persist or occur beyond 72 -hours postdose: dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and 
tingling/paresthesia.  
Postsurgical health economic outcome assessments will include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS), use of skilled 
nursing facility, outpatient physical therapy use, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], and use of other health services following 
discharge (phone calls related to postsurgical pain, unscheduled visits related to postsurgic al pain, and visits to 
emergency department) through postsurgical Day 29 . 
A follow -up visit will be scheduled for all subjects on postsurgical Day 14.   A follow -up phone call will be made 
on postsurgical Day 29 to all subjects who received study drug to as sess for AEs.  
Number of Subjects (P lanned):

7. INTRODUCTION 
7.1. Indication  
EXPAREL® was developed to provide a prolonged period of decreased pain and decreas ed 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_482747] a single dose administration without the use of indwelling catheters.  It is 
indicated for use as an analgesic injected into the surgical site for postsurgical pain relief.  
Effective postsurgical pain control is a critical element in pat ient recovery following surgery, 
as the majority of patients  may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days.  
Improved postsurgical pain management contributes to better healing, faster patient  mobilization, 
shortened hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959], and reduced healthcare costs ( American Society of Anesthesiologists 
Task Force on Pain Management 1995).  
7.2. Current Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/Treatments  
Current modalities of post surgical  analgesi c treatment include wound infiltration and nerve block 
with local anesthetic ag ents, usually  combined with the systemic administration of analgesics 
(multimodal therapy).  Multimodal therapy usually includes opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAID s), and/or acetaminophen provided through a variety of routes 
including intravenous ( IV), transdermal patch , and oral (PO) administration.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_482748] ; however , they also have considerable 
drawbacks including time and resources required for monitoring opi [INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related side effects.  
A reduction in the use of postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_482749]- induced adverse effects, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], nausea, vomiting, constipation, 
somnolence, pruritus, and urinary retention.   
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common surgical procedure that causes postsurgical pain of 
considerable intensity and duration.  While the s tandard analgesic medications administered prior 
to the TKA procedure and used to provide analgesic relief immediately after surgery can vary, 
most experts agree that multimodal pain control has become the standard of care .  In TKA, 
that may include local analgesics  (i.e., wound infiltration) combined with acetaminophen and a n 
NSAID  or a cyclooxygenase- 2 selective inhibitor with opi[INVESTIGATOR_482750] .  
This a pproach has been shown to significantly  reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_482751]- related 
adverse events ( AEs).  It is clear that opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related AEs  increase perioperative morbidity, 
including delay  in ambulation and participation in rehabilitation therapy  programs.  Also, 
analgesic adjuncts, such as dexamethasone (single intraoperative dose)  and gabapentinoids  
(i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin) may provide further benefit  (Joshi 2015) .  Following surgery , 
additional analgesic treatment  often includes opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Therefore, TKA was selected as an 
appropriate pain model for investigating a sustained -release formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], which 
has the potential to overcome the limitation reported in previous studies with regard to the duration of the analgesic effect obtained with commercially -available products.  
With over 70 million surgeries performed annually in the US, postoperative pain is a ubiquitous condition among our population.  While it is a predictable component of the postoperative process, such pain is often poorly managed, resulting in clinical and physiological changes that 
increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc.), diminish quality of life,

and extend length of stay, thereby [CONTACT_40561][INVESTIGATOR_40496] ( Oderda 2007) and reducing 
patient satisfaction.  Effective relief of acute pain with minimal opi[INVESTIGATOR_40497], on the 
other hand, may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications (like delay in regaining bowel 
function or an inability to tole rate liquid and solid oral intake, etc.), and conserve healthcare 
resources.  As  such, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires 
that all healthcare facilities practice adequate pain management and monitor opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related AE s 
(Apfelbaum 2003 ). 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_482752], and are currently considered the mainstay 
of treatment.  Adverse events related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_482753] (e.g., nausea, vomiting, ileus, 
confusion), however, represent one important reason that there is a need to develop opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-
sparing strategies.  Indeed, fear of gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as 
well as respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], present major limitations for the widespread use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] ( Chernin 2001 and Viscusi  2009).
  Furthermore, management of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related events 
often requires medical attention (e.g.,  opi[INVESTIGATOR_40500], antiemetic agents) and increased 
pharmacy/nursing time, which may raise healthcare expenses  (Carroll 1994) .   
7.3. EXPAREL (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469])  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40501] -acting local anesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration 
of action after local adminis tration, usually reported as less than 8 hours.  EXPAREL (Pacira 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, NJ) is a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40469].  It consists of microscopic spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam
® drug delivery 
system), organized in a honeycomb- like structure comprising numerous non- concentric internal 
aqueous chambers containing a bupi[INVESTIGATOR_40502] a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL.  Each 
chamber is separated from adjacent chambers by [CONTACT_40562].  The lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , 
cholesterol, and triglycerides) are naturally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482754] a complex mechanism involving 
reorganization of the barrier lipid membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an 
extended period of time.  A small amount of extra -liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (i.e., not bound within 
the DepoFoam particles) enables EXPAREL to have a similar onset of action to standard 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39912].   Because of this, EXPAREL has been noted in wound infiltration studies to 
have a bimodal curve ( Apseloff 2013), with an initial peak at approximately 0 -2 hours and a 
second peak at approximately 24 -48 hours ( Hu 2013).   
EXPAREL was approved by [CONTACT_40563] 2011 for administration into the surgical site to 
produce postsurgical analgesia.  The active  ingredient (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]) and  inactive ingredient 
(DepoFoam) of EXPAREL are each contained, though separately, in FDA -approved products:  
• Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338325], a well -characterized anesthet ic/analgesic, with more than 
35 years of its use in the US. 
• DepoFoam, a liposomal extended- release formulation contained in the marketed product 
DepoCyt® (1999).  The form of DepoFoam used in each of the products – DepoCyt and 
EXPAREL – has a slightly diff erent mixture of lipid components.

7.3.1. Summary of Human Experience with EXPAREL  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Wound Infiltration New Drug Application (NDA)  
During the original clinical development program (wound infiltration), Pacira conducted 
21 clinical studies and one observational follow -up study to investigate EXPAREL (formerly 
known as SKY0402™) .  Across these studies, a total of 1307 human subjects received 
EXPAREL  at doses ranging from  10-750 mg (or 9-665 mg  free base) and by [CONTACT_40564] : 
local administration into the surgical wound, subcutaneous, perineural, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] .  The 
investigational drug product has been well tolerated and the reported AEs occur red at a similar 
rate as the corresponding bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482755].   
In doses up to [ADDRESS_620231] been conducted; EXPAREL  did not cause significant 
QTc prolongation even at the highest dose evaluated.   
Across all studies, the types of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported and the 
incidence rates generally were similar between the EXPAREL  All Doses group (all doses 
combined) and the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124183].  The  incidence rate for each of the three most 
common TEAEs (nausea, constipation, and vomiting) was lower in the EXPAREL  All Dos es 
group than in the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124183].   
EXPAREL  was demonstrated to produce statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
analgesia in two pi[INVESTIGATOR_41958] -controlled Phase 3 studies (SKY0402- C-317 and SKY0402-
C-316) involving both orthopedic and soft tissue procedures over 36 and 72 hours, respectively.  
In addition to meeting their primary endpoints ( area under the curve [ AUC ] of the numeric rating 
scale [NRS] at rest [ NRS -R] pain intensity scores through 72 hours [ Study SKY0402- C-316] and 
through 24 hours [ Study SKY0402- C-317]), key secondary endpoints also were met, 
demonstrating prolonged analgesia and reduction of opi[INVESTIGATOR_482756] (percentage 
of subjects who received no supplementary opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]; total amount of postopera tive 
consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536];  and time to first use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536]).  The robust nature 
of the efficacy results in both pi[INVESTIGATOR_482757]0402- C-316 and SKY0402- C-317 was 
demonstrated across subgroups of subjects  with various prognostic fea tures and across 
demographic subgroups.   
An analysis was performed to compare the incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related AEs between the 
EXPAREL  and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482758]- controlled, parallel -group wound 
infiltration studies (SIMPLE TKA 311, SKY0402- C-208, SIMPLE Hemorrhoidectomy 312, 
SKY0402- C-209, SKY0402- C-207, SKY0402- C-201, and SIMPLE Breast Augmentation 315).  
There was a statistically significantly lower incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related AEs in the EXPAREL  
≤300 mg group compared to the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482759] 72 hours postdose.  This was 
consistent with the statistically significantly lower total postoperative consumption of opi[INVESTIGATOR_482760]  ≤300 mg group through 72 hours postdose.  Fewer subjects in the EXPAREL

(25.6% versu s 45.6%; p<0.0001).  The total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482761] (adjusted geometric 
mean) through 72 hours postdose was statistically significantly lower in the EXPAREL  ≤300 mg 
group (7.94 mg) compared to the bupi[INVESTIGATOR_124183] (15.84 mg); p<0.0001.  The EXPAREL

(standard deviation [ SD]) of the average number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- related AEs per subject was 
0.58 (0.522), and the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482761] (adjusted geometric mean) through 
72 hours postdose was 22.82 mg in  the EXPAREL  >300 mg group.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Nerve Block Supplemental NDA  
A total of 335 human subjects received EXPAREL as a nerve block over six clinical studies 
(SKY0402- 002, SKY0402- C-111, SKY0402- C-203, SK Y0402- C-211, 402- C-322, and 402- C-
323) utilizing three different surgical models ( femoral nerve block, intercostal nerve block, and 
ankle nerve block).  Doses administered ranged from 2 mg to 310 mg.  The data from three of these studies (SKY0402- 002, SKY0402- C-203, and SKY0402- C-211) were included in the 
wound infiltration NDA as well as the nerve block supplemental NDA.   
Phase [ADDRESS_620233] udy to investigate the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL  (total of 266 mg in 20 mL) 
divided into three equal doses in three syringes of approximately 88 mg in 6.6 mL volume per nerve and administered to each of three nerve segments (index nerve, nerve above, and nerve 
below) compared with saline placebo nerve block.  The primary objective was to e valuate the 
efficacy of intercostal nerve block using EXPAREL  compared with placebo in subjects 
undergoing posterolateral thoracotomy.  
Intercostal nerve block with EXPAREL  was well tolerated in subjects undergoing posterolateral 
thorac otomy.  However, the study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint:  there was no 
statistically significant difference in the mean AUC of the NRS -R pain intensity scores through 
[ADDRESS_620234] hoc analysis.  
Fifty -six subjects ( 59.6%) in the EXPAREL group and 46 subjects ( 50.5%) in the placebo group 
experienced one or more TEAEs.  Most of the TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity.  
Three subjects (3.2%) in the EXPAREL group and no subjects in the placebo group experienced a TE AE that were assessed by [CONTACT_331590].  Twelve subjects (12.8%) 
in the EXPAREL group and 9 subjects (9.9%) in the placebo group experienced one or more  
treatment -emergent serious AEs ( SAEs ).  Two of these subjects  in the EXPAREL group and 
four of these subjects in the placebo group died.  None of the SAEs or deaths was assessed by [CONTACT_482799].  Two subjects (2.1%) in the EXPAREL group and seven  
subjects (7.4%) in the placebo group were  withdrawn from the study due to an AE.  
Study 402 -C-323 was  a Phase 2/3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study in subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA under 
general or spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].  The primary objectives of Part 1 were  to (1) evaluate three dose 
levels of EXPAREL  versus placebo with respect to the magnitude and duration of the analgesic 
effect achieved following single dose injection femoral nerve block with EXPAREL , and 
(2) select a single therapeutic dose of EXPAREL  from the three dose levels to  be tested in Part 2.

Femoral  nerve block with EXPAREL  at 67 mg, 133 mg, and 266 mg was well tolerated in 
subjects undergoing TKA .  There were no discernible safety differences across the treatment 
groups.  There was a dose response in EXPAREL -treated sub jects.  A dose of 266 mg was 
selected for Part 2.  
Part 2 of the study met its primary efficacy endpoint: the difference in  the AUC of the NRS -R 
pain intensity scores through 72 hours between the EXPAREL group and the placebo group was statistically significant.  Additionally, the difference in the total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (mg) through 72 hours between the EXPAREL 266 mg group and the placebo group was 
statistically significant indicating lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_482762].   
In Part 1, there were no discernible safety differences across the treatment groups.  In Part 2, 
the incidences of TEAEs and treatment -emergent SAEs were similar between the EXPAREL 
266 mg group and the placebo group.  There were no deaths or withdrawals due to an AE during 
the study.  
During Part 2 of the study, three subjects experien ced a fall; each subject was in the EXPAREL 
[ADDRESS_620236] at 
24 hours, 72 hours, and on Day 30.  The rate of inpatient falls in study  402- C-323, 1.8%, was  
very similar to the overall incidence of inpatient falls in TKA patients (between 1% and  2%).  
The 20- meter walk test was used to determine whether there was any significant degree of motor 
blockade with use of EXPAREL.  The percentage of subjects who were able to complete the walk test at [ADDRESS_620237] 
was comparable between EXPAREL 266  mg and placebo groups at 24 hours (53.0% vs. 58.5%, 
respectively) and 72 hours (83.1%  vs. 92.6%, respectively).  This suggested a lack of significant 
motor blockade with EXPAREL.  This is confirmed by [CONTACT_482800]/motor function.  
Pooled Nerve Block Safety Data 
In the All Studies pool, 335 subjects received EXPAREL (All Doses), 33 subjects received 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974], and 207 subjects received placebo.

9. STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN  
9.1. Study Design  
This is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, controlled trial in approximately 
300 adult subjects undergoing primary unilateral TKA under spi[INVESTIGATOR_482763] (10-15 mg) . 
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482727]; however, if the spi[INVESTIGATOR_482728], the patient may receive general anesthesia.  Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) is 
then the preferred route.  If TIVA is contraindicated or not prefera ble, then inhalational 
anesthetics may be used.  The use of fentanyl or short -acting analogues will be permitted in both 
groups.     
The following medications will be allowed: 
• Anti-emetics may be used pre- operatively or intra -operatively.  
o Decadron [ADDRESS_620239] -operatively.  
• Lidocaine will be permitted, if used as a local anesthetic at the site of IV placement or as IV to stabiliz e heart rhythm.  
• Propofol is permitted for induction and intra -operatively, but not post -operatively.  
• Versed, [ADDRESS_620240] or present neurologic, cardiac, and general medical conditions that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_482764].  After the ICF is signed, a  medical 
history, surgical history, physical examination, physical therapy assessment, 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), vital sign measurements, urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test 
for women of childbearing potenti al will be conducted.  
On Day 0, all eligible subjects will receive the following medications within 4 hours prior to 
surgery:  
• Acetaminophen /paracetamol 975- 1000 mg, PO . 
• Celecoxib [ADDRESS_620241] has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative 
drugs: naproxen 500 mg PO or meloxicam 7.5 mg PO. 
• Pregabalin up to 300 mg, PO . 
On Day 0, all eligible subjects will also receive tranexamic acid , up to 2 grams (IV), at the 
beginning of surgery or intra -operatively.

Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to two treatment groups.  Subjects in Group 1 will receive LIA 
with EXPAREL 266 mg in 20 mL admixed with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% in 20 mL and expanded 
in volume with 80 mL normal saline  (total volume of 120 mL) .  Subjects in Group 2 will receive 
LIA with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% in 20 mL expanded in volume with 100 mL normal saline  (total 
volume of 120 mL) .   
Trained and qualified Investigators (see Appendix 5) will use their usual surgical technique to 
perform the TKA.  Use of tourniquets and drains, if used, will be recorded.  The case is to be 
completed at a time that will allow for a postsurgical physical therapy assessment on Day 0.  
Subjects will be requir ed to remain at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482735] a minimum of [ADDRESS_620242] still complete the 72 -hour assessments if they are discharged from 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482765] 72 hours after surgery.  
The use of fentanyl or analogues wil l be permitted (during surgery only) in both groups.  
Intraoperative administration of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_482737], local anesthetics, or anti -
inflammatory agents will be prohibited in both groups, unless needed to treat an AE.

In addition to LIA, all study participants will re ceive a standardized approach for managing 
postsur gical pain that includes a scheduled multimodal pain regimen including adjunctive 
analgesics, NSAIDs, and rescue analgesics as needed.  
Postsurgically, all subjects will receive the following scheduled medications until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954]:  
• Acetaminophen /paracetamol 975- 1000 mg PO every 8 hours (q8h).  The  total daily dose 
is not to exceed 3000 mg.  
• Celecoxib 200 mg PO every 12 hours (q12h) . 
o If a subject has an allergy to celecoxib, they may use the following alternative drugs: naproxen [ADDRESS_620244] may re -dose, per physician judgment, as needed (PRN), if initial medication 
fails. If a subject cannot tolerate PO medication, or has repeated failure of the rescue medication 
with oxycodone (PO), IV morphine (2.5- 5 mg) or hydromorphone ( 0.5-1 mg) may be 
administered q4h or PRN .  Patient -controlled analgesia (PCA) is not permitted .
  No other 
rescue analgesic agents, including NSAIDs, are permitted until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  After 
discharge, the analgesic regimen may be adjusted for each subject individually as deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_482801].  
Postsurgical Assessments 
Postsurgical clinical assessments will include pain intensity scores using a 10 -cm visual analog 
scale (VAS) (see Appendix 1); o verall benefit of analgesia score (OBAS) questionnaire 
(see Appendix 2); total postsurgical opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]; physical therapy assessment

special interest include altered mental status/altered sensorium, rigidity, dysarthria, seizure, tremors, metallic taste, tinnitus, perioral numbness, and visual disturbance.  Additionally, the 
following events are of special interest if they persist or occur beyond 72 -hours postdose: 
dizziness, hyperesthesia, muscular twitching, and tingling/paresthesia.  
Postsurgical health economic outcome a ssessments will include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS), 
use of skilled nursing facility, outpatient physical therapy use, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], and use of 
other health services following discharge (phone calls related to postsurgical pain, unscheduled visits related to postsurgical pain, and visits to emergency department) through postsurgical 
Day 29.   
A follow -up visit will be scheduled for all subjects on postsurgical Day 14.  A follow -up phone 
call will be made on postsurgical Day  [ADDRESS_620245] Participation  
Participation will begin at the signing of the ICF.  No more than 30 days should pass between signing of the ICF and the administration of EXPAREL.  The time from stud y drug 
administration through the end of participation is 30 ± 3 days.  Therefore, subjects may participate in the study for up to 63 days.

11.2.3. Description of Diluents  
Normal saline  for injection ( 80 mL) will be added to  the admixed study drug for Group 1 to 
achieve a total volume of 120 mL .  Normal saline  for injection ( 100 mL) will be added to the 
study drug in Group 2 ( bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% in 20 mL ) to achieve a total volume of 120 mL .   
11.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment  
11.3.1. Randomization Scheme  
Approximately 300 subjects ( 150 per treatment group) are planned for enrollment.  Subjects will 
be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive  either LIA with EXPAREL 266 mg admixed with  
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% (Group 1) or  LIA with bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% (Group 2). 
The randomization code will be generated by a centralized randomization system, which will 
also be used to communicate subject randomizations to study sites.  All  rando mized subjects will 
have both a unique subject identifier and a unique random code identifier.  No subject or random 
code identifiers are to be reused once assigned.   
11.3.2. Randomization Procedures  
Once a subject is identified as being qualified for the study pe r the eligibility  criteria ( see 
Section  10.1 and Section  10.2), and is at the study site for surgery, the unblinded research 
pharmacist or designee will obtain a randomization assignment.  The subject will be considered randomized into the study once the study treatment assignment is received.  
11.3.3. Replacement of Subject s 
Subjects who are randomized but are withdrawn from the study before receiving study drug or 
do not undergo the surgical procedure may  be replaced.  Once assigned, subject numbers will not 
be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who withdraw will be  assigned a unique subject 
number and randomized to treatment according to the procedures outlined above.  
11.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
During the clinical development of EXPAREL, single doses  ranging from [ADDRESS_620261] shown that because EXPAREL releases bupi[INVESTIGATOR_482770], administration of 
EXPAREL 266 mg results in a maximum plasma concentration ( C
max) equivalent to that seen 
with stan dard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 100 mg.  EXPAREL 266 mg, the FDA -approved and marketed 
dose, was selected for this study.  Based  on current clinical practice, b upi[INVESTIGATOR_31974] 0.5% was 
selected  for this study , consistent with standard of care  (Brener 2013) .   
11.5. Blinding  
11.5.1. Blinding Procedures  
To maintain the double -blind  study design , only the unblinded study personnel who are NOT 
involved with protocol -specific, post surgical  assessments may prepare  and administer  the study 
drug.  Staff members conducting study -specific, po stsurgical  assessments and the subject s will

EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_620262]’s treatment, unless it is necessary to manage 
treatment of  the S AE.  Expedited  SAEs will be unblinded by [CONTACT_482804].  
At each site, only the designated unblinded pharmacist will receive the unblinded randomization 
assignments and  be responsible for preparing study drug.  
Assignment of blinded and unblinded responsibilities regarding the preparation of study drug 
should take into account that EXPAREL  must be administered within [ADDRESS_620263] occurred prior to administration.  
The administration  of study drug will be recorded using the minimal amount of information 
necessary to avoid unblinding staff who will be participating in blinded procedures  (see 
Pharmacy Manual for ad ditional details) . 
No crossover will be permitted between the blinded and unblinded study site personnel during 
the study period.  The assignment of site monitors will also be segregated.  Blinded monitors will 
review case report forms ( CRFs ), clinic chart s, and all other study -related documents that do not 
disclose the allocation of study treatment.  Care should be taken in recording and review of 
operating r oom records to not record information in an unblinded fashion.  Pharmacy or any 
other clinic record s providing unblinded information (e.g., randomization, study drug 
preparation, study drug accountability, study drug administration) will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_482805].  
11.5.2. Unblinding Procedure s 
Subject treatment assignments should not be unblinded during the study by [CONTACT_297105].  The Investigator will have the ability to unblind a subject through the randomization 
system if he or she feels that subject safety warrants such unblindi ng.  However, the Investigator 
should discuss the safety issues with the Medical Monitor before attempting such unblinding, 
if possible.  Any unblinding will be documented through immediate notification of the Pacira 
study team and the Investigator  within the interactive response technology ( IRT) system used for 
randomization.  The reason for unblinding will be documented.  Any accidental unblinding events (i.e., through mishaps in the operating room or miscommunication among study staff) 
must be reported t o Pacira immediately.  
Any unblinding performed through the randomization system  will be recorded as a transaction 
and the appropriate study personnel will be notified that such a transaction occurred.  
Any incidence(s) of unblinding will be noted in the c linical s tudy report with a full discussion of 
the events leading to the decision to unblind.

14.1. Adverse Events  
14.1.1. Definitions  
Definition of Advers e Event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.  An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use in combination with 
another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function.  Adverse events include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status.  
The AE may involve any organ or syst em and can be represented by [CONTACT_482808] a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical sign, as well as by [CONTACT_482809].  Any medically relevant and untoward 
change after the su bject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating 
condition (e.g., migraine) is considered an AE.   
An AE that occurs after the ICF is signed and before the start of the study drug administration is identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE).  An AE that occurs after the administration of the study 
treatment is considered a TEAE.   
Definition of Adverse Reaction:  Any AE caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to c onclude that the drug caused the event.  
Definition of Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE.  A  suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than advers e reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  Suspected adverse 
reactions are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the event.  
14.1.2. Recording Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to docum ent all AEs (i.e., PTAEs and TEAEs) with an 
onset after the subject signs the ICF.  For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur through 
postsurgical Day [ADDRESS_620276] be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered related to 
study drug.  Whenever feasible, AE terms should be documented as medical diagnoses (highest

possible level of integration); otherwise, the AEs should be reported separately as individual 
signs or symptoms.  Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for example , an 
AE of nausea and vomiting should be listed as two separate events: the event of nausea and the event of vomiting.  If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on the AE CRF, the diagnosis should be recorded and the symptoms collapsed (re moved; i.e., lined through and 
initialed).  Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results should be reported as their clinical corollary (e.g., low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia).  
A continuous AE with varying grades of severity should be rec orded as one AE.  The highest 
grade of severity experienced by [CONTACT_482810].  
Any condition noted before the subject signs the ICF  will be listed as Medical History and is 
considered a pre -existing c ondition.  If a pre -existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more 
severe or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed , or after study drug administration, 
it is considered an AE.  Note: A change in treatment for a pre -existing condition (e.g., ne w high 
blood pressure medication), does not necessarily indicate an AE.  
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, severity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, action taken with subject due to an AE , and the 
outcome of the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if  applicable.   
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events  
In general, the severity of an AE should be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild : An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], caus ing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate:  An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
Severe:  An AE that prevents normal everyday activities . 
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is not the same as "serious," which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
patient's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obli gations. 
14.1.4. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration on a case -by-case basis.  General guidelines for determining the AE ’s causality to 
the study dru g are provided below.  
Unrelated:  A causal relationship between the study drug and the AE can be 
easily ruled out (e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a 
reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause).

Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.               402 -C-331 (TKA)  
EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 2 
 
Unlikely :  A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug 
administration which makes a causal relationship improbable and in 
which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation;  
Possible:  A clinical event with a reasonable t ime sequence to administration 
of the study drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals;  
Probable:  A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration 
of the study drug unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge); or  
Definite:  The pharmacological properties of the study drug(s) or of the 
substance class, and the course of the AE  after dechallenge and, if 
applicable, after rechallenge, and/or specific test indicate involvement of the study drug(s) in the occurrence/worsening of the AE, and no indication of other causes exists.
 
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess the o utcome of the AE after careful medical consideration, on a 
case- by-case basis.  General guidelines are provided below:  
Recovered/Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE. 
Recovered/Resolved  
with Sequelae:  The initial event resolved, but has a continuing abnormal condition 
as a result of the AE.  
Not Recovered/  
Not Resolved:  At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an 
undetermined outcome.  Note: ongoing AEs are not to be considered 
resolved as a result of death. 
Recovering/Resolving:  At the time of last assessment, the event was decreasing in frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected.  
Fatal:  The AE directly caused death.  
Unknown:  There was an inability to access the subject or the subject’ s records 
to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was lost to follow -up). 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject due to an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, diagnostic tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE. 
• None.  
• Medication.

• Non-pharmaceutical therapy.  (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the 
CRF.)  
• Discontinued from study.  
• Other.  (The specific action taken must be recorded.)  
14.2. Serious Adverse Events  
14.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered 
“serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death1. 
• A life -threatening adverse event2.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]3. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity4. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Medically significant5. 
1Death:  Any event resulting in a subject’s death  must be reported as an SAE.  However, death, 
in and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome.  The cause of death is the AE.  Therefore, the Investigator should make every effort to obtain and document the cause of death for all subjects who die during t he study.  If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], the cause of death remains unknown, the AE 
should be documented as an “unspecified fatal event.”  
2Life-threatening : An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, its occurren ce places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an 
AE that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
3Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] : It should be noted that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE.  It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40541] “serious” when it 
requires inpatient care.  Consequently, an SAE should not be reported in case of preplanned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the study.  However, 
any medical condition that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e., prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or requires the subject to be readmitted should be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent or significant incapacity : A substantial disruption of a  person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5Medically Significant : Important medical events that may not result in death, be  life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the y may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medically significant events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

question.  Where applicable, information from relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_482783] -identifying information redacted prior to forwarding to Pacira.  
In the event of a fatal or life- threatening SAE, any required follow -up must be provided to Pacira  
Drug Safety or designee immediately.  The Investigator will follow all SAEs until resolved or the condition stabilizes and further follow -up is not warranted.

15. STATISTICAL METHODS  
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed for this study.   
15.1. Study Hypothesis  
The first primary null hypothesis is H 01:µ1= µ2versus the alternative hypothesis H A1:µ1< µ2.  
If the first primary null hypothesis is rejected, then the second primary hypotheses will be tested.   
The second primary null hypothesis is H02:γ1= γ2versus the alternative hypothesis     
HA2:γ1< γ2.   
Where µ 1 and µ 2 are the mean VAS AUC (12-48) and γ1 and γ2 are the mean total opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023] (IV morphine equivalents) through 48 hours  for treatment group 1 and treatment 
group 2 respectively.  
15.2. Study Endpoints   
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section 12.2 (Efficacy Endpoints), 
Section  12.4 ( Health Economic Outcomes  Endpoints), and Section 12.6 (Safety Endpoints).  
15.3. Determination of Sample Size  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_620279] 90% power to detect a 
−0.[ADDRESS_620280] 
deviation (SD) is 0.[ADDRESS_620281] 90% power to detect a 
difference in AUC (12-48) of the VAS pain intensity score means of − [ADDRESS_620282] with a 0.025 two- sided significance level.  Three hundred subjects 
(150 per treatment arm) will be randomized into this study in order to have  260 evaluable 
subjects.  
15.4. Analysis Populations  
The fol lowing analysis sets are planned:  
The safety analysis set will include all s ubjects who receive study drug.  All analyses based on 
the safety set will be by [CONTACT_147246].  
The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analys is set who undergo the 
planned surgery.  All analyses based on the efficacy analysis set will be by [CONTACT_482813].  
15.5. Handling Subject Dropouts and Discontinuations  
For the calculation of the AUC of VAS pain intensity scores through any of the time periods, missing data will be imputed using a multiple imputation scheme.  Details for the multiple 
imputation scheme will be provided in the SAP.

15.6. Statistical Analyses  
15.6.1. Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline  characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
15.6.2. Study Compliance  
The percentage of subjects in each analysis set and the percentage who fail to complete the study 
(as well as the reasons for discontinuation) will be displayed by [CONTACT_1570]. 
15.6.3. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be based on randomized treatment, regardless of actual treatment 
received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Measures  
The primary efficacy measures in this study are the AUC of the VAS pain intensity scores from hour 12 through 48 hours and total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482784] 0 thru 48 hours.  For t he AUC 
of the VAS  pain intensity scores through 48 hours, EXPAREL  will be compared to placebo 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment and site as main effect s.  Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482785].  To protect the type 1 error rate, total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482786].  All comparisons will be at 
the 5% alpha level.  For the AUC comparison, the difference between the treatment groups will 
be estimated along with the 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals (CI s).  For the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482787], the ratio of EXPAREL to placebo along with the 2- sided 95% CI for 
the ratio will be estimated.  
Handling of Subjects Requiring Rescue Medication 
For AUC of the VAS  pain intensity scores, prior to analysis the w indowed Worst -Observation-
Carried -Forward (wWOCF) imputation method will be applied.  For subjects who take rescue 
pain medication, their pain intensity scores recorded within the window of controlled type of 
rescue medication will be replaced by [CONTACT_941] ‘wors t’ observation.  All pain scores within that 
window will be replaced by [CONTACT_941] ‘worst’ observation.  The worst observation will be the highest 
score in the time interval from the end of surgery to first rescue medication or, for subsequent 
rescue medication i ntervals, the end of the previous rescue window to the rescue medication.  
The VAS score at the time of rescue and end of previous rescue window are included in the 
determination of worst observation.  If the rescue medication intervals overlap, then worst  
observation may be the value carried from the prior interval.  Note that pain intensity scores in the window that are higher than the worst value prior to rescue pain medication will not be overwritten.  If no pain intensity score is available prior to the first rescue pain medication, the 
worst observation from all available measurements will be used instead. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Efficacy Measures  
The secondary efficacy measures will be analyzed using a hierarchical fixed -sequence stepwise 
testing procedur e.  To protect the Type [ADDRESS_620283] -PRO -0151.002    
CONFIDENTIAL  66 of 76  28 July  2016

EXPAREL®             Clinical Study Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_620284] is significant at the 0.05  level , then, and only then, 
the next secondary efficacy measure will be tested, and so forth.  The  result s will be declared 
statistically significant at the 0.05 significance level.   The secondary endpoints and order of the 
hierarchy will be defined in the SAP.  
The secondary VAS AUCs selected for analysis will be analyzed as described for the primary 
AUC.  
The secondary total opi[INVESTIGATOR_482788] 48 hours. 
The secondary endpoints measuring proportions of subjects selected for analysis will be analyzed 
using a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
The secondary t imes to event endpoints selected for analysis  will be analyzed using logistic 
regression and Kaplan -Meier method s. 
All other secondary endpoints will be summarized or tabulated as appropriate without testing for a treatment difference.  
15.6.4. Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on actual treatment received.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Events that start prior to the 
start of study drug administration will be identified in listings only.  Incidence rates of TEAEs 
and the proportion of subject prematurely withdrawn from the study due to a TEA E will be 
shown for each treatment group.  Incidence rates will also be displayed for each treatment group for study drug -related TEAEs and by [CONTACT_926].  Incidence rates of SAEs will also be shown for 
each treatment group.  All incidence rates will be cate gorized and displayed by [CONTACT_59134].  
15.6.5. Health Economic Outcomes  
Health economic outcomes will be summarized or tabulated as appropriate without testing for a 
treatment difference.  
15.7. Significance Testing  
All statistical comparisons will be at the 5% alpha level.

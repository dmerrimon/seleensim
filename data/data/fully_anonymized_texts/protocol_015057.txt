Study Title:  
A Phase 3 Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of AR -[ZIP_CODE] , a Cold Ther moreceptor  Modula tor, for 
the Treatment of Dry Eye Disease (COMET -3) 
Study Number:  
AR-[ZIP_CODE]- CS302 
Study Phase:  
3 
Primary Objective(s): 
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_117927] 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] compared to its vehicle dosed 
twice daily (BID) in subjects with dry eye disease (DED).  
Study Design:  
This will be a Phase 3, multicenter, vehicle -controlled, double -masked, randomized study conducted at 
approximately [ADDRESS_1057366] of 
Screening (Day -14) and Baseline  (Day 1)  visits as well as follow -up visits at Day  7, Day 14, Day 28 , and 
Day 90 (Study Exit). In addition, there will be a Day 60 dispensing visit.  
All subjects will be exposed to the Controlled Adverse Environment (CAE®) at the Screening visit to assess 
eligibility.  At the end of the Screening visit, all qualified subjects will be assigned to administer AR -[ZIP_CODE] 
vehicle BID to both eyes for approximately 14 days during the vehicle run -in period. After the vehicle run -in 
period, subjects will be re -evaluated at the Baseline visit for signs and symptoms of DED. Only subjects who 
requalify, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in the study and randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
within each site to receive 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE]  or AR -[ZIP_CODE] vehicle to be administered BID as 1 drop in each 
eye for 90 days. Efficacy will be assessed at  the Baseline (Day 1) visit and Day 7, Day 14, Day 28, and 
Day 90. At the end of the Day 90 visit,  subjects will exit the study. Safety assessments will be conducted at 
each study visit.

Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Determination  
Two hundred two (202) intention -to-treat ( ITT) population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 
99% power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR -[ZIP_CODE] over vehicle in the proportion of subjects ≥ 10  mm 
in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14, assuming a true difference of proportions (AR -[ZIP_CODE] vs 
vehicle) of 80% vs 30% and a two- sided alpha = 0.05.  
Additionally, 202 ITT population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 9 9% power to conclude 
superiority of 0.003% AR -[ZIP_CODE] over vehicle in the mean change from Baseline  in SANDE score on Day 28 
assuming a true difference (AR -[ZIP_CODE] minus vehicle) of -7.9, a common standard deviation of 17.72 , and a 
two-sided alpha = 0.05.  
Accounting for subject discontinuations, approximately 460 total subjects ( 230 per treatment arm) will be 
randomized assuming a dropout rate of 10%.  
 
Primary endpoint 
• Proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14  
 
Secondary endpoints  
• Change from Baseline in SANDE score on Day 28  
• Change from Baseline in  unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14 
• Change from Baseline  in SANDE Score on Day 90 
• Change from Baseline  in ODS  - VAS on Day 90 
• Change from Baseline  in Eye Dryness - VAS Day 90

Statistical Analyses  
Analysis of primary efficacy will be based on difference of proportions tests for dichotomous endpoints and 
analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) for change from Baseline  endpoints. Available data only will be used if 
the discontinuation rate is <  5% in each arm ; otherwise, an estimand based on multiple imputation will b e 
used for the primary analysis.  
Analysis of secondary efficacy will be conducted as described for the primary efficacy endpoints, using 
difference of proportions test s or ANCOVA with available data only if the discontinuation rate is < 5% in 
each arm and multiple imputation otherwise. The secondary efficacy endpoints will only be formally tested if 
the endpoint is significant at the α=0.05 level. Testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted 
using a fixed -sequence hierarchical strategy.

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1057382] of Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 8 
(TRPM8)  that is being developed for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of dry eye 
disease (DED ). 
1.1 Background 
DED is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis 
of the tear film, and accompanied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and 
hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles ( Craig 2017). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_510320] 5% to 50% of the global population ≥ 50 years old, depending on the definition of DED that was used (Baudouin 2014, Bron 2014, Rolando 2010, Smith 2007, Stapleton 2017, Uchino 2013).   
DED is broadly attributed to either impaired tear film production or excessive tear film evaporation. Either of these changes to the tear film can compromise the health of the ocular surface with associated epi[INVESTIGATOR_81636], which can adversely affect visual function. This can be experienced as blurred vision and ocular surface discomfort, often described as a 
feeling of dryness, burning, itchiness, or a sandy/gritty sensation. 
Treatment of DED is mainly symptomatic and very few specific pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_510321] ( Jones 2017) . Artificial tear preparations are generally the first therapy  
considered. Artificial tears are based on lubricating or viscosit y-increasing agents and there is 
limited evidence suggesting that any one type of artificial tear is markedly better than others 
(Doughty 2009). With respect to pharmaceuticals, various strategies exist for targeting the 
underlying ocular inflammation associated with DED with two products ( Restasis
® 
[0.05% cyclosporine ophthalmi c emulsion] and Cequa™ [0.09% cyclosporine ophthalmic 
solution]) indicated for increased tear production in patients with DED and a third , Xiidra® 
(5.0% lifitegrast ophthalmic solution), indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of DED. In addition, a novel cholinergic agonist, delivered nasally (varenicline solution, 
nasal spray 0.03mg [Tyrvaya™]), is approved for the treatment of signs and symptoms of 
DED. The short- term application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_770480]. 
In recent years, increased attention has been placed on the neuronal regulation of tear 
production. The trigeminal nerve provides the pathway for parasympathetic stimulation of the lacrimal functional unit and sensory stimulation of the cornea and conjunctiva is essential for initiating basal tear production (Belmonte 2015; Belmonte 2017). Reduced corneal 
neuron density and / or dysfunction of the corneal sensory nerves have been hypothesized to contribute to the pathogenesis of DED. The functional types of sensory nerve fibers of the 
cornea are distinguished by [CONTACT_770496], each of which confers a specific sensitivity to mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli.

    Branches of the trigeminal nerve innervating the cornea and lids selectively express cold 
sensitive thermoreceptors, called TRPM8  receptors ( Belmonte 2017, Viana 2011). TRPM8 
receptors are associated with the detection of ocular surface dryness and are activated by 
[CONTACT_770497] (Belmonte 2017, Yang 2017, Yang 2018). In addition, agonists of TRPM8 promote a 
cooling sensation that may be beneficial for reducing ocular discomfort and pain. Taken together, TRMP8 agonists may have a dual role in the potential treatment of DED by [CONTACT_770498] ( Abelson 2013).

isk/Benefit Assessment  
AR-[ZIP_CODE] has been used as a flavoring agent or adjuvant in the food industry and as a 
cooling agent for chewi ng gum and candies for more than a decade. AR-[ZIP_CODE] 
(FL-no. 16.123) is generally recognized as safe (GRAS)  as a flavoring agent or adjuvant 
(USFDA/FEMA GRAS  No. 4681) in or on human food products with no safety concerns at 
specified use levels ( EU/EFSA 2014 ; WHO/JECFA No. 2079 ). 
In vitro , in vivo  and ex vivo  studies have also been performed on AR-[ZIP_CODE] to demonstrate 
safety , tolerability and n egligible systemic exposure and to characterize the effective dose 
and the regimen of ocular administration of AR-[ZIP_CODE] ophthalmic solution. In addition, Aerie has conducted two good laboratory practice ( GLP ) 3-month repeated-dose topi[INVESTIGATOR_527134]-[ZIP_CODE] Ophthalmic Solution

    ocular toxicity studies of AR- [ZIP_CODE] ophthalmic solution in rabbits on clinical formulations 
and higher dose regimens then reflected in this Phase 3 study.  
DED represents a significant health care burden, contributing to approximately 25% of visits 
to ophthalmic clinics (Gayton 2009, Reddy 2004, Yu 2011) , and can significantly affect a 
patient’s daily activities and quality of life. Studies have shown that DE D interferes with 
reading, driving ability, computer use, work productivity and is associated with increased 
anxiety, stress and depression ( Noor 2018).  
Currently there are few effective treatments for DED. Artificial tears, which are comprised of various polymers and buffering excipi[INVESTIGATOR_770481]. Artificial tears are generally palliative in nature and do not halt disease progression. With respect to pharmaceuticals, various strategies exist for targeting the underlying ocular inflammation associated with DED, but only one (5% lifitegrast [Xiidra
®]), is indicated for the treatment of the signs and 
symptoms of DED. In addition, a novel cholinergic agonis t, delivered nasally (varenicline 
solution, nasal spray 0.03mg [Tyrvaya™]), is  approved for the treatment of signs and 
symptoms of DED.   
Thus, there is a significant unmet need for an effective topi[INVESTIGATOR_770482]. This unmet need in combination with all 
pre-clinical and clinical data collected to date support continu ed development of AR-[ZIP_CODE] 
as a potential new treatment for DED  with a high overall positive benefit- risk ratio to 
humans.   
2. STUDY O BJECTIVES

5.2 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
Subjects who qualify at the Screening  visit will be instructed  on proper administration 
procedure to instill 1 drop of AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle BID to both eyes on Days -14 to -1 ( vehicle 
run-in period) as follows: 1 drop in each eye in the morning (from approximately 7:00h to 
10:00h) and 1 drop in e ach eye in the evening (from approximately 19:00h to 22:00h). A new 
vial should be used for each administration time (both eyes dosed from one vial). Following the vehicle run -in period, those subjects who requalify at the Baseline visit,  will be  
randomize d into two  groups, in a 1:1 ratio  within each site, as follows:  
• 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] (n = 230) 
• AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle (n = 230) 
Subjects will be re -instructed on proper administration procedures at the Baseline visit. 
Subjects will be instructed to administer their randomized study intervention BID to both 
eyes as follows: 1 drop in each eye in the morning (from approximately 7:00h to 10:00h) and

    All qualified subjects will b e assigned to receive AR -[ZIP_CODE] vehicle BID to both eyes for 
approximately 14 days during the vehicle run-in period. Following the run- in period, all 
subjects who requalify at the Baseline visit (Day 1), will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, within 
each site, to receive 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] or AR-[ZIP_CODE] vehicle. The IRT will provide the site 
with the specific kit number(s) for each randomized subject at the time of randomization. Sites will dispense the study intervention according to the IRT instructions and the Sch edule 
of Visits and Assessments (Appendix 1).

Only in case of medical emergency or occurrence of adverse events that warrant unmasking in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], will the study intervention assignment(s) be unmasked and made available to the Investigator and the Medical Monitor. In the absence of medical need, the randomization code will not be available to the above personnel until after the study is completed and the database is locked. 
If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s study intervention assignment 
after an emergency situation, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_1689]. Only  after 
consultation with the Medical Monitor will a decision be made as to whether or not the study 
intervention for the subject should be unmasked. The study intervention  assignment will be 
revealed on a subject-by-subject basis, thus leaving the masking on the remaining subjects 
intact.

    The subjects’ used and unused study intervention vials will be collected at each visit from the 
Baseline visit  up to and including the Day 90 ( Exit) visit  to assess dosing  compliance . Dosing 
compliance will be based off the used and unused vial count. If the subject is less than 80% 
or more than 125% compliant with dosing based on the expected number of used and unused 
vials, then the subject will be deemed non- compliant and a protocol deviation must  be 
recorded. Subjects will be instructed on instillation and storage of study intervention at the 
end of each  visit (e xcluding the exit visit), as well as provided written instructions.  
These guidelines will be used by [CONTACT_770501]’s necessary compliance for the study and for recording deviations from this compliance. 
The study centers will keep an accurate accountability record that specifies the amount of 
study intervention dispensed to each subject, the amount of study intervention returned to the site, and the dates of each . 
5.7 Packaging and Labeling  
Each packaged unit will be labeled with an investigational label with the information required per applicable regulations.  
The products for each study intervention assignment will be packaged into identical randomized intervention kits; each randomized intervention kit will contain one of 2 study 
interventions : 0.003% AR -[ADDRESS_1057406]  be stored in clinic refrigerated 
(2°C to  8°C/36°F to 46°F) until dispensed to the subject . Temperature of the study 
intervention storage location at the site is to be monitored using a calibrated monitorin g 
device and documented. Study intervention should be removed from the refrigerator at least [ADDRESS_1057407] from light (store in carton) as directed on the investigational label. Subjects should be instructed not to freeze the study intervention.

6.6 Efficacy Assessments  
6.6.1 Symptom Questionnaire (Visual Analog Scale  (VAS) ) 
Subjects will be asked to rate each of the following DED symptoms (both eyes together), 
over the last 24 hours , each  on a separate VAS: ocular discomfort (ODS) , eye dryness (EDS) , 
 For each VAS, subject s will be asked to place a vertical mark on the horizontal 
line to indicate the level of each symptom, with 0 corresponding to “no symptom” and 
100 corresponding to “maximal symptom”. The assessment line length of each scale will be 100 mm (Figure 2).  Instructions for measuring each subject ’s response on each VAS can be 
found in the Manual of Procedures.

The SANDE questionnaire ( Schaumberg 2007 ) is comprise d of 2 unique VAS s to assess the 
frequency and severity of DED symptoms. Subjects will be asked to complete the SANDE to 
rate both the frequency and severity of DED symptoms for both eyes together. Each of the 
two questions will be accompanied by a VAS. The assessment line length of the scale will be 
100 mm and will be similar to the following depi[INVESTIGATOR_182513] (Figure 3). H igher scores indicat e

    If a disease is known at the time an AE is reported, this diagnosis should be recorded rather 
than listing of individual symptoms. However, if a cluster of symptoms cannot be identified 
as a single diagnosis, each individual event should be reported separately. If a diagnosis is subsequently known, it should be reported as follow-up information. 
When recording an AE, the following information should be provided on the study AE 
eCRF : 
1. Action Taken with Study Intervention: 
• None 
• Study Intervention Discontinued 
• Study Intervention Interrupted  
2. AE Outcome:

• Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Unknown/Lost to follow-up 
6.9.2 Adverse Event Definitions 
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
• Adverse event (AE): any untowa rd medical occurrence associated with the administration 
of the study intervention in humans, whether or not considered to be related to the study intervention.  
• Adverse reaction (AR) : any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
administrat ion of the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug 
(IND) safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the administration of the drug and the AE. See Section 6.9.5. 
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening AR : an AE or AR is considered “life- threatening” 
if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or AR that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious adverse reaction (SAR): an AE or AR is 
considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening or sight- threatening AE, subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial  disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, 
  
AR-[ZIP_CODE] Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1057417] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as a serious adverse event when the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_770491] a preexisting condition (with no increase in severity) .  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected AR: an AE or AR is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general inves tigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended. See Section 6.9.6. 
6.9.[ADDRESS_1057418] enrollment and the 
commencement of study medication, it should be recorded as an AE. Any change in the health status after commencement of study me dication should be recorded as treatment 
emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ). 
Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
 
[IP_ADDRESS] AEs and Prior Medical History  
Any medical condition present prior to informed consent which remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits. However, an AE should be 
recorded if the frequency, intensity, or the character of a pre -existing  condition worsens 
during the study period beyond what would be expected from the natural progression of that condition.  
Symptoms and signs that are consistent with the natural history of DED are not considered reportable adverse events. Such developments are recorded but are not reportable adverse events.  Worsening of symptoms and signs of DED  should be recorded as an AE or SAE only 
if judged by [CONTACT_527156]/or frequency or 
  
AR-[ZIP_CODE] Ophthalmic Solution   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1057419]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• 1 = Mild: present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activities  
• 2 = Moderate: bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A change in increased severity for a reported  AE will require a stop date for the previous 
severity and a new start and stop date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity may go from mild to moderate, or from moderate to severe. In either case, the start and stop dates should be record ed. 
Note: A severe AE is not the same as a serious AE. Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section 6.9.8 for further 
information on SAEs, SARs, and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]).   
6.9.5 Relationship  
A relationship between the AE and the study intervention  or study procedure will be 
determined by [CONTACT_737], as applicable, for each AE using these explanations:  
• Not Related: The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical condition, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease, or therapy administered to the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product, device, or procedure.  
• Unlikely Related: The event is most probably caused by [CONTACT_190643]’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between adminis tration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal 
relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_77425], device, or procedure.

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ZIP_CODE] -CS302, Amendment 2 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 49 of 81  
    • Possibly Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence f rom the time of 
study medication administration or study procedure and/or follows a known response 
pattern to the product, device or procedure but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or  concomitant therapy 
administered to the subject.  
• Related: The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication administration or study procedure and/or follows a known response pattern to the product, device or procedure and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_141477]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occurs immediately following study medication administration or procedure, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.
  
6.9.6 Expectedness 
• AEs or ARs are considered “unexpected” if they are not  listed in the Reference Safety 
Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure for AR-[ZIP_CODE] or are not  listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or ARs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring 
with this class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of AR-[ZIP_CODE] and are not  specifically mentioned as occurring with the study drug.  
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or ARs that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the phar macological properties of the drug but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
• An Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours from time of awareness) report 
any SAE or SAR (see Section 6.9.2 for definitions) to the Sponsor or its clinical research 
organization ( CRO) representative, whether or not considered drug-related, including 
those listed i n the protocol or Investigator’s Brochure. 
6.9.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (other than pregnancy tests results) that are noted as abnormal and 
clinically significant at study exit and that are changes from Screening values will be documented as AEs.

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting SAEs or SARs  
An Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) report any SAE or SAR 
(see Section  6.9.2 for definitions) to the Sponsor or its CRO representative, whether or not 
considered study intervention-related, including those listed in the protocol or Investigator’s Brochure. The Investigator must use the SAE report form and include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event. The Investigator must report any SAE or SAR that occurs or is observed during the study. In c ase of incomplete 
information, the Investigator must provide follow -up information as soon as possible, again 
using the SAE report form. The email or fax to submit the SAE report is found in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
SAE r eports will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1689]. Regulatory authorities , IRB, and 
Investigators at each of the study sites will be informed as required.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting S uspected  Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)   
The Investigator must immediately (i.e., within 24 hours) report S[LOCATION_003]Rs. In the event of 
S[LOCATION_003]R, the site must notify the Medical Monitor (Section 10.2) for the study and submit an 
SAE report form within [ADDRESS_1057420] provide follow-up information as soon as possible using the SAE report form.

A subject may exit the study by [CONTACT_770506]. Any subject may decide to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice.  
The subject may also be discon tinued from the study for the following reasons:  
• AEs (AEs including, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], clinically relevant laboratory 
abnormalities, and intercurrent diseases reported by [CONTACT_770507] )

The purpose of these visits is to provide the Sponsor and/or Health Regulatory Agency the 
opportunity to evaluate the progress of the study, document compliance with the protocol and 
with regulatory requirements, verify the accuracy and completeness of subject  eCRF s, 
resolve any apparent discrepancies or inconsistencies in the study records, and account for all investigational supplies.  
9. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mea n, median, 
standard deviation  (SD) , minimum and maximum. Qualitative variables will be summarized 
using counts and percentages.  
All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent medications, and AEs will be 
coded to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined as the last non -missing measure prior to the initiation of 
randomized study treatment  unless otherwise defined in the SAP.  
Change from Baseline (CFB) will be calculated as post-B aseline result  – Baseline ; treatment 
comparisons will be calculated as AR -[ZIP_CODE] – vehicle.  
All primary and secondary analyses will be two-sided at a significance level of 0.05.

    9.2 Unit of Analysis  
Safety endpoints will be analyzed for both eyes. For efficacy endpoints assessed at the eye 
level, the unit of analysis will be the “study eye” as defined in Section  9.3. For efficacy 
endpoints assessed OU, the unit of analysis with be the subject.  
9.[ADDRESS_1057431] one eye (the same eye) meeting all the inclusion criteria 
(Section 4.2 ) and none of the exclusion criteria (Section 4.3 ) at both Screening and Baseline 
visits where applicable. Study subjects will be dosed in both eyes. If both eyes are eligible at the time of randomization, the study eye will be defined as the eye with the lower pre -drop 
unanesthetized Schirmer score to be performed at the Baseline visit.  If both eyes still qualify 
and have the same pre- drop unanesthetized Schirmer score, the right eye will be designated 
as the study eye 
9.[ADDRESS_1057432] as specified in 
Estimand 1 from the intent- to-treat ( ITT) population, assuming the overall study 
discontinuation rate is <5% in each arm . If the study discontinuation rate is ≥ 5% in each arm 
then the primary analysis will be based on multiple imputation methodology as specified in Estimand 2, and the available data analyses will become robustness analyses.  
Additional robustness analyses will include repeating the primary analysis on the ITT population imputing missing data as failures for the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirm er score on Day 14 endpoint; using multiple imputation 
methodology under different assumptions of missingness (at random and not at random) each using 30 imputed values; the ITT population imputing missing data using last observation carried forward (LOCF); the ITT population using trimmed means; and the per- protocol (PP) 
population with available data per subject. 
9.5 Hypotheses  
The primary endpoints will be tested as follows:  
H
01: The difference between study eyes treated with AR -[ZIP_CODE] (0.003%) and study eyes 
treated with vehicle, in the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 = 0. 
H11: The difference between study eyes treated with AR -[ZIP_CODE] (0.003%) and study eyes 
treated with vehicle, in the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 ≠ 0.

etermination of Sample Size  
Two hundred two (202) ITT population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 
99% power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] over vehicle in the proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14, assuming a true difference of proportions (AR -[ZIP_CODE] vs vehicle) of 80% vs 30% and a two-sided 
alpha = 0.05. 
Additionally, 202 ITT population subjects (study eyes) per treatment group yields 
99% power to conclude superiority of 0.003% AR-[ZIP_CODE] over vehicle in the mean change from Baseline in SANDE score on Day 28 assuming a true  difference (AR -[ZIP_CODE] minus 
vehicle) of -7.9, a common SD  of 17.72, and a two-sided alpha = 0.05.  
Accounting for subject discontinuations, approximately 460 total subjects (230 per treatment arm) will be randomized assuming a dropout rate of 10%.  
9.8 Analysis Populations  
The following analysis population will be considered. 
9.8.1 Intent -to-Treat Population  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subjects. The primary efficacy 
analysis will be performed on the ITT population. Subjects in the ITT will be analyzed as 
randomized. 
9.8.2 Per Protocol Population 
The per protocol (PP) population includes subjects in the ITT population who do not have 
significant protocol deviations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study and 
who com plete the trial through Day 90. Protocol deviations will be assessed prior to database 
lock and unmasking. The PP population will be analyzed using observed data only for efficacy variables. Subjects in the PP population will be analyzed as treated.  
9.8.[ADDRESS_1057433]. The safety population will be analyzed for all safety assessments. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated.

9.10 Efficacy Analyses 
9.10.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
• Proportion of subjects ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer score on Day 14 
9.10.2 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary comparison in this trial will be between AR -[ZIP_CODE] (0.003%) and vehicle in the 
ITT population with available data per subject using Estimand 1 below if the overall study discontinuation rate is < 5%. If the discontinuation rate is ≥ 5%, this analysis will be a sensitivity analysis.  
Estimand 1: 
• Population: subjects in the ITT population with DED defined through enrollment 
criteria  
• Endpoint:  
o Proportion of subjects with ≥ 10 mm increase in unanesthetized Schirmer 
score on Day 14 
• Intercurrent event:  
o Discontinuation of investigational products is ignored. [treatment p olicy 
strategy]  
o Non-optimal compliance is ignored. [treatment policy strategy]  
o Withdrawal due to any reason. Missing data not imputed. [hypothetical strategy]  
• Population- level summary:  
o Difference in the proportion of subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_1057435] hetized 
Schirmer score on Day 14 between AR-[ZIP_CODE] (0.003%) and vehicle  
If the overall study discontinuation rate is ≥ 5% in each arm  then the primary analysis will be 
based on multiple imputation methodology using Estimand 2 below. If the discontinuation rate is < 5%  in each arm, this analysis will be a sensitivity analysis.

ICFs. If the Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person (e.g., Sponsor, other Investigator) who will accept the responsibility. Notice of this transfer, including written acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by [CONTACT_1034]. 
10.10 Protocol Deviations 
Per ICH E6 ( Good Clinical Practice [GCP ]) R2 Section 4.5.1 the Investigator/institution 
should conduct the trial in compliance with the protocol agreed with the Sponsor and, 
if required, by [CONTACT_770512]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_510341].  
Protocol waivers or deviations from the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria are not 
allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study regulatory acceptability or subject safety. Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.  
The site will contact [CONTACT_770513]/or exclusion criteria as 
needed prior to enrollment of the study subject. The Sponsor or their representative will document clarification requests and responses. If a subject does not meet any of the eligibility criteria, that subject may not be enrolled into the study. 
If the Investigator feels that in his/her clinical judgment, it is necessary to  promptly 
implement reasonable alternatives to, or deviations from, the protocol in consideration of the 
safety of study subjects, the Sponsor is to be notif ied of these alternatives and deviations, 
and the reasons for such changes are to be documented in the study records. The Investigator is to also notify his/her IRB of any such changes. 
If a significant protocol deviation is identified by [CONTACT_770514] e.g., 24 or 48 hours (as per 
IRB guidelines). The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation and decide whether any of these non-compliances should be reported to the relevant regulatory authority as a serious 
breach of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant regulatory  authorities’ requirements, 
the protocol deviation is not required to be reported immediately but is still required to be notified to the IRB, the spec ific protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress 
report.  
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to the database lock.

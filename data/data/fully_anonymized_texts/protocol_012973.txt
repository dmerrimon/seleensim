3. Abstract:  
 
Background:  Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI) can be the beginning of a disease process that 
produces change that continue years after injury resulting in debilitating chronic TBI 
symptomatology. Some studies find that up to 30% of people that have sustained mild traumatic 
brain injury ( mTBI ) have pe rsistent symptoms. Enduring cognitive deficits after mTBI present 
barriers to full functional recovery and re -entry into societal roles.  Executive dysfunction, poor 
attention -concentration, and memory difficulties are the most persistent disabilities face d by 
[CONTACT_447906]. An estimate 44% of Veterans with mTBI also have post-traumatic  stress 
disorder ( PTSD ) with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_89377].  Attention problems are reported by 50% of 
combat Veterans which are requisite for other cognitive processes that are vita l to everyday 
functioning such as memory, problem solving, language skills, and the cognitive control of 
behavior . Effective interventions are needed to address the cognitive deficits resulting from 
chronic mTBI. Of the attention and executive function tre atments currently used in clinical 
practice, there is a dearth of those with substantial evidence to support effectiveness. Current 
cognitive interventions for Veterans with mTBI did not include specific attention training, lacked 
rigorous training or foun d improvement only on self -reported symptoms. In order to improve 
translation, strategy training has been recommended to accompany attention training. Goal 
Management Training (GMT) is such a strategy training and has been found to be improve 
executive fun ction skills in Veterans with mTBI. However, GMT lacks specific attention training, 
which is a limitation in that attention is a component of the normal executive function used in 
goal management. Given the need in mTBI lack of rigor in attention training,  the relationship of 
attention to goal management, and the promise of combined attention training and goal

drill method of attention training that also includes i ndividual functional goals for attention 
recovery.  
 
Method: This is a randomized control pi[INVESTIGATOR_447889] [ADDRESS_569561] administration at pre/post and six mon ths 
following treatment. A multiple linear regression model will be used to determine if there is a 
significant association between treatment effect and comorbidities such as PTSD, depression, 
anxiety, pain, sleep, substance abuse, etc.  
4.  Background:  
Problem.  TBI can be the beginning of a disease process that produces change that continue 
years after injury resulting in debilitating chronic TBI symptomatology1, 2. Some studies find that 
up to 30% of people that have sustained mTBI have persistent symptoms3. Persistent 
symptoms following mTBI have been related to diffuse axonal injury4 or neuroinflammatory 
reactions5. Enduring cognitive deficits after mTBI present barriers to full functional recovery and 
re-entry into societal roles.  Executive dysfunction, poor attention -concentration, and memory 
difficulti es are the most persistent disabilities faced by [CONTACT_447906]6, 7. An estimate 44% of 
Veterans with mTBI also have PTSD8 with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_89377].  Attention problems are 
reported by 50% of combat Veterans9 which  are requisite for other cognitive processes that are 
vital to everyday functioning such as memory, problem solving, language skills, and  the 
cognitive control of behavior. Associated comorbidities also impair cognition making it difficult to 
diagnose and treat Veterans with mTBI. These comorbidities include pain10, substance abuse11, 
anxiety12, depression13, fatigue14 and sleep disturbances15 that also specifically impact attention.  
Cognitive deficits are the most debilitating following mild  to severe TBI and can lead to long -
term disability and immense economic burden16. 
Gaps in Knowledge.  
Studies of training and response to treatment .  Effective interventions are needed to address the 
cognitive deficits resulting from chronic mTBI. Of the attention and executive fu nction treatments 
currently used in clinical practice, there is a dearth of those with substantial evidence to support 
effectiveness17. Most studies were conducted for moderate to severe TBI.  Recent studies in 
Military and Ve terans with mTBI reported improvement following cognitive rehabilitation18-23; but 
there were study limitations with remaining serious gaps in knowledge.  For example, there was 
absence of rigor in attention train ing.  Cognitive interventions did not include specific attention 
training23 or the attention training consisted of simply “paying attention during conversations”19, 
22. The time spent engaged in attention training was frequently not reported19, 21, 22. Some 
studies found improvement only in subjective self -report of symptoms or lacked improvement in 
objective cognitive tests18-21.  Finally, training methods have not specifically targeted the 
orienting component of attention that is problemat ic for Veterans with mTBI24-26.  Some studies 
of attention training have shown some improved attention on laboratory measures, but, 
unfortunately, limited translation to improvement of real -world task performance27.

IRB version 03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/2020       In order to improve translation, strategy training has been recommended to accompany 
attention training28.  Goal Management Training (GMT) is such a strategy training designed to 
improve cognition regardless of etiology.  GMT is a manualized, interactive, psychoed ucational 
meta -strategy intervention designed to promote a mindful approach to complex real -life tasks 
and reduce lapses of attention in brain -injury survivors29-31. Additionally, GMT employs some 
compensatory strategies for achieving goals, which is recommended as an effective cognitive 
treatment by [CONTACT_447907] (INCOG)32.  A recent study 
showed benefits of combining attention and c ompensatory training in pediatrics33. GMT is a 
promising intervention, and effect size improved when combined with personal goal setting or 
problem solving34.  We recently demonstrated executive function improvement in Veterans with 
chronic blast -related mild TBI in response to GMT, finding significant improvement in executive 
function, according to the Computerized Tower of London (cTOL)35, 36. However, GMT lacks 
rigorous attention training, which is a limitation in that attention is a necessary component of the 
normal e xecutive function needed for goal management.   
     Given the need in mTBI, lack of rigor in attention training, the relationship of attention to goal 
management, and the promise of combined attention training and goal management training; 
we will combine  the metacognitive intervention, GMT, with a drill method of attention training 
that also includes individual functional goals for attention recovery.  
5. Specific Aims:  
     Effective interventions for attention and executive function for Veterans dealing with 
pervasive symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) are desperately needed.   
Veterans with mTBI and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) experience cognitive and 
emotional barriers that interfere with the ability to fully participate in so cietal roles.  
Specifically, both mTBI and PTSD are associated with altered attention25, [ADDRESS_569562] limited translation to improvement of re al-world tasks27.  To improve translation, 
strategy training has been recommended to accompany attention training28.  In our 
preliminary work we tested feasibility and potential for a strategy intervention entitled Goal 
Management Training (GMT) finding significant improvements in ex ecutive function, 
according to the Computerized Tower of London (cTOL).    
      Given the in -laboratory success of attention training, the prior failure of attention training 
to translate to real -world tasks, and the feasibility and promise of Goal Manage ment 
Training, we will innovatively combine attention and Goal Management Training. This

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/[ADDRESS_569563] to executive function but 
facilitate implementation of attention strategies into functional behavior.  Ou tcomes of 
Veterans with mTBI (25 treatment/25 control)  will be measured with objective 
neuropsychological tests of attention and executive function, as well as real -world task 
performance.  
  
Aim 1 : Determine the treatment effect of attention training comb ined with GMT in 
Veterans with mTBI.  
Hypothesis 1:  GMT plus attention training will significantly improve performance on tests of 
cognition compared to the control group .  
Primary measure : Computerized Tower of London  (cTOL ) total time, time to first move and 
optimal moves). We have found significant improvement in cTOL following GMT in previous 
cohorts of Veterans with blast -related mTBI and anticipate improvement following a 
combined intervention.   
Secondary measure : Attention Network Task  (ANT) reaction time and errors for one or all 
dissociable components of three attentional systems (orienting, alerting, executive control) 
following intervention. There is little understanding of components of impaired attention and 
how it impacts executive function; therefore, there is limited guidance in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_447890]. We will conduct an experimental task (attention network task) that disassociates 
three attentional components (alerting, orienting, and executive control). W e will specifically 
target the orienting component of attention that is problematic for Veterans with mTBI and 
PTSD24, 26.  Attentional processes are vital to goal -directed behavior. There is great 
potential in the use of these measures to identify individual differences (type of attention 
deficit) that could moderate treatment -related improvement and inform targeted 
interventions.  
Hypothesis 2 : Treatment gains will translate to functional activities compared to controls .  
Primary measure  of functional performance: test of grocery shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (TOGSS) total 
time and optimal strategy use. The TOGSS captures efficiency in completing a real -world 
task and aligns with the strategy skills learned in GMT.   
Secondary measure  of community part icipation, the  Community Reintegration of 
Servicemembers (CRIS) extent of participation. The CRIS demonstrated significant GMT 
treatment effect compared to controls in Veterans with mTBI. The combined treatment of 
attention training using drill training an d implementing strategies to improve attention in a 
functional setting through GMT will potentiate treatment effect to functional activities. 
Measuring functional improvement through performance -based measures and self -report of 
engagement in activities wi ll demonstrate treatment translation.    
Tertiary analysis  will be conducted on moderator variables: PTSD symptoms, Pain, History 
of Substance Abuse, Depression, number of concussions and combat exposure.      
     Successful completion of the proposed stud y will provide insight into the effectiveness of 
the innovative combined treatment of attention and executive function in Veterans with 
mTBI and PTSD. Use of the ANT could better target treatment and lead to future 
examination of attention treatment on neu roplasticity.

least 18 years old.  
 
Protection of Data:  
 
Datasets will be de -identified; participants will not be identified by [CONTACT_447910].  Data will be entered into electronic databases that will 
include a study ID (not personal identifying information) and saved in a VA secured shared 
folder with access limited to research team members. Data from the Smartphone AP will be 
transferred via MyHealtheVet secure messaging which is compliant with all information 
security requirements with encryption from end -to-end. Participants’ study records will not 
be released without written permission from the participant. Records of particip ants will be 
kept in locked file cabinets in a locked room. Access to those files will be restricted to 
authorized study personnel.  
 
Recruitment : Patients from the BRRC recruitment data base will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]; clinicians will 
hand out fliers in North Flori da/South Georgia Veterans Health Administration outpatient clinics; 
letters to inform Veterans with mTBI diagnoses of the study will be mailed; and fliers will be 
distributed to local Veterans groups and Veteran support centers at community colleges and 
universities.  The proposed study has an existing approved protocol and patients are 
recruited through a variety of proven methods: patients from the BRRC recruitment data 
base will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]; clinicians will hand out fliers in North [LOCATION_012]/South Georgia 
Veterans Health Administration outpatient clinics; letters to inform Veterans with mTBI 
diagnoses of the study  will be mailed; and fliers  will be distributed to local Veterans groups 
and Veteran support centers at community colleges and universities.  
Interested participants will be scheduled for an appointment to determine eligibility criteria. 
Once potential participants are deemed eligible, written informed consent will be obtained 
from each subject by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_447892]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_447893]. 
Participants will be asked to sign an informed consent after the purpose of the project, risks, 
and benefits have been fully explained in language a l ayperson can understand.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/[ADDRESS_569569] 2 -3 times a week.  The informant will be scheduled for an 
appointment for consent and to complete the BRIEF -A questionnaire.  They will receive a phone 
call once a week to answer whether the homework was easy or difficult for the Veteran and see 
if there are specific cognitive issues that need to be addressed.   
Due to the COVID 19 outbreak, this protocol has been modified to reduce  the participants' risk 
of contracting  COVID -[ADDRESS_569570] (VVC) service . 
Randomization Procedure : 25 of the Veterans will be randomized to treatment while 25 will 
engage in BHW/movies as control participants. The Pocock -Simon covariate adaptive 
randomization procedure will be used so that, for each PTSD severity category, approximately 
50% (25/25) of Veterans are assigned to treatment group; consequently, there will be 
approximately equal proportion of PTSD participants assigned to the treatment an d control 
groups.  
Each group  of the [ADDRESS_569571] of Grocery Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_447894] a virtual setting (V -Mart) during session 7 or 8.  
Intervention  
GMT : is a [ADDRESS_569572]. Each session builds on the 
steps of a five -stage planning and problem -solving strategy. Veterans will be taug ht to generate 
and verbalize the following five -steps: “stop -what am I doing?”, “define the goal”, “list the steps”, 
“learn the steps”; then, “check -am I doing what I planned?” The five -stage strategy is then 
incorporated into a variety of activities in th e laboratory and in -home assignments. At each 
session, the participant discusses utilization of the strategies in daily life and reviews progress. 
The following steps are taught during simulated tasks:  1) Identify Main Goal; 2) Break down 
task into sub -goals and steps for each goal; 3) List supplies needed; 4) Recognize potential 
barriers to completing goal; 5) Determine strategy to accomplish task: 6) Prepare to begin task 
with “presence of mind” exercise; 7) State goal out loud; 8) Begin task and stop se lf frequently 
to state main goal out loud and check to be sure one is working toward the goal (on target).  
Generalization  of laboratory practice to home environment is of critical importance. 
Unfortunately, the original GMT did not provide a method to mon itor the frequency or success of 
home practice, nor a method to support productive practice in the home environment. In our 
prior work, we developed The Veteran’s Task Manager (A Smartphone application (AP)), which 
was specifically developed to utilize the  strategies taught in the lab during GMT, support the 
home practice mandated by [CONTACT_1222], and monitor practice. Participants will use the AP features to 
break down tasks, estimate time to complete, check off each step as completed, respond to the 
visual/vibrati ng alert of “Goal” and respond to alert if “On Target”. Information will be collected 
by [CONTACT_447911], such as accuracy of planned steps, time to complete task, and number of 
distractions from goal. The AP will record the participant’s performance in functional practice at 
home and this information will be reviewed at the next lab session and recorded.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/2020        Attention Training : Veterans will also engage in BrainHQTM attention training at home for 
one-hour, five days/ week  comprised of selected components of BrainHQ from Posit Science 
Corporation (Table1).  Once a week the Veteran will review and engage in Brain HQ with the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_447895] a second two -hour weekly tel e-health session. This web -based computerized 
CRT modality of cognitive training is a restorative or “bottom -up” approach that targets basic  
cognitive skills such as arousal and vigilance processes, attention and information processing, 
and directly engage s fundamental attention -control 
skills through repetitive graded exercises. BrainHQ is 
software designed such that the speed and complexity 
of exercises increase as the user’s performance 
improves to consistently maintain a high proportion of 
successful tr ials while gradually increasing task 
demands. BrainHQ has been designed as a web -
based platform, and participants can perform tasks at 
home on their own home computers.  Veterans will be 
given a code and password from the research staff to 
sign into Brain H Q so that their personal information is not recorded. Speed and accuracy as 
well as time spent engaged are downloaded directly from the Brain HQ website by [CONTACT_237766]. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_447896].  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_447897].  
      Control Group : Participants that are randomized to this group will provide a control for 
repeat testing and will provide similar characteristics with the treatment group, such as severity 
of PTSD. To equate for time and exposure to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], the participants  will engage in a Brain 
Health Workshop (BHW) and watch geographic movies. BHW was developed specifically for 
consistency with GMT session length and contact [CONTACT_447912]49. BHW is an education 
presentation on brain function and cognitive principle s of learning with homework  (readings 
assigned ) and quizzes on information covered. To match time and contact [CONTACT_447913], 
control participants will meet with the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_65585] a separate two -hour session from BHW and 
watch geographic movies foll owed by a short quiz.  This will equate the amount of time and 
contact [CONTACT_447914].  
Measuremen t: Veterans with mTBI will qualify for the study if they demonstrate a deficit in 
attention as measured by [CONTACT_447915]. The 
following measures (Table 2) will be administered at week 1 (before intervention), week 11 
(after intervention) and at week 36 (six months after intervention). The prim ary outcome 
measures for Aim 1, will be the computerized Tower of London (cTOL)[ADDRESS_569573] of 
Grocery Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_206517] (TOGGS).  
The following measures will be administered by [CONTACT_447916]:  Combat Exposure Scale, Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, Beck 
Depression Inventory, Alcoholic Use Disorders Identification Test, PTSD Checklist for DSM5, 
Brief Pain Inventory, Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults, and State

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/2020  Description of Measures  
1. Screening Measures:  
National Adult Reading Test (NART) is an oral reading test consisting of 50 words (Nelson and 
Willison, 1991). The NART can be used to estimate premorbid intelligence and will be used as a 
screen. Similar to Levine et al. (2007), we will use the cut off sc ore of > [ADDRESS_569575] of Memory Malingering  (TOMM ): is frequently used to  detect poor effort on 
neuropsychological assessment and has been validated with TBI patients (Tombaugh, 1996; 
Slick et al., 2004; DeBoar, 2007). This test will be used to screen out patients scoring 45 or 
below on Trial 2 or the Retention Trial (Trial 1 s cores will not be used) to provide a level of 
confidence to the results of outcome measures.  
Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological  Status (RBANS ): is a 
cognitive  screening instrument The RBANS is composed of [ADDRESS_569576] Learning and Story Memory comprise the 
Immediate Memory Index; Figure Copy and Line Orientation yield the 
Visuospatial/Constructional Index; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_333638]; and Digit Span and Coding comprise the Attention Index. Four subtests 
make up the Delayed Memory Index, specifically, List Recall, List Recognition, Story Recall, 
and Figure Recall  (Randolph, Tierney, Mohr, & Chase, 1998 ). Administration is 
approximately 20 minutes and has been used to assess cognition in mTBI (Cooper et al., 
2010 ). An attention score of 1.5 SD below the mean will be used to include participant s with an 
attention deficit.  The index scores of the RBANS will  also be used to characterize the 
patient’s cognitive capacity and to determine whether aspects of cognitive ability impact 
response to treatment.  
2. Primary Treatment Outcome Measure s:  
Tower of London (TOL) : is a computerized program in which patients are shown two 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_333635] a goal board and a test board (Unterrainer et al, 2006).  Each 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_447898], with the balls in a

possible moves of the balls in the test pi[INVESTIGATOR_447899] [ADDRESS_569577] administration is less than 30 minutes for each session 
(pre/post/follow -up). Each set consists of 30 problems of variable difficulty, determined by 
[CONTACT_156551], such as, the number of moves needed to solve the problem (Berg and By[CONTACT_26752], 
2002).  In turn, each set consists of the same number of 4, 5, [ADDRESS_569578] the planning process (Kaller, 2007, 2008, 200 9; Berg, 
By[CONTACT_26752], McNamara, & Case, 2010 ; Kaller, Unterrainer, Rahm, & Halsband, 2004 ). The 
dependent variables are the total  time spent solving the problem and the optimal moves 
made toward the goal display. Based on our previous studies, executive function represents 
three factors (behavior regulation, emotional regulation and metacognition) (Waid, Wen, 
Heaton, and Velozo, sub mitted to Neuropsychology).  GMT is a metacognitive training with 
emphasis on planning prior to engaging in a complex task. Therefore, a primary measure 
that captures the planning and problem solving of a multi -step task, called the Tower of

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/2020  London (TOL), was selected. Based on results from our preliminary study, the dependent 
variables of total time and optimal moves will be used to determine treatment effect.  While  
not all of the participants in our previous work demonstrated significant improvement on 
these variables, group differences based on paired T -tests were significant in Total Time 
(p=0.026) and Optimal Moves (p=0.022) from baseline to treatment.  In addition to our 
findings, Levine (2011) demonstrated a significant change in the TOL following GM T for a 
mixed neurological sample compared to a control group.  Thus, the TOL appears to be 
sensitive to the effects of GMT  and will be compared from post and 6-month  follow -up to 
screening to determine treatment gains (HO#1) . 
Test of Grocery Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_447900] (TOGSS):  is a performance -based measure of a person’s 
ability to locate items in an actual grocery store. In addition to measuring specific grocery 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], TOGSS scores are associated with cognitive abilities, particularly executive 
functioning  (Rempfer, Hamera, Brown, & Cromwell, 2003; Zayat, 2006). TOGSS 
administration is [ADDRESS_569579] priced brand for each one. Outcome variables (accuracy, 
speed and effi ciency) will be tested to determine improvement in functional performance 
(HO#2). Veterans will have the option of practicing shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10714] a virtual grocery store 
displayed on a monitor using a game controller to navigate prior to completing the TOGGS 
in an  actual grocery store. Both the Veteran and the clinician will identify barriers to efficient 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_447901].  
3. Secondary Measures:  
Attention Network Task (ANT) : presents participants with a target item (>) on a computer screen 
surrounded by [CONTACT_424979] (> > > > >), neutral ( - - > - -), or incongruent flanker stimuli. Stimulus 
presentation is preceded by [CONTACT_447917] [ADDRESS_569580]. To characterize 
the type of attention deficits of each participant, we will use the attention network task (ANT) 
to determine the relationship with the alerting, orienti ng and executive aspects of attention 
to treatment effects. Given the success of the ANT in discriminating impairment among the 
three attentional networks in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD, we will utilize this method to 
study differential response of attenti on networks to cognitive remediation ( Ho #1, secondary 
measure).  
Community Reintegration of Service Members (CRIS): will be used to measure 
participation. The CRIS was developed specifically for soldiers with disabilities (Resnik et 
al., 2009, 2011) and is  available in two formats, a paper and pencil version with [ADDRESS_569581] good internal reliability: Extent of Participation = 
0.91, Perce ived Limitations = 0.93, and Satisfaction with Participation = 0.97 (Resnik et al, 
2009). Meaningful detectable change indices were 5.9, 6.2, and 3.6, respectively for Extent, 
Perceived and Satisfaction subscales (Resinik et al, 2012). CRIS -CAT scores were  
predictive of SF -12 physical and mental health related quality of life scores at the 1-year 
follow -up (Resinik et al, 2012). Preliminary analysis described reveals good internal 
reliability and separation into ability levels in a sample of [ADDRESS_569582]  
reliability is 0.95 for Extent of participation; 0.85 for Perceive limitation; and 0.95 for 
Satisfaction scales  (Ho#2, secondary measure).

self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM -5 symptoms of PTSD. The PCL -5 has a variety 
of purposes, including: 1. Monitoring symptom change during and after treatme nt 2. Screening 
individuals for PTSD 3. Making a provisional PTSD diagnosis. The PCL -[ADDRESS_569584] of PTSD on the response to treatment.  
Brief Pain Inventory  (BPI) is a 9-item self-administered questionnaire used to evaluate the 
severity of a patient's pain and the impact of this pain on the patient's daily functioning. The 
patient is asked to rate their worst, least, average, and current pain intensity, list current 
treatments  and their perceived effectiveness, and rate the degree that  pain interferes with 
general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other persons, sleep, and 
enjoyment of life on a 10-point  scale. The BPI -sf is a modification of the Brief Pain Inventory - 
Long Form, which includes additional questions on demographics (date of birth, marital status, 
education, employment), pain history, aggravating and easing factors, treatment and 
medication , pain quality, and response to treatment.  
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test ( AUDIT -C) asks [ADDRESS_569585] of alcohol use on the response to treatment.   
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II):  is a 21-item questionnaire filled out by [CONTACT_333652].  Questions are rated using 
a 4-point  scale and cover symptoms of depression such as hopelessness, irritability, guilt, 
fatigue, weight loss and la ck of interest in sex. The reliability of the BDI in TBI has been 
reported at .92 (Green, 2001; Beck et al, 1996).    
Combat Exposure Scale  (CES) is 7 -item self -report measure that determines wartime stressors 
exhibited by [CONTACT_41294]. Individuals are asked to respond based on their exposure to various 
combat engagements, such as firing rounds at the enemy and being on dangerous duty.  
Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory  (NSI) is a 22 -item self -report questionnaire developed by 
[CONTACT_447918] (1995) to asse ss post-concussion  symptoms after mild traumatic brain 
injury.  
State -Trait-Anger -Expression -Inventory  (STAXI ) is a self-report questionnaire measure that 
focuses on anger expression. It assesses both the current (or state) anger of the applicant, and 
the generally characteristic (trait) anger level.  
Modified Fatigue Impact Scale  (MFIS ) is a modified form of the Fatigu e Impact Scale (Fisk et al, 
1994b) based on items derived from interviews with MS patients concerning how fatigue 
impacts their lives. This instrument provides an assessment of the effects of fatigue in terms of 
physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functi oning.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272]  (PSQI): is a 19 -item self -rated questionnaire for evaluating 
subjective sleep quality over the previous month. Seven component scores are added to 
obtain a global score ranging from 0 –21, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality. 
The PSQI has a s ensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% for identifying cases with sleep 
disorder and has been used in a wide range of population -based and clinical studies. Since 
sleep disturbances are common complaints for Veterans returning from deployment and 
has been known to impair cognition, the PSQI will be used to determine whether sleep 
disturbances interfere with treatment response.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/2020  EXAMINER : A battery of [ADDRESS_569586] to use in clinical research studie s.  The tasks take approximately 60 minutes to 
administer via a computer and result in 12 primary variables.  Tasks include: Dot counting 
(count blue dotes on a series of screens and recall the number of dots across screens), N -back 
(identify whether a ser ies of locations match the location presented 1 or 2 before), Flanker 
(indicate the direction of an arrow that is flanked by [CONTACT_333650]), 
Continuous Performance Test (respond to certain stimuli and withhold response to other stimuli 
on a computer screen), Anti -saccades (move eyes toward a stimulus and moves eyes away 
from a stimulus), Set -shifting (switch between a homogeneous matching task and a 
heterogeneous matching task), Phonemic Fluency (name [CONTACT_447921]), Category Fluency (name [CONTACT_333656] a category), Unstructured 
Task (complete puzzles within 6 minutes with the goal of earning as many points as possible), 
and the Social Norms Questionnaire (answer yes no questions abo ut socially appropriate 
behaviors). Test re -test reliability is .94 and correlated with the FrsBe -0.57 in a multi -neurologic 
population.  
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions –Adult  (BRIEF -A) is a self and informant 
report questionnaire consist ing of 75 statements about executive behaviors. There are three 
possible responses to items: often, sometimes, never. There are nine subscales: inhibit, 
self-monitor, plan/organize, shift initiation, task monitor, emotional control, working memory, 
and org anization of materials. Normative self -report (n=1,050) reliability ranges from .73 to 
.90 for the scales and .93 to .96 for Index and Global Executive Composite scores. While 
the reliability in a mixed clinical sample (n=233) ranged from .[ADDRESS_569587] reliability over 4 weeks 
averaged .82 to .93 on the scales and .94 for Index and Global Executive Composite 
scores. The total BRIEF -A score correlates at .84 with the Dysexecu tive Questionnaire 
(Roth, 2005). In a sample of patients diagnosed with TBI, the MI reported a cronbach alpha 
of 0.96 (Waid -Ebbs et al., 2012 ). The Metacogn itive Index score of the BRIEF -A will be 
used to detect generalization of treatment effect  and impact of specific executive function 
deficits on treatment gain .   
Goal Attainment Scale  (GAS ) is an individualized outcome measure involving goal selection and 
a five -point goal scaling that is standardized in order to calculate  the extent to which a patient's 
goals are met.  The patient and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_447902]’s needs, such as: +2 
able to find 4 -5 items; +1 able to find 3 items; 0 able to find 2 item s; -1 able to find 1/5 items; -2 
unable to stay in store and locate items.  
Veteran’s Task Manager Smartphone Application  (VTM ) is a free Smartphone application (AP) 
specifically developed to utilize the strategies taught in GMT will be loaded from the App le store 
or Google store by [CONTACT_447919] (iPhone or Android). Participants will use 
the application features to break down tasks, estimate time to complete, check off each step as 
completed, respond to visual/vibrating alert of “Goal ” and respond to alert if “On Target”. 
Information, such as accuracy of planned steps, time to complete task, and number of 
distractions from goal will be collected by [CONTACT_447911]. Data will only be transferred via secure 
messaging in MyHealtheVet  or shown to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_447903] (TSQ) is a questionnaire used to capture satisfaction

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/31/2020  Demographics will be collected using the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research 
forms, including amount and type of productivity (work and unpaid volunteer). Details of TBI 
events and history will be documented using the Ohio State TBI identification Method  which is a 
standardized procedure for eliciting a person’s lifetime history of TBI via a 3-5-minute  structured 
interview . 
Statistical Analysis P lan 
Aim 1 :  Determine the treatment effect of attention training combined with GMT in Veterans with 
mTBI. Hypothesis 1a:  GMT plus attention training will significantly improve performance on tests 
of cognition compared to the control group. 1b: Treatment g ains will translate to functional 
activities compared to controls.  
For both Hypothesis 1 and 2: A multiple linear regression model will be used to determine if 
there is a significant difference between the treatment and control groups in tests of cognition  
and function. Separate models will be fit for each outcome measure (cTOL, ANT, TOGSS, 
CRIS) the baseline measure and treatment group indicator will be used as covariates in the 
model. The Wald test will be used to determine if the coefficient for treatmen t group is 
significantly different from zero, indicating a significant treatment effect. Effect sizes for 
between -group differences will be estimated using the coefficient of the group indicator in the 
model.        
Tertiary analysis : Other moderator varia bles (Table 2) will be examined to determine whether a 
linear relationship exists between changes in problem solving, attention or participation. These 
variables include  PCL-5 total score and index scores (such as intrusions), BPI [INVESTIGATOR_182913], 
AUDIT -C tota l score, BDI -II total score, number of concussions, STAXI -2, PSQI, MFIS and CES 
total score.  
Sample Size : A sample size of 50 participants equally randomized into treatment or control 
groups will yield 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.8139. In other words, if the true 
improvement in the treatment group is 0.[ADDRESS_569588] deviations greater than the control group, 
then the pi[INVESTIGATOR_447904] 80% chance of detecting a significant difference. Based on our 
preliminary analysis of [ADDRESS_569589] size of 1.76 
(3.16, 0.37) for the cTOL time to first move, a moderate effect size of 0.827 ( -0.46, 2.10) for 
cTOL optimal moves, and a moderate effect size of 0.67 ( -0.60, 1.95) for cTOL time to 
completion40. 
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  
The primary hazard to participation in the experimental/clinical neuropsychological 
measures and interventions is fatigue/ frustration. Examiners are trained to respond to such 
reactions and provide encouragem ent, breaks, and assistance as needed. Testing or 
training will be terminated, and the Veteran will be debriefed, in the event of adverse 
emotional reactions or extreme fatigue, which are very rare.  In the event that the participant 
answers 3 on question 9  of the  Beck Depression  Inventory  (depression questionnaire used  
during screening ) or actively expresses thoughts of harming themselves , the Veterans 
Crisis Line (also called the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline [PHONE_9364] press 1 for 
Veterans Crisis Line) will be called by [CONTACT_5051] . This will be performed prior to the 
subject leaving the sight of the study staff .

The proposed project has the potential to provide information that will enable clinicians to  
target Veterans with disrupted attention neural networks with effective treatments 
specifically prescribed to a particular component of attention. This will benefit Veterans by 
[CONTACT_447920] p rocesses. The 
potential benefits far outweigh the minimal  risks.  Veterans will be reimbursed for each 
session of their participation.  
9. Conflict of Interest:

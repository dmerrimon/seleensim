The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of HTD1801 on concurrent disease activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and on the safety and tolerability of HTD1801 over 18 weeks in adult subjects with PSC.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) objectives include: • Develop and validate population PK models for the components of HTD1801: berberine (BBR) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); • Calculate individual single-dose and steady-state exposure metrics based on non-compartmental analysis methods in adult patients with PSC; • Evaluate exposure-response models for efficacy; • Evaluate the relationship between exposure, adverse events, and serious adverse events.  Methodology: A 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and dose-controlled, parallel group clinical trial with a PK substudy, followed by a 6-week, dose-controlled extension period, followed by a 6-week placebo controlled randomized withdrawal period. Number of subjects (planned): [ADDRESS_975645] may be enrolled.  Approximately 36 subjects enrolled at selected sites will undergo additional blood draws for PK/PD analysis. Inclusion criteria:   1. Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age; 2. Have a clinical diagnosis of PSC as evident by [CONTACT_716208] a consistent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showing sclerosing cholangitis; 3.

Change in serum bilirubin; 10. In subjects with IBD who have elevated FC, change in FC compared to Baseline at Weeks 6 and 12, and the proportion of subjects who normalize FC at Weeks 6 and 12; 11. For subjects who have elevated CRP at Baseline (for all subjects as well as only IBD subset): change from Baseline in CRP at Weeks 6 and 12, and normalization of CRP at Weeks 6 and 12; 12. For subjects with IBD who have Partial Mayo Score above 0: Change from Baseline in Mayo scores at Weeks 6 and 12. Efficacy analysis:  The mITT population will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. The primary efficacy variable is the change in ALP from Baseline to Week 6 in the initial double-blind parallel group period. Changes in ALP from Baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], visit and treatment period using descriptive statistics. A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) will be fit to the data and the model will include fixed factors for treatment, visit and treatment by [CONTACT_23259], a random factor for subject, and Baseline value as a covariate. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the repeated assessment over time. Denominator degrees of freedom will be adjusted using Kenward-Roger’s method. Sensitivity analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Treatment comparisons will be made at each visit and each treatment period, with the primary comparison at Week 6. No imputation of missing data is necessary for the MMRM analysis of the primary endpoint.  A similar MMRM analysis will be performed for the randomized withdrawal period. Analysis for the randomized withdrawal period will be conducted for all subjects and separately for responders based on pre-specified responder criteria.  For the dose-controlled treatment period, a one sample t-test will be used to evaluate the change in ALP from Week [ADDRESS_975653], and the proportion of subjects who achieve a 50% decrease in ALP from Baseline will be calculated at end of treatment using a last observation carried forward for any missing data. Frequencies and percentages will be calculated by [CONTACT_35080]. Any adjustments for multiplicity will be described in the SAP. Treatment comparisons will be made at Week 6 (or LOCF) using Fisher’s exact test. A similar analysis will be performed for the randomized withdrawal period. For the dose-controlled extension period, a one sample exact test will be used to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving each of the secondary endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_975654]/ALT ratio, bilirubin, C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin will be analyzed using a MMRM similar to that described above for the primary efficacy variable.

  Page 8  Safety Evaluation   Safety Endpoints: Adverse events and changes in clinical laboratory assessments will be used to evaluate safety and tolerability.  Safety Analysis: Safety data will be summarized using descriptive analysis.  PK/PD Evaluation  Pharmacokinetic Endpoints: 1. Apparent clearance (CL/F) of UDCA and BBR; 2. Apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) for UDCA and BBR; 3. Additional single-dose and steady-state non-compartmental exposure metrics (e.g., Cmax, AUC0-12, AUC0-inf).  Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis:  Population PK models for the components of HTD1801 will be developed and validated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM) approach. Selection of the appropriate model will be based on hypothesis testing and graphical analysis of residual error (goodness of fit).  Target parameters for each component include apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F). Covariate relationships will be evaluated and incorporated into the model as indicated by [CONTACT_26739].  Covariates for evaluation will include, but will not be limited to, vital signs (e.g., body size), demographics (e.g., sex, age, race) and organ function / disease biomarkers (e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase).  The models will be validated using likelihood profiles, bootstrap analysis, and visual predictive check.  Concentration vs. time profiles will be simulated for each subject based on that subject’s individual-specific (post-hoc) parameter estimates. Individual single-dose and steady-state non-compartmental metrics will be calculated from these simulated data.  Metrics for UDCA will be reported with and without baseline correction.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis  An exploratory exposure-response analysis will be performed to evaluate the relationship between exposure metrics (e.g., AUC, Cmax) for UDCA, BBR, and UDCA+BBR and change from baseline in serum ALP.  The analysis will evaluate the effect of covariates including disease state (e.g., baseline ALP; IBD with elevated FC; elevated CRP).  An exploratory exposure-response analysis will be performed to evaluate the relationship between exposure, adverse events (AE) of interest, and serious adverse events (SAE).  The relationship between exposure and AE or SAE occurrence will be evaluated graphically and, where indicated, statistically.

  Page 20 1.0 INTRODUCTION HTD1801 is a novel salt formed between berberine (BBR) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with a stoichiometry of 1:1, and is currently being developed as an oral treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). HTD1801 is expected to dissociate into berberine chloride (BBR·Cl) and UDCA after oral administration. Both UDCA and BBR have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of cholestatic disease. Due to the different mechanisms of the two products, at least an additive, and possibly an additive or synergistic effect may occur when they are administered together in the form of HTD1801. This study will evaluate HTD1801 in adult subjects with PSC by [CONTACT_701332] (ALP) over 6 weeks.   1.1 BACKGROUND 1.1.1 Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic, progressive liver disease characterized by [CONTACT_716210]- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts, which leads to the formation of multifocal bile duct strictures. This cholestatic disease leads to fibrosis and ultimately liver failure, cirrhosis and an increased risk of malignancy.[1, 2]  Today, nearly 50,000 patients in the [LOCATION_002] suffer from PSC, and the median life expectancy after diagnosis of PSC is 12 to 18 years without liver transplantation.[3]  PSC is more common in men than in women (2:1), and can occur at any age with a peak incidence around forty years of age.[4] Currently, no effective therapy has been approved for the treatment of PSC.[1]  UDCA is a secondary bile acid produced by [CONTACT_120897] a metabolic by-product, which is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) (NDA 020675).[5] UDCA has been shown to significantly improve biochemical parameters, delay progression of the disease and prevent the need for liver transplantation in patients with PBC.[6, 7]  The possible mechanisms of action for UDCA’s efficacy in the treatment of chronic cholestasis include, but are not limited to, the following:[8] • Improvement of hydrophilicity index in the circulating bile acid pool; • Stimulation of hepatobiliary and ductular secretion; 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND 136137  
  Page 21 • Cytoprotection against bile acid and cytokine-induced injury; • Immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effects. Based on the pharmacological properties summarized above, UDCA has been investigated as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with PSC. UDCA treatment leads to significant improvements in liver biochemistry, including serum ALP, aspartate transaminase (AST), and bilirubin. However, a meta-analysis failed to show that UDCA reduced mortality, hepatic decompensation, need for liver transplantation or liver histological deterioration compared with placebo.[9, 10]  Tabibian et al., pointed out that UDCA monotherapy may not be sufficient for the treatment of PSC and a combination therapy should be considered.[11]  An analogue of UDCA, 2,4-norursodeoxycholic acid (nor-URDA) with a similar mechanism of action of UDCA has demonstrated improvements in rodent models of cholestasis[3] Nor-UDCA has also been evaluated in a recently completed phase 2 clinical trial in 159 patients with PSC.[12] BBR is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in many different plants, with a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine.[13, 14]  BBR·Cl is an approved antiseptic drug in China, Japan, and Taiwan. In the [LOCATION_002] and Australia, BBR is widely used in various dietary supplements for a number of advertised health benefits and is grandfathered under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) in the [LOCATION_002].[15]  The reported multi-spectrum activity of BBR, including immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis and anti-infection, suggests that BBR has the potential to treat chronic cholestatic liver diseases. Studies show BBR’s ability to inhibit the toxic effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and normalize intestinal permeability. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that BBR may have beneficial effects in the treatment of PSC. ALP level has been used as a biomarker in clinical trials of PSC for the past two decades and the reduction of ALP has been used as primary endpoint in over 40% of clinical studies.[6, 16-18]  ALP was the primary variable used in the FDA's approval of OCALIVA.  Recently, several observational studies have further supported the use of ALP as a surrogate marker for transplant-free survival.[19-22]  In a phase 2 clinical trial of nor-UDCA in PSC patients, change in serum ALP levels during treatment is used as the primary outcome measure.[23]  In a preclinical study by [CONTACT_716211] a common bile duct ligation induced mice model of cholestasis, the ALP levels were

  Page 22 reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 30% after 7-day treatment of nor-UDCA post [ADDRESS_975667] ligation (BDL).[24]  This study will evaluate HTD1801 in adult subjects with PSC by [CONTACT_716212] 6 weeks.    1.1.2 Nonclinical Studies HighTide conducted an efficacy study of HTD1801 in rats subjected to BDL. HTD1801 at doses of 50 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg reduced ALP levels by 23.8% and 25.1% respectively, increased super oxide dismutase activity, and reduced malondialdehyde levels significantly, providing mechanistic evidence for the action of HTD1801 in the treatment of PSC. In addition, both doses ameliorated hepatocellular necrosis, reduced inflammation in the portal area, and inhibited bile duct proliferation, providing additional evidence of the potential for therapeutic effects of HTD1801 in PSC. A second pharmacology study was conducted to evaluate the effects of HTD1801 on intestinal microbiota modification in a high-fat diet-induced hamster model of metabolic disorder. Recent clinical observations and animal findings have suggested an abundance of christensenellanceae[25] and decreased parabacteroides[26, 27] have a role in the etiopathogenesis of PSC.  The nonclinical toxicity profiles of both UDCA and BBR have been extensively studied. A full ICH M3 battery of nonclinical studies was performed with UDCA in support of NDA [ZIP_CODE]. The toxicity profile of berberine was assessed in a battery on nonclinical studies conducted and/or reviewed by [CONTACT_716213]. These studies include single dose oral studies in mice and rats, in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies, as well as reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in mice and rats.[28-32]  The pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of HTD1801 has been evaluated in both rats and dogs.  HighTide conducted toxicology studies of up to 2-weeks in rats (non-GLP) and up to 13-weeks in dogs (GLP).  The results of these studies show that combined administration of UDCA and berberine as HTD1801 results in pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles similar to that of the individual components UDCA and BBR. In addition, the 13-week GLP dog study provided data to qualify the toxicity profile of berberine in nonrodents and the safety of the combination of berberine and UDCA when administered as HTD1801.

BBR is widely used in dietary supplements in the [LOCATION_002] at a recommended dose of 17 to 33 mg/kg/day, which is roughly 1 to 2 g/day. As shown in Table 2, the UDCA and BBR·Cl content of HTD1801 are comparable to that already shown to be safe clinically. Table 2.

  Page 24 2.0 OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the effects of HTD1801 on ALP in adult subjects with PSC.  The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effects of HTD1801 on concurrent disease activity of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and on the safety and tolerability of HTD1801 over 18 weeks in adult subjects with PSC.  Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) objectives include: • Develop and validate population PK models for the components of HTD1801: berberine (BBR) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); • Calculate individual single-dose and steady-state exposure metrics based on non-compartmental analysis methods in adult patients with PSC; • Evaluate exposure-response models for efficacy; • Evaluate the relationship between exposure, adverse events, and serious adverse events

  Page 25 3.0 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 BASIC DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS This proof-of-concept study with a PK substudy will be conducted in three randomized, double-blind treatment periods in adult patients with PSC.   The study design consists of an initial randomized, double-blind, placebo- and dose-controlled, parallel group period, followed by a dose-controlled extension period, followed by a placebo-controlled randomized withdrawal period.   • In the 1st period, subjects will be randomized to receive twice-daily doses of 500 mg, 1000 mg, or matching placebo for 6 weeks.  The primary analysis will be based on this initial 6 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and dose-controlled, parallel group period. • Following the completion of that initial double-blinded, placebo- and dose-controlled parallel group period, subjects will be eligible to enroll in a 6-week extension period in which subjects previously randomized to 500 mg or 1,000 mg twice-daily (BID) will continue for 6 more weeks at that previous dose, while subjects previously randomized to placebo will be re-randomized to receive 6 weeks of either 500 mg or 1,000 mg BID.   The study will remain double-blind. • Following the completion of the 6-week experimental treatment extension, all subjects will be re-randomized to either continue on the active treatment they received in Period 2, or be assigned to placebo.  The plan is for 50% of the subjects to remain on the experimental treatment at the previous dose and 50% will receive placebo.

Proportion of subjects with a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) or a clinically significant laboratory abnormality (overall and of any given type); 2. Proportion of subjects who discontinue due to an adverse event (AE) (either treatment-emergent or clinically significant laboratory abnormality). 3.3.3 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 1. Apparent clearance (CL/F) of UDCA and BBR; 2. Apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F) for UDCA and BBR; 3. Additional single-dose and steady-state non-compartmental exposure metrics (e.g., Cmax, AUC0-12, AUC0-inf). 3.4 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING Period 1: Placebo- and dose-controlled, parallel-group period Subjects will be enrolled in equal numbers to one of the initial three treatment groups, those being placebo BID, HTD1801 500 mg BID, or HTD1801 1,000 mg BID, during the initial 6-week, double-blind, placebo- and dose-controlled, parallel-group period.  Randomization will be centrally controlled, stratified according to a co-existing diagnosis of IBD, and subjects will be assigned a pre-packaged and numbered treatment.  Period 2: Dose-controlled extension Following their completion of Period 1, subjects will enroll in a 6-week extension period in which subjects previously randomized to 500 mg or 1,000 mg BID will continue for 6 more weeks at that previous dose, while subjects previously randomized to placebo will be randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of either 500 mg or 1,000 mg BID.    
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND 136137  
  Page 33 Period 3: Randomized withdrawal Following their completion of Period 2, subjects will enroll in a 6-week randomized withdrawal period in which all subjects will be randomly assigned to either continue on the active treatment they received in Period 2, or be assigned to placebo.  The plan is for 50% of the subjects to remain on the experimental treatment at the previous dose, and 50% will receive placebo.    All subjects and study personnel (other than an unblinded statistician who will develop the randomization number list, and an unblinded EDC designer will load the randomization number list into the EDC system) will remain blinded as to the treatment administered throughout the study.  All study test article will be provided in matching white tablets, four to a bottle, two bottles to be administered each day, one in the morning and one in the evening.  A 45-day supply will be provided to each subject at each visit to cover the next 6-week period with an additional 3-days of coverage to provide for possible scheduling conflicts.     In this double-blind study, if a medical emergency occurs and a decision about a subject’s condition requires knowledge of the treatment assignment in order to properly treat the subject, the study blind may be broken for that specific subject only.  Ideally, this decision to break the blind for this one subject should only be made after consultation with the Medical Monitor or Sponsor Representative. Any broken blind must be clearly justified and explained by a note in the subject's source documents.   3.5 REPLACEMENT OF DROPOUTS Subjects who do not complete study assessments through Week 6 of the initial double-blind period are eligible to be replaced at the Sponsor's discretion.

  Page 46 6.0 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 6.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT The following definition of adverse event (AE) will be used for this study:  Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, regardless of whether it is considered to be related to the investigational product.   The following are examples of AEs: • Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the indication under study • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition • New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration, even if they were present before the start of the study • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction with another medical product • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concurrent medication Overdose should not be reported as an AE or serious adverse event (SAE), but rather the symptoms resulting from the overdose. Examples of AEs do not include the following: • Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy). The medical condition that led to the procedure as the AE should be reported. 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND 136137  
  Page 47 • Situations that are unwanted by [CONTACT_701344], for example social inconvenience after admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] • Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of a preexisting disease or condition (present or detected before enrollment) that does not worsen overall • Expected progression of the disease being studied, including signs or symptoms of the disease, unless progression is more severe than expected for the subject’s condition AEs may include pre-treatment or post-treatment events that occur as a result of protocol-mandated procedures (e.g., invasive procedures, modification of the subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  AEs should be captured even if they occur during periods without drug treatment, post-treatment periods, known placebo treatment, or in a reference or control group receiving drug or nondrug therapy. The investigator is responsible for all AE assessments. The investigator and study staff will note all AEs mentioned by [CONTACT_716218]. All clinical complaints volunteered by [CONTACT_716219] (eCRF) for the study period indicated. The subject will receive appropriate treatment and medical supervision for any AE that occurs.   All AEs judged to be clinically significant, including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, will be followed until resolution. All AEs will be summarized in the annual report or more frequently if requested by [CONTACT_61462]. SAEs require special reporting in addition to documentation in the eCRF as described in Section 6.7.

  Page 48 6.2 DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT In this study, a serious adverse event is defined as an AE that meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death • Is life-threatening.  The term life-threatening in the definition of an SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. The term life-threatening does not refer to an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   • Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] a prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_716204]’s office or out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084], but not necessarily SAEs. A medical occurrence or complication that prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61375]. When there is doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_51956], the AE should be considered an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120874] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from its original Baseline level is not considered an SAE. • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  This does not include AEs of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. • A congenital anomaly or birth defect.  This refers to the offspring of a study subject. • An other important medical event.  Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised when deciding whether reporting is appropriate for other important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_716205]. These events should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND [ADDRESS_975692] address the investigator’s estimate of causality. The medical monitor will review the SAE to determine if it is an expected SAE (i.e., whether or not the SAE is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator’s Brochure).  6.3 RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS When an AE or SAE occurs, the investigator is responsible for reviewing all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostic reports) relative to the event(s). The investigator will record all relevant information about any AE (including SAEs) on the AE page of the eCRF. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s medical records in lieu of the properly completed AE or SAE pages of the eCRF. These documents should not be sent unless they are specifically requested by [CONTACT_603604]. If this request occurs, all subject identifiers and protected health information should be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_701320]. The investigator will also attempt to report a diagnosis, instead of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information, for the AE. The diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, should be documented on the appropriate page of the eCRF as the AE or SAE. In addition, SAEs need to be reported in the SAE report. AEs being processed as SAEs will also require additional documentation. The study procedures manual provides additional guidelines about reporting SAEs. 6.4 ASSESSMENT OF INTENSITY The investigator will assess the intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study on the basis of his or her clinical judgement.  The classifications in Table 4 should be used in assigning intensity of each AE recorded in the case report form. Forma-ed: Font color: BlueDeleted: Table 4

  Page 50 Table 4. Classification of AEs by [CONTACT_716220] (Grade 1) An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities Moderate AE (Grade 2) An event that is sufficiently discomforting to the extent of interfering with normal everyday activities Severe AE (Grade 3) An event that prevents the subject from performing normal everyday activities Life-threatening or disabling AE (Grade 4) An event that, at the time of occurrence, put the subject at risk of death or resulted in a persistent or significantly disability or incapacity Death related to AE (Grade 5) An event that resulted in death AE = adverse event   a From Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.[ADDRESS_975693]. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category used for rating the intensity of an AE (such as mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction). However, AE itself may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. Both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An AE is considered serious when it meets one of the predefined outcomes described in Section 6.1. 6.[ADDRESS_975694]. The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure or product label for marketed products in estimating the relationship. Because of reporting timelines, the investigator might have minimal information to include in the initial SAE report. However, the investigator must always make an assessment of causality for every SAE before the transmission of the SAE report. The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_61380]-up information, with subsequent amendment of the SAE report. Causality assessment is

Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study; however, they may voluntarily withdraw at any time. The investigator will provide a written explanation of the reason for discontinuation in a source document and this information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. Subjects will be specifically queried to determine whether or not withdrawal of consent might have been due to an adverse event.  If a subject withdraws before completion, every effort should be made to complete the assessments scheduled during the follow-up period [termination/end of study visit]. A subject may be removed from the study for the reasons described in Section 7.1 through Section 7.3. 7.4 PREMATURE STUDY OR SITE TERMINATION If the sponsor, investigator, medical monitor, study monitor, or appropriate regulatory officials discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the site should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation among the sponsor, investigator, medical monitor, and study monitor.  The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be used to for the assessment of trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].

  Page 58 8.0 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 8.1 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING  Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will be used to capture study assessments and data. The study coordinator or other delegated study staff will enter data from source documents into the eCRFs. All eCRFs will be reviewed and source-verified by [CONTACT_716226], and the study monitor will ensure that all data in the eCRF are correct and complete. Before or between visits, the medical monitor or study monitor may conduct a preliminary medical review of the eCRFs. Once the eCRFs are completed and source-verified, the investigator must electronically sign all required eCRF pages, verifying the accuracy of all data contained in the eCRFs. Training will be provided for the electronic data capture (EDC) system. All study staff using the EDC system must have the necessary education, training, and experience or any combination of these. The investigator will be responsible for documenting employee education, training, and previous experience that pertain to the EDC system for all site staff using the EDC system.  The investigator must maintain adequate security of the EDC system, including documentation that all users have been trained on the appropriate standard operating procedure and a list of authorized users. To ensure all data entries can be tracked, all personnel responsible for data entry must obtain a unique user identification (user ID) and password before any data can be entered in the eCRFs. Authorized study staff will be assigned a unique user ID only after receiving standard operating procedure training.  If electronic data systems other than those provided and maintained by [CONTACT_716227], the investigator must ensure that the systems are validated and that data are backed up as described in Section 9.2.

Data will also be listed as deemed appropriate. All statistical analyses will be performed and data appendices will be created by [CONTACT_716228] 9.4 or later. All statistical tests will be two-sided with an alpha (α) level of 0.05. 8.2.[ADDRESS_975705] The modified Intent-to-treat population (mITT) will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug and who have at least one post-dose efficacy assessment. The safety population will include randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug. 8.2.3 Efficacy Analysis The mITT population will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. No alpha adjustments for multiplicity will be made for the analysis of efficacy endpoints for this proof of concept study. The primary efficacy variable is the change in ALP from Baseline to Week 6 in the double-blind parallel group period. Changes in ALP from Baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_72082]. A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) will be fit to the data and the model will include fixed factors for treatment, randomization strata of IBD diagnosis, visit and treatment by [CONTACT_23259], and Baseline value as a covariate. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the repeated assessment over time. Denominator degrees of freedom will be adjusted using Kenward-Roger’s method. Sensitivity analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Treatment comparisons will be made at each visit, 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND [ADDRESS_975706] period.    The secondary efficacy variables of the proportion of subjects who normalize ALP, the proportion of subjects who achieve ALP of < 1.[ADDRESS_975707] and the proportion of subjects who achieve a 50% decrease in ALP from Baseline will be calculated at the end of treatment using a last observation carried forward for any missing data. Frequencies and percentages will be calculated by [CONTACT_35080]. Any adjustments for multiplicity will be discussed in the SAP. Treatment comparisons will be made at Week 6 (or LOCF) using Fisher’s exact test. A similar analysis will be performed for the randomized withdrawal period. For the dose-controlled extension period, a one sample exact test will be used to evaluate the proportion of subjects achieving each of the secondary endpoints at Week [ADDRESS_975708]/ALT ratio, bilirubin, and IgG4 will be analyzed using a MMRM similar to that described above for the primary efficacy variable. Further details of the efficacy analyses will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan. 8.2.[ADDRESS_975709] severity and relationship to study drug will be reported.

  Page 61 Changes in vital signs, hematology, and clinical chemistry parameters from Baseline to the end of the study will be examined. Treatment-emergent changes from normal values to abnormal values in key laboratory parameters will be identified. 8.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Population PK models for the components of HTD1801 (UDCA and BBR) will be developed and validated using a nonlinear mixed-effects model (NONMEM) approach. The model for UDCA will include endogenous UDCA. The error model will include between-subject variability and residual error between observed and predicted concentration (using NONMEM’s FOCE method).  Selection of the appropriate model will be based on hypothesis testing using the likelihood ratio test and graphical analysis of residual error (goodness of fit).  Target parameters for each component include apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vss/F). Covariate relationships between PK parameters and individual characteristics will be evaluated and incorporated into the model as indicated by [CONTACT_26739].  Covariates for evaluation will include, but will not be limited to, vital signs (e.g.,, body size), demographics (e.g., sex, age, race) and organ function / disease biomarkers (e.g., bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase).  The models will be validated using likelihood profiles, bootstrap analysis, and visual predictive check. Concentration vs. time profiles will be simulated for each subject based on that subject’s individual-specific (post-hoc) parameter estimates. Individual single-dose and steady-state non-compartmental metrics will be calculated from this simulated data (e.g., Cmax, AUC0-12, AUC0-inf).  Metrics for UDCA will be reported with and without baseline correction. 8.2.6 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis An exploratory exposure-response analysis will be performed to evaluate the relationship between exposure metrics (e.g., AUC, Cmax) for UDCA, BBR, and UDCA+BBR and change from baseline in serum ALP.  The analysis will evaluate the effect of covariates including disease state (e.g., baseline ALP; IBD with elevated FC; elevated CRP). An exploratory exposure-response analysis will be performed to evaluate the relationship between exposure, adverse events (AE) of interest, and serious adverse 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND 136137  
  Page 62 events (SAE). The relationship between exposure and AE or SAE occurrence will be evaluated graphically and, where indicated, statistically. 8.2.7 Sample Size Results from published clinical trials of PSC patients including Zhu et al., 2015 and Fickert et al., 2017 were reviewed.[10, 34] These publications were used along with consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study to estimate mean baseline ALP and  to estimate variability.  Total sample size was chosen based on balancing  consideration of business costs, time to enroll subjects with this rare disease and the mean change which could be detected given the mean baseline and variability assumptions. The standard deviation for change from baseline in ALP was assumed to be 200. A total of [ADDRESS_975710] a mean difference from placebo within a dose group of 147 with 80% power at an alpha of 0.05. Assuming a mean baseline ALP of 450, this equates to a 32.7% reduction. This study whould be adequate to determine if there is a positive signal in ALP during HTD1801 treatment.  No formal sample size analysis was performed for the PK substudy.  Thirty-six (36) subjects providing up to 504 pharmacokinetic samples is considered sufficient to characterize CL/F and Vss/F of UDCA and BBR in this study population.

   APPENDIX A  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS (INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR HARMONISATION E6, SECTION 4.8) 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND 136137  
  Page 1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS (International Council for Harmonisation E6, Section 4.8) Informed consent must be obtained from every subject before he or she enters a study. It must be given freely and not under duress. Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_29159]’s legally acceptable representative signing an IRB/IEC-approved consent form. When minors are involved, a parent or guardian should sign the consent form. If the minor is an adolescent (12 to 16-18 years of age, dependent on region, as specified in ICH E11, Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Pediatric Population), his or her signature [CONTACT_120945]. Subjects who do not speak English must be presented with a consent form written in a language that they understand. A copy of the signed consent form must be given and made available to sponsor and representatives of the appropriate regulatory authority upon request. If, for any reason, subject risk is increased as the study progresses, a revised IRB/IEC-approved consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_423]. Nothing in these regulations is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable federal, state, or local laws. Only in the case of a life-threatening incident may an investigational agent be used without prior signed consent. In such an emergency situation, separate certifications must be written by [CONTACT_17588] a physician not participating in the study and the investigator. The certifications, along with the protocol and informed consent form, must be sent to the IRB/IEC within [ADDRESS_975721] until informed consent and IRB/IEC approval are obtained. BASIC ELEMENTS OF INFORMED CONSENT Every informed consent form must include explanations of each of the following 22 elements: • The fact that the trial involves research • The purpose of the trial • The trial treatment(s) and the probability for random assignment to each treatment • The trial procedures to be followed, including all invasive procedures

  Page 2 • The subject’s responsibilities • Those aspects of the trial that are experimental • The reasonably foreseeable risks or inconveniences to the subject and, when applicable, to an embryo, fetus, or nursing infant • The reasonably expected benefits (When there is no intended clinical benefit to the subject, the subject should be made aware of this.) • The alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment that may be available to the subject, as well as their important potential benefits and risks • The compensation or treatment available to the subject in the event of a trial-related injury • The anticipated prorated payment, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial • The anticipated expenses, if any, to the subject for participating in the trial • The fact that the subject’s participation in the trial is voluntary and that the subject may refuse to participate or withdraw from the trial, at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled • That the monitor(s), the auditor(s), the IRB/IEC, and the regulatory authority(ies) will be granted direct access to the subject’s original medical records for verification of study procedures or data, without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_120938], by [CONTACT_2960] a written informed consent form, the subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative is authorizing such access • That the records identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_120939], will not be made publicly available; and if the results of the trial are published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential • That the subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative will be informed in a timely manner if information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial 
CONFIDENTIAL  HighTide Biopharma Pty., Ltd.  HTD1801 Clinical Protocol IND 136137  
  Page 3 • The person(s) to contact [CONTACT_716236], and whom to contact [CONTACT_44751] a trial-related injury • The foreseeable circumstances or reasons under which the subject’s participation in the trial may be terminated • The expected duration of the subject’s participation in the trial • The approximate number of subjects involved in the trial • The consequences of a subject’s decision to withdraw from the research and the procedure for orderly termination of participation by [CONTACT_423] • That the trial will be included on ClinicalTrials.gov as required by [CONTACT_421628], and, if applicable, the appropriate study database of another regulatory agency (e.g., the Health Canada Clinical Trial Database, EudraCT). Nothing is intended to limit the authority of a physician to provide emergency medical care to the extent the physician is permitted to do so under applicable federal, state, or local laws. The informed consent requirements are not intended to preempt any applicable federal, state, or local laws that require additional information to be disclosed in order that informed consent be legally effective. Some states require further action on the investigator’s part concerning subject consent.

Study Design This study is a Phase IIIb, open -label, multicenter study to assess the 
long-term safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of HYQVIA/HyQvia 
(IGI, 10% w ith rHuPH20 administered subcutaneously) for maintenance 
therapy to prevent relapse. This study is an extension of Baxalta Clinical 
Study 161403, a Phase III Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability Study of 
HYQVIA/HyQvia and GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG in CIDP.
Enrollment into this study is open to subjects who have completed Study 
[ADDRESS_814874] meet all eligibility criteria (see section 
‘SUBJECT SELECTION ’) in order to participate in this Extension 
Study. As of December 3, 2021, a total of 121 subjects completed the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] (161403), 7 7 of whom rolled over into the extension study 
(161505) . There are 11 ongoing subjects in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_614524].  Hence, it is estimated that 
a maximum of 88 subjects will be eligible for study participation .
In this Extension Study, eligible subjects will receive HYQVIA/HyQvia 
in an open -label fashion until relapse or until predetermined study end 
for the specific country from which the subject is participating (see 
section ‘ Planned Duration of Subject Participation’, below).
Dose of HYQVIA/HyQvia and Dosing Regimen:
Subjects will continue to receive the same dose and dosing regimen of 
HYQVIA/HyQvia in the Extension Study as the subject’s full dose 
received in Epoch [ADDRESS_814875] components of HYQVIA/HyQvia will be 
administered sequentially. SC infusion of rHuPH20 solution at a dose of 
80 U/g Immunoglobulin G (IgG) w ill be administered first, to be 
followed by [CONTACT_614567], 10% within 10 m inutes of completion of 
the infusion of rHuPH20 solution.

Entry into Extension Study:
Enrollment into the Extension Study (signed informed consent) may take 
place immediately prior to or during the subject’s study completion visit 
in Study 161403. The termination visit of Study [ADDRESS_814876]’s eligibility for entrance into the Extension 
Study must be determined prior to the first investigational product (IP) 
infusion in the Extension Study, which will o ccur at the next visit (the 
first treatment visit in the Extension Study). The first administration in 
the Extension Study will take place at the subject’s next scheduled 
dosing (every 2, 3, or 4 w eeks). The dose w ill be the same as that 
administered in St udy 161403. The first infusion will be at the subject’s 
full dose; there will be no ramp -up of dose.
After the first 12 w eeks of treatment in the Extension Study, the dosing 
interval of HYQVIA/HyQvia may be adjusted for subject preference 
provided that it is safe to do so at the investigator’s discretion. If 
medically necessary, the interval and/or dose may be changed at any 
time, at the investigator’s discretion.
Administration and Study Site Visits:
As some subjects were receiving placebo treatment and ha ve not been 
exposed to HYQVIA/HyQvia while participating in Study 161403, all 
subjects will have at least the first 2 infusion visits in the Extension 
Study at the study site to facilitate safety monitoring.
Subjects from Study 161403:
The first 2 infusions in the Extension Study will be conducted at the 
investigator’s site. Thereafter and per investigator’s discretion, the SC 
infusions for subjects rolling over from Study [ADDRESS_814877]’s home or other suitable 
location, as acceptable per local regulations and standard practices of the 
study site and if product can be shipped from the pharmacy to the 
respective locations.
The ability of the subject (and/or caregiver) to perform infusion 
procedures independently is a prerequisite for self -administration in 
general. As needed, retraining and verification of the subject’s (and/or 
caregiver’s) proficiency in independently self -administering infusions 
will be provided and must be documented.

Extension Study. How ever, an unscheduled visit can occu r at any time 
should the need arise.
Planned Duration of Subject 
ParticipationEach subject will have the opportunity to receive HYQVIA/HyQvia until 
approval of HyQvia marketing authorization for the treatment of CIDP 
in either US or EU (w hichever comes l ater) unless one of the following 
criteria is met:

Mode of Adm inistration: SC infusion, to be administered via a peristaltic 
infusion pump with programmable infusion rates and infusion volumes at 
1to 3infusion sites per infusion day, with step -wise increases in infusion 
rate. IGI 10% solution may be administered at 1, 2, or 3 infusion sites. 
Therecommended site(s) for the infusion of HYQVIA/HyQvia are the 
middle to upper abdomen and thighs.
For the in itial 2 infusions, it may be delivered at an infusion rate of 10 to 
240mL/h per infusion site for subjects ≥40 kg and 5 to 80 mL/h per 
infusion site for subjects <[ADDRESS_814883] and/or at the 
discretion of the investigator.
For subsequ ent administrations, infusion rate may be increased as tolerated 
by [CONTACT_1708] .
Due to a manufacturer (CME America) recall on the Body Guard 323 pump 
and pump tubing, a replacement pump (for US and CANADA only) will 
bethe Q Core –Sapphire pump. 
The Body Guard 323 pump and pump tubing will continue to be used in 
EU/ROW. Details o n the infusion parameters for each pump is provided in 
the Investigator Site Infusion Manual.
Prior to subjects being allowed to infuse at these higher infusion rates in the 
home setting, this should first be conducted under medical supervision in 
the cl inic setting.
At high infusion rates, above 750 mL/h (if trifurcated needle set for 
3infusion sites is used ),the pump occlusion alarm may be activated due to 
high back pressure, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_614525]. If this occurs then reduce the 
infusion rate to allow  proper pump function.

6.BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
Purified human immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparations were first used in 1952 for the 
treatment of patients with primary  immunodeficiency  disease (PID), a class of disorders 
that result in increased susceptibility  to infection, including both recurrent py ogenic 
infections secondary  to defects of humoral immunity  and opportunistic infections 
resulting from defect
s in cell -mediated immunity (Bruton, 1952, Rosen et al., 1995) .
Individuals with these disorders require replacement therap y with immunoglobulin 
products to prevent or reduce the severit y of infections. I n addition to PID sy ndromes, 
immunoglobulin preparations have been indicated for secondary  immunodeficiencies, 
such as B -cell chronic l ymphocytic leukemia, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
(AIDS), and immunodeficiency after bone marrow transplantation (Abdel -Mageed et al., 
1999, Griffiths and Chapel, 1997, Rechtman, 1997 , Wolin and Gale, 1997) . 
Immunoglobulins are also effective in the management of autoimmune disorders, such as 
idiopathic thrombocy topenic purpura (ITP) (George and Raskob, 1998 , Imbach et al., 
1995, McMillan, 2000), Kawasaki sy ndrome (Barron et al., 1990 , Rosenfeld et al., 1995 ) ,
and multi -focal motor neuropathy  (MMN) (Hahn et al., 2013) . Clinical studies in 
neurological indications have also shown significant results with intravenous (IV) 
immunoglobulin (IGIV) preparations in the treatment of chronic inflammatory  
demy elina ting pol yradiculoneuropath y (CIDP) (Hughes et al., 2008 , Léger et al., 2 013).
CIDP is a progressive chronic sensory  and motor neuropath y with a relapsing and 
remitting or progressive course of more than 2 months, characterized by  [CONTACT_614574], positive sensory  symptoms, areflexi a without wasting, and impaired sensation 
with a preferential loss of vibration or joint position sense (European Federation of 
Neurological S ocieties, 2010 , Köller et al., 2005 ).Worldwide estimates of the prevalence 
of CIDP range from 1.9 to 8.9/100,000 with an annual incidence of 0.15 -1.6/100,000
(Iijima et al., 2008
, Laughlin et al., 2009 , Lunn et al., 1999, McLeod et al., 1999, 
Mygland and Monstad, 2001) . A report in Neurology  in 2009 cited a [LOCATION_002] (US) 
prevalence of CIDP of 8.9/100,000 and a n annual incidence of 1.6/100,000 new cases 
each year(Laughlin et al., 2009 ). CIDP has an estimated prevalence in Europe of 
3.7/100,000 (Orphanet Report Series, 2014 ).
European Federation of Neurological Societies/Peripheral Nerve Societ y (EFNS/PNS) 
guidelines published in 2010 utilize clinical, electrodiagnostic, and supportive criteria 
forthe diagnosis of CIDP (European Federation of Neurological Societies, 2010) . CIDP 
is defined as having either a ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_614527]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_614528] a s ymmetric proximal and distal weakness with sensory  involvement of all 
extremitie s. The clinical course is either slowl y progressive or relapsing and remitting.

Tendon reflexes are diminished or absent in all extremities. Cranial nerve involvement 
isless commonly  seen. Balance can
be impaired due to loss of proprioception 
(Koski, 2002) . Sensory  symptoms may  include numbness, tingling, and painful 
paresthesias ( Dyck et al., 1975 , McCombe et al., 1987 ). Aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_614529], according to the 
EFNS/PNS guidelines, includes CIDP with pure motor or pure sensory  impairment 
orwith distal, multi focal, or focal distributions (European Federation of Neurol ogical 
Societies, 2010) . Aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_614530]. CI DP with a predominantly distal presentation is 
described as distal acquired dem yelinating symmetric neuropath y (DADS) (Note: DADS 
without immunoglobulin M [IgM] paraprotein is generall y considered to be a variant of 
CIDP). Lewis -Sumner Sy ndrome, also known as multifocal acquired demy elinating 
sensory  and motor ne uropathy  (MADSAM), is the as ymmetric variant of CI DP. For 
thisstudy , pure sensory  CIDP (including chronic immune sensory  polyradiculopathy  
affecting the central process of the primary  sensory  neuron) and focal CIDP (eg, 
involvement of the brachial or lumb osacral plexus or of one or more peripheral nerves in 
one upper or lower limb) will be exclusionary ; the study  outcome measures are not fitting 
to assess clinical change in patients with those variants of CIDP. In order to meet the 
clinical diagnostic criteria for CIDP (whether t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_614531]), other causes for a 
neuropathy must be excluded ( European Federation of Neurological Societies, 2010 ). 
The EFNS/PNS guidelines and the American Academy  of Neurology  (AAN) require 
electrodiagnostic testing with findings consistent with demy elination for a diagnosis of 
CIDP (Cornblath et al., 1991, European Federation of Neurological Societies, 2010, 
Hahn et al., 2005, Köller et al., 2005 ). Major electrodiagnostic featur es consistent with 
CIDP include one or more of the following: prolonged distal motor latencies, reduced 
motor conduction velocity, delay  or absence of F waves, partial motor conduction block, 
abnormal temporal dispersion, and distal compound motor action p otential (CMAP) 
increase (Europe an Federation of Neurological Societies, 2010, Köller et al., 2005, 
Koski, 2002) .Supportive criteria in the diagnosis of CIDP may include findings from 
examination of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872], magnetic resonance imaging, nerve biopsy  and/or 
response to immunotherapy  treatment (European Federation of Neurological Societies, 
2010) .
While CIDP can occur in all ages, it occurs more often in the middle -aged and elderl y 
population with a male predominance (Hughes, 2003
).The peak incidence of CIDP is 
between the ages of 30 to 60 y ears(Dalakas, 2011 ). Approximately  60% of patients have 
a chronic progressive form and are t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_33174]. Approximately  30% have a relapsing 
remitting course and these patients tend to be younger.

result in painful sy mptoms such as aching, jabbing, and searing or burning pain
(Ulane and Brannagan, 2012) .
Although the exact etiology  of CIDP is unknown, it is regarded a s an autoimmune 
disorder. On nerve biopsy , a dem yelinating neuropathy is seen with inflammatory 
changes and infiltration of macrophages and T -cells. Demy elination, rem yelination, 
andonion bulb formation is present (Hughes, 2003 , Köller et al., 2005 , Koski, 2002) .
Axonal loss can also be seen. Long
-term dem yelination leads to axonal loss, and it is the 
amount of axonal loss that determines the level of disability  and long -term prognosis
(Köll er et al., [ADDRESS_814908] and Brannagan, 2012 ).Treatment is 
recommended for all CIDP patients who demonstrate significant clinical symptoms in 
order to prevent continuing dem yelination and secondary  axon loss leading to pe rmanent 
disability (Köller et al., 2005 ).
Conventional therap y for CI DP includes corticosteroids, plasma exchange (PE), and 
IGIV. IG IV has been the most studied treatment and the only approved therap y for CIDP
for both induction and maintenance therap y(Eftimov et al., [ADDRESS_814909] et al., 2010 , Léger et al., 2013 ,  
Mendell et al., 2001 , Nobile -Orazio et al., 2012 , Patwa et al., 2012, van Schaik et al., 
2002 ).  In clinical guidelines for treatment of CIDP, corticosteroids (Eftimov et al., 2012, 
Hughes et al., 2001 , Nobile -Orazio et al., 2012 , van Schaik et al., 2010) and PE 
(Dyck et al., 1986 , 
Hahn et al., 1996 , Mehndiratta and Hughes, 2012 )are also first -line 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614532] y and maintenance therap y(Euro pean Federation of 
Neurological Societies, 2010, Patwa et al., 2012) .
The EFNS/PNS 2010 guidelines recommend that either corticosteroids or IGIV 
should beconsidered for the initial treatment of CIDP. PE may  be similarl y effective 
but
less tolerated because associated adverse events (AEs) are not uncommon. 
Since IGIV may  provide rapid improvement, it is often the first choice.

If the response is inadequate t o the initial treatment or there is a problem with tolerability  
of maintenance treatment, the EFNS/PNS [ADDRESS_814910] -
line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (IGIV, steroids, or PE) be tried before considering combination treatments. 
Adding an immun osuppressant or immunomodulatory  drug may  be considered, but there 
is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular immunosuppressant/ 
immunomodulatory  agent (Cocito et al., 2011a, European Federation of Neurological 
Societies, 2010
). However, while cor ticosteroids are effective in treating the symptoms of 
CIDP, there are significant problems with safet y and tolerability associated with 
corticosteroid treatment, particularl y when given chronically (Gorson, 2012 ). 
Subcutaneous (SC) administration of immunoglobulin G (IGSC) has been the 
predominant mod e in the Scandinavian countries for many  years (Gardulf et al., 1991 )
and has become increasingl y widespread with tens of tho usands of SC infusions given 
during the last decade in patients with primary  and secondary  antibody  deficiencies
(Grunebaum et al., 2002 ). To date, several publications have reported the therapeutic 
efficacy  of IGSC administrati on in patients with CIDP (Cocito et al., 2014, Cocito et al., 
2011b, Köller et al., 2006 , Lee et al., 2008, Markvardsen et al., 2013) IGSC replacement 
therap y is considered to be effective, safe, and also highl y appreciated b y patients 
(Misbah et al., 2009 , Nicolay  et al., 2006) and to have a low risk of sy stemic adverse 
reactions (ARs) (
Gardulf et al., 1995, Gardulf et al., 1993 , Gardulf et al., 1991 ). 
Some of the proposed advantages of IGSC over IGIV include: 1) superior sy stemic AE 
profile and improved tolerability , 2) an alternative for patients with poor venous access, 
3) option for home treatment, and thus reduced burden on resources and healthcare costs 
(Gardulf and Hammarström, 1996 )
,  4) improved he alth-related quality  of life (HRQOL), 
5)ease of administration and flexibility  of dosing, and 6) increased convenience and 
compliance. The main disadvantages with conventional I GSC therap y are: 1) the limited 
volume of fluid that can be delivered subcutan eously , and 2) the low bioavailability  
(65% -69%) (Berger et al., 2013 )of the conventional IGSC therap y. These limitations in 
turn require more frequent dosing ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_614533] y to several times a week 
(Markvardsen et al., 2014) and, in the case of large doses, ad ministration at multiple sites 
to deliver the entire dose (Harbo et al., 2009a , Harbo et al., 2010 , Markvardsen et al., 
2014) .
Immune Globulin I nfusion 10% (Human) with Recombinant Human 
Hyaluronidase (IGI, 10% with rHuPH20; tradenames: HYQVIA/Hy Qvia) was 
developed to address the major limitation of conventional I GSC therap y.

HYQVIA/Hy Qvia significantly  enhances SC administration in PID by  [CONTACT_614575]  (as compared to conventional IGSC therap y) without requiring greater 
doses than those administered b yIV(Schiff et al., 2008) .
In addition, HYQVIA/HyQvia allows the SC administration of standard PID monthly  
dosing volumes and the utilization of infusion rates equal to IV administration while 
preserving the advantages of SC administration (Schiff et al., 2008 ). These advantages 
may be particularl y relevant to neurology indications, including immune -mediated 
neuropathies for IgG usage, that require immunomodulatory  doses up to 5 times higher 
than immune replacement doses.
One clinical stud y with HYQVIA/HyQvia in CIDP is currentl y ongoing: Study
 161403, 
aPhase III Efficacy , Safety , and Tolerability  Study  of HYQVIA/Hy Qvia and 
GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG. It is a Phase III m ulticenter, double -blind, placebo 
controlled study .
This clinical study  is being performed to investigate the long -term tolerability  and safet y 
of rHuPH20 -facilitated IGSC therapy  in subjects with CI DP, who have completed 
Baxalta Clinical Study  [ADDRESS_814911]
6.1.1 HYQVIA/HyQvia
HYQVIA/Hy Qvia is a product that contains both Immune Globulin Infusion 10% 
(Human) (IGI, 10%) and recombinant human h yaluronidase (rHuPH20) packaged as two 
separate vials. Fur ther information is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for 
IGI, 10% with rHuPH20.
[IP_ADDRESS] Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase
rHuPH20 (molecular weight of ~61 kDa) is produced from geneticall y engineered 
Chinese Hamster Ovary  (CHO) cells containing a deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmid 
encoding for a soluble fragment of human h yaluronidase PH20. rHuPH20 is a soluble 
recombinant form of human hy aluronidase that modifies the permeability of connective 
tissue through the h ydrolysis of h yaluronan. rHuPH20 acts locall y and transiently  within

6.5Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to 
Human Subjects
6.5.1 HYQVIA/HyQvia
The clinical development program for HYQVIA/Hy Qvia has demonstrated that I GI, 10% 
administered via SC treatment with rHuPH20 is efficacious and safe in PID. The safet y, 
tolerability , efficacy , and bioavailability  of HYQVIA/Hy Qvia were investigated in one 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_614536] y (160603) and an Extension Study  (160902) in subjects with PID. 
One supportive clinical study  (160602) in subjects with PI D using GAMMAGARD 
LIQUID/KIOVIG (IGI, 10%) administered subcutaneously  was also conducted. Further 
information i s provided in the IB for IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 as well as Prescribing 
Information for HYQVIA and the Summary
 of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for 
HyQvia.
The most common ARs observed in PID clinical trials in >5% of subjects were: local 
reactions, headach e, antibody  formation against rHuPH20, fatigue, nausea, py rexia, and 
vomiting.
The safet y and efficacy  of chronic use of the rHuPH20 solution in HYQVIA/Hy Qvia 
hasnot been established in conditions other than PID. Study 160603 compared the 
efficacy , pharma cokinetics, safet y, and tolerability of IGIV, 10% and IGI, 10% 
administered subcutaneously  following rHuPH20 solution. Study  160902, an 
extension tostudy  160603, assessed the long -term tolerability  and safet y of 
IGI, 10% following administration of rHuPH2 0 solution.

Eighteen percent (15 of 83) of subjects with PID receiving IGI, 10% with rHuPH20 in 
Baxter Study  [ADDRESS_814916] rHuPH20 (binding and neutralizing 
antibodies) will be monitored during this clinical study  (See Section 12.7.10 for details).
Pregnancy, Breast Feeding, Fertility
IGSC products have been shown to cross the placenta, increasingly  during the third 
trimester. Clinical experience with immunog lobulins suggests that no harmful effects on 
the course of pregnancy  or on the fetus and the neonate are to be expected. Development 
and reproductive toxicology  studies have been conducted with rHuPH20 in mice and 
rabbits. No adverse effects on pregnancy  and fetal development were associated with 
anti-rHuPH20 antibodies. I n these studies, maternal antibodies to rHuPH20 were 
transferred to offspring in utero. The effects of antibodies to the rHuPH20 component of 
HyQvia on the human embry o or on human fetal d evelopment are currently  unknown.
Immunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may  contribute to protecting the neonate 
from pathogens that have a mucosal portal of entry . 
For subjects in the European Union (EU): The safet y of H yQvia for use in human 
pregnancy  has not been established in controlled clinical trials and therefore should only  
be given with caution to pregnant or breastfeeding women.
For subjects in US: HyQvia should be given to a pregnant or nursing woman only  if 
clearl y indicated.
There ar e currently  no clinical safet y data for Hy Qvia on fertility  available. Clinical 
experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no harmful effects of IGI 10% on fertility  
are to be expected. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects o f 
rHuPH20 with respect to reproductive potential at the doses used for facilitating 
administration of IGI 10%.
Subjects who become pregnant during thestudy should bewithdrawn from thestudy .

6.5.[ADDRESS_814917] LIQUID/KIOVIG
GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG will not be used as an investigational drug in 
thisstudy . However, GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG— also known as IGI, 10% —
isthe immunoglobulin product in HYQVIA/Hy Qvia. I nformation on this product is 
therefore also presented:
IGI, 10% administered via IV treatment (GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG) 
isefficacious and safe in the particular fields of therapeutic use and approved 
indications, ie, PI D, ITP, and MMN, as demonstrated in the clinical development 
program for GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG. 
Please see the IB for IG I, 10% for further information, as well as the Prescribing 
Information for GAMMAGARD LIQUID and the S mPC for KI OVIG.
Serious ARs (defined as serious adverse events [SAEs] occurring during or within 
72hours of infusion or any  casuall y related SAE occurring within the study period) that 
occurred in the clinical trials of GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG were asepti c 
meningitis, pulmonary  embolism, and blurred vision.
The most common ARs observed in ≥5% of subjects were: 
PID, IV administration: headache, fatigue, py rexia, nausea, chills, rigors, pain in 
extremity , diarrhea, migraine, dizziness, vomiting, cough, urticaria, asthma, 
phary ngolary ngeal pain, rash, arthralgia, m yalgia, oedema peripheral, pruritus, and 
cardiac murmur.
PID, SC administration: infusion site (local) event, headache, fatigue, hea rtrate 
increased, p yrexia, abdominal pain upper, nausea, vomiting, asthma, blood pressure 
systolic increased, diarrhea, ear pain, aphthous stomatitis, migraine, orophary ngeal 
pain, and pain in extremity.
MMN, IV administration: headache, chest discomfort, muscle spasms, muscular 
weakness, nausea, orophary ngeal pain, and pain in extremity .
Rare but serious events may  occur with IGI products, including hy persensitivity , 
thrombosis, renal dy sfunction/failure, hy perproteinemia, increased serum viscosity , and 
hyponatremia hemol ysis, hemoly sis, transfusion- related acute lung injury  (TRALI), and 
aseptic meningitis sy ndrome.

Thrombosis may  occur with immune globulin products, including IGI, 10%. Risk factors 
may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hy percoagulable conditions, 
history  of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling vascular catheters, 
hyper viscosity , and cardiovascular risk factors.
Renal dy sfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death may  occur in 
predispose d patients receiving IGIV products including IGI, 10%. Renal dy sfunction and 
acute failure occur more commonly  with IGIV products containing sucrose. IGI, 10% 
does not contain sucrose.
IGI, 10% contains blood group antibodies (isoagglutinins) that may  caus
e 
hemoly sis.Delay ed hemoly tic anemia can develop subsequent to IGI, 10% therapy  
duetoenhanced red blood cell (RBC) sequestration. Acute hemol ysis, consistent with 
intravascular hemoly sis, has been reported. The following risk factors may  be related to 
the development of hemoly sis: high doses (eg, ≥2 g/kg, single administration or divided 
over several day s) and non -O blood group. Underlying inflammatory  state in an 
individual patient may  increase the risk of hemolysis but its role is uncertain.
Contraindi cations to I GI, 10% treatment include anaphy lactic or severe s ystemic 
hypersensitivity reactions to I G, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) -deficient patients with 
antibodies against IgA and a history  of hy persensitivity .
IGI, 10% has a high margin of safet y. Scree ning against potentiall y infectious agents 
begins with the donor selection process and continues throughout plasma collection and 
preparation. Three validated, dedicated, independent, and effective virus 
inactivation/removal steps have been integrated into the manufacturing and formulation 
processes, further increasing the margin of safety . In addition, careful screening and 
monitoring of subjects in this study  will be utilized to minimize the above and other 
known risks associated with I G therap y (eg, excl usion criteria, blood group ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_614537], and laboratory  monitoring for hemol ysis).

Due to a manufacturer (CME America) recall on the Bod y Guard 323 pump and pump 
tubing, a replacement pump (for US and CANADA only ) will be the Q Core 
–Sapphire 
pump. 
The Bod y Guard 323 pump and pump tubing will continue to be used in 
EU/ROW. Details on the infusion parameters with each pump is provided in the 
Investigator Site Infusion Manual.
Prior to subjects being allowed to infuse at these higher infusion rates than specifi edin 
Infusion Manual in the home setting, this should first be conducted under medical 
supervision in the clinic setting. At high infusion rates above 750 mL/h (if trifurcated 
needle set for 3 infusion sites is used), the pump occlusion alarm m ay be activated due to 
high back pressure, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_614525]. If thisoccurs, then reduce the infusion rate to 
allow proper pump function. These rates should not be exceeded unless the investigator 
determines that higher infusion rates could be attempted a nd as long as the higher 
infusion rates are attempted under medical supervision in the clinic setting, prior to 
allowing their use in the home setting.
Site of administration: Bifurcated and trifurcated needle sets are to be used for 2 and 
3infusions, res pectivel y. The recommended site(s) for the infusion of HYQVIA/Hy Qvia 
are the middle to upper abdomen and the thighs. 
Volume of infusion per site: IGI 10% solution may be administered at 1, 2, or 3 infusion 
sites with a maximum infusion volume of up to 300 mL per infusion site for subjects 
weighing <40 kg, as tolerated. On a given infusion day , the maximum infusion volume 
should not exceed 1200 mL  for subjects weighing ≥40 kg or 600 mL for subjects 
weighing <[ADDRESS_814931]. Should 
the total infusion volume that is to be administered exceed either 1200 mL for subjects 
≥40 kg or 600 mL for subjects <40kg, or exceed the
maximum infusion volume a subject 
can tolerate on a given infusion day , then the total dose may  be administered over 
multiple day s as divided doses a recommended 48 to 72 h apart (eg, Day  1 and Day  3 of a 
given infusion cy cle, but left to the investigator’s discretion) to allow the infused fluid to 
be absorbed.
Note: The volume (mL) of infusion solution to be administered will be calculated using 
the subject’s bod y weight measured at baseline. Adjustment based on body weight 
changes during the course of th e stud y is not planned, however it may be done if deemed 
medically  necessary  by [CONTACT_093] (eg, clinically  significant bod y weight change).

administration are described in Section 8.7.3. Description of treatment, including 
treatment period, doses, and dosage frequency , are detailed in Section 8.7.4 .
The number of infusion visits during the SC treatment period will vary  across subjects , 
depending on whether their infusion cy cles are every  2, 3, or 4 weeks.
Subjects will continue to receive the same dose and dosing regimen of HYQVIA/Hy Qvia 
in the Extension Study  as the subject’s full dose received in Epoch 1 of the Phase III 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_311906] y (Study  161403).
The study  product components of HYQVIA/Hy Qvia will be administered sequentially . 
SC infusion of rHuPH20 solution at a dose of 80 U/g IgG will be administered first, to be 
followed b y SC infusion of IGI , 10% within [ADDRESS_814942]’s next 
scheduled dosing (every  2, 3, or 4 weeks). The dose will be the same as that administered 
in Study 161403. The first infusion will be at the subject’s full dose; there will be no 
ramp -up of dose.
After the first 12 weeks of treatment in the Extension Study , the dosing interval of 
HYQVIA/Hy Qvia may  be adjusted for subject preference provided that it is safe to do so 
at the investigator’s discretion. If medicall y necessary , the interval and/or dose may  be

Unscheduled Visit for Relapse Assessment
Subjects who relapse (defined as an increase in adjusted I NCAT disability  score by  
≥1point relative to t he baseline score of this extension study  on 2 consecutive I NCAT 
assessments) will be discontinued from the extension study .
At any  time during the SC treatment period, unscheduled visit(s) to the study  site will be 
allowed for subjects who experience CIDP worsening to perform INCAT, R -ODS, hand 
grip strength, and MRC sum score assessments.
10.3.3 Study Completion/Early Termination Visit
Subjects may  end their active participation in the SC treatment period in [ADDRESS_814944] participating country  gets market authorization for the treatment 
of CIDP in either US or EU (whichever comes later). Study  completion 
assessments are to be conducted on the day  of the final infusion. This will mark the 
subjects’ completion of the study .
2.A subject may  withdraw their participation in the study  or be discontinued from the 
study  prior to completing treatment. These subjects will be asked to undergo an 
early termination visit at the study site prior to discontinuation from the study .
10.4 Management of Infusion -Related AEs
Itis the investigator’s responsibility  to monitor the safet y and well -
being of the subject 
and to assure that all infusions are conducted in the prescribed and timel y manner 
throughout the stud y, regardless of the location of administration. Subjects and ca regivers 
will be provided with information about the ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_10926] s ymptoms of possible AEs 
and when the subject/caregiver should immediately call the investigator or go to the 
emergency  room/department for immediate treatment.
The occurrence of certai n AEs, such as headache, chills, or body  aches, may  be reduced 
by [CONTACT_1743].
Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1674], hy persensitivity , or anaphy lactic reaction(s) requires 
immediate discontinuation of the infusion and administration of appropriate medical 
treatment in accordance with the local standard of care.

Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_12692] JAN 11
Any rate reductions, interruptions, or discontinuation of an infusion and, if applicable, 
any medications and/or non -
drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_1675](s) must be recorded in the 
appropriate CRF(s). The use of an y pre -medication(s) must be recorded in the appropriate 
CRF(s). See Section 10.5.[ADDRESS_814945] -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614542]. The use of steroids, however, may  confound the interpretation and 
analysis of the ef ficacy  outcome measures in this study . Therefore, the guidelines listed 
below concerning the use of steroids in this study  are to be followed:
Systemic corticosteroids at doses >10 mg/prednisolone/day  or its equivalent are not 
permitted throughout the cour se of the stud y if given for worsening of CIDP.
Low-dose s ystemic corticosteroids ( ≤10 mg prednisolone/day  or its equivalent) are 
permitted; however, the dosage should remain stable unless a change is deemed 
medically necessary .
In the event a change in low- dose s ystemic corticosteroid dose or the addition 
of a low -dose s ystemic corticosteroid is necessary during the study , it must be 
approved b y the Medical Monitor prior to the addition/change being made, 
whenever possible. It must be determined whether co ntinuing in the study  
may pose increased risk to the subject due to the condition requiring treatment 
and/or whether the condition may  impede the subject’s participation in the 
study  or confound the results of the study .
Non-systemic corticosteroids (eg, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], ophthalmic, or inhaled glucocorticoids) 
areallowed at an ytime before screening andduring thecourse ofthestudy .
Immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive agents (such as azathioprine and 
methotrexate) have been reported to be beneficial and may  be considered for use as an 
add-on therapy  in clinical practice when the response to corticosteroids, IGIV, or PE is 
inadequate (European Federation of Neurological Societies, 2010 ). However, clinical 
efficacy  of these agents remains to be proven. Neve rtheless, to avoid confounding effects 
on the interpretation of the efficacy  outcome measures in this study , the use of 
immunomodulatory /immunosuppressive agents during the course of the study  is not
permitted.

following:
Other IgG products
For questions about medications and non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614543], please consult 
the Medical Monitor.
10.5.1 Immunizations
Passive transfer of antibodies (such as via IgG treatment) may  transiently  impair the 
immune responses to live attenuated virus vaccines, such as mumps, rubella, and varicella 
for up to 6 months and for 1 y ear or more to measles (rubeola). Subjects should be 
instructed that when they are receiving vacci nations that they  are to inform the 
immunizing healthcare professional of this potential interaction between IgG treatment 
and vaccinations, and that the subject is receiving IgG therapy. Annual influenza vaccines 
are permitted.
10.5.2 Pre-Medications for Infusion Administration
For subjects who are prone to infusion- related AEs, if the same ty pe of mild -to-moderate, 
non-serious AE(s) expected to be related to infusion (eg, headache, chills, fever, flushing, 
malaise) occur(s) during or after [ADDRESS_814947] may  be pre -medicated 
for subsequent infusion(s) at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with the 
standard of care at the investigative site. Subjects may  be pre -medicated with 
acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti
-inflammatory  drugs (NSAI Ds), antihistamines and/or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930]. If any  of these agents do not adequatel y prevent the infusion -
related AE(s), consult with the Medical Monitor.
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_12866] (eg, EML A) may  be used if the needle insertion was intolerable in 
prior infusions. Subjects who have a history  of using topi[INVESTIGATOR_12866] (eg, EML A) for 
IV infusions may  also use these topi[INVESTIGATOR_614544].
The use of an y pre-medications should be recorded in the appropriate CRF(s).

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 
11.1
The Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) Disability Scale
The INCAT 10- points disability  scale (Hughes et al., 2001) is the most widely  used 
assessment tool to measure the functional activity  level of patients with CIDP. The 
INCAT disability  scale consists of upper and lower extremity  components, with a 
maximum of 5 points for the upper extremities (arm disability ) and a maximum of 
5points for the lower extremities (leg disability ), which are summed for an overall 
INCAT disability  score ranging from 0 to 10 points, where 0 is normal (eg, no upper limb 
problems and walking not affected) and 10 is severely  incapacitated ( eg, inability  to 
move either arm for an y purposeful movement and restricted to wheelchair, unable to 
stand and walk a few steps with help).
The INCAT disability  score is considered to be an effective and responsive tool to assess 
clinical response to treat ment in CI DP(Hughes et al., 2008, Merkies et al., 2010) .
Anadjusted INCAT disability  score is the same as the INCAT disability  score, with 
theonly exception in the exclusion of changes from 0 (normal) to 1 (minor sy mptoms) 
(orvice versa) in upper limb function since this reflects only  a symptomatic change 
andisnot considered to be a clinicall y me aningful change of functional ability  
(Hughes et al., 2008 ).A ≥1-point change in the adjusted I NCAT disability  score is 
considered to be a clinically  significant response to treatment and has been used as the 
primary  efficacy  outcome measure in a number of clinical trials in CIDP, including the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_614546] (Hughes et al., 2008, Léger et al., 2013) .
The INCAT disability  scale will be administered at the study  site by  [CONTACT_1275]/designee using a validated translated version, as applicable. It is 
recommended that the investigator/designee complete the asse ssment using the same 
translated version throughout the course of their participation in the study .
In order to reduce the possibility  of bias, investigators/designees who perform INCAT
assessments must not have access to information regarding any  AE(s) experienced by  [CONTACT_614583]. The investigator/designee who administers the 
INCAT to a particular subject should remain constant throughout the stud y for that
particular subject and should be the same individual that administers the MRC to that 
subject. For detailed administration timepoints, see Section 21.2 Schedule of Study  
Procedures and Assessments.

11.2 Rasch -Built Overall Disability Scale (R -ODS)
The R -ODS is a patient self -reported, linearly -weighted overall disability  scale that was 
specificall y designed to capture activity  and social participation limitations in pati ents 
with immune -mediated peripheral neuropathies including CIDP (van Nes et al., 2011) .
The R -ODS is composed of 24 items for which subjects are asked to rate their 
functioning (ie, no difficulty , some difficult y, or could not do) related to a variet y of 
every day tasks at the moment of completion. The R -ODS has a high i nternal/external 
validity , acceptable reliability  scores, and high discriminant validity . In a recent 
publication, the R- ODS was reported to be a more responsive scale in capturing clinically 
meaningful changes over time in newly  diagnosed or relapsing pat ients with Guillain 
Barré S yndrome (GBS) and CI DP compared with the widely  used ordinal -based INCAT
(Draak et al., 2014 ).
The R -ODS will be directly  recorded in the subject’s electronic diary  using a translated 
version, as applicable. It is recommended that the subject completes the assessment using 
the same translated version throughout the course of their participation in the study . For 
detailed administration timepoints, see Section 21.[ADDRESS_814958]’s distal strength and upper limb function, is 
commonly  used in clinical practice to monitor the subject’s clinical and functional status, 
as well as response to treatment (Merkies et al., 2000 ). Hand gr ip strength measurement 
using devices such as a hand dy namometer is of particular relevance in subjects with 
peripheral neuropathies in which distal weakness predominates.
In this stud y, hand grip strength will be assessed as a measure of motor function us ing the 
Vigorimeter (Martin, Tuttlingen, German y), an instrument that is commonly used in 
patients with immune -mediated neuropathies. The instrument has good validity , 
reliability , and responsiveness, and has been shown to capture both meaningful 
improveme nt and deterioration earlier than the INCAT disability  scale.
Hand grip strength will be administered at the study site b y the investigator/designee. For 
detailed administration timepoints, see Section 21.2 Schedule of Study  Procedures and 
Assessments.

11.4 Medical Research Council Sum Score
The MRC sum score will serve as a measure of muscle strength (Kley weg et al., 1991 ).  
To obtain an MRC sum score, the following muscles on each side of the body  are 
examined, and the strength of each muscle is rated according to the MRC scale: deltoids, 
biceps, wrist extensors, iliopsoas, quadriceps, and anterior tibialis. The MRC scale ran ges 
from 0 to 5, where: 
0 = no visible contraction;
1 = visible contraction without movement of the limb;
2 = movement of the limb but not against gravit y;
3 = movement against gravity over (almost) the full range;
4 = movement against gravity  and resista nce; and,
5 =normal.
All scores from both the left and right side of the body  are summed to obtain the MRC 
sum score. The MRC sum score ranges from 0 (paral ysis) to 60 (normal strength).
The MRC scale will be administered at the study  site by  [CONTACT_17062]/designee. The 
investigator/designee who performs the MRC scale evaluation for a particular subject 
should remain constant throughout the stud y for that particular subject and should be the 
same individual that administers the INCAT to that subject. I n order to reduce the 
possibility  of bias, investigators/designees who perform MRC scale assessments must not 
have access to information regarding an y AE(s) experienced b y the particular subject 
they are evaluating. For detailed administration timepoints, see Section 21.2 Schedule of 
Study  Procedures and Assessments.

dose meets one or more of the following criteria:
Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death)
Is life -threatening –
defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment

elective, or spontaneous abortion shall be considered an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Unexp ected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)
Any suspected adverse reaction to study  treatment (i.e., including active comparators) 
that is both serious and unexpected (S[LOCATION_003]R). 
The event(s) must meet all of the following:
Suspected adverse reaction
Serious
Unex pected
Assessed as related to study  treatment
Once determined to meet the criteria for a S[LOCATION_003]R, a SAE should be submitted to 
regulatory  agencies expeditiously . 
The reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-Serious Adverse Event
A non-serious AE is an AE that does not meet the criteria of an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Events
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome 
isnot consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Reference 
Safety Information (RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in 
theIB and/or prescribing information as occurring with a clas s of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product but are not 
specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation. 
For non-commercial use only

Theexpectedness of AEs will be determined by  [CONTACT_506383]/or 
prescribing information as the RSI . This determination will include considerations such 
as the number of AEs previously  observed, but not on the basis of what might be 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a product.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Reactions Plus Susp ected Adverse Reactions
An AR plus suspected AR is any  AE that meets any  of the following criteria:
an AE considered b y either the investigator and/or the sponsor to be possibly or

an AE that begins during infusion of IP or within 72 hours following the end of IP 
infusion, or
an AE for which causality assessment is missing or indeterminate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-existing Diseases
Pre-existing diseases that are present before entry  in to the study  are described in the 
medical history
, and those that manifest with the same severity , frequency , or duration 
after IP exposure, will not be recorded as AEs. However, when there is an incre ase in the 
severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on 
the AE CRF.

be included in the analy sis of AEs:
CIDP relapse or worsening reflective of disease progression and meeting ≥1 point 
increase in the adjusted INCAT disability  score will be collected and re corded on 
the appropriate CRF(s).
Infusion site swelling following SC infusion of IGI, 10% solution that is reported 
by [CONTACT_614584] . Infusion of a large

All other AEs from the firs t IP exposure until study  completion/discontinuation date will 
be described on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis 
could be established at the time of reporting the AE, a sy mptom or sign, in standard 
medical terminology  in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions (see definition in Section 12.1.1 ). Each AE will be evaluated by [CONTACT_150061]:
Seriousness as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Severity  as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Causal relationship to IP exposure or study  procedure as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and, if 
applicable, action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug 
interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE 
CRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution, medically  stabilized, or 
30 day s after the study  completion/termination visit, whichever comes first. Follow -up 
information will be recorded in the appropriate CRF(s) as applicable unless the database 
has alread y locked. If the severit y rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event 
resolves, the original AE report will be revised (ie, the event will not be reported as a 
separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the h ighest severit y rating will be reported. 
Deviations from the protocol- specified dosage (including overdosing, underdosing, 
abuse, and withdrawal) that result in AEs meeting criteria for SAEs, treatment errors 
(including incorrect route of administration, u se of an incorrect product, and deviations 
from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, 
and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard to occurrence 
of AEs and/or other observations because these events may  be reportable to regulatory  
authorities.
Any pregnancy  that occurs after administration of IP will be reported on a Pregnancy  
Report Form. Attempts will be made to follow the subject through completion of the 
pregnancy  and the inf ant up to [ADDRESS_814961] be rep orted on the provided SAE Report Form within 24 hours after 
awareness; no additional reporting on CRFs is necessary .

[IP_ADDRESS] Severity
The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and 
judgment based on the most appropriate description below:
1.Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner 
with the subject’s normal functioning level.
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require minimal therapeutic 
intervention.
2.Moderate
The AE produces lim ited impairment of function and may
 require therapeutic 
intervention.
The AE produces no sequela/sequelae.
3.Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may  lead to temporary  
inability  to resume usual life pattern.
The AE produces sequela/se quelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic 
intervention.
These severity  definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study-
related procedure(s), if necessary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality
Causality  is a determination of whether there is a reasonab le possibility  that the I P is 
etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality  assessment includes, eg, 
assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association 
(or lack of association) with underly ing disease, prese nce (or absence) of a more likely  
cause, and ph ysiological plausibility . For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment 
according to the following most appropriate a lgorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
Not related (both circumstances must be met)
Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent 
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs
For non-commercial use only
HYQVIA/HyQvia CONFIDENTIAL Page 69of 120
Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_12692] JAN 11
Is not associated with the IP (ie, does not follow a rea sonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of IP or has a much more likel y alternative 
etiology )
Unlikely  related (either 1 or both circumstances are met)
Has little or no temporal relationship to the IP
A more likely  alternative etiology exists
Possibly  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of IP
An alternative etiology  is equally  or less likely  compared to the potential 
relationship to the IP
Probably  related (both circumstances must be met)
Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P, which may  
include but is not limited to the following:
oReappearance of a similar reaction upon re -administration (positive 
rechallenge)
oPositive results in a drug sensitivity test (skin test, etc.)
oToxic level of the IP as evidenced by  [CONTACT_44696]
Another etiology  is unlikely  or significantly  less likely
For events assessed as not related or unlikel y related and occu rring within 72 hours after 
completion of I P administration, the investigator shall provide the alternative etiology .
These causality  definitions will also be used to assess the relationship of an AE with a 
study -related procedure(s), if necessary .

The Common Toxicity  Criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) 
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group, 2006) , published by  [CONTACT_1742]., 1982, will be 
used to grade the following laboratory  values:
ALP, ALT, AST, BUN, Hgb, 
lymphocy tes, neutrophils, platelet count, serum 
creatinine, serum total bilirubin, and WBC.
Grading for LDH will use the same thresholds as defined for ALT and AST.
Sodium and potassium will be graded using the thresholds taken from 
theWorld Health Organi zation (WHO) toxicity  grading system 
(World Health Organization, 2003) . 
For non-commercial use only

Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: [PHONE_12692] JAN 11
The laboratory  parameters and the corresponding grading scale are provided in 
Section 21.4. The toxicity scale is defined as: 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 
3 = severe, 4 = life -threatening (U.S.Department of Health and Human Services et al., 
2008) .
Laboratory
 parameters not listed in Table 21-3will not be graded. However, clinical 
significance of those abnormal laboratory  values will be assessed as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values 
The investigator’s assessment of each laboratory  value will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF/laboratory  form. For each abnormal laboratory  value, the investigator 
will det
ermine whether the laboratory  value (except hy aluronidase antibody  values) is 
considered clinically  significant or not. For clinically  significant values, the investigator 
will indicate if the value constitutes a new AE (see definition in Section 12.1, and record 
the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF), is a sy mptom or related to a 
previously  recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]), 
or is due to another issue that will be specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically  
significant, the investigator will indicate the rea son, ie, because it is due to a pre -existing 
disease, due to a lab error, or due to another issue that will be specified. Additional tests 
and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology  of an abnormal 
value or to monitor the cours
e of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. 
Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator.

Guidance on Reporting and Assessing rHuPH20 antibody test results
All hy aluronidase antibody  test results (titers, and binding or neutralizing) will be 
assessed for clinical significance b y the investigator in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
database bu t are not to be reported as AEs. 
For AEs occurring during the SC infusion of h yaluronidase the investigator and sponsor 
will independently  assess relatedness, also taking into account quantitative and qualitative 
test results for h yaluronidase antibodies.
For AEs occurring upon or after subsequent SC infusion of the immunoglobulin 
component an assessment of causalit y is confounded by [CONTACT_614586] y 
administered IMPs. The overlap is transient due to the short half -life of hyaluronidase of
about [ADDRESS_814974] results. The following samples are 
planned:
Serum IgG samples (back-up aliquots)
Anti- rHuPH20 bindi ng antibody  samples (back -upaliquots)
Anti- rHuPH20 neutralizing antibod y samples (back -upaliquots)
Baseline and end -of-trial serum/plasma back -up samples will be stored for possible 
testing of pathogens for no more than 2 years after the final study rep ort has been 
completed.
Other back -up samples that remain after study  testing is done may  be stored and used for 
additional testing (eg, further evaluation of an abnormal test, investigation of an AE or 
suspected seroconversion ).Samples will be stored in a coded form for no more than 
2years after the final study report has been completed and subsequently  the samples will 
be destro yed. The need for HIV and hepatitis serology  should be determined by  [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_614553] . For detailed sampling 
timepoints, see Table 21-2.

12.8 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include body  temperature (°C or °F), respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (breath s/minute), 
pulse rate (beats/minute), and resting s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg). 
Blood pressure will be measured when subjects are in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/sitting position. Vital 
signs will be measured at baseline, periodically  at each infusion visit, and at study  
completion/earl y termination visit (See Section 21.2 Schedule of Study  Procedures and 
Assessments detailed collection timepoints).
Forthe initial 2 SC infusions, vital signs are to be monitored and recorded at any  time 
prior to infusion, in the event of occurrence of AE(s), and within 60 minutes of 
completion of an infusion. During subsequent infusion visits, vital signs will be taken 
only in the event of an AE that occurs during an infusion and when a healthcare 
professional (eg, infusion nurse) is present to take the measurements. In these cases, vital 
signs will be taken at the onset of an AE (or as soon as the AE is reported) and wit hin 
60minutes of completion of an infusion. Additional vital signs may  be taken as deemed 
medically  necessary  to monitor the AE. Subjects/caregivers will be instructed that if a 
healthcare professional is not present at an infusion and the subject experie
nces an AE 
necessitating stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_614554], the subject/caregiver should immediately contact 
[CONTACT_614587]/department.
Body height (in or cm) will be obtained from the baseline visit in Study  161403. Weight 
(lb or kg), as well as body  mass index (BMI), will be collected at baseline of Study  
161505. Subsequently , body  weight will be re -measured every  24 weeks and in the event 
of clinically  significant change in body  weight (see Section 21.2 for detailed 
measurement timepoints). All body  weight measurements are to be taken at the study  site 
using the same scale/instrument throughout the study  for that individual sub ject. 
Subject’s self -reported weights will not be used at any  time during the course of the 
study .
Vital sign values are to be recorded on the appropriate CRF. For each abnormal vital sign 
value, the investigator will determine whether or not to report an AE (see definition in 
Section 12.1) and record the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign on the AE 
CRF. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or 
etiology  of an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE, should be obtained 
when clinicall y indicated. Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at the 
discretion of the investigator.

13.OTHER ASSESSMENTS
13.1 Short Form -36 Health Survey
Quality  of life measures are useful in assessing the relative burden of disease as well as 
the degree to which treatment has made a difference in the well
-being of an individual. 
The SF -36 health survey  will be utilized to assess changes in HRQOL and functional 
health (Ware et al., 2000) . The SF -36 health survey  is a standardized, validated 
instrument designed to be self -administered by  [CONTACT_130690] 14 y ears and older and is 
composed of items grouped into 8 domains. The domains reflected in the phy sical 
component summary  score (PCS) are ph ysical functioning, role -physical, bodily  pain, 
and general health. The domains captured in the mental component summary  score 
(MCS) include social functioning, role -emotional, vitality , and mental health.
The SF -[ADDRESS_814975] complete the assessment using 
the same translated version through out the course of the study . For detailed 
administration timepoints, see Section 21.2 Schedule of Study  Procedures and 
Assessments.
13.2 EuroQoL (Qualit y of Life) -5 Dimensions (EQ -
5D-3L)
The EQ -5D is a validated, self -administered assessment of overall health designed by  
[CONTACT_614588], 1990 .It is a descriptive s ystem of HRQOL states consisting of 
5dimensions (mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and 
anxiety /depression). Subjects are asked to describe their health state that day  by [CONTACT_43435] 
[ADDRESS_814976] the levels of severit y for each of the 5 dimensions: no 
problems, some or moderate problems, or extreme problems. The EQ -5D also includes a 
standard vertical 20 -cm visual analogue scale (similar to a thermometer) for recording a 
subject’s rating of their current HRQOL state.
The EQ-5D- 3Lwill be administered at the study  site using a validated translated version, 
as applicable. It is recommended that the subject complete the assessment using the same 
translated version throughout the course of the study . For detailed administration 
timepoints, see Section 21.2 Schedule of Study  Procedures and Assessments. 
13.3 Health Resource Utilization
The HRU items will assess subjects’ utilization of healt h services such as day s off from 
school/work, unscheduled phy sician visits (including urgent care visits to see healthcare 
providers), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and emergency  room visits. HRU does not include visits and 
days off from school/work for study -related outpatient procedures and assessments.

medication. The [ADDRESS_814978] complete the 
assessment using the same translated version throughout the course of the study . For 
detailed administration timepoints, see Section 21.2 Schedule of Study  Procedures and 
Assessments.
13.6 Patient Global Impressi on of Change
The Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale is a single item recorded at study  
completion/termination that evaluates the subject’s perspective on whether or not they  
have improved since the beginning of treatment. The PGI C is used as an ‘anchor’ in the 
determination of clinically  meaningful change. Subjects rate their perception of 
improvement or deterioration since the beginning of treatment on a 7 -point scale ranging 
from “very  much worse” to “very  much improved”.
The PGI C scale will be completed using a translated version, as applicable. I t is 
recommended that the subject complete the item using the same translated version 
throughout the course of the study .

14.3 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data
Missing or incomplete AE start/stop dates, relationship to study  medication, severit y, and 
seriousness will be imput ed. Missing or partial AE start dates will be imputed for the 
purpose of determining treatment emergence. If an AE start date is completely  missing, 
the AE will be considered treatment -emergent in the extension study . If a partial AE start 
date is supplied , then the later of (1) the first infusion date in the Extension Study  or (2) 
the earliest date that is consistent with the available data will be used as an imputed start 
date for determining treatment emergence. If an AE has a missing causality assessmen t, 
the relationship of the AE to treatment will be counted as “related”. If an AE has a 
missing severit y assessment, the severit y will be imputed as “unknown”, except that if the 
subject also had a severe AE categorized under the same preferred term, then the AE of 
unknown severit y will be imputed as a severe AE. Events of unknown seriousness will be 
tabulated as SAEs; however, every  effort will be made to avoid data lock with events for 
which a determination of seriousness remains missing. The Medical Monitoring Plan 
presents details of how this effort will be executed.

determined from the recorded data, then the infusion will be imputed as “Not done”. 
Otherwise, an y infusion that has some amount of recorded data will be assumed to have 
been completed, unless the available data indicate otherwise. If the infusion dose level is 
missing, it will be imputed as unchanged from the previous infusion. If an infusion start 
date a nd/or time is missing or incomplete, a date and time of infusion will be imputed.
Missing antibody  data will be imputed as “No new development of antibodies”. No 
specific values will be imputed for quantitative summaries.
Missing INCAT assessments that pertain to determination of relapse status will be

Missing Ig trough levels will not be imputed for any  quantitative anal ysis.
Missing or incomplete start and stop dates for prior/concomitant medications and non -
drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614555].
Missing or incomplete assessment dates (or date -times if needed to support calculations) 
will be imputed for time to event anal yses.
The SAP will provide mo
re detailed imputation rules for the handling of missing and 
incomplete dates and times of assessments and events.
Clinical laboratory  values that contain non -numeric values due to assay  results that were 
above or below the limit of quantitation will be imputed at the upper or lower limit of the 
assay , respectivel y, if needed for an y analysis.
Data will not be imputed in any  quantitative summaries by  [CONTACT_614590]. Both 
scheduled and unscheduled assessments will be used in all event- based analy ses (rel apse, 
occurrence of AEs, etc.). Unscheduled visit data will not be used in any  “by-visit” 
descriptive summaries.
Data such as (but not limited to) laboratory tests that were not specified for collection in 
the protocol will be reviewed on a case -by-case ba sis for handling decisions during the

and descriptive statistics overall for all subjects in the SAF anal ysis set. There are no 
statistical h ypotheses to be tested and no planned statistical testing. However, results may 
be presented b y 161403 Epoch 1 actual treatment and overall, where applicable.
Continuous measures will be summarized using the number of subjects in the sample (n), 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical outcomes 
will be summarized using the number and percentage of subjects. Event rates will be 
estimated in several different way s, depending on the outcome measure, as explained in 
the remainder of this section. All collected data will be listed or provided in Clinical Data 
Interchange Standards Consortium (CDI SC)-compliant datasets.
14.4.1 Primary Outcome Measure
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety/Tolerability
Clinically  important treatment -emergent abnormalities in vital signs, laboratory  
assessments, and ph ysical examination results will be reported as AEs. All AEs will be 
coded using Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) version 18.1 
(Sep 2015) and reported by  [CONTACT_44749] (ie, MedDRA sy stem organ class), prefer red 
term, and treatment received in the previous study (Study  161403).
All analy ses of AEs will be performed using data from the SAF anal ysis set. All TEAEs, 
SAEs, ARs/suspected ARs, AEs that could be related to possible immune -mediated 
responses to one or more study  medication components, AEs that are temporally  related 
to infusion, and other subsets of AEs will be reported using (1) the number and 
percentage of subjects who experienced a particular ty pe of event at any  time during the 
study , (2) the number and rate of reports of a specified type of event per subject -year of 
time at risk, and/or (3) the number and rate of reports of a specified ty pe of event per
infusion.
Any ongoing TEAE that occurred during Study  [ADDRESS_814982] infusion in the continuation study , this AE will be reported as a new TEAE.

The purpose of examining all TEAEs without regard to causalit y is to identify an y 
potential new signals that may  arise. The following summaries of all TEAEs are planned:
1.The number and percentage of subjects who had any  TEA E, any  serious TEAE, any
TEAE leading toearlywithdrawal, anyTEAE with onset during and within 
72hours after infusion, any  moderate or severe TEAE, any  localized TEAE, any  
moderate or severe localized TEAE, or an y TEAE leading to death will be 
summarized in a single table.
2. The number and percentage of subjects who had a TEAE, serious TEAE, TEAE 
leading to earl y withdrawal, TEAE that occurred in >5% of subjects, or TEAE that 
occurred during or within 72 hours after infus ion will be summarized overall and 
by [CONTACT_3148], MedDRA sy stem organ class, and preferred term in a separate table 
for each specified group of events.
3. The total number of reports, and event rates expressed as number of events (reports) 
per infusion, per su bject, and per subject- year of time at risk, will be summarized

iIn the event of an antibody titer of 1:160 or greater.
jHem olysis Panel: The hemolytic anemia panel will consist of hemoglobin (Hgb), lactate dehydrogenase, serum haptoglobin, plasma -free (unbound) 
Hgb, serum direct anti -globulin (direct Coomb’s) test (antibody elution to be performed if direct Coomb’s test is positive), reticulocyte count, as well as 
urine hemosiderin. The hemolytic anemia panel be conducted only in the event of a drop in Hgb of 1 g/dL or more compared to b aseline value.
k The Hgb result obtained from the baseline visit in the Extension Study will serve as the baseline Hgb value for the duration of the Extension Study. In 
the event of a drop in Hgb of 1 g/dL or more compared to previous Hgb, every effort is to be made to perform a hemolytic pane l within 72 hours. At 
any time during the study, an unscheduled hemolytic panel may be performed in the event of suspected hemolytic anemia.

HYQVIA/Hy Qvia in pregnant women.
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with GAMMAGARD 
LIQUID/KIOVIG (IGI 10%) and IGI 10% component of HYQVIA/Hy Qvia. I t is also not 
known whether IGI 10% can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or 
can affect reproduction capacit
y. However, clinical experience with immunoglobulins 
suggests that no harmful effects of IGI 10% on fertility  are to be expected.
Develo pment and reproductive toxicology  studies have been conducted with rHuPH20 in 
mice and rabbits. No adverse effects on pregnancy were associated with anti -rHuPH20 
antibodies. I n these studies, maternal antibodies to rHuPH20 were transferred to offspring 
in utero. The effects of antibodies to the rHuPH20 component of HYQVIA on the human 
embry o or on human fetal development are unknown.
In this stud y, subjects who are women of childbearing potential must agree to utilize a 
highl y effective contraceptive measur e throughout the course of the study  and for [ADDRESS_815000] administration of I P. In accordance with the Clinical Trial Facility  Group 
(CTFG) recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy  testing in clinical trials 
(version 2014 -09-15) (Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG), 2014) , birth control 
methods that may  be considered as highl y effective include the following:
Combined (estrogen- a nd progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception 
associated with inhibition of ovulation:
oral
intravaginal
transdermal
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:
oral
injectable
implantableii
Intrauterine device (IUD) ii
Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS)ii

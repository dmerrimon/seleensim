10 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC RA TIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
 
Staphylococcal  Infections in I nfants  
Seventy percent of late -onset sepsis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is due to gram -
positive organisms.[ADDRESS_331775] commonly isolated 
pathogen.2–7 Staphylococcus  aureus  is associated with overwhelming septic shock, severe 
necrotizing pneumonia,2,8–11 and high risk of mortality (up to 40%).12 The majority (95%) of 
coagulase -negat ive Staphylococcus  isolates and 40% of Staphylococcus aureus  isolates are 
methicillin -resistant (MRSA).9,[ADDRESS_331776] prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_271644].2,13–[ADDRESS_331777] Staphylococcus  species .  
 
Rifampin: Rifampin  is a semisynthetic derivative of rifamycin SV. Rifampin has a wide spectrum 
of antibacterial activity that includes methicillin- resistant staphylococcal species. Rifampin 
inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase but does not inhibit the mammalian enzyme.16 Rifampin is not 
an option for monotherapy given the high likelihood for development of resistance but  is often 
added to facilitate bacterial eradication among infants with persistent  staphylococcal (including 
MRSA) bacteremia.17  
 
Food and D rug Administration (FDA)  label: Rifampin is approved for the treatment of 
tuberculosis and for the treatment of asymptomatic carriers of Neisseria meningitidis  to 
eliminate meningococci from the nasopharynx.[ADDRESS_331778] 
Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Staphylococcus epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353]  (coagulase -negative 
Staphylococcus ); however, the safety and effectiveness of rifampin in treating clinical infections 
due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well -controlled trials.  
 
Understanding of the P K of rifampin in infants is limited (Table 1). The volume (V) of rifampin is 
larger, and clearance (CL) lower, than in older children or adults.18 In 12 pediatric patients aged 
3 months to 12 years (mean age 4.6 years),the V, clearance (CL), and half -life (t½) of rifampin 
were 0.63 L/kg, 0.16 L/kg/h, and 1.94 h, respectively.19 In 9 pediatric patients aged 1 day to 18 
years (mean age 5.6 years) who received a single dose of intravenous (IV) rifampin (20 mg/kg), 
the V, CL, and t½ of rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_271645] 1.1 L/kg, 0.29 L/kg/h, and 2.[ADDRESS_331779] that peak rifampin concentrations between 2 and 5 mg/L seem 
to be effective in the treatment of persistent staphylococcal bacteremia.18 Rifampin clinical trials 
in infants are few. In 10 infants with persistent staphylococcal bacteremia, all subsequently 
cleared their infections in approximately 1 day after receiving IV rifampin 2.5– 10 mg/kg.21 A PK 
study of rifampin (5– 10 mg/kg/day IV) in 21 infants (median gestational age 29 weeks [range 
26–41] and median postnatal age 18 days [range 11– 55 days]) found that the mean rifampin 
half-life was 4.9 +/ - 1.7 hours, and drug CL increased with increasing postnatal age.18 However, 
there was wide inter -patient variability in drug concentrations. This study was lim ited by [CONTACT_271663]. Differences in extracellular 
fluid volume, plasma protein levels, protein affinity to antimicrobials, rate, and mechanism of 
elimination may account for the PK discrepancies observed between infants and older 
populations.18

Ticarcillin -clavulanate : Ticarcillin  is a semisynthetic penicillin with activity against a wide 
range of gram -negative and gram -positive organisms. Ticarcillin is potentially an excellent 
agent to use in infants because of its broad spectrum of activity and safety profile observed in 
older populations.22 Similar to other beta -lactams, ticarcillin’s main CL route is the renal 
system. Ticarcillin is used in combination with clavulanic acid, which is a beta -lactamase 
inhibitor; this combination  is termed ticarcillin -clavulanate.  
 
FDA label: The safety and effectiveness of ticarcillin- clavulanate has not been established in 
infants <3 months of age. Ticarcillin -clavulanate is FDA -approved for patients older than 3 
months of age and is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by [CONTACT_271664]: septicemia (including bacteremia), lower 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], bone and joint infections, skin and skin structure infecti ons, urinary tract 
infections, gynecologic infections, and intra -abdominal infections.  
 Understanding of the safety and PK of ticarcillin- clavulanate in preterm infants is extremely 
limited (Table 2). In a study evaluating the PK of single -dose ticarcillin  in newborn infants, CL 
and half -life increased and decreased, respectively, with increasing GA at birth, birth weight, 
and chronological age.
23 For infants > 2500 g at birth, CL increased from 6.0 mL/min to 18.9 
mL/min from birth to the third week of life. Similarly, for infants 1500– 2000 g, CL increased 
from 3.1 mL/min to 4.6 mL/min from birth to the third week of life. For term infants, half -life 
decreased fr om 2.[ADDRESS_331780] week of life. For infants ≤[ADDRESS_331781] week of 
life. The 54 participants were given 50 mg/kg of ticarcillin intramuscular (IM) . Only 14 PK 
samples were obtained from infants <1500 g birth weight, and only 9 infants were <33 weeks 
GA at birth. A second study evaluated the PK of multiple -dose IM ticarcillin in infants.24 Infants 
were enrolled into 3 groups: 1) 6 infa nts <2000 g and 0– 7 days of age (75 mg/kg every 8 
hours); 2) 22 infants >2000 g and 0 –7 days of age (75 mg/kg every 6 hours); and 3) 8 infants 
>2000 g and 1 –8 weeks of age (75 –100 mg/kg every 6 hours). Plasma CL increased with 
increasing PNA and GA. The PK  of ticarcillin -clavulanate was studied in 9 preterm (range 30–
36 weeks GA) and [ADDRESS_331782] infant had a birth weight of 1400 g. 
Infants were dosed as follows: preterm infants were given 83.3 mg/kg ticarcillin/3.3 mg/kg 
clavulanate every 8 hours, and term infants w ere given 100 mg/kg ticarcillin/4 mg/kg 
clavulanate every [ADDRESS_331783] infants in the study. Another study in 11 low -birth-weight 
(<2200 g) infants evaluated the P K of 75 mg/kg of IV ticarcillin -clavulanate.
26 The median birth 
weight was 1250 g (range 683, 2110). Based on findings of sub -therapeutic exposures to both Table 1. Previous PK  Studies of IV Rifampin in Children

Clindamycin:  Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S) -chloro -substitution 
of the 7(R) -hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin that acts by [CONTACT_271665]. It was originally isolated from t he soil fungus 
Streptomyces lincolnensis  and first synthesized in 1967. It is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_271646], although cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) penetration is poor. Clindamycin has activity against MRSA and Staphyloc occus epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353]  (coagulase -negative 
Staphylococcus ), as well as a wide range gram -positive and gram -negative anaerobic 
organisms. Clindamycin is potentially an excellent agent to use in infants because of its safety 
profile and broad spectrum observed in older populations.
22  
 FDA label: Clindamycin is approved for the treatment of adult patients with serious infections 
caused by [CONTACT_271666], infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci , 
pneumococci,  and staphylococci , including serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], serious skin and 
soft tissue infections, and female pelvis and genital tract infections.  This product contains 
benzyl alcohol as a preservative.  Benzyl alcohol has been associated with a fatal “Gaspi[INVESTIGATOR_271647]” in premature infants.  The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population 
from chemicals that may leach from the single  dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not 
been evaluated.  
 
Published data on the safety and PK of clindamycin in preterm and term infants are extremely 
limited (Table 3). In a study evaluating the PK of 20 mg/kg/day of clindamycin divided q 6– 8 
hours in term and preterm infants, CL was directly related to PNA.
27 The half -life of clindamycin 
was 8.7 hours for infants <28 days of age and 3.6 hours for infants >4 weeks of life. Serum half -
life in adults and older children are 3.0 and 2.5 hours, respectively.28 CL was not presented by 
[CONTACT_271667] t o be 1.92 L/hr for infants >3.5 kg and 0.31 L/hr for infants <3.5 kg. 
However, no infant in this study was <28 weeks gestation at birth, and only 1 infant was <1000 
g birth weight. Only 2 term infants <14 days of age were enrolled in the study. Drug

13 accumulation was observed in the 1 infant <1000 g who was administered 15 mg/kg/day every 
8 hours. No safety data were collected in this study. In a second study of 12 infants, no 
correlation between clindamycin CL and renal function, PNA, GA, or postmenstrual a ge was 
observed.29 However, the assay used in this study could not distinguish between clindamycin or 
its metabolites. CL ranged from 37.8 to 135 mL/kg/hr. Again, no safety data were presented.

2.2 Scientific Rationale  
 
Dosing for hepatically cleared therapeutics in preterm and term infants are likely to vary greatly 
from older children and adults due to immaturity of metabolic and renal pathways.  
2.2.1  Potential Risks  
It is the i nvestigator’s responsibility to ensure that, prior to initiating this study, this protocol is 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_145337].  The composition and conduct of this 
committee must conform to the U.S. CFR , including provisions outlined in 45 CFR 46 subpart D.  
 
Clindamycin and rifampin are protein- bound drugs. There are theoretical risks of increased 
bilirubin in infants with elevated bilirubin.  
 
Risks of Blood Drawing 
There are small risks to blood sampling, usually some pain/discomfort with the blood stick. We 
will make every effort to avoid additional (to standard of care) sticks for this study and will time 
clinical blood draws to coincide with timed samples, using existing intravenous lines when 
possible.  
 Risks of Rifampin  
From the FDA label and review of the literature, s ide effects in patients administered rifampin 
include impacts to: gastrointestinal system (heartburn, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, 
flatulence, cramps, and diarrhea); blood (l ow platelets occurred primarily with high -dose 
intermittent therapy; this effect is reversible if the drug is discontinued as soon as bruising 
occurs); central nervous system (headache, fever, drowsiness, fatigue, trouble walking, 
dizziness, inability to c oncentrate, mental confusion, behavioral changes, pains in arms or feet, 
and generalized numbness); renal system (elevations in kidney laboratory values [blood urea nitrogen {BUN} and serum uric acid] have been reported and are reversible when rifampin is 
discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted); and skin (skin reactions are mild and self -
limiting and do not appear to be allergic reactions).

CYP450 substrates,  and such concomitantly administered drugs should be monitored for 
potential lack of efficacy during concurrent treatment with rifampin and for 1 month after discontinuation of rifampin therapy.  
 Rifampin should not be used as monotherapy.  Empi[INVESTIGATOR_271648] -staphylococcal therapy of an 
appropriate anti -staphylococcal antibiotic should be used in combination with rifampin.  
 
Risks of Ticarcillin- clavulanate  
From the FDA label and review of the literature, side effects of ticarcillin- clavulanate, as with 
other penicillins, include the following adverse reactions: hypersensitivity (skin rash, pruritus, 
urticaria, arthralgia, myalgia, drug fever, chills, chest discomfort, erythema multiforme, toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], Stevens -Johnson syndrome, and anaphylactic reactions); central nervous 
system (headache, giddiness, neuromuscular hyperirritability, or convulsive seizures); 
gastrointestinal disturbances (disturbances of taste and smell, stomatitis, flatulence, nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhea, epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], and pseudomembranous colitis have been reported; 
onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment); 
hemic and lymphatic systems (thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, 
reduction of hemoglobin or hematocrit , and prolongation of prothrombin time and bleeding time); 
abnormalities of hepatic function tests (elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase [SGOT], serum alanine aminotransferase [SGPT], serum alkaline phosphatase, serum lactate 
dehydrogenase [LDH], serum bilirubin; there have been reports of transient hepatitis and 
cholestatic jaundice, as with some other penicillins and some cephalosporins); renal and urinary 
effects (hemorrhagic cystitis, elevation of serum creatinine and/or BUN, hypernatremia, 
reduction in serum potassium and uric acid); and local reactions (pain, burning, swelling, and 
induration at the infusion site and thrombophlebitis with intravenous administration).  
 Available safety data for pediatric patients treated with ticarcillin- clavul anate demonstrate a 
similar adverse event profile to that observed in adult patients.  
 
Ticarcillin -clavulanate should not be used as monotherapy when methicillin- resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus  is suspected.  
 
Risks of Clindamycin 
From the FDA label and review of the literature, the following are adverse reactions of 
clindamycin: antibiotic -associated colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, abdominal pain, nausea, 
and vomiting; hypersensitivity reactions (maculopapular rash and urticaria have been observed 
during drug therapy; generalized mild- to-moderate morbilliform -like skin rashes are the most 
frequently reported of all adverse reactions; rare instances of erythema multiforme, some resembling Stevens -Johnson syndrome, have been associated with clindamycin; a few cases of 
anaphylactoid reactions have been reported); skin and mucous membranes (pruritus, vaginitis, 
and rare instances of exfoliative dermatitis have been reported); liver (jaundice and 
abnormalities in liver function tests have been observed durin g clindamycin therapy); renal 
system (although no direct relationship of clindamycin to renal damage has been established, renal dysfunction as evidenced by [CONTACT_156086], oliguria, and/or proteinuria has been observed in 
rare instances); hematopoietic (transient neutropenia [leukopenia] and eosinophilia have been 
reported; reports of agranulocytosis and thrombocytopenia have been made; no direct etiologic 
relationship to concurrent clindamycin therapy could be made in any of these instances); local 
reactions (pain, induration, and sterile abscess have been reported after intramuscular injection

Priority PK samples: At least [ADDRESS_331793].  
Priority samples include # 2, 5, and 7 for each drug (see  Table 5). For example, if an infant is 
receiving a drug every [ADDRESS_331794] dose the study coordinator collects sample #1, 2, 
and 6 and after the fourth dose the study coordinator collects sample #3, 4, 5, and 7.  
 
Flush times:  Flush times will be recorded and will occur ≤15 minutes from the end of study 
drug infusion.  
 
Minimizing blood loss: Plasma samples will be collected in 200 µL blood aliquots. To minimize 
the amount of blood sampling, a limited PK sampling scheme will be employed such that  no 
more than 8 timed PK samples (1.6 mL of blood) are obtained from each participant for PK 
analysis.  
 
Dried Blood Spots (DBS) PK Sampling:   Collect [ADDRESS_331795] only timed 
plasma PK samples.  DBS should be collected from the collected whole blood before spi[INVESTIGATOR_271649].   
 
Scavenge PK Sampling:   A maximum o f 10 scavenged plasma samples will be collected per 
participant.  
 
CSF PK Measurements:   Collect 100- [ADDRESS_331796] dose.   Alternatively, scavenged CSF samples (samples left over in the 
clinical microbiology lab) may be used.  
 
Urine Samples:   During one dosing interval when the timed multiple dose blood samples are 
obtained (after 3rd, 4th, or 5th), collect urine from the beginning of infusion to the next  scheduled 
infusion.  
6.5 Final Study Visit  
 
Follow -up Assessment (Day 11)  
For [ADDRESS_331797] dose of study drug 
should be recorded. Thes e include: hematocrit, white blood cell count, platelet count,

will be clearly detailed in the Manual of Procedures (MOP).  
Anti-Staphylococcal Trial   Version 4.0  
IND #[ADDRESS_331800] DESCRIPTION  
7.1 Dosage and Study Drug Information  
7.1.1  Rationale for Dose Selection  
Rifampin : Infants receiving rifampin 5– 10 mg/kg/day demonstrate wide inter -patient variability 
in rifampin concentrations, with some patients demonstrating low peak and trough plasma 
concentrations.[ADDRESS_331801] dose of study drug  dosing is defined as the fourth dose 
for rifampin, and the sixth dose of clindamycin or ticarcillin- clavulanate after enrollment, even if 
the clinicians continue the study drug.  
 
Table 5. Rifampin Dosing  
 
Cohort  GA  PNA  Dose  
1 <32 weeks  <14 days  10 mg/kg Q 24 hours x  
4 doses  
2 <32 weeks  ≥14 days –120 days  15 mg/kg Q 24 hours x  
4 doses  
3 ≥32 weeks  <14 days  15 mg/kg Q 24 hours x  
4 doses  
4 ≥32 weeks  ≥14 days –120 days  20 mg/kg Q 24 hours x  
4 doses  
 
Ticarcillin -clavulanate  (based on ticarcillin component): Older infants receiving ticarcillin -
clavulanate 50– 100 mg (based on ticarcillin component) every 8 hours demonstrated wide 
variability in ticarcillin concentrations, with some patients demonstrating low peak and trough 
plasma concentrations. Premature infants will likely need a l onger interval because of a lower 
CL.

24 All dosing regimens are similar to alternative published regimens.  
 
Clindamycin:  In adults, clindamycin is extensively metabolized by [CONTACT_83525] P450 
system and subsequently eliminated by [CONTACT_10521] s.[ADDRESS_331802] 3 days of life had reduced clindamycin 
elimination with a w eight -adjusted CL that was approximately one quarter of adult CL and an 
elimination half -life 3 times that of the adult value.31 Infants born at 28– [ADDRESS_331803] of that seen in term infants, with an associated half -life 3 times 
longer than term infants .31 This large difference between term and preterm i nfants suggests 
rapid maturation of clindamycin elimination pathways. Thus, we propose to decrease the dosing interval.

Guidelines for Assessing Severity of an Adverse Event  
The investigator should use the following definitions when assessing intensity of an advers e 
event:  
Anti-Staphylococcal Trial   Version 4.0  
IND #115396  03 February 2014  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
27 1. MILD: Participant is aware of symptoms or has minor findings, but tolerates them well 
and no or minimal intervention required  
2. MODERATE: Participant experiences enough symptoms or findings to require intervention  
3. SEVERE: Participant experiences symptoms or findings that require significant intervention 
8.1.[ADDRESS_331809] pre- existing medical conditions and will be currently 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], those pre- existing conditions will not be considered as adverse events. New 
events that occur or worsening through frequency or intensi ty of pre -existing conditions will be 
reported as adverse events. All reportable events as defined above, determined to be an AE based on physical examination, laboratory findings , or other means, will be recorded in the 
source documents and entered in the  electronic CRF (eCRF) . Each event will be recorded on 
an AE case report form starting after consent has been obtained. The investigator will provide 
date of onset and resolution, severity, action(s) taken, changes in study drug dosing, causality 
to study drug, and outcome.  
  
Follow -up of AEs  
Reportable events that are identified at the last assessment (or the early termination visit) must 
be recorded on the AE CRF with the status of the AE noted and followed until resolution. All 
serious suspected adverse reactions will be followed until resolution. All other events that 
cannot be resolved by [ADDRESS_331810] will be considered resolved by 
[CONTACT_271674] ( EDC) system  as such. Any event 
beginning more than [ADDRESS_331811] dose of study drug will not be captured.  
8.1.4  Interim Safety Analysis  
Rifampin : The study team will evaluate safety after [ADDRESS_331812] participant in each cohort are entered  and there are no pending queries . Enrollment 
in the cohort will be halted if there are any safety concerns .  
 
Clindamycin:  The study team wil l evaluate safety after 3 participants ≤[ADDRESS_331813] 
participant ≤26 weeks gestation in cohort 1 are entered  and there are no pending queries . 
Enrollment for infants ≤26 weeks gestation in cohort 1 will be halted if there are any  safety 
concerns . During the safety review , enrollment in this cohort will continue except for infants ≤26 
weeks gestational age at birth.

28 8.2 Guidelines for Determining Causality  
 
The investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse event to 
study drug where an affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction: Is there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event? ‘‘Reasonable possibility’’ 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
8.3 Reporting Procedures  
 Relevant clinical and safety laboratory data will be entered into the data coordinating center 
(DCC) AdvantageEDC
SM at the study site within 7 business days of data acquisition. The DCC 
data management personnel will monitor the occurrence of the events listed below and notify 
the DMC, safety monitors, investigators, NIH/NICHD, and PTN staff if any of the halting criteria 
are met. A decision to proceed or to terminate the trial will be made by [CONTACT_271675]/NICHD. The DMC may request review of the data if deemed necessary.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_331814] 
also subm it safety reports locally as required by [CONTACT_11577].  
8.3.2  Regulatory Reporting  
Any event that requires expedited reporting based on federal regulations will be forwarded to 
the IND sponsor. The IND sponsor or its representative will submit expedited safety reports 
(IND safety reports) to the FDA and other regulatory agencies as necessary, and will inform the 
investigators of such regulatory reports. Site investigators must submit IND safety reports as 
required by [CONTACT_11577]. Documentation of the submission and receipt by [CONTACT_271676]. All serious events designated as “not related” to study product(s) will 
be reported to the FDA at least annually in a summary format.  
8.4 Halting or Discontinuation 
 A participant’s parent/guardian may voluntarily discontinue participation in this study at any time.  
The participant’s parent/guardian is not obligated to state the reason for withdrawal.  The 
reasons for withdrawal, or failure to provide a reason, must be documented by [CONTACT_271677]/ withdrawal section of the CRF.  
 
Participant safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis to monitor for halting criteria.  
The study enrollment and dosing will be halted for 1  or more of the drugs in this study for a 
safety review if serious suspected adverse reactions or serious adverse reactions occur in 2 or 
more participants  within each drug group . Enrollment to any remaining drug(s) will continue.

31 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
10.1 Study Outcome Measures  
PK of these 3 antimicrobials.  
10.2 Sample Size Consider ations  
 
The sample size is based on the ability to observe a serious toxicity rate and to describe the PK. 
A sample size of 32 participants will provide adequate precision in the PK parameter estimates 
(i.e., CL) that will be dependent on the underlying variability of the parameter (see table below). 
For example, assuming an inter -individual coefficient of variance (CV%) of 40% in the 
population CL parameter estimate after weight -based allometric and maturation scaling, a 
sample size of 32 participants would provide a margin of error of ±14% in the 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of the CL estimate.  
 
The sample size is sufficient to describe the PK of these 3 antimicrobials.  
 
PK Parameter CV%  95% CI Margin of Error  
40% ± 14%  
50% ± 17%  
60% ± 21%  
80% ± 28%  
 
Replacement Participants  
If participants have <3 evaluable PK samples  (not scavenged or dried blood spots), additional 
participants may be enrolled to ensure appropriate analysis. Evaluable samples are defined as 
samples with adequate volume and integrity to generate accurate concentration results as well 
as their associated dosing and sample times data.  
 Population for Analysis 
All participants who receive at least [ADDRESS_331817] of Care (POPS) trial will be combined and co-
modeled with data from the Staph Trio trial. Inclusion of POPS data will increase the sample 
size across all cohorts, allow for model evaluation/validation using data from an independent 
trial and likely result in more precise estimation of model parameters.  
10.3 Analysis Plan  
 
Descriptive statistics such as number of observations, mean, median, 95% confidence interval, 
standard deviation, standard error, minimum, and maximum will be presented by [CONTACT_271681]-Staphylococcal Trial   Version 4.0  
IND #115396  03 February 2014  
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
32 age and postnatal age group for continuous  variables (such as age, weight, etc.). Other 
descriptive statistics such as counts, proportions, and/or percentages will be presented by 
[CONTACT_271682] (such as race, sex, 
etc.). 
 
Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The number of participants completed and discontinued early from study and the reasons for 
discontinuation will be summarized. Demographic and baseline characteristics will also be 
summarized. Variables include race, age, sex, and selected clinical variables recorded prior to 
initiation of study drug. Study drug administration will be summarized in terms of number of days 
of dosing and reasons for final discontinuation of study drug.  
 
Safety and Clinical Laboratory Analyses  
The number  of AEs, suspected adverse reactions, and adverse reactions will be summarized 
overall, by [CONTACT_926], and by [CONTACT_271683] (MedDRA) system 
organ class and preferred term. Prior and concomitant medications will be summariz ed by 
[CONTACT_78464] (WHO) drug class. Laboratory data, such as hematology and serum chemistry data, will be tabulated by [CONTACT_271684]. Summary statistics for changes from 
baseline will be presented. Continuous laboratory measurements will be described at each visit 
using univariable descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.); observed values and changes from 
baseline will be summarized. Lab tests reflective of liver toxicity (e.g., ALT, AST) will be further 
summarized in terms of the most extreme values and largest changes from baseline (in the 
appropriate direction) observed from start of study drug through the end of therapy.   
 
PK Analysis Plan 
PK parameters will be estimated by [CONTACT_105]- compartmental analysis using WinNonlin software. The 
plasma concentrations -time profiles of each study drug will be presented in figure form by 
[CONTACT_271685]. The appropriate non -compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters will be 
computed, including AUC
0–24, AUC ss, C max, CL, V ss, and t 1/[ADDRESS_331818] to allow for noncompartmental  analysis, a population PK 
analysis approach will be used.  
Interim PK analysis  
Rifampin : An interim PK analysis will be performed after enrollment of 3 participants in each 
cohort for rifampin. If the interim analysis suggests the PK data are sufficient to describe 
rifampin disposition in this patient population, enrollment will stop after 8 participants are 
enrolled in each cohort. If additional participants are required, the interim PK data will be used to 
determine the number of additional participants.  
 
Clindamycin: An interim PK analysis will be performed after enrollment of 3 participants in 
cohort 1 for participants ≤26 weeks gestational age. If the interim analysis suggests the PK data 
are sufficient to describe clindamycin disposition in this patient population, enrollment will stop 
after 8 participants are enrolled in each cohort. If additional participants are required, the interim 
PK data will be used to determine the number of additional participants.  
 
For both analyses, if the PK analysis suggests that drug exposure is below the maximum 
tolerated exposure in adults, no dosing modifications will be made.

Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of 
risks and possible benefits of participation in this study will be provided to the participants’ families. Consent forms describing in detail the study procedures and risks are given to the 
participant’s legal guardian, and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to 
enrolling in the study. Consent forms will be IRB -approved, and the participant’s legal guardian 
will be asked to read and review the document. Once the legal guardian has reviewed the 
document, the investigator will explain the research study to the participant’s legal guardian and 
answer any questions that may arise. The participant’s legal guardian will sign and date the informe d consent document prior to the participant being enrolled in the study. The participant’s 
legal guardian may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the study. A copy of 
the informed consent document will be given to the participants’ legal guardians for their 
records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_271687].  
 
The IND s ponsor or designee will provide the investigator, in writing, any new information that 
bears significantly on the participants' risk to receive the investigational product. This new 
information will be communicated by [CONTACT_271688]’ legal guardians who 
consent to participate in the trial in accordance with IRB requirements. The informed consent 
document will be updated, and participants’ legal guardians will be re- consented, if necessary.  
 
Site staff may employ IRB -approved recruitment ef forts prior to the participant consenting; 
however, before any protocol -specific procedures are performed to determine protocol eligibility, 
an informed consent form must be signed.  
 
By [CONTACT_1725], the participant’s legal guardian a grees that the participant 
will complete all evaluations required by [CONTACT_20767], unless the participant is withdrawn voluntarily 
or is terminated from the trial for any reason.

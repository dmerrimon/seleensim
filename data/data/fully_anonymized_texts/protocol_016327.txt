PRIMARY  ENDPOINT  The primary outcome will be fluvastatin AUC0- 12h and AUC0- ∞ 
(AUC = area under the plasma concentration versus time curve).  
SECONDARY  
ENDPOINTS   Secondary outcomes will include fluvastatin  maximum plasma

SAFETY  
EVALUATIONS  Safety evaluation will be determined by  [CONTACT_357095]. Subjects will be monitored on an ongoing basis while involved with the study by [CONTACT_3462]. Subjects will be screened with a 
medical history and physical examination by [CONTACT_357096], chemistries, liver, renal and coagulation 
laboratories. Subjects must have normal function of all major organs. 
At study completion, subjects will have repeat physical examination and repeat hematology, chemistries, liver, renal and coagulation laboratories for safety monitoring.  
 
PLANNED  INTERIM  
ANALYSES   Serious adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_357097].  
  
STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  AUC0 -∞ will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule from time [ADDRESS_445454] + Clast/ke. Parameters such as maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) will be determined from the 
observed data. The terminal elimination rate constant (ke) will  be 
obtained using linear regression of log transformed concentrations over the terminal log- linear decline phase. Oral clearance (CL/F) will 
be calculated using Dose/AUC0- ∞. Other estimated pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be calculated using non- compartme ntal methods with 
 
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 10 of 33 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  WinNonlin Professional software (Pharsight, Inc., Mountain View, 
CA). Log- transformed pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared 
across treatments with analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences will be regarded as statistic ally significant if p< 0.05. 
Data will be presented as mean values with standard deviations. Each subject will serve as his/her own control. Differences in 
pharmacokinetic parameters between treatments will be calculated 
using student’s paired t -test. Statistical calculations will be done using 
STATA 10.0 (StataCorporation, College Station, TX).  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  Using a paired t -test and prior data, a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_445455] a 50% difference in AUC0- 12 between the 
two study regimens with a statistical power of 80% (two sided alpha = 
0.05) and standard deviation of 50%. Due to the lesser effects of 
rifampin on fluvastatin AUC, the within subject variability can affect 
the sample size. We plan to enroll sample siz e of 12 subjects to 
maintain an adequate sample size in case of potential attrition.

the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) system which 
categorizes drugs based on extent of metabolism and solubility characteristics 6. 
According to this classification system, the plasma exposure of  Fluvastatin, a BDDCS 
class I drug should be minimally influenced by [CONTACT_357098]6.  
 
1.1 Overview of Non -Clinical Studies  
Available in vitro data demonstrates that inhibition of OATP1B1 by [CONTACT_357099] (HEK293) cells, which 
implies the drug’s significant dependence on the membrane transporter7. Animal studies 
have also confirmed that rifampin significantly alters hepatobiliary transport of  
rosuvastatin and increases its plasma exposure (AUC) and Cmax8. 
1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies  
Contrary to our expectations, one clinical study has demonstrated that co- administration of 
single -dose rifampin with 2 mg of fluvastatin results in significant i ncrease in exposure of 
the cholesterol -lowering agent9. However this study was conducted with one tenth to one

9.2.2  Blood Chemistry Profile  
Blood will be obtained and sent to each site’s clinical chemistry lab for Hgb, HCT, RBC, 
Plt, WBC with differential, Ca++, Na+, K+, Cl -, CO2, glucose, serum creatinine, BUN, 
phosphorus, AST,ALT, alkaline phosphatase, CPK, total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, 
cholesterol, and triglycerides.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_445470] will be obtained from female subjects who are of 
childbearing age prior to their participation in the study.  
9.2.4  Urinalysis  
Urine will be obtained and sent to each site’s clinical laboratory for determination of (list 
as applicable) color, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, and blood.  
9.3 Pharmacokinetic Measurements  
Blood for determination of serum concentrations of fluvastatin will be collected  0, 0.33, 
0.67, 1,1.5, 2, 2.5, 3,4, 6, 9, and 12h after fluvastatin dosing.Plasma will be separated and 
stored at –80°C until analysis of drug levels.   
Plasma concentrations of fluvastatin and rifampin in all collected plasma samples will be 
measured via a previously validated tandem liquid  chromatography mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) method. Determined plasma concentrations of fluvastatin will then be 
modeled using pharmacokinetic modeling software to calculate the corresponding AUC, oral clearance, and oral volume of distribution of fluvast atin in the treatment groups.

11 ADVERSE
 EXPERIENCE  REPORTING  AND  DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
 
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 23 of 33 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  relationship with the treatment.   An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or 
frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and st op dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study 
drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
AE Severity 
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE s everity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to gra de severity.  It should be pointed 
out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily 
serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no 
medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may be 
aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy require d. 
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.  
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment  
 
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 24 of 33 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_357081]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_256057].  
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and 
that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978].  
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected 
drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to ha ve no relationship to the 
study drug.  
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
● death 
● a life- threatening adverse experience  
● inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
● a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
● a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
● Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or requir e intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
 
11.2.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting 
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per 
UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
 
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), the site investigator will report 
SAEs to the IRB/IEC.

● Protocol violation requiring disc ontinuation of study treatment  
● Lost to follow -up 
● Sponsor request for early termination of study  
● Positive pregnancy test (females)  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be 
followed and treated by [CONTACT_357107].   
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early discontinuation 
visit as soon as possible and then should be encouraged to complete all remaining 
scheduled visi ts and procedures.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The rea son for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in 
the subject’s source documents Refer to Section [ADDRESS_445472]’s best interest to continue.

primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited to, 
the following:  
● Failure to meet inclusion/excl usion criteria  
● Use of a concomitant medication  
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a 
protocol violation. The  sponsor will determine if a protocol violation will result in 
withdrawal of a subject.  
When a protoc ol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be signed by a Sponsor representative and the Investigator. A copy of the form will be filed in the site ’s 
regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files.  
[ADDRESS_445474]  
15 STATISTICAL  METHODS  AND  CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Pla n (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan described below.   
15.[ADDRESS_445475] are age, race, height, weight and gender.   
15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
AUC0 -∞ will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule from time [ADDRESS_445476] + Clast/ke. 
Parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) 
will be determined from the observed data. The terminal elimination rate constant (ke) 
will be obtained using linear regression of log transformed concentrations over the terminal log- linear decline phase. Oral clearance (CL/F) will be calculated using 
Dose/AUC0 -∞. Other estimated pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using non-
 
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 27 of 33 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  compartmental methods with WinNonlin Professional software (Pharsight, Inc., Mountain 
View, CA). Log- transformed pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared across 
treatments with analysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences will be regarded as statistically significant if p< 0.05. Data will be presented as mean values with standard 
deviations. Each subject will serve as his/her own control. Differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between treatments will be calculated using student’s paired t -test. Statistical 
calculations will be done using STATA 10.0 (StataCorporation, College Station, TX).  
15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) will be determined from the observed data. T he terminal elimination rate constant (ke) 
will be obtained using linear regression of log transformed concentrations over the terminal log- linear decline phase. Oral clearance (CL/F) will be calculated using 
Dose/AUC0 -∞. 
 
15.[ADDRESS_445477] and prior data, a sample size o f n=[ADDRESS_445478] a 50% difference in AUC0- 12 between the two study regimens with a statistical 
power of 80% (two sided alpha = 0.05) and standard deviation of 50%. Due to the lesser 
effects of rifampin on fluvastatin AUC, the within subject variability can affect the sample 
size. We plan to enroll sample size of [ADDRESS_445479]’s visit into the protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) when the 
information corresponding to that visit is available.   
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for 
completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_737].  A copy of the CRF will remain at the 
Investigator’s site at the completion of the study.

STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  AUC0 -∞ will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule from time [ADDRESS_445496] + Clast/ke. Parameters such as maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) will be determined from the 
observed data. The terminal elimination rate constant (ke) will  be 
obtained using linear regression of log transformed concentrations over the terminal log- linear decline phase. Oral clearance (CL/F) will 
Protocol Number  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_357083] #:  Version Date:  Page 9 of 35 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  be calculated using Dose/AUC0- ∞. Other estimated pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be calculated using non- compartme ntal methods with 
WinNonlin Professional software (Pharsight, Inc., Mountain View, 
CA). Log- transformed pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared 
across treatments with analysis of variance for repeated measures. 
Differences will be regarded as statistic ally significant if p< 0.05. 
Data will be presented as mean values with standard deviations. Each subject will serve as his/her own control. Differences in pharmacokinetic parameters between treatments will be calculated using student’s paired t -test. Statistical calculations will be done using 
STATA 10.0 (StataCorporation, College Station, TX).  
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  Using a paired t -test and prior data, a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_445497] a 50% difference in AUC(0- 12) betwee n the 
two study regimens with a statistical power of 80% (two sided alpha = 
0.05) and standard deviation of 50%. Due to the lesser effects of 
rifampin on fluvastatin AUC, the within subject variability can affect 
the sample size. We plan to enroll sample s ize of [ADDRESS_445498] enter the liver to exert their efficacy. Compared to other statins 
like rosuvastatin and pravastatin, fluvastatin is extensively metabolized 4. It has a 
Protocol Number  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_357083] #:  Version Date:  Page 10 of 35 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  more hydrophobic profile making it highly permeable through the membranes and 
in theory less dependent on OATP1B1- mediated transport5.  
 
To predic t hepatic uptake transporter effects on drug disposition, Wu and Benet 
developed the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) 
system which categorizes drugs based on extent of metabolism and solubility 
characteristics 6. According to this classification system, the plasma exposure of  
Fluvastatin, a BDDCS class I drug should be minimally influenced by [CONTACT_357111]6.   
1.1 Overview of Non -Clinical Studies  
Available in vitro data demonstrates that inhibition of OATP1B1 by [CONTACT_357112] (HEK293) 
cells, which implies the drug’s significant dependence on the membrane transporter
7. Animal studies have also confirmed that rifampin significantly alters 
hepatobiliary transport of r osuvastatin and increases its plasma exposure (AUC) and 
Cmax8. 
 
Similar results to those observed in clinical studies have been observed in in vivo 
and in vitro rat studies where the effects of inhibition of hepatic uptake transporters 
offset the effect of  the hepatic enzyme induction for the BDDCS class IV drug 
digoxin9. In this study, hepatic enzyme induction by [CONTACT_357113], but when hepatic uptake transporters were inhibited 
by [CONTACT_132313], the AUC values matched t hose of the control. Unfortunately, a direct 
comparison to the human glyburide trial cannot be made because no analogous uninduced, rifampin treatment was conducted in this rat study. Interestingly, similar 
AUC ratios for the induced treatment (1.99(in vit ro), 2.15 (in vivo)) were observed, 
which may indicate a similar effect of hepatic uptake transporters in rats and 
humans

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_445500] demonstrated that the effects of hepatic OATP1B1 
transporters on the BDDCS Class II drug glyburide are the same under induced and 
non-induced conditions13.  Concomitant rifampin treatment under the the induced 
condition yielded a glyburide AUC IVrif:AUC noIVrif  ratio of 2.06, which is 
comparable to the AUC ratio of 2.18 under the non -induced condition, despi[INVESTIGATOR_357086]13. For fluvastatin (a t 
clinical doses), it is expected that this AUC IVrif:AUC noIVrif  will be closer to 1, and it 
is desired to compare these ratios between induced and uninduced states as has 
previously been done for glyburide.

 ADVERSE  EXPERIENCE  REPORTING  AND  DOCUMENTATION  
Protocol Number  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_357083] #:  Version Date:  Page 23 of 35 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
investigation of a patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.  An 
unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of 
AEs during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source 
documents.  Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, 
treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrel ated, the cause.  
AE Severity 
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modi fied criteria 
can be found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It 
should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity a nd that a 
severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
 
 
 
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no 
medical intervention or therapy required. The subject may be 
aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357091].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
Protocol Number  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_357083] #:  Version Date:  Page 24 of 35 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following 
the guidelines in Table 2.  
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a re asonable 
temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_357081]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_357120]. 
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and 
that is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_82978].  
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the drug; that follows a known or expected response patte rn to that suspected 
drug; but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study drug.  
 
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
● death 
● a life- threatening adverse experience  
● inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
● a persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
● a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
● Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, 
based on appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
 
Serious Adverse Experi ence Reporting 
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per UCSF CHR Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after 
Protocol Number  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_357083] #:  Version Date:  Page 25 of 35

12.[ADDRESS_445513]’s best interest to 
continue.  The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment 
discontinuation:  
● Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent)  
● Subject is not compliant with study pr ocedures  
● Adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_357082]  
● Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
● Lost to follow -up 
● Sponsor request for early terminati on of study  
● Positive pregnancy test (females)  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be 
followed and treated by [CONTACT_41848].   
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early 
discontinuation visit as soon as possible and then should be encouraged to complete 
all remaining scheduled visits and procedures.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time,  for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for 
subject withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be 
specified in the subject’s s ource documents Refer to Section [ADDRESS_445514]’s best interest to 
continue.    
Protocol Number  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_357083] #:  Version Date:  Page 26 of 35 
Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_445515]’s withdrawal from the study will be 
specified in the subject’s source documents.   Subjects who withdraw after study 
period 1 but prior to  study period 2 should be encouraged to come in for a final visit 
(and the procedures to be followed would include those for their next scheduled 
visit).    
12.[ADDRESS_445516] safety and primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study 
include, but are not limi ted to, the following:  
Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
Use of a concomitant medication  
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol violation. The sponsor will determine if a protocol violation will result in 
withdrawal of a subject.  
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a 
Protocol Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be 
signed by a Sponsor representative and the Inves tigator. A copy of the form will be 
filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files.

 DATA  SAFETY  MONITORING  
The study does not required a Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
15. STATISTICAL  METHODS  AND  CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis  of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) will be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any modifications to the analysis plan described below.   
15.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
All eligible patients who are randomized into the study will be included in the data 
analysis.  
Protocol Number  or PI [INVESTIGATOR_357083] #:  Version Date:  Page 27 of 35 
Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_445517] are age, race, height, weight 
and gender.   
15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
AUC0 -∞ will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule from time [ADDRESS_445518] + 
Clast/ke. Log- transformed pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared across 
treatments with anal ysis of variance for repeated measures. Differences will be 
regarded as statistically significant if p< 0.05. Data will be presented as mean 
values with standard deviations. Each subject will serve as his/her own control. 
Differences in pharmacokinetic par ameters between treatments will be calculated 
using student’s paired t -test. Statistical calculations will be done using STATA 10.0 
(StataCorporation, College Station, TX).  
15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax 
(Tmax) will be determined from the observed data. The terminal elimination rate constant (ke) will be obtained using linear regression of log transformed 
concentrations over the terminal log- linear decline phase. Oral clearance (CL/F) 
will be calculated using Dose/AUC0- ∞. Other estimated pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be calculated using non- compartmental methods with WinNonlin 
Professional software (Pharsight, Inc., Mountain View, CA).  
 
15.[ADDRESS_445519] and prior data, a sample size of n=[ADDRESS_445520] a 50% difference in AUC0- 12 between the two study regimens with a 
statistical power of 80% (two sided alpha = 0.05) and standard deviation of 50%. 
Due to the less er effects of rifampin on fluvastatin AUC, the within subject 
variability can affect the sample size. We plan to enroll sample size of 12 subjects 
to maintain an adequate sample size in case of potential attrition.  
Once included in the study, patients wil l be randomized using computer -generated 
random numbers, corresponding to each treatment. This will be performed by

CONFIDENTIALMain Criteria for Inclusion:
1.Have histologica lly or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (locally advanced or recurrent and not a candidate for 
curative therapy) or stage IV NSCLC.
2.Must meet both of the following 2 criteria:
a)Have documentation of ALK rearrangement by a positive result from any laboratory  test approved by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA) (eg, the Vysis ALK Break Apart FISH [fluorescence in situ 
hybridization] Probe Kit or the Ventana ALK [D5F3] CDx [companion diagnostic] Assay or Foundation 
Medicine’s FoundationOne CDx)
or
Have documented ALK rearrangement by a different test (non –FDA -approved local lab tests) and have 
provided tumor sample to the central laboratory (Note: Central laboratory ALK rearrangement testing 
results are not required to be obtained before randomizati on.)
b)The patient had been treated with any 1 of the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (alectinib, ceritinib, 
crizotinib) for at least 12 weeks before progression. 
3.Had progressive disease while on alectinib or ceritinib (defined as no more than [ADDRESS_869025] dose of 
alectinib or ceritinib to disease progression, as assessed by [CONTACT_31598]). (Number of 
patients not previously treated with alectinib will be capped at 10 for every 30 patients enrolled.)
4.Had alectinib or cerit inib as the most recent ALK inhibitor therapy. Chemotherapy before or after progression 
on alectinib or ceritinib is allowed. 
5.Have at least [ADDRESS_869026] version 1.1 as assessed by [CONTACT_093]. 
6.Recovered from toxicities related to p rior anticancer therapy to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 Grade ≤1. (Note: Treatment -related alopecia or peripheral neuropathy 
that are Grade >1 are allowed if deemed irreversible.)
7.Have Eastern Cooper ative Oncology Group performance status ≤1.
8.Have adequate organ and hematologic function.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
1.Received any prior ALK -targeted TKI other than crizotinib, alectinib, or ceritinib.
2.Received both alectinib and ceritinib.
3.Received criz otinib, alectinib, or ceritinib within [ADDRESS_869027] dose of brigatinib. 
4.Previously received more than 3 regimens of systemic anticancer therapy for locally advanced or metastatic 
disease.
Note: A systemic anticancer therapy regimen will be counted if it is administered for at least 1 complete cycle. A 
new anticancer agent used as maintenance therapy will be counted as a new regimen. Neo -adjuvant or adjuvant 
systemic anticancer therapy will be counted as a prior regimen if disease progression/recurre nce occurred within 
12months upon completion of this (neo -)adjuvant therapy.
1.Have symptomatic brain metastasis (parenchymal or leptomeningeal). Patients with asymptomatic brain 
metastasis or who have stable symptoms that did not require an increased dose of corticosteroids to control 
symptoms in the past [ADDRESS_869028] dose of brigatinib may be enrolled.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The primary endpoint for this study is confirmed ORR, as assessed by [CONTACT_351846] , per 
RECIST version 1.1 in full analysis set.

CONFIDENTIALStatistical Considerations:
The purpose of this phase 2 study is to determine the confirmed ORR of orally administered brigatinib at current 
clinical doses ( ≤180 mg QD) in patients with ALK+ NSCLC whose disea se progressed after therapy on alectinib or 
ceritinib. The sample size was determined so that it would allow for stating that the true ORR (expected response 
rate) is greater than the threshold response rate of 20% for patients previously treated by [CONTACT_648633]. A 
sample size of [ADDRESS_869029] 90% power to rule 
out an uninteresting ORR of 20%, assuming the true ORR is 35%. The calculation is based on an exact binomial test 
with a one-sided alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_869030] patient is 
enrolled. ORR will be tested at a one -sided alpha of 0.025. If the primary endpoint is achieved in patients previously 
treated with alectinib or ceritinib, then a subgroup analysis of confirmed ORR in patients previously treated with 
alectinib will be performed and tested at a one -sided alpha of 0.025.

which was 12.9% of all new cancers worldwide [1]. Globally , lung cancer accounte d for 
1.6millio n cases and 1.4 millio n deaths in 2008 [
2].It is the l eading cause of cancer death in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US) and in the European Unio n (EU). In the US, an estimated 234,030 new cases 
of lung cancer will be diagnosed by  [CONTACT_87600] 2018, and 154,050 deaths due to the disease are 
estimated to occur [
3]. In the EU, lung cancer is ranked as the fourth most frequent cancer; 
approximately  313,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 and 268,000 deaths in that y ear [1]. 
Five
-year survival rates remain low: 17.7% and 13% in the US and Europe, respectively [4,5]. In 
Japan, l ung cancer i s ranked as the third most frequent cancer; approximately 113,000 new cases 
were di agnosed in 2012 and approximately 71,500 deaths in that y ear (Center for Cancer Control 
and Information Services, National Cancer Ce nter, 2017). Most lung cancer cases are diagnosed 
at advanced stages and about 78% of newly diagnosed patients have regio nal/distant disease [
1]
[
5].
Historically, l ung cancers have been stratified on the basis o f histol ogic criteria and are generally 
divided into 2 categories: small -cell lung cancer and non –small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
NSCLC is the most prevalent histologic class, accounting for nearly 85% of all lung cancers 
[
6,7], and includes a numbe r of subt ypes such as adenocarcino ma, squamous -cell carcino ma, 
large -cell carcinom a, and bronchio loalveo lar carcino ma [
8]. In recent y ears, attenti on has turned 
to stratifying lung cancer pat ients on the basis o f molecular alterations since it has beco me clear 
that histol ogically  identical tumors are driven by [CONTACT_648634], such as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648623] (EGFR) -mutant, anaplast ic lymphoma kinase -rearranged (ALK+), c -ros oncogene 
1 (ROS1) rearranged, or BRAF V600E mutant NSCLC. Th e focus herein is on NSCLC that 
contains oncogenic rearrangements in the ALK gene, and the role of brigatinib, a novel 
small -molecule inhibitor, in the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC. 
4.1.2 ALK+ NSCLC
ALK is a ty rosine kinase encoded on chromosome 2 and is primarily i nvolved in developmental 
processes and expressed at low levels in adults [
9]. The first genet ic rearrangement of ALK seen 
in NSCLC invo lved a fusio n between the EML4 gene and the ALK tyrosine kinase do main (KD). 
EML4 -ALK has the capa city to transform  fibroblasts grown in culture and as subcutaneous 
xenografts to induce tumor format ion [
10]. Since then, a number of addit ional ALK fusio n 
partners have been described in NSCLC that are believed to re sult in aberrant signaling and 
oncogenic transformat ion [11,12]. 
Estimates of the frequency o f ALK rearrangement in the overall populat ion of NSCLC patients 
range fro m 2% to 7% [
13,14] , whi ch represent, on the basis o f proporti onali ty of total  
popul ations in the US and EU, approximately 7000 to 25,000 ALK+ NSCLC pat ients in the US

wild-type EGFR and Kirsten rat sarcoma virus oncogene [9]. 
4.1.3 Current Treatment for ALK+ NSCLC
While the standard treatment algorithm for unselected NSCLC patients has historically invo lved 
front line treatment with chemotherapy, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that patients with 
ALK+ locally advanced or met astati c NSCLC respond well to treatment with the ALK inhibitors 
(crizotinib, alectinib, and cerit inib).
Crizotinib received accelerated approval fro m the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
2011 on the basis o f resul ts from 2single -arm studies [
15]. 
The efficacy of crizotinib has been confirmed in a ran domized study  of crizotinib versus 
chemotherapy [
15,16] .
ALK -dependent mechanisms o f resistance, observed in approximately 30% of pat ients [
17], 
include the acquisit ion of secondary mutations in ALK that interfere wit h crizotinib binding, 
and/or amplificat ion of the ALK fusio n gene. More than [ADDRESS_869037] commo n being L1196M and 
G1269A [
18,19] . The central nervous system (CNS) i s the first si te of progressi on in 
approximately  50% of  patients treated with crizotinib [20,21] , suggesting inadequate penetration 
of crizotinib into the brain (ie, pharmaco logic failure) as the pri mary  cause of  resistance in these 
patients. Therefore, an ALK inhibitor that can overcome secondary  resistance m utations in ALK, 
has adequate penetration into the CNS, and is less suscept ible to pharmaco logic failure, m ay be 
requi red to overcome resistance .
Recent ly, 2 other ALK inhibitors, cerit inib [22]and al ectinib [23], have beco me available for 
NSCLC pat ients with ALK rearrangements. Both drugs are effect ive in pat ients previously 
treated with crizotinib. Cerit inib demo nstrated significant ly improved progression -free survival 
(PFS) vers us chemotherapy  (hazard rati o 0.55) [24] whereas alect inib demo nstrated significant ly 
improved PFS versus crizotinib (hazard ratio 0.34 -0.47) [25,26] in treatment -naïve ALK+ 
advanced NSCLC. 
ALK secondary  mutationsassoci ated wi th clinical  resistance to ceri tinib and alect inib have also 
been ident ified, including L1152R and F1174C/V for ceritinib, I1171N/T/S for alect inib, and 
G1202R for both agents [
18,27-30] .
More recent ly, the invest igational agent lorlatinib has been evaluated in a phase 1/2 trial showing 
responses after ≥1 prior ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (25% [11 of 44] object ive response 
rate (ORR) in patients with 2 prior ALK TKIs and 31% [4 of 13] ORR in patients with 3 prior 
ALK TKIs). The most commo n treatment -related adverse events (TRAEs) were 
hypercho lesterol emia (90%) and hypertriglyceridem ia (72%) [
31].

CONFIDENTIAL4.1.4 Unmet Medical Need
Significant progress has been made with incorporation of ALK TKIs for treatment of ALK+ 
NSCLC, but eventually  almost all patients progress on these TKIs. The alternative treatments for 
these patients include chemotherapy and checkpo int inhibit ors (PD -1 or PD -L1 antibody). The 
efficacy  of platinum doublet chemotherapy  seems not to be impacted by  [CONTACT_648635], but 
the efficacy  was limi ted wi th a response rate of about 30% and median PFS of about 
4months[32]. Checkpo int inhibito rs have been introduced into the market recent ly as treatment 
for NSCLC. These agents are particularly  effect ive in pat ients whose tumors over -express PD -L1 
and have less benefit in pat ients with EGFR m utation or ALK rearrangements [
33], possibly 
related to l ow m utation burden in this populat ion characteri zed by  [CONTACT_648636] [
34]. 
There i s still high unmet medical need for these ALK+ NSCLC pat ients progressed on alect inib 
or ceri tinib to have access to an efficacious targeted therapy (evidenced by [CONTACT_648637]) and adequate CNS penetration with robust intracrania l responses. Such a new 
therapeuti c opti on coul d prol ong disease control and translate into improved lo ng-term outcom es 
including longer PFS. These efficacy attributes of a new therapy , along wi th a favorable safet y 
profile, are needed for this patient pop ulation.
4.2 Brigatinib
Brigatinib (AP26113) is a novel, orally administered (PO) TKI discovered and developed by 
[CONTACT_381495], Inc (ARIAD; Cambridge, [LOCATION_005]), a wholly owned subsidiary 
of [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceut ical Company Limit ed. Primary  targets are activated mutant forms o f ALK 
and ROS1, which play  important rol es in NSCLC and other cancers. 
A series o f in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that brigatinib potently inhibited ALK 
activit y and proliferat ion in ALK+ cell lines and exhibited a g reater than [ADDRESS_869038] ivity 
over ALK- negat ive lines. 
In clinical study , brigat inib has an acceptable safety  profile at the recommended dose of 90 mg 
once daily  (QD) f or 7 day s, then 180 m g QD, continuously (hereinafter presented as 90 mg 
QD→180 m g QD ). Bri gatinib at this dose level exhibited substant ial efficacy  in patients wi th 
ALK+ NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib. In 110 patients, the confirmed response rate 
was 56.4% (62 of 110, 97.5% CI: 45.2, 67.0) by  [CONTACT_648638] (IRC) 
assessment. The IRC -assessed median duration o f response (DOR) was 15.7 months (95% CI: 
12.8, 21.8 event rate: 54.8%) and median PFS was 16.7 months (95% CI: 11.6, 21.4, event rate: 
49.1%). Hi gh IRC -assessed intracranial object ive response rate (iORR) (66.7%, 12 of 18, 95% 
CI: 41.0, 86.7) with a median 16.6 months (95% CI: 3.7, Not Reached) duration of intracranial 
response was also observed in pat ients with measurable baseline brain metastases by [CONTACT_55543] 
(ALTA study , data cut- off: 29 September 2017, data on file) . On 28 April 2017, the FDA granted 
accelerated approval to brigat inib (ALUNBRIG) for the treatment of patients with metastatic 
ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant of crizotinib.

revealed that assessed at concentrations relative to the level o f exposure achieved in pat ients at 
the approved or recommended phase [ADDRESS_869040] potent inhibitor compared 
with crizotinib, cerit inib, and alectinib. Brigat inib inhibits 17 clinically and preclinically 
observed crizotinib -, ceri tinib-and/or al ectinib -resistant ALK m utations. Com pared wi th these [ADDRESS_869041] ivity in a mice 
orthotopic brain model metastasis. 
In the ALTA study , the 90 m g QD →180 m g QD treatm ent regimen was associated with a higher 
confirmed ORR and lo nger PFS, as well as improved i ntracranial efficacy, as co mpared with the 
90 m g QD regimen. Therefore, there appears to be a relationship between dose/exposure and 
efficacy , which suggests that hi gher brigat inib doses may result in better efficacy. However, 
higher brigat inib doses/expos ures were associated with so me treatment -related Grade 3 or higher 
adverse events (AEs) (eg, increased creatine phosphokinase [CPK], skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders and rash) 
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2017/208772Orig1s000TO C.cfm). A 
240mg QD dose of brigatinib was determined to be the highest acceptably tolerated dose in 
Study  AP26113 -11-101. As a result, in the present study , pati ents who progress on brigat inib 
180mg QD will have the option to receive brigat inib at an inc reased dose of [ADDRESS_869042] not experienced toxicit ies greater than Grade 2 
after the 180 m g brigat inib dos e.
The rati onale for escalat ion to 240 m g QD at disease progression is to provide an opportunit y at 
progression for treatment at higher exposures of brigat inib that may consequent ly provide 
clinical benefit through a greater degree of ant itumor activit y compared to 180 mg and/ or to 
attem pt to overcom e potenti al pharmacol ogic resistance at 180 mg QD brigat inib (ie, to increase 
brigatinib exposure in order to have better activit y against a given ALK KD resistance mutation 
or for increased exposure in the CNS ).
In study  AP26113 -
11-101, 10 pati ents were enrolled to receive brigatinib 240 mg QD, of which 
1 pati ent experi enced a dose -limit ing toxicit y (DLT) of Grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT)

emergent adverse events (TEAEs) leading to d ose interrupti on, reduction, 
or discontinuati on occurred at similar rates for patients dosed at 90 mg QD →180 m g QD (56.3%

[5 of 10], 20.0% [2 of 10], and 10.0% [1 of 10], respect ively). Co mmo n TEAEs were similar for 
patients dosed at 90 mg QD →180 m g QD and 240 mg QD brigat inib and included 
gastrointestinal [GI], constitutional, and pulmo nary events. Data from studies AP26113 -11-101 
and AP26113 -13-201 indicate the incidence of early onset pulmo nary events (EOPEs) is related 
to the init ial dose of brigat inib, but EOPEs have not been observed upon dose escalat ion 
(ie,90mg QD →180 m g QD regimen). Therefore, it is expected that patients who tolerate 
brigatinib at [ADDRESS_869043] an increased risk of 
EOPEs after escalat ion.
In separate but similar studies, ALK+ patients taking brigat inib after progressing on crizotinib, 
had a l onger median PFS as assessed by [CONTACT_55543] (15.6 months, 95% C I: 11.1, 21.0, ALTA study, 
data cut: 29 September 2017) than those taking alectinib (8.9 months, [36]and 7.1 months, [37], 
both by  [CONTACT_581981]) or cerit inib (5.[ADDRESS_869044] igator assessment, [38]). 
On the basis of nonclinical and clinical data, brigatinib may be efficacious in pat ients who 
developed resistant mutations to alectinib or cerit inib or those who do not respond to alectinib or 
ceritinib because of pharmacol ogic resistance. This phase 2 study  is designed to assess the 
clinical efficacy  and safet y of brigatinib in ALK+ advanced NSCLC pat ients who have 
progressed on alect inib or cerit inib.

8.4.2 Pulmonary Adverse Reaction s, Photosensitivity, and Other Adverse Events 
During early clinical development of brigat inib, moderate and severe pulmo nary AEs 
(eg,dyspnea, hypoxia, cough, pneumonia, and pneumonit is) were observed shortly after 
initiation of the drug in a subset of pat ients. These events were termed EOPEs . 
In the ALTA study  (Study  AP26113 -11-201) for bri gatinib, as of 21 February 2017, of 
219treated pati ents, there were 14 cases of EOPE (total 6.4%, 14 of 219). All cases occurred at a 
dose of 90 mg QD. No EOPEs were identified after escalat ion to 180 mg QD in the 90 m g 
QD
→180 m g QD dose group, or after re -initiation following study  treatm ent interruption. 
Median time of EOPE onset was Day  2 (range: 1 -9). Eleven o f these 14 cases were reported as 
serious adverse events (SAEs). Seven patients had events tha t were Grade ≥3, all of who m 
perm anent ly discont inued brigat inib because o f these events. One patient had a Grade 5 EOPE 
(pneumo nia). 
Pulmo nary events occurring within the first [ADDRESS_869072] ion (pneumo nia) 
shoul d be m onitored and reported. To reiterate, some events occur after a single dose of 
brigatinib, and physicians should be aware of this possibilit y and discuss it with patients. Newly

should be accom plished according to the recommendat ions in Table 8.b. 
Photosensit ivity to sunlight has occurred in pat ients treated with brigatinib. Pa tients shoul d be 
advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking brigat inib, and for at least [ADDRESS_869074] -spectrum UVA/U VBsunscreen and lip balm (SPF =30) to 
help protect against potential sunburn. For severe photosensit ivity react ions (≥ Grade 3), 
brigatinib should be withheld unt il recovery to baseline. The dose should be modified according 
to Table 8.b.

8.6 Excluded Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Systemic treatm ent wi th the f ollowing medicat ions should be avo ided during the study :
Strong CYP3A inhibitors: boceprevir, clarithro mycin, cobicistat, conivaptan, grapefruit -
containing products including grapefruit juice, idelalisib, indinavir, itraconazole, 
ketoconazo le, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprev ir, 
telithromycin, and voriconazo le. If conco mitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be 
avoided during the study , reduce the brigatinib once daily  dose by [CONTACT_3450]  50% 
(ie,from 180 m g to 90 m g, or from  90 m g to 60 m g). After di scont inuat ion of a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor, resume the brigat inib dose that was tolerated before init iating the strong 
CYP3A inhibitor.
Moderate CYP3A inhibitors: aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], cimet idine, ci profl oxacin, cl otrimazole, 
cyclosporine, dilt iazem, dronedarone, ery thromycin, flucon azole, fluvoxamine, imat inib, 
tofisopam , and verapamil. If concomitant use of a moderate CYP3A inhibitor cannot be 
avoided during the study , reduce the brigatinib QD dose by  [CONTACT_3450]  40% (i e, from 
180mg to 120 mg, 120 mg to 90 mg, or fro m 90 mg to 60 mg). After discont inuat ion of a 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor, resume the brigatinib dose that was tolerated before init iating the 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor.
Strong CYP3A inducers: carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enzalutamide, mitotane, phenobarbital, phenyto in, 
primidone, rifa mpin, rifapent ine, rifabutin, and St. John’s wort.
Moderate CYP3A inducers: bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, and nafcillin.
As the above lists are not exhaust ive, the invest igator should consult the prescribing informat ion 
for any  medicat ion und er considerat ion for use to assess if it is a strong CYP3A inhibitor, 
moderate CYP3A inhibitor, strong CYP3A inducer, or moderate CYP3A inducer. 
The fo llowing m edicat ions and procedures are also prohibited before radio logical disease 
progression is observ ed:
Any illicit substance. Medical use of cannabis is allowed if it is legal where the patient 
resides and no al ternative treatm ent is available, on the base of case -by-case review and 
agreem ent by  [CONTACT_71908]. 
Any other systemic ant icancer therap y including, but not limited to: chemotherapeutic 
agents, immunotherapy , biological response m odifiers (excluding growth factors), 
radiotherapy , and/or systemic hormonal therapy (with the exception of local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such

Use of any  other invest igational drug or device.
8.7 Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Palliat ive therapy and supportive care are permitted during the study  for m anagement of 
symptoms and underlying medical condit ions that may develop during the study . This may  
include blood and blood products and growth factors as clinically needed. 
8.8 Precautions and Restrictions
Brigatinib induces CYP3A in vi tro and m ay decrease concentrations of CYP3A substrates. 
Coadministration of brigat inib wit h CYP3A substrates, including hormonal contraceptives, can 
resul t in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy  of CYP3A substrates. Brigat inib may also 
induce other enzymes and transporters (eg, CYP2C, Pgp) via the same mechanism responsible 
for induct ion of CYP3A (eg, pregnane X receptor activat ion). Therefore, addit ional monitoring 
shoul d be considered for patients receiving substrates of these enz ymes and transporters with a 
narrow therapeutic index during treatment with brigatinib as their effect iveness may be reduced.
Brigatinib is an in vitro inhibitor of P -glycoprotein (Pgp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), organic cat ion transporter 1 (OCT1), multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) 
and 2K (MATE2K). Patients should be closely mo nitored when brigatinib is coadministered with 
substrates of these transporters w ith a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin, dabigatran, 
methotrexate) as their plasma concentrations may  be increased.

10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 PTE Definition
A pretreatment event (PTE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who has signed 
inform ed consent to participate in a study  but before administration of any  study  medicati on; it 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relat ionship wit h study  parti cipat ion.
10.1.[ADDRESS_869124]; 
the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this 
treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended si gn (incl uding an abnorm al 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous con dition that has increased in severit y or frequency  since 
the administration o f study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or del ay in treatm ent, dose m odificati on, therapeuti c intervent ion, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  shoul d be reported as AEs in 
the appropriate section of the eCRF. Disease progressio n assessed by m easurem ent of  malignant 
lesions on radi ographs or other methods should not be reported as an AE.

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.3 AE Severity
The severit y of AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE versio n 4.03 (see the study  
manual). If the AE is not defined in the CTCAE, the invest igator will determine the severit y of 
the AE on the basis o f the following definit ions:
Mild (Grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine 
activit y.
Moderate (Grade 2): The AE interferes wit h routine activit y but responds to symptomat ic 
therapy  or rest.
Severe (Grade 3): The AE significant ly limits the patient’s abilit y to perform routine 
activit ies despi[INVESTIGATOR_43538].
Life-Threatening (Grade 4): The patient is at immediate risk of death.
Death (Grade 5): The patient dies as a direct result of the complicat ion or condit ion induced 
by [CONTACT_84204]. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_869125] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening. (Refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it 
were m ore severe.)
Requi res inpat ienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]. (See 
clarificati onin the paragraph in Sect ion 10.2 on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24509].)
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disab ility is defined as a 
substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions.)
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . (Refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately  life-threatening, or r equire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when, 
on the basis of appropriate medical judgment, it may  jeopardize the patient, require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_869126] ious agent. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
[eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy], pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.)

Study No. [ADDRESS_869127] ive date 14 June 2010 [39].Clarification should be m ade 
between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because the 
terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to describe 
the intensit y (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, h owever, may  be of relatively  minor 
medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as serious , which is 
based on patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to functi on. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does 
not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 
1000/mm3to less than 2000 i s considered Grade 3 (severe) but may  not be consi dered seri ous. 
Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a gui de for defining regulatory  reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_53341]/or in response to an open question fro m study  
personnel or revealed by  [CONTACT_16037], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will 
be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section
 10.3 for the period of observat ion). 
Any clinically  relevant deteri oration in laboratory  assessments or other clinical finding is 
considered an AE. Wh en possible, signs and symptoms indicat ing a commo n underlying 
pathol ogy shoul d be noted as [ADDRESS_869128] be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion) 
by [CONTACT_648653] 24 
hours of beco ming aware of the event. This will be done by [CONTACT_648654] ( EDC) SAE report. If transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is not feasible, then a 
facsimile (fax) of the completed [COMPANY_005] paper- based SAE form will be sent. A sample of the 
paper -based SAE form and processing directions are in the study  manual. Inform ation in the 
SAE report or form must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF.
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, then 
the invest igator will transmit a fo llow-up EDC SAE report (or a paper -based S AE form if an 
EDC SAE report is not feasible) or provide other documentation immediately wit hin 24 hours of 
recei pt. Copi [INVESTIGATOR_648628] (eg, ECGs, l aboratory  tests, di scharge 
summary, postmortem results) should be sent to t he addressee, if requested.
Planned hospi [INVESTIGATOR_618475] (eg, surgery  was perform ed earlier or l ater than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the invest igator must determine both the severit y (toxi city 
grade) of the event and the relat ionship of the event to study drug administration. For serious 
PTEs, the invest igator must determine both the severit y (toxi city grade) of the event and the 
causalit y of the event in rel ation to study  procedures.
Severit y (toxi city grade) for each AE, including any  lab abnorm ality, will be determined using 
the NCI CTCAE, versi on4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [39]. The criteria are provided in the 
study  manual .

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
The best response (CR, PR, SD, or PD), according to RECIST version 1.1, will be derived for 
each eligible patient who receives at least [ADDRESS_869146] 2 -sided 95% CIs for the ORR will be calculated 
on the basis of the bino mial distribut ion. The primary  analysis will be performed on ORR 
assessed by  [CONTACT_26732]. Best target l esion response will be displayed using a “waterfall” plot. 
Supportive sensi tivity analyses will  be perform ed for ORR assessed by [CONTACT_648661]-protocol population. Supportive sensit ivity analyses will also be performed in pat ients 
confirmed to be ALK+ via central assessment and within subgroups defined by [CONTACT_654], sex, rac e, 
geographi c regi on, m utation status, pri or anti cancer therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014], and other prognostic factors.

response evaluat ion criteria in so lid tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (versio n 1.1). Eu J 
Cancer 2009;45:228 - 247.
Choosing Target Lesions
Select up to 5 lesions (up to 2 per organ).
Select largest reproducibly  measurable lesio ns.
If the largest lesio n cannot be measured reproducibly, select the next largest lesion which can 
be.
Add up l ongest di ameters (LD) of non -nodal  lesions (axial  plane).
Add short axis diameters of nodes.
This is the sum of the longest diameters (SLD).
Nontarget Lesions
All other sites of disease present at baseline and not classified as target lesio ns will be 
classified as nontarget lesions, including any measurable lesions that were not chosen as 
target lesio ns.
It is possible to record mult iple nontarget lesio ns involving the same organ as a single item 
on the eCRF (eg, “mult iple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes”).
Determining Response
Assess at baseline and on study  with consistent modalit ies (CT, MRI, PET/CT).
–Measure target lesio ns and calculate SLD.
–Visually assess nontarget lesio ns.
–Search for new lesio ns.
–Combine these assessments into the overall response.

CONFIDENTIALTarget Lesion Response
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all extranodal target lesions.
All pathological lymph nodes must have decreased to <10 mm in short 
axis.
Partial response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference 
the baseline sum diameters.
Progress ive disease (PD) SLD increased by [CONTACT_2669] 20% from the smallest value on study 
(including baseline, if that is the smallest).
SLD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (2 
lesions increasing from, for example, 2 mm to 3 mm, does not qualify ).
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD.
Nonevaluable (NE) One or more lesions cannot be evaluated because of missing data or poor 
image quality unless a convincing argument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the 
assigned time point response (eg, PD based on other findings).
SLD, sum of the longest diameters.
Nontarget Lesion Response
Complete response (CR) Disappearance of all extranodal nontarget lesions.
All ly mph nodes must be nonpathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Normalization of tumor marker level.
Non-CR/no n-PD Persistence of 1 or more nontarget lesions(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the nor mal limits.
Progressive disease (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions (subjective 
judgment by [CONTACT_433331]).
Unable to evaluate (UE) One or more lesions cannot be evaluated because of missing data or poor 
image quality unless a convincing argument can be made that the 
contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the 
assigned time point response (eg, PD based on other findings).
New Lesions 
Shoul d be unequivocal and not attributable to differences in scann ing technique or findings 
which may  not be a tum or (does not have to meet criteria to be “measurable”). 
If a new lesio n is equivocal, continue to next time point. If confirmed then, PD is assessed at 
the date when the lesio n was first seen. 
Lesio ns identified in anatomic locations not scanned at baseline are considered new. 
New l esions on ul trasound shoul d be confirmed on CT or MRI.

integrity in the context of healt hcare challenges presented by  [CONTACT_4165] 2019 
(COVID -19) public health emergency. This amendment allows invest igators  and study  personnel 
to conduct visit s rem otely , deliver study  drug di rectly  to pati ents, use l ocal laboratory  and 
imaging results if patients are unable to travel to the invest igative site, and remotely access 
patient records for data monitoring as n ecessary  during the COVID -19 public healt h emergency. 
Secondly, the dose modificat ion for Grade 3 and 4 creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevat ions

circumstances, such as during the 
COVID -19 public health emergency, 
additional drug supply may be provided 
to the subjects to cover periods between 
on-site visits. Additional study drug may 
be dispensed during a scheduled study 
visit, o r study drug may be shipped 
directly from investigational sites to 
participants’ residences by a contracted 
logistics provider or distributor (direct -
to-patient [DTP] shipment) in agreement 
with [COMPANY_005] processes and local health 
autho rities. 
Before initiation of the DTP process,

Study ComplianceAdded text: In extenuating 
circumstances, such as during the 
COVID -[ADDRESS_869201], suitably controlled 
remote access to patients’ electronic 
medical records may be used for data 
monitoring. Only pseudo nymized 
documents may be shared through a 
cloud -based system. Videoconferencing 
may be used for remote site data 
verification, but copying or recording of 
the video and/or documents (eg, screen 
captures) is not permitted. These 
procedures will be documented in the

elevation 
• Withhold brigatinib until recover y to 
Grade 1 or less (less than or equal to 2.5 
× ULN) or to baseline, then resume 
brigatinib at next -lower dose (Table 8.a).
• If Grade 4 elevation of CPK recurs, 
permanently discontinue brigatinib.The dose modifications for Grade 4 CPK 
elevation or recurrence of Grade 3 CPK 
elevation were changed to align with the 
Company Core Data Sheet. A n analy sis of 
data from Studies AP26113-13-301 and 
AP26113 -13-201 suggested that CPK 
increases were associated with longer 
duration of treatment and did not seem to be 
associated with the frequency of muscular 
toxicity. In a review of individual patient 
data from these studies, only 1 patient 
reported a Grade 3 CPK elevation as well as 
a Grade 3 muscular toxicity (PT: muscular 
toxicity). Additionally, many of the 49 
patients from these studies with a Grade ≥3 
CPK elevation did not report a muscular

8Protocol Summary
Study Compound(s):  Ubrogepant
Phase:  3
Study Objective:  To evaluate the efficacy, safety , and tolerability of 2 doses of ubrogepant (50mg and 
100mg) compared to placebo for the acute treatment of a single migraine attack
Clinical Hypotheses:
1.  At least 1ubrogepant dose is superior to placebo in the acute treatment o f migraine .
2.  Ubrogepant is safe and tolerable.
StudyDesign
Structure:  Multicenter, randomized, double- blind ,placebo -controlled , parallel -group, single attack study;
randomization to placebo, ubrogepant 50 m g, or ubrogepant 100 m g.
Duration :  The study includes a screening period of up to 14 days prior to randomization, a 60 -day period in 
which to treat a single migraine attack, and a 4 -week follow -up period.
Study Treatment Groups :  Ubrogepant 50 mg, ubrogepant 100 mg
Controls :  Ubrogepant p lacebo
Dosage/Dose Regimen :  Study participants will have up to [ADDRESS_1046243] (IP)or rescue medication if the patient has either a nonresponding migraine or a 
migraine recurrence.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Population Characteristics
Number of Patients :  Approximately 1650 patients will be randomized (550per treatment arm)
Condition/Disease :  Migraine with or without aura
Key Inclusion Criteria :  To be eligible for study participation, patients must be 18 to 75 years of age (inclusive) , 
have a history of migraine with or w ithout aura for at least 1 year consistent with a diagnosis according to the
International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria , 3rdedition, beta version ( ICHD -3 beta, 2013 ) and

toScreening (Visit 1) .
Key Exclusion Criteria :  
13AUG2018 CSR UBR-MD-01

Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-01 Amendment 3
9Response Measures
Efficacy :  Rating of headache severity, absence or presence of migraine -associated symptoms, use of rescue 
medication, use of optional second dose, and recurrence of headache pain
 
 
General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses:   The efficacy analyses will be based o n the Modified 
Intent -to-treat ( mITT )Population. The last observation carried forw ard (LOCF) approach will be used to impute 
missing posttreatment values. Baseline for efficacy is defined as the last nonmissing efficacy assessment before 
the initial dose of study treatment. For each primary variable, the observed response proportion s will be 
provided by [CONTACT_1570]. Theprimary efficacy variable of pain freedom at 2 hours after the initial dose will 
be analyzed using a logistic regression model with categorical terms for treatment group, historical triptan 
response (triptan responder, triptan insufficient responder, or triptan naïve), use of medication for migraine 
prevention (yes/no), and baseline headache severity (moderate or severe). The primary efficacy variable of 
absence of the most bothersome symptom at [ADDRESS_1046244] bothersome. The respective comparisons of the ubrogepant dose sversus placebo, which are t he formal 
tests of the efficacy hypotheses, w ill be conducted using the appropriate pairw ise contrasts within the logistic 
regression model. For secondary and other efficacy endpoints related to migraine headache pain severity and/or 
recurrence, migraine -associated symptoms, or use of rescue medication (including the second dose of IP), the 
observed response proportions w ill be analyzed using the same methods used to analyze the primary efficacy 
variables. For secondary efficacy endpoints on migraine -associ ated symptoms, baseline presence/absence of the 
symptom will be included as an additional covariate for the logistic regression model .The proportion of 
patients reporting satisfaction with study medication at 2 and 24 hours after the initial dose, the pro portion of 
patients able to function normally at 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours after the initial dose, and the proportion of patients 
assessed by [CONTACT_160477] “much better ” or “very much better” at 2 hours after the initial dose will be analyzed 
using the same methods used to analyze the primary efficacy variables. The baseline functional disability score 
will also be included as a covariate for the analysis of the proportion of patie nts able to function normally. For 
the change from baseline in EQ-5D-5Lindex value at 24hours 
after the initial dose, treatment comparisons of 
ubrogepant dose groups versus placebo will be performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
with cat egorical terms for treatment group, baseline severity, historical triptan response, and use of medication 
for migraine prevention, and with the baseline EQ-5D-5L index value as a covariate. Descriptive statistics will 
be provided for the change from baseli ne in the EQ VAS score at 24 hours after the initial dose by [CONTACT_6490].

151. Background and Clinical Rationale
What is Migraine and How Prevalent is It?
Migraine affects 18% of women and 6% of men in the [LOCATION_002] with a peak prevalence 
occurring between the ages of [ADDRESS_1046245] during a n attack ( Lipton et al, 2007). In the U nited States, work loss due to 
migraine is estimated to cost ~ $13 billion annually ( Hu et al, 1999
). Prevalence is similar in 
Europe, with migraine headache affecting 17.6% of women and 8% of men 
(Stovner andAndree, 2010
).It is currently  ranked by  [CONTACT_941] W orld Health Organization as 19th 
among causes of disability  (Katsarava et al, 2012). 
Migraine is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_160324], unilateral headache of moderate 
or severe pain intensity , associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light 
(photophobia) and sound (phonophobia). In about 25% of individuals, migrain e headache 
may be preceded b y focal neurological dy sfunction (aura). Improving the diagnosis and 
optimizing treatments for migraine have been recognized as critically  important to reduce the 
global burden of 
migraine ( Katsara va et al, 2012
).
Because there are no biological markers for migraine, diagnosis is based on clinical history , 
exam, and the exclusion of other headache disorders. Phy sicians appl y clinical criteria to 
guide diagnoses and subsequent treatment. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_763469] a s yndrome diagnosis 
applied to patients with migraine (with or without aura) who have 1 to 14 headache day s per 
month. Chronic migraine is a specific International Classification of Headache Disorders 
criteria, 3rdedition beta version (ICHD -3 be ta)diagnosis applied to a subset of patients with 
≥15 headache day s per month ( ICHD-3 beta , 2013; Katsarava et al, 2012 ; 
Olesen etal,2006). 
What is CGRP  and What is itsRelationship to Migraine ?
CGR P(calcitonin gene-related peptide) isaneuropeptide implicated in thepathoph ysiology 
ofmigraine. CGR Plevels inthe cranial venous outflow (ie, external jugular vein) are
increased durin g amigraine attack ( Goadsb yand Edvinsson , 1993
) and exogenous ly
administered CGR Phasbeen shown to trigger migraine- likeheadache in migraineurs. The 
majorit y
(80%to 90%) oftrigeminal Aδfibers thatinnervate thedura contain CGRP ,
suggesting that these fibers may be involved insterile neurogenic inflammation and
migraine pain transmission. Furthermore, the CGRP receptor is present on human meningeal
andcerebral blood vessels. These observations suggest that activation of the 
13AUG2018 CSR UBR-MD-01
15
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-01 Amendment 3
16trigeminovascular s ystem, with release of CGRP , may play  a key  role in migraine 
pathogenesis and that inhibition of CGRP function may yield anovel therapeutic approach to
treating migraine.
Establishment of CGRP  Antagonism to Treat Migraine
The abilit y of CGR Pantagonism torelieve pain inthe acute treatment of migraine was
established by[CONTACT_523329] (I V)formulation ofolcegepant (Olesen etal,2004), 
andreplicated by [CONTACT_44873] & Co.,Incwith anoral formulation oftelcagepant, ahighly
selective CGR Preceptor antagonist (CGRP RA). InPhase 3studie s,telcagepant was
superior to placebo inthe primary  endpoints of 2
-hour pain freedom, 2- hour pain relief, 
and the absence of associated symptom s(photophobia, phonophobia, andnausea), aswell as
thekey secondar y endpoint of 24-hour sustained pain freedom (Connor et al, 2009 ). 
Serum alanine aminotransferase (AL T) increases were observed with telcagepant as well as 
with a second CGRP  antagonist, MK- 3207. For this reason, the development of these 
compounds was stopped. 
What is U brogepant?
Ubrogepant, a novel CGRP  receptor antagonist that is chemicall y distinct from both 
telcagepant and MK -3207, is now bei ng developed for the acute treatment of migraine. 
Preclinical and clinical studies conducted to date for ubrogepant have shown no evidence of 
hepatoto xicity .
A Phase 2b clinical study was conducted, which compared 1-, 10-
, 25-, 50- , and 100- mg 
doses of ubr ogepant to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine. Overall, all the ubrogepant 
doses tested were well tolerated and t he adverse event (AE) profile of all ubrogepant doses 
did not dif fer significantly  from placebo. For the primary  efficacy  endpoint of pain freedom
at 2hours, ubrogepant doses of 1 and 10 mg did not dif fer from placebo, but doses of 25, 50, 
and 100 mg were better than placebo. For the primary  efficacy  endpoint of pain relief at 
2hours none of the ubrogepant doses dif fered from placebo , p
robabl y due to a high placebo 
response rate .
The a bsence of migraine -associated s ymptoms of photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea was
assessed as key  secondary  endpoints. Ubrogepant doses of 50 and 100 mg were significantly  
better than placebo for absence o f phonophobia and photophobia at 2 hours, whereas 25 mg 
did not dif fer from placebo. None of the ubrogepant doses dif fered from placebo for the 
endpoint of absence of nausea at 2 hours. Measures of sustained migraine headache relief

16
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-01 Amendment 3
17(2to 24 hours and 2 to 48 hours sustained pain freedom and sustained pain relief) generally  
suggest edthat ubrogepant 50 mg and 100 mg were more effective than the 25 -mg dose.
The purpose of this study will be to assess the safety and ef ficacy  of 2 doses of ubrogepant, 
50 and 100 mg, versus placebo in the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura, in a 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study .
2. Study Objectives and Clinical Hypotheses
2.1 Study Objectives
To evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of 2 doses of ubrogepant (50 and 100 mg) 
compared to placebo for the acute treatment of a single migraine attack.
2.[ADDRESS_1046246] 1ubrogepant dose is superior to placebo in the acute treatment of migraine .
2.Ubrogepant is safe and tolerable.
3. Study Design
This multicenter , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, single attack
study  will enroll approximately  1650 patients from approximately  100 centers in the United 
States. Patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of the fol lowing 3 treatment groups: placebo, 
ubrogepant [ADDRESS_1046247]
An Adjudication Charter will be established and will describe the process for the blinded 
surveillance, monitoring, and adjud ication b y the Clinical Adjudication Committee of events 
of posttreatment elevations of ALT and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥3 times the 
upper limit of normal (ULN) in the ubrogepant program. The purpose of this committee 
charter will be to provid e a standardized process for the adjudication of data associated with 
these events in order to determine whether the elevation was related to ubrogepant.
13AUG2018 CSR UBR-MD-[ADDRESS_1046248] (DSMB) will also be established to review 
unblinded safet y data and summary reports, identify  any safety issues and trends ,and make 
recommendations to the Sponsor , including modification or early  termination of a trial, if 
emerging data show unexpected and clinically significant adverse events of treatment.
Details of the DSMB memberships, standard operational procedures for data 
monitoring/review , frequency  of review , and other pertinent details will be provided in a

7.2.1 Primary Efficacy Variables
The coprimary  efficacy  parameters for the U nited States areas follows:  
13AUG2018 CSR UBR-MD-01
38
Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-01 Amendment 3
39Pain freedom (PF) at 2 hours after the initial dose , defined as a reduction in headache 
severit y from moderate/severe at baseline to no pain, at 2hours after the initial dose
Absence of the most bothersome migraine- associated sy mpto m (the most bothersome 
migraine -associat ed symptom will be identified at baseline for each patient) at 2hours 
after the initial dose . 
7.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables
The secondary  efficacy  parameters for the[LOCATION_002] are:
Pain relief ( PR)at 2hours after the initial dose , defined as the reduction of a 
moderate/severe migraine headache to a mild headache or to no headache , at 2 hours 
after the initial dose
Sustained pain relief ( SPR)from 2 to 24hours after the initial dose ,defined as pain 
relief with no administration of either rescue medication or the second dose of IP,and 
with no occurrence thereafter of a moderate/severe headache during the relevant 
number of hours after dosing with the IP
Sustained pain freedom (SPF) from 2 to 
24 hours after the initial dose , defined as pain 
freedom with no administration of either r escue medication or the second dose of IP, 
and with no occurrence thereafter of a mild/moderate/severe headache during the 
relevant number of hours after dosing with the IP
Absence of photophobia at 2hours after the initial dose
Absence of phonophobia at 2hours after the initial dose
Absence of nausea at 2hours after the initial dose
 
 
 
 
 
13AUG2018 CSR UBR-MD-[ADDRESS_1046256] (LOCF) approach will be used to impute missing post treatment values. Baseline for 
efficac y is defined as the last nonmissing ef ficacy  assessment before the initial dose of study  
treatment. All statistical tests will be 2 sided hy pothesis tests performed at the 5% level of 
significance for main ef fects. All conf idence intervals will be 2 -sided 95% confidence 
intervals, unless stated otherwise.
7.3.1 Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analyses
For each primary  variable, the observed response proportions will be provided by  [CONTACT_6490]. Theprimary  efficacy  
variable of pain freed omat 2 hours after the initial dose will be 
analyzed using a logistic regression model with categorical terms for treatment group, 
historical triptan response (triptan responder, triptan insufficient responder, or triptan naïve), 
use of medi cation for migraine prevention (y es/no), and baseline headache severit y 
(moderate or severe). The primary  efficacy  variable of absence of the most bothersome 
symptom at [ADDRESS_1046257] bothersome. 
If the logistic regression model fails to converge due to complete or 
quasi -complete separation, Firth’s penalized likelihood method ( Firth, 1993 ) will be used. 
The logistic regression model will be referred to as the primary  model. 
13AUG2018 CSR UBR-MD-01
41

Allergan Confidential Protocol UBR -MD-01 Amendment 3
42The respective comparisons of the ubrogepant dose sversus placebo, which are the formal 
tests of the efficacy  hypotheses, will be conducted using the appropriate pairwise contrasts 
within the logistic regression model. Treatment comparisons will be based on the model -
derived odds ratios and their associated 95% confidence intervals. Two -sided p -values will 
also be provided. 
, thestudy  will be considered a success if at least 1 ubrogepant dose is 
demonstrated to be superior to placebo on both coprimary  variables after multiplicity  
adjustment. 
 
 
.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
For each secondary  efficacy  endpoint, the observed response proportions will be analy zed 
using the same methods used to anal yze the primary  efficacy  variables. The respective 
comparisons of the ubrogepant doses v ersusplacebo will be conducted using model -derived 
odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals and p -values from the logistic regression model. 
For 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints o n migraine -associated sy mptoms, baseline presence/absence 
of the sy mptom will be included as an additional covariate for the logistic regression model.
A graphical approach b y Bretz et al (2009 )will be used to control the ov erall ty pe I error rate 
for multiple comparisons across the ubrogepant doses and the primary  and secon dary 
efficacy  endpoints. The coprimary  efficacy  endpoints will serve as the gatekeepers of the 
secondary  endpoints. The secondary  endpoints will be tested in the same order as they  appear 
in the list of secondary  endpoints, except for the 3migraine -associated s ymptoms which will 
be treated at the same level to allow the recy clingof weights among the 3symptom 
endpoints. Recy clingof weights between the 2 doses is also allowed. The details of the 
multiple comparison procedure will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan (SAP).

Patient s may  voluntaril y withdraw from the stud y at an y time. Notification of earl y patient
discontinuation from the study  and the reason for discontinuation will be clearl y documented 
on the appropriate eCRF .All randomized patients who prematurely discontinue from the 
study , regardless of cause, should be seen for a final assessment. A final a ssessment will be 
defined as completion of the evaluations scheduled for V isit 3/Earl y Termination  
 
. If the patient discontinue safter IPis 
taken, the patient is also expected to return for theSafety  Follow -up V isit(Visit 4) 4 weeks 
postdose .
8.9 Withdrawal Criteria
Women who become pregnant will be withdrawn from the study  (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and 
should refrain from taking IP. The patient should return to the clinic for early  termination
procedures (Visit 3), including the safet y follow -up visit (V isit 4) if IPwas taken. 
Patients who reply  with “y es” to questions 4 or 5 in the suicidal ideation section or “y es” to 
any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C -SSRS at Visit 3  
nd should receive appropriate follow -up a s in routine clinical practice , 
including the safet y follow -up visit (V isit 4) if IPwas taken.
A patient with a condition and/or a situation that, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may  put the 
patient at significant risk, may confound the study  results, or may  interfere significantl y with 
the patient's participation in the study  may be withdrawn from treatment.

unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the 
medici nal (investigational) product. In addition, during the screening period, ad verse events 
will be assessed regardless of the administration of a pharmaceutical product.
Note:  Adverse events must be collected once informed consent has been obtained, regardless 
of whether or not the patient has been administered study  drug.
Progress ion of treatment indication including new or worsening of anticipated clinical signs 
or sy mptoms, which are collected as clinical efficacy  variables and assessed as unequivocall y 
associated with the disease progression and /or lack of efficacy , should NOT  be reported as 
adverse events unless the disease progression is greater than anticipated in the natural course 
of the disease.
Adverse events will be assessed, documented, and recorded in the eCRF throughout the study  
(ie, after inform ed consent has been 
obtained). At each visit, the investigator will begin b y 
query ing for adverse events by  [CONTACT_229298] a general, non -directed question such as 
“How have you been feeling since the last visit?” Directed questioning and examination wil l 
then be done as appropriate. All reported adverse events will be documented on the

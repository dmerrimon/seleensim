Clinical Trial Protocol
Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMETHODOLOGY
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, international, 
Phase 3 trial to investigate the safety  and efficacy  of mesalamine 2 g extended release granules 
(sachet) for maintenance of clinical and endoscopic remission in subj ects with UC. Subjects who 
are in remission can be enrolled in the current trial via 
1of 3pathway s. 
Pathway  1:  Subjects who are in remission following [ADDRESS_1130515] 1 point decrease from baseline for stool 
frequency , with an endoscopic score of 0 or 1.
Pathway  2:  Subjects in remission at the end of the 8- week open- label treatment period in 
Study  000174 will be allowed to be randomized into Study  000175. 
Pathway  3
–de novo:  Subjects who did not participate in Study  000174 can also be 
enrolled; these subjects will have been treated with various medications for UC (excluding 
biologics and long -term [ ≥6weeks ] immunosuppressants) and will have been in remission 
for <[ADDRESS_1130516] a Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score 
assessment to ensure eligibility .
All eligible subjects will be randomized during Visit 1/D ay 0 (start of maintenance) to 1of the 
following treatments:  
one mesalamine 2 g extended release granules (sachet) QD (2 g/day ) OR
one 2 g placebo sachet to match 
mesalamine extended release granules (sachet)
Dose will be administered QD at least [ADDRESS_1130517] 8 ounces (240 mL ) of water. For all subjects, the first dose of investigational medicinal 
product 
(IMP) will be administered the day  following randomization/Visit 1.
During the 6- month trial period, all subjects will visit the trial site 5 times for safety and efficacy 
evaluations:  baseline, Week 2, and Months 2, 4, and [ADDRESS_1130518] 
clinical sy mptoms ( stool frequency  and rectal bleeding) in an electronic diary . The Clinical and 
Endoscopic Response Score assessments will be performed at baseline and Month 6. After 
[ADDRESS_1130519] a complete screening visit,
and if they  arejudged to be in clinical and endoscopic remission based on their Clinical and 
Endoscopic Score at baseline/randomization, t hey 
will continue with the 6- month assessment for 
safet y and efficacy evaluations.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIALMETHODOLOGY ( Continued )
Flexible sigmoidoscopy /colon oscop y will be video recorded and transferred to the independent 
central reader. The details of the tools, recording, data transfer, and assessment will be documented 
in an Imaging Charter .If the local site ’sendoscopic reading determines the subject is ineligi ble, the 
subject will be screen failed (Pathway  3 –de novo ).If the local site’s endoscopic reading 
determines that the subject is eligible, the flexible sigmoidoscopy /colon oscopy recording will be 
sent to the independent central reader for final determination of eligibility (Pathway  3 –de novo ). 
For subjects rolling over from the 000174 trial (Pathway  1 and 2) ,000175 eligibility  will be derived 
from the final end-
of-treatment ( EOT) independent central read. A flexible 
sigmoidoscop y/colon oscopy will also be performed at Month 6, which will also be sent to the 
independent central reader for endoscopic endpoint scoring for all subjects . 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS
Approximately 260 subjects with UC in clinical and endoscopic remission will be randomized 
(130/treatment regimen).

STATISTICAL METHODS
Sample size : The true remission rates at Month 6 for mesalamine 2 g extended release granules 
(sachet) and placebo regimens were assumed as 68% and 49%, respectively, based on The 
mesalamine Study  Group (1996) ,(3)Hawkey  et al ( 1997), (4)and Apriso™ package insert
(2009).( 5)Under these assumptions, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1130521] 85% power to detect a statistically  significant treatment group difference in the 
remission rate at a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_1130522]  1, approximately  260 subjects will be randomized. 
Efficacy
: The prima ry efficacy  anal ysis will be based on all randomized subjects who were
assigned to mesalamine [ADDRESS_1130523]  2 or 3(ITT; intent -to-treat) . The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be the proportion of
subjects inremission, defined as rectal bleeding score of [ADDRESS_1130524] stratified by [CONTACT_816518] a two-sided 0.05 
significance level. Subjects who discontinue the double
-blind regimen before Month 6, as well as 
subjects with missing remission assessment at Month 6, will be considered not having met the 
remission criteria . The odds ratio will be estimated and its 95% confidence interval will be 
provided.
Safety : The safet y anal yses will be based on all subjects who receive at least 1dose of IMP . All 
adverse events will be coded by  [CONTACT_816519] (MedDRA) . A treatment-emergent 
adverse event will be defined as an y adverse event occurring after t
he start of IMP or pre -existing 
medical condition that worsens in intensity  after the start of IMP.
Clinical laboratory  variables will be presented in 2ways. First, mean change from baseline to the 
end of the double -blind treatment visit will be summarize d. Baseline will be defined as the last 
assessment before the first dose of IMP . Second, the number and percentage of subjects with 
treatment -emergent potentially  clinicall
y significant laboratory values on or before the end of the 
double -blind treatment v isit will be tabulated . 
Other safety  assessments will also be summarized descr iptivel y.

Ferring Pharmaceuticals CONFIDENTIAL1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Backgroun d
Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory  bowel disease, is a chronic condition of unknown origin. 
Ulcerative colitis is a relapsing and remitting disease characterized by  [CONTACT_705436] -infectious 
inflammation of the colorectal mucosa. (6)  In the United State s (US), about 1 million people are 
affected with UC. (7,8) The annual incidence of UC per 100,000 people is 10.4 to 12cases in the 
US and 8 cases in Europe . The prevalence rate per 100,000 people is 35 to 100 cases in the US and 
21 to 243 in Europe. UC is slightly  more common in women than in men. Although the disease can 
occur at an y age, the age of onset follows a bimodal pattern, with a peak at 15 to 25 years and a 
smaller peak at 55 to 65years.(9)
Active epi[INVESTIGATOR_705422] b y passing of blood a nd mucus, diarrhea, and abdominal pain 
frequentl y accompanied by  [CONTACT_816520]. (10)In the most severe forms, sy stemic signs 
comprising fever, anorexia, and weight loss may  occur. 
Approximately  60% of patients have a mild 
form, 25% a moderate form, and 15% a severe disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391], it is estimated that 
approximately  1 of every 2 patients with UC will experience a relapse within 1 y ear;the cumulative 
probability  of relapse is 80% within 2 y ears and 95% within 10 y ears.( 11)
Involvement of th e rectal mucosa is a constant feature while the inflammation spreads to higher 
levels in continuous and retrograde fashion, with no sparing of mucosa from the anorectal junction. 
Hence, UC may  be divided in proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, left -sided colitis (the proximal limit 
being below the splenic flexure), extensive colitis (involving the transverse colon), andpancolitis
(involving the entire colon).
The aim of treatment of UC is theinduc tionof remission and maintenance of remission
, and the 
prevention of  complication of long -term UC . 
Several therapeutic drug classes are used in UC: 5 -aminosalicy lic acid ( 5-ASA )derivatives, 
corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and anti- tumor necrosis factor -αagents. At present, 
aminosalicy late derivatives are the main and first-line therapy  for mild to moderate epi[INVESTIGATOR_705423].( 12)Rectal administration of salicy late-type drugs constitutes the 
treatment of choice in proctitis, proctosigmoiditis, and left
-sided UC.( 13,14,15) The extended
release mesalamine granules are purposed to treat all forms of active mild -to-moderate UC in all 
segments of the colon.
Ferring recently  developed a prolonged release granule formulation with a higher drug load (95% 
load) to provide a bett
er alternative for patients that have difficulty  swallowing the tablet or capsule 
forms, and thereb y ma y help increase treatment compliance.

The optimum dose of oral mesalamine for induction therap y in order to achieve remission is 
between 2 and 4 g/day .(18)  
1.2
Scientific Justification for Conducting the Trial
The mesalamine 2 g extended release granules ( sachet) is approved in [ADDRESS_1130537] difficult y swallowing the tablets or large capsules forms. The re are no sachet granular forms 
available for both induction and maintenance of remission in some countries . The availability  of 
this easier -to-take formulation might potentially  help increase compliance, and would be an overall 
useful tool in the care of these patients. 
1.3 Benefit / Risk Aspects
The 95% granules allows for a true once a day  convenient dosing with the highest unit dosage form 
available for induction and maintenance of UC . In addition the granules are easier to swallow than 
the tablets and capsules currentl y available in the US .
The most common adverse events ( AEs) considered related to treatment with mesalamine 
formulations up to 2g per day  have been diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting, 
andrash. Hy persensitivity  reaction s and drug fever may  occasionally  occur.

3.1 Overall Trial Design
3.1.1 Overall Design and Control Methods
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, international, 
Phase 3 trial to investigate the safety  and efficacy  of therap y with mesalamine 2 g extended release 
granules (sachet) for maintenance of clinical and endos copic remission in subje cts with UC. 
Subjects who are in remission can be enrolled in the current trial via [ADDRESS_1130539] s. 
Pathway  1:  Subjects who are in remission following [ADDRESS_1130540] 1 point decrease from baseline for stool 
frequency , with an endoscopic sc ore of 0 or 1.
Pathway  2:  Subjects in remission at the end of the 8- week open- label treatment period in 
Study  000174 will be allowed to be randomized into Study  000175. 
Pathway  3
–de novo:  Subjects who did not participate in Study  000174 can also be 
enrolled; these subjects will have been treated with various medications for UC (excluding 
biologics and long -term [ ≥6weeks ] immunosuppressants) and will have been in remission 
for <[ADDRESS_1130541] a Clinical and Endoscopic Response Score 
assessment to ensure eligibility . Refer to Section 4.3.1 for a complete listing of restrictions.
All eligible subjects will be randomized during Visit 1/Day  0 (start of maintenance) to 1 of the 
following treatments:  
one mesalamine 2 g extended release granul es (sachet) QD (2 g/day ) OR
one 2 g placebo sachet to match mesalamine extended release granules (sachet)
Dose will be administered QD at least [ADDRESS_1130542] 8 ounces (240 mL ) of water. For all subjects, the first dose of investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) will be administered the day  following randomization/Visit 1.
During the 6
-month trialperiod, all subjects will visit the trialsite 5 times for safety and efficacy 
evaluations:  baseline, Week 2, and Months 2, 4, and 6. On a daily basis, subjects will record 
clinical sy mptoms ( stool frequency  and rectal bleeding) in an electronic dia ry. The Clinical and 
Endoscopic Response Score assessments will be performed at baseline and Month 6. After

Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator and designated persons at Ferring via 
the IRT system. Breaking of the blind for individual subjects i n emergency  situations is only  
permitted in case of a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) or in case of an 
important AE where the knowledge of the IMP in question is required for therapeutic decisions for 
the management of the subject. Th e expectedness of events will be assessed by  [CONTACT_705440]’s Brochure.
As the emergency  permits, the need to break the blind will be agreed upon by  [CONTACT_2183]. It should be recorded in the eCRF that the code is broken and wh y, when, and b y whom. 
The investigator must record the event of unblinding in the sub ject’s medical record, including the 
reason for unblinding, but not the treatment allocation, if this can be avoided. 
In case of accidental unblinding, the same documentation as for emergency  unblinding must be 
obtained, and the event must also be recorde d in the subject’s medical record.
It may  be necessary  to unblind an individual subject’s treatment for the purposes of expedited 
reporting to the authorities and/or Independent Ethics Committee(s) (IEC)(s)/I nstitutional Review 
Board(s) (I RB)(s). In that situation, every  effort will be made to maintain blinding of sponsor

Each of the items in the AElog is described in detail in the following sections.
Adverse Event s
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate signs and s ymptoms 
should be recorded. One diagnosis/s ymptom should be entered per record.
If a subject suffers from the same AEmore than once and the subject recovers between the events, 
the AE s should be recorded separatel y. If an AEchanges in intensity , a worst -case approach should 
be used when recording the event, i.e. the highest intensity  and the longest duration of the event.a
A procedure is not an AE; the reason for conducting the procedure is. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816512] ; 
the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_270588]. Death is not an AE, but the cause of death is (an exception is 
sudden death of unknown cause, which is an AE).
Date and Time of Onset
The date of onset is the date when the first sign(s) or sy mptom(s) were first noted. If the AEis an 
abnormal clinicall y significant labor atory  test or outcome of an examination, the onset date is the 
date the sample was taken or the examination was performed. 
Intensity
The intensity  of an AEmust be classified using the following 3- point scale:
Mild: awareness of signs or s ymptoms, but no disruption of usual activity
Moderate: event 
sufficient to aff ect usual activity  (disturbing)
Severe: inability  to work or perform usual activiti es (unacceptable)
                                                
aException: if an AE with onset before the first IMP administration (i.e., a pre- treatment AE) changes in 
intensity, this must be recorded as 2 separate events. The initial AE should be recorded w ith outcome “not yet 
recovered” and the date and time of outcom e are when the intensity changed. The second AE should be 
recorded w ith date and time of onset when the intensity changed.

Reasonable possibility : There is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship 
between the IMP and the AE . The AE may occur as part of the 
pharmacological action of the IMP or may  be unpredictable in its 
occurrence.
Examples: 
AEs that are uncommon but are known to be strong ly associated 
with I MP exposure
AEs that are not commonly  associated with IMP exposure, but the 
event occurs in association with other factors strongl y suggesting 
causation, such as a strong temporal association or the event 
recurs on rechallenge
No reasonable possibility: There is no reasonable evidence or argument to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IMP and the AE.
Examples:
known consequences of the underl ying disease o r condition under 
investigation
AEs common in the trial population, which are also anticipated to 
occur with some frequency  during the course of the trial, 
regardless of IMP exposure
Action Taken with IMP
The action taken with the IMP in response to an AEmust be classified as 1of the following:
no change (medication schedule maintained or no actio n taken)
withdrawn
interrupted
Other Action Taken
Adverse events requiring therap y must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to 
protect the health and well-being of the subject. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines 
must be avai lable to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency  situation.
If medication is administered to treat the AE, this medication should be entered in the concomitant

duration, and the outcome of the pregnancy  as well as neonatal health. If a pregnancy  results i n an 
abnormal outcome (birth defect/congenital anomaly), this must be reported as an SAE to Global 
Pharmacovigilance at Ferring Pharmaceuticals as described in Section 8.4.2. Any abnormal 
pregnancy  outcome which the investigator and/or sponsor consider to be related to the IMP will be 
treated as an expedited report .

8.4.1 Serious Adverse Event D efinition
Serious AE s are defined as follows:
An event is defined a serious 
adverse event if it:Guidance
results in death Any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, 
including deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_1130576] always be 
exercised and ,when in doubt the case should be considered serious (i.e. ,if 
case fulfils the criterion for a medically important event). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816513] s. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_480191]/or surgical operations planned before trial inclusion are not considered 
AEs, if the illness or disease existed before the subject w as enrolled in the 
trial, provided that the condition did n ot deteriorate during the trial.
results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacityDisability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. In doubt, the decision should be left to medical 
judgment by [CONTACT_093].

conceived during treatment with the IMP.
is an important m edical event Important medical events are events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_816514] 1of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. Examples of important medical events include AEs that 
suggest a significant hazard, contraindication or precaution, occurrence of 
malignancy ,or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether even ts qualify as 
medically important.
Important medical events include any suspected transmission of an infectious 
agent via a medicinal product. Any organism virus or infectious particle (e.g. ,
prion protein transmitting transm issible spongiform encephalopat hy), 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A 
transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms 
or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a subject exposed to a 
medicinal product.

All analy ses will be detailed in a subsequent statistical anal ysis plan.
9.1 Determination of Sample Size
The true remission rates at Month 6 for mesalamine 2 g extended release granules (sachet) and 
placebo regimens were assumed as 68% and 49%, respectivel y, based on The Mesalamine Stud y 
Group (1996) (3), Hawkey  et al (1997) (4), and Apriso™ package insert (2009) .(5)Under these 
assumptions, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1130580] 85% power 
to detect a statistically  significant treatment group difference in the remission rate at a two -sided 
0.[ADDRESS_1130581]. I n addition, reason- specific discontinuation will 
be summarized by  [CONTACT_705446].
9.3 Protocol Deviations
The following protocol deviations will be identified as major protocol deviations:
overall IMP compliance less than 80%
not taking the randomized I MP
taking prohibited medication s
The final definition of major and minor protocol violations will be determined prior to breaking the 
trialblind.  
The number and percentage of subjects with major protocol deviations will be summari zed.

Development Phase: Phase 2  
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Double -Blind 4-week Study to Evaluate the Impact of AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  
This research study is designed with the purpose of evaluating  a new drug,  combination Dextromethorphan -
Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (AXS-05), for its effect on smoking behavior.  
Primary Objective  
1. To evaluate the impact of AXS -05 compared to Bupr opi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] ( BUP ) on change in smoking intensity from 
baseline to the 3 -Week Fol low-Up Visit. Smoking intensity  refers to the total amount of smoke inhaled by [CONTACT_33615]. Smoking intensity will be assessed as a latent 
variable modeled through three  predictive factors: 1. Salivary cotinine , which will be assessed at all study 
visits , 2. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514] (CO) breath testing at all study visit s and 3. Number of c igarettes smoked 
per day assessed via daily smoking diaries .  
Secondary Objectives (Smok ing Behavior)  
2. To compare AXS-[ADDRESS_32940] conducted between the 3 -
Week Follow -up and 4 -Week Follow -up Study Visits . Smoking Abstinence will be assessed by [CONTACT_6270] -report 
diaries and biochemical ly confirm ed via expi[INVESTIGATOR_33515].   
Secondary Objectives (Covariates and Potential Mo derators)  
3. To assess specific baseline variables for an association with smoki ng behavior outcome , listed above . Baseline 
variables assessed will include age, gender, race, education, baseline nicotine dependence, stress, anxiety, 
depression, and self -efficacy . If a baseline variable is found to be associate d with change in smoking behavior, 
it will be treated as a covariate in a secondary analysis of smoking behavior and assessed as a potential 
moderator of treatment effect.  
Secondary Objectives (Adherence, Side Effects, and Tolerance)  
4. To compare AXS-05 to BUP on adheren ce to self -administered drug through  Medication Use diaries  
5. To compare AXS-05 to BUP on t olerability through weekly , open -ended survey to assess  potential side 
effects.  
6. To compare AXS-05 to BUP on the incidence of adverse events or seri ous adverse events utilizing FDA 
accepted reporting guidelines on these outcomes.   
Secondary Objectives ( Urinary Levels of DXM )  
7. To measure urine drug levels of Dextromethorphan ( DXM ) at weeks 1 -4 and assess potential correlation of 
these levels with smok ing behavior and side effects.   
Secondary Objectives (Potential Mediators)  
8. To compare AXS-05 to BUP on change s from baseline vs. weeks 1 -4 Follow -up Visits on the following: 
smoking urges, withdrawal symptoms,  smoking reward, stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance,  and 
agitation.  
9. To compare AXS-05 to BUP on change from baseline to weeks 1 -4 Follow -up Visits  on daily assessment of the 
following: urge fr equency, urge severity, and irritability .  
  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  6 Hypotheses  
This protocol is hypothesis -supp orting and hypothesis -testing.  
Primary Hypothesis  
1. Participants allocated to AXS -05 vs. BUP will demonstrate significant reduction in total smoking intensity 
from baseline to the 3 -Week Follow up visit. Smoking intensity will be assessed as a latent variable modeled 
through 3 predictive factors: 1. Salivary cotinine , which will be assessed at all study visits. 2. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_33516] (CO) breath testing at all study visits and 3. Number of c igarettes smoked per day will be veri fied 
objectively and salivary cotinine level.  
Secondary Hypotheses (Smoking Behavior)  
2. Participants allocated to AXS-[ADDRESS_32941] conducted between the 3 week Follow -up and 4 week  Follow -up Study 
Visits . Smoking Abstinence will be assessed via self -reported smoking abstinence (not one puff of one 
cigarette) with biochemical confirmation via expi[INVESTIGATOR_33517].   
Secondary Hypotheses (Covari ates and Potential Moderators)  
3. Potential baseline predictors of tobacco use will not be associated with smoking behavior outcomes listed in 
objectives 1 -6; these predictors include age, gender, race, education, baseline nicotine dependence, stress, 
anxiety,  depression, and self -efficacy.   
Secondary Hypotheses (Adherence, Side Effects, and Tolerance)  
4. Participants allocated to AXS-05 vs. BUP alone will demonstrate no significant difference on adherence to 
self-administered drug via Medication Use Diaries .  
5. Participants allocated to AXS-05 vs. BUP alone will demonstrate no significant  difference  in the incidence of 
side effects through weekly open -ended survey s on potential side effects.  
6. Participants allocated to AXS-05 vs. BUP alone will demonstrate no significant difference on adverse eve nts 
or serious adv erse events utilizing  FDA accepted reporting guidelines on these outcomes.   
Secondary Hypotheses (Urinary Level of DXM )  
7. Participants allocated to AXS-[ADDRESS_32942] to urinary  drug 
levels at each medication assessment visit : 1. Relatively stable urinary  drug levels of DXM (< 50% below or 
above the mean), 2. A majority of participants will show urinary  DXM concentrations that are in the 
“expected therapeutic range” for tobacco dependence treatment ( 30 ng/ml) , 3. There will be a correlation 
between DXM levels and smoking behavior outcomes (objective  2), 4. Urinary  levels of DXM that are above 
the mean  will not be associated with a higher incidence  of side effects or adverse event s (objectives 4-6) 
when added to BUP and compared to BUP alone .   
Secondary Hypotheses  (Potential Mediators)  
8. Participants allocated to AXS-05 vs. BUP will demonstrate the following: 1. A significant reduction in smokin g 
urges, withdrawal symptoms , stress, anxiety,  depression , sleep disturbance , agitation  from baseline to all 
four post -drug initiation time points , 2. The change in in smoking urges and withdrawal symptoms will be 
significantly associated with change in smoking behavior assessed throug h objective 2 .   
9. Participants allocated to AXS-05 vs. BUP will demonstrate a significant reduction in urges and imp rovement in 
irritability from baseline to weeks 1 -4 based on urges and irritability Diary entries.  
  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  7 3.2.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
1. The Study Therapy : The overarching goal of this proposal is to conduct preliminary testing of AXS-05 (a fixed dose 
combination of 105 mg of sustained -release (SR) Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (BUP) and 45 mg of immediate -release (IR) 
Dextromethorphan  (DM))  for its effect on smoking behavior. Dextromethorphan (DXM), a widely used over -the-
counter cough suppressant , crosses the blood -brain barrie r easily . DXM has been shown to block α3β4 nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors  and N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors , is a  serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_33518], and is a sigma -[ADDRESS_32943] shown that administration of DXM leads to 
decreased  self-administration of nicotine in nicotine -dependent rats in a dose -dependent manner (see #6 below in 
this section ). DXM ha s not, however, been studied for its effect on tobacco use in humans.   
 DXM, when taken alone (e.g. when it is used as a cough suppressant ), would not be expected to be useful for 
treatment of nicotine dependence in humans. Therapeutic  concentrations of DXM are required to bind the receptors 
that impact neurotransmitters that are important in the treatment of  nicotine dependence ; however,  it is not 
possible to attain these concentrations  of DXM in humans when it is dosed as a single agent because of its rapid 
metabolism via CYP2D6 . Because  approximately 95% of DXM that is ingested is quickly metabolized into dextro rphan 
via the CYP2D6 pathway , plasma concentrations of DXM are negligible when i t is administered alone .  The metabolite 
dextro rphan is quickly glucurodinated and therefore does not easily cross the blood -brain barrier and thus  would not 
be expected to have a meaningful impact on nicotine se lf-administration in humans. A n innovative approach to attain 
therapeutic concentrations of DXM is to co -administer it with an inhibitor of its metabolism . Such an approach would 
allow for attainment of plasma concentrations that have been shown to result in the  bind ing of  neural recepto rs that 
impact nicotine self-administration (See #6 below in this section ).  
 Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (BUP)  is a well-characterized , FDA approved medication for smoking cessation that has  also been 
shown to inhibit the metabolism of DXM . When  various  doses of BUP  – including doses that are commonly 
prescribed for smoking cessation  (e.g. 150 mg or less)  – are co-administered  with DXM  to healthy volunteers , a 
significant  increase in DXM plasma levels  is observed (See Inves tigators Brochure  Version 4.0 [IND 129633] Section 
5.1.1: AXS-05 (Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33519] ). This finding , togethe r with the finding that 
similar  DXM  levels  reduce  nicotine self -administration in nicotine -dependent rats, suggest s that it may be possible to 
develop a drug prod uct that combines  safe, commonl y used dose s of DXM  and BUP  that would be well -tolerated  and 
result  in a reduction  in smoking behavior in humans.  
Currently,  the pharmaceutical development company Axsome Therapeutics Inc.  (Axsome) is develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_33520] -dose combination  [ADDRESS_32944]  has been  
designated with the name “ AXS-05,” and for clarity, we will refer to it as such in this protocol . In three completed 
Phase I trials  and two ongoing Phase II/III trials sponsored by [CONTACT_33616] , AXS-05 has been found to be generally safe 
and well-tolerated  in the completed three Phase 1 studies and the adverse event profile of AXS -05 was similar to that 
of BUP alone . AXS-05 is currently being evaluated for efficacy and safety in “adequate and well -controlled 
registration trials  in treatment -resistant depression and agitation associated with Alzheimer’s  disease  (see below) . 
Thus far, AXS-05 has not been tested for its effec t on tobacco use in humans ; furthermore, to our knowledge , DXM 
has not been studied in combination with BUP or any other CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g. quinidine) for its impact on 
tobacco use  in humans .  
2.  The disease population :  This study evaluates individuals with t obacco dependence. T obacco use  is the number 
one cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US1,2. It causes 480,000 deaths per year and is the cause of 
death in approximately two -thirds of all smokers2.   
3.  The clinically unmet need  for this type of supportive care :  Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment used by 
[CONTACT_33617]. Approximately 29.9% of all s mokers attempt to quit smoking with the use of a 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  8 medication3. Currently, there are seven FDA approved smoking cessation medications : varenicline, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 
nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray4. These FDA approved medications roughly double the chances 
of quitting during any given quit attempt; efficacy vs. placebo of RR=1.7 (nicotine gum) , RR=1.8 (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394])  to RR=2.4 
(varen icline)5. Developmen t of a new  medication class with oral administration, low incidence of side effects , and 
greater efficacy than that of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33521] -level adoption and large -scale population impact.    
4.  Why the stated objectives of the research are important :  This study is  designed to produce evidence that AXS-[ADDRESS_32945] smoki ng abstinence : the [ADDRESS_32946] 
on smoking behavior beyond that of BUP , a well-established  and FDA approved  tobacco dependence treatment. The 
study is designed to  assess changes  (reductions)  in smoking behavior that may occur in current smokers who use 
AXS-05. If results are positive, the study outcomes are designed to guide further development of AXS-05 as a smoking 
cessation treatment .  
5.  The rationale for performing this research : The overarching rational e for performing this research is the study ’s 
high potential for future impact. If AXS-05 is found to be a safe and effective treatment and is approved as an aid to 
smoking cessation , it could be made available to thousands of smokers  through Axsome’s acces s to large -scale drug 
production and capacity for national distribution . This long -term potential for production and distribution means that 
positive study findings may lead to further development of this potential treatment and, if successful , a reduction  in 
smoking rates in the US and abroad.   
6.  Citations for existing literature that supports the rationale for performing this research : Dextromethorphan 
Reduces Nicotine Self -Administration in Rats7.  Design:  Young adult female rat s were fitted with jugular  IV catheters 
and trained to self -administer a nicotine infusion d ose of 0.03  mg/kg/infusion. Then, in a dose -effect function study, 
oral DXM was administered over five doses ranging from 0 to 30 mg/kg. Results: DXM administration  significantly 
decreased nicotine self -administration in a dose -dependent manner with maximal effect seen at 30 mg/kg (p<.0005) 
(Figure 2). Throughout varied doses, motor function and food intake showed no significant changes , suggesting low 
toxicity. Rele vance:  This study showed that administration of DXM leads to decreased nicotine self -administration in 
rats, suggesting that we may observe a similar finding in humans  if we are able to obtain similar plasma 
concentrations of DXM.   
7.  Published and u npublished clinical data, if any, that supports the conduct of this research : Studies completed by 
[CONTACT_33618]-05, described in the Investigators Brochure  Version 4.0 [IND 129633]  Section 5.1.1: AXS -05 
(Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33522]) Pharmacokinetics)  provide evidence of the following:  1. Administration of 
combination AXS-05 results in a significant i ncrease in plasma DXM levels , 2. BUP -inhibited  metabolism of DXM 
extends DXM half -life sufficiently (from 2 hours to 20 hours) to allow  for twice daily dosing of AXS-05 with stable 
plasma levels . Furthermore, additional studies, found that  DXM co -administered with the metabolic inhibitor 
quinidine  results in a reduction of depressi ve symptoms in patients with treatment -resistant depressio n8 and DXM 
co-administered with the metabolic inhibitor quinidine  results in reduction of agitation symptoms in individuals with 
Alzheimer’s type deme ntia9.   
8.  How conclusions derived from this research will be used :  Results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_33523] s upporting 
evidence for the design of a fully powered , randomized controlled trial on the use of  AXS-05 as a treatment for  
tobacco dependence.    
9. Previous Human Experience with the Proposed Dose: The proposed doses to be used in this stud y are as follows: 
AXS-05 (105 mg BUP/45 mg DXM), twice daily  and 105mg BUP SR, twice daily . The proposed dose of AXS -05 for this 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  9 study is identical to the dose used in Study AXS -05-301 during the six -week double -blind treatment period and used 
in Study AXS -05-AD-301 used for following the titration for five consecutive weeks (Days 8 to 43)  (see Investigator’s 
Brochure Version 4.0 [IND 129633]  Section 5.5.1: AXS -05 (Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33522]) Clin ical Safety 
Experience ). However, in the study, patients  will be exposed to either AXS -05 or 105 mg BUP SR for only 28 days . 
3.3.  DESIGN AND PROCEDURE   
Non -Treatment Study: This study is designed to assess changes in smoking behavior in smokers who use AXS-05 
compared to those who use bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33524] . 
Research Design  and Procedures Overview : The proposed study is a Phase II double -blind, randomized active -
controlled 4-week trial of  approximately [ADDRESS_32947]  3 weeks of assessments (assessments through Visit 
4). Participants  will be randomized with 1:1 allocation to AXS-05 (45 mg Immediate Release DXM  + 105 mg Sustained 
Release BUP) vs. 105 mg Sustained Release BUP , twice daily (BID). Subjects will be instructed to only take [ADDRESS_32948] 3 days. Subjects not completing three weeks of assessments will be replaced to ensure that 60  randomized 
patients (30 per group) complete the study  through the 3 -week Follow -up Assessment Visi t (Visit 4) .  
The dose of AXS -[ADDRESS_32949] and 
Agitation in patients with  Alzheimer’s  Disease.   DXM and BUP doses are FDA approved for other indications and  have 
been fo und to be safe and generally well -tolerated in combination (as AXS -05) in  three Phase I studies to date. 
Medications will be continued for four  weeks in each group . Laboratory testing , including expi[INVESTIGATOR_33525], will occur  at the B aseline  Visit  and each visit  thereafter t o objectively assess the number of 
cigarettes smoked per day  in addition to daily smoking diaries . Additional testing on smoking behavior will include 
abstinence testing during the 7-day Smoking Abstinence T est at the 4-week Follow -up Assessment Visit . Potential  
side effects of AXS-05 and BUP alone will be assessed through repeated survey administration  with  open -ended 
questions  and spontaneous report. Adherence to drug use will be assessed through  Medication Use Dia ries collected 
at each study visit. Urine  drug levels will be collected Visits 2 -5 to allow for correlation of urine  drug leve ls to  the 
number of  cigarettes  smoked  per day (Cotin ine, CO) and side effects. Pre-post drug initiation changes in smoking 
urges, withdrawal, stress, depression, anxiety , motivation and sleep quality will be assessed as potential mediators of 
effect on smoking behavior.

Use of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  The primary considerations for the use of inclusion/exclusion criteria include 
consent (English, age), patient safety (illness, medications, blood tests, pregnancy), and generalizability (willingness 
to quit, c igarette use, drug and alcohol use, psychiatric illness).  
Assessment and Follow -up of Specific Exclusion Criteria:  
If a participant is excluded based on criteria above, the study medical provider will further assess the exclusion 
through medical interview  as needed . If this interview reveals a safety issue for the  excluded individual, the medical 
provider will send a letter to the excluded individual’s primary care provider or seek immediate medical assistance if 
necessary.  
Management of specific exclusio n criteria are detailed below:   
Generalized Anxiety Disorder will be assess using the GAD -713. Scores of 15 or higher indicate severe anxiety, and will 
be exclusionary. If a potential participant scores above a 15 they will be referred to their PCP for further follow -up. In 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  11 addition, the study Physician or PA will generate a letter to the  excluded  individuals  PCP to notify them of the results. 
Suicidality will be assessed using the PHQ -911. A score of >0 on question 9 of the PHQ -9 (“Thoughts that you would be 
better off dead or hurting yourself in some way”) will be exclusionary. If a participant scores >0 on question 9, the 
Physician or PA will be notifie d immediately for further clinical assessment and appropriate referral and follow -up.  
The Audit -C will be used to assess for alcohol use disorder12 during the phone screen . A score of >4 for men or >3 for 
women will be considered positive, and the  potential participant will be excluded from the study.  
Bipolar Disorder will be assessed using the Mood Disorder Qu estionnaire (MDQ)16. A positive screen involves 
answering “Yes” to 7 or more of the 13 items in section 1, “Yes” to section 2, and “Moderate Problem” or “Serious 
Problem ” in section 3. A positive screen will result in further assessment by [CONTACT_33623] -up. If needed, the individual will be given information for the Duke Mental Health Services, 
including their phone number (919 -684-0100).   
Psychotic Disorders will be assessed using the Modified Mini Screen (MMS) Section C17. If the potential participant 
states “Yes” to any of the questions, or there is concern for psychotic disorder in the clinician’s judgement, the 
potential participant will be excluded from the study. The study Physician or PA will assess for appropriate f ollow -up 
and referral. If needed, the individual will be given information for the Duke Mental Health Services, including their 
phone number (919 -684-0100).  
Anorexia and Bulimia will be assessed using the SCOFF Questionnaire18. An answer of “yes” to two or more questions 
will be considered a positive screen. A positive screen will result in further assessment by [CONTACT_33624] -up. If needed, the participant will be given information for the Duke Center for Eating 
Diso rders, including their phone number (919 -668-0397).  
A history of seizure disorder will  be assessed through the Medical History form  (Appendix 2)  in two ways. First, 
participants will ask if they have a diagnosis of a seizure disorder. If the potential part icipant reports “Yes” to a 
diagnosis of seizure disorder, they will be excluded. Secondly, potential participants will be asked if they have ever 
experienced a seizure or seizure -like activity. If the individual  reports “Yes,” the study Physician or PA wil l further 
assess the event and provide additional follow -up and referrals as necessary.  In addition, history of conditions that 
increase the risk for seizure will be assessed through the Medical History form (Appendix 2)   
Potential p articipants will be as sessed for medications that lower seizure threshold via a medication exclusion list, 
found in Appendix 1.  
Assessment of  Potential  Side Effects throughout Study  
During the course of the study, participants will be assessed at each visit on the following par ameters to assess the 
potential for medication side effects: suicidality, psychosis, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, agitation, as well as an 
open -ended question on potential medication side effects.  
Suicidality:  A study drug, Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], can increase the risk of suicidality, so suicidality will be assess at each study visit. 
Participants will be assess for suicidality using the PHQ -9 question 9 (Appendix 3) at each visit after initiation of the 
study drug. If a par ticipant scores >0 on this question, the study clinician will administer the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS). The C -SSRS assesses suicidal ideation, intensity of ideation, and suicidal behavior.  The 
results of the C-SSRS will be used for f urther clinical assessment and follow -up as needed. This follow -up will be 
based on a medical assessment of the  situation, and may include  a referral to mental health services or immediate 
psychiatric evaluation in the Emergency Department if needed.  
Psych osis: Participants will be assessed for psychotic disorders using the MMS Section C (Appendix 20) at each visit 
after initiation of the study drug. If a participant answers “Yes” to any of the items on the MMS Section C, a study 
clinician will  administer  the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)  (Appendix 22) . This  will be used for further clinical 
assessment and follow -up as needed. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is a clinician -administered instrument 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  12 used for assessing positive, negative and af fective symptoms for psychotic disorders over 18 symptom constructs.  A 
study drug, Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], can cause psychosis, so this assessment will be used to assess for emerging or worsening 
symptoms of psychosis.  
Depression: The Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328] -Revised  (CES -D-R) (Appendix 13) is a [ADDRESS_32950] had symptoms of depression (following the DSM -V). A study drug, 
Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], can cause depressive symptoms, so this assessment will be used to assess for emerging or worsening 
symptoms of depression. The sco re will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1003], and a ppropriate follow -up and referral  
will be initiated as needed.  
Anxiety : The State -Trait Anxiety Inventory  (STAI) (Appendix 12)  is a 40 item introspective measure developed to 
assess both trait and state anx iety. A study drug, Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], can cause anxiety, so this assessment will be used to 
assess for emerging or worsening symptoms of anxiety . The study clinician will review the results of the measure and 
arrange a ppropriate follow -up and referral as needed.  
Sleep Quality : The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) (Appendix 15) is a 19 -item scale that was designed to assess 
the quality and patterns of sleep of adults.  A study drug, Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], can cause sleep disturbance, so this assessment 
will be used to asse ss for worsening sleep quality.  This measure will be administered at each study visit to assess for 
changes in sleep quality.  
Agitation : The Brief Agitation Measure  (Appendix 16)  is a 3 -item scale designed to assess a participant’s agitation 
level. A study drug, Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], can cause agitation, so this assessment will be used to assess for emerging or 
worsening symptoms of agitation.  The study clinician will review this measure and  provide further clinical assessment 
and follow -up as needed.  
 
3.5. DURATION OF STUDY   
TIMELINE: Study activities will occur over approximately  14-month perio d. Two and a half  months are allocated for

3.6. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
A detailed Data Analysis is provided in Section 13.  A summary of data analysis procedures includes the following: 
Multilevel Modeling: Given repeated  observations across multiple individuals, many of the analyses in this study will 
be derived from m ultilevel modeling (MLM). Missing Data:  Missing data will be examined to determine whether 
missingness is systematic (i.e. associated with individual baseli ne differences or time -related changes in observed 
variables). An intent -to-treat approach in which subjects lost to follow -up will be counted as non -abstinent will also 
be used to analyze univariate outcomes. An alpha criterion of 0.05 will be used in all  comparisons. Analysis of Study Activities  14 Months

Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  13 Primary Outcome:  The primary study outcome  is an assessment in change in smoking intensity from baseline to 
Week -[ADDRESS_32952] and 3. Num ber of cigarettes smoked per 
day.  To enhance power for our primary outcomes, we will use repeated measures analysis to capture daily entry of 
the number of cigarettes  smoked  per day in smoking diaries. Secondary abstinence outcomes : Here we will i nclude 
change in the number of cigarettes  smoked  per day from baseline to all Follow -up Visits ( Visits 2 -5), with 
confirmation of self -report through  expi[INVESTIGATOR_33529]. We will also assess change in CO and 
cotinine  as independent outcomes and abstinence rates through the [ADDRESS_32953]: The following constructs will be assessed as potential predictors of abstinence: 
demographics (age, gender, race, education), smoking history and hea viness, prior quit attempts,  dependence 
(FTND), urge rating (MPSS), depression (PHQ -9), anxiety (GAD -7), alcohol use (AUDIT -C), drug use (DAST), stress (PSS -
4), and self-efficacy questions . Assessment of potential mediators of primary effect: The following  constructs will be 
assessed to determine whether assignment to  the stud y group is associated with change pre - and post -treatment: 
urge rating (MPSS) , depression  (CES-D), anxiety  (STAI ), withdrawal symptoms (MNWS), stress (PSS -4), sleep quality 
(PSQI) and agitation (BAM) .). Sample Size Calculation: Total sample size required to show differenc es in primary 
outcomes between AXS-05 vs. BUP with 10% downward adjustment in study group outcomes for possibility of 
unexpectedly poor outcome s is N = 60  (completed patients) . Approximately [ADDRESS_32954] three weeks of assessments (Visit 4).     
All analyses will be performed on the Intent -to-Treat group that is defined as all subjects randomized and all 
replacement subjects, if applicable.

Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  15 5. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
5.1. STUDY CONDITION  
1.  Incidence, prevalence, and main causes and concerns :  
Tobacco use is the number one cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US1,2. It causes 480,000 deaths 
per year and is the cause of death in approximat ely two -thirds of all people who smoke2. Since the 1964 Surgeon 
Genera l’s Report on the health effects of smoking19, US smoking r ates have fallen from 42.2%19 to 15.1%20. Many 
smokers  who have been abl e to quit, have already done so using available treatments. This means that t oday’s  
remaining smokers who are unable to quit are an increasingly  treatment -resistant population4. Abstinence rates for 
unassisted quit attempts are less than  5%4 and new , successful treatment  approaches for the current population of 
smokers are urgently needed.   
2.  The current therapeutic or management options :   
Pharmacother apy is the primary  smoking cessation treatment used by [CONTACT_33625], with 29.9% of smokers 
attempting to quit smoking with the use of a medication3. Currently, there are seven FDA approved smoking 
cessation medications including varenicline, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray4. These 
approved medications roughly double the chances of quitting during any given quit a ttempt; efficacy vs. placebo of 
RR=1.7 (nicotine gum) , RR=1.8 (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394])  to RR=2.4 (varenicline)5. Additionally, AXS-05 represents a new drug class 
with effec ts on depression and agitation  (below ) – constructs which are known to play a role maintaining tobacco use 
behavior. The development of a new class of dr ug which impacts tobacco use through reduction of depression 
symptoms and agitation has the potential to impact a large population of smokers who are unable to quit due to 
these affective challenges.  
3.  Explanation of how/why the current options are  inade quate : 
The relatively low  dosing of BUP and DXM used in AXS-05 (DXM IR 45 mg/BUP SR 1 05mg) suggests the potential 
advent of a smoking cessation medication with a low side effect profile and high tolerability. Side effects strongly 
predict a dherence to smoking cessation medications and are highly predictive of smoking cessation outcomes. In one 
study, smokers  adherent to medication  showed 1.8 time s higher abstinence ( p = 0.0001) than non -adherent 
smokers21. Unfortunately, the most commonly prescribed FDA approved smoking cessation medications (Varenicline 
and Nicotine Patch) have fairly high incidence of side effects (bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], nicotine lozenge and gum are better 
tolerated). One study comparing v arenicline vs. placebo found the following side effect incidence rates: nausea 
(28.1% vs. 8.4%), headache (15.5% vs. 12.2%), vivid dreams (10.3% versus 5.5%)22. A meta -analysis23 (N > 177,000) on 
side effects from nicotine replacement (the most commonly us ed smoking cessation medication ) showed the 
following side effect rates vs. placebo (all p < 0.001): Headache (9.7% vs. 4.7), nausea (8.5% vs. 5.1%) , insomnia 
(11.4% vs . 8.0%), skin irritation  – patch  (19.5% vs. 6.9% )23. A study (N=225)24 on nicotine patch adherence (daily use 
for 28 days), found that 64.7% of participants were non -adherent and stopped regular use (30% forgot to use it, 15% 
had side effects, 10% relapsed, 7% financial challenges).  A study (N=662) on nicotine gum adherence (use of 75% of 
prescribed gum) showed that 73.4% were non -adherent, most frequently due to forgetting to use the gum25. A study 
on Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  [ADDRESS_32955] common , but 
discontinuation of Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] 150 mg SR dosing due to side effects was  only 7%26. Developmen t of a new  medication 
class with oral administration, efficacy beyond that of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and a low incidence of side effects  has the 
potential for high -level adoption and  large scale population impact.  
4.  Any relevant treatment issues or controversies :  
AXS-05 has not been used for treatment of tobacco dependence. As such , there are no treatment issues or 
controversies that need to be explored. Because the drug is new for this indication , it is unknown whether the drug 
will lead to a reduction  in smoking in humans. AXS-05 was found to be safe and generally well -tolerated in  three  
Phase 1 trials conducted in over 100 subjects . To date, i n two ongoing “adequate and well -controlled” clinical trials in 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  16 treatment resistant depression and agitation associated with  dementia of the  Alzheimer’s type  blinded study 
medication (AXS -05, BUP or placebo) has been well tolerated. Smoking is a  behavior and there is no reason to think 
that side effects of AXS -05 will be different in smokers than those subjects enrolled in the three completed Phase 1 
studies .  
5. Other concerns related to quali ty of life or treatment deviation due to study condition :  
AXS-[ADDRESS_32956] health benefits. There is no treatment deviation due  to study condition.    
5.2. Study  Drug  
5.2.1.  TYPE OF DRUG   
AXS-05 as used in this study is a fixed -dose combination of dextromethorphan (DXM) immediate release (IR) 45 mg 
and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (BUP) sustained release (SR) 105  mg taken two times daily . Either AXS -05 or BUP (SR) will be dosed 
twice daily ([ADDRESS_32957] 3 days) for 28 days (4 weeks).

5.2.2.  DRUG MECHANISM OF ACTION  
Dextromethorphan Mechanism of Action :  
DXM is a widely used over -the-counter cough 
suppressant with minimal side effects at 
recommended doses (5 -15 mg every 2 hours  or 30 -60 
mg twice per day )27. DXM easily crosses the blood -
brain barrier28. In blood, 65% of DXM is bound to 
carrier proteins, with 35% of DXM in free for m; a 
similar concentration of free DXM (30%)  is found in 
urine  and cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF)29. Once DXM is in 
the CSF  at sufficient concentrations , it binds to the 
following receptor s: α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptor ( nAChR ) is found in the presynaptic terminals 
of neo -cortical neurons that secrete norepi[INVESTIGATOR_33531]30,31. DXM is an efficient α3β4 nAChR  
antagonist, acting independently of the nicotine 
binding site, providing robust (non -competitive) 
inhibition  of the receptor32. The α3β4 nAChR and DXM binding of α3β4 nAChR are associated with reduction in 
physical withdrawal symptoms reduction in nicotine reward -based behavior33, 34;  Sigma -[ADDRESS_32958] significant 
activity at other opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328]38,39. Therapeutic effects of DXM activation of Sigma -1 include an anticonvulsant 
effect37,40, significa nt neuroprotective effects in degenerative brain disease41,42, and antidepressant effects in 
animals43; N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand -gated ion channels that, when activated, r elease 
glutamate (a fast acting excitatory neurotransmitter)44. DXM binds deep inside the NMDA ion channel as a non -
Figure 1: Dextromethorphan Mechanism of Action  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  17 competitive receptor antagonist45. Potentially important for addic tion recovery, NMDA receptor activation is involved 
in neuroplasticity, and activates neurons involved in cue -based learning and memory formation46,47,48; Serotonin  is a 
monoamine with substantial effect on regulation of mood in humans. Increasing synaptic serotonin by [CONTACT_2329] a 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor is the primary mechanism of many antidepressants. There are 14 known serotonin 
transporters that control serotonin levels at various sites in the brain49. DXM is a non -selective serotonin transporter 
reuptake inhibitor (inhibits all known serotonin transporters) leading to increased serotonin levels in the brain50 and 
co-administration of D XM and  the metabolic inhibitor quinidine has previously been shown to reduce  depressive 
symptoms in treatment resistant depression , agitation associated with Alzheimer’s  type dementia, and 
pseudobulbar affect (PBA) ; Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] - During nicotine withdrawal, an aspect of the withdrawal syndrome is 
related to low levels of synaptic norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]51. Low norepi[INVESTIGATOR_33532], 
difficulty concentrating, and lack of productivity52. DXM is a norep inephrine reuptake inhibitor, and increases 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_33533]53. The following are DXM concentrations within the CSF required to activate each 
receptor: α3β4 nAChR  = IC50 of 700nM54; Sigma -1 receptor = 400nM53; NMDA  Concentrations of DXM necessary for 
NMDA blockade  = 780 nM55.  Serotonin receptors = 240 nM56 norep inephrine (α1D receptor) 830 nM29. 
Unfortunatel y, DXM at FDA approved doses leads to CSF concentrations (4-600nM) that only activate Serotonin and 
Sigma -1 receptors, but not α3β4 nAChR, NMDA, or α1D, which appear to be critical to its role in reducing nicotine 
self-administration. Lower levels of DXM i n the brain are a result of DXM metabolism  (Figure 1)57. DXM is metabolized 
via the CYP2D6 pathway (Cytochrome p450) to dextro rphan. DXM metabolism occurs rapi[INVESTIGATOR_33534], resulting in roughl y 95% of DXM being metabolized into dextro rphan. Dextro rphan 
does not easily pass the blood -brain barrier and shows  minimal activity in the brain. One way to greatly increase the 
CSF concentration and central activity of DXM is to administer DXM with a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33535] a potent 
CYP2D6 inhibitor at low (non -therapeutic) doses58. Interestingly, 5 -10% of Caucasians have a homozygous deficiency 
of the CYP2D6 enzyme and metabolize DXM to Dextro rphan more slowly , showing higher CSF levels of DXM59.

5.2.3.  RATIONALE FOR USE OF STUDY DRUG  IN THIS PARTICULAR SUPPORTIVE 
CARE  CONTEXT  
Rational for using combination AXS-05 in Human Smokers:  AXS-[ADDRESS_32959] on tobacco use. 
AXS-05 shows considerable promise as a potential smoking cessation treatment of from a pharmacologic perspective 
of receptor binding. Additionally, AXS-05 is being evaluated in clinical trials for  treatment -resistant depressi on and 
agitation associated with Alzheimer’s type dementia  and both depression and agitation have been shown to be 
associated with relapse in smokers.  AXS-[ADDRESS_32960] FDA approval of AXS -05 as a treatment for tobacco dependence.   
The proposed dose and duration of use of AXS-05 for this study , is supported by [CONTACT_33626] (Section 5.2.5  
Clinical Experience).    
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  18 5.2.4.   PRE-CLINICAL EXPERIENCE OF STUDY DRUG  
Pre-clinical experience (animal studies)  have been conducted on DXM and BUP  (the components of AXS -05).  A 
description of these pre -clinical studies on DXM and BUP may be found within the Investigators Brochure  Version 4.0 
[IND 129633] Section 4 : Nonclinical Studies  included in this application. This includes information on non -clinical 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, carcinogenicity, genetic toxicity, and reproductive and developmental 
toxicity.   
Furthermore, a 2016 study at our center demonstrated that oral DXM administration significantly decreased nicotine 
self-adm inistration of rats in a dose -dependent manner. Across the DXM dosing, which ranged from 0 to 30mg/kg, 
motor function and food intake did not show significant changes.   
5.2.5.   CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
Clinical experience  with AXS-05 and with the control drug (BUP) may be found within the Investigators Brochure  
Version 4.0 [IND 129633] Section 5: Effects in Humans,  included in this application.  This includes information on 
human pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, elimination, drug interactions, clinical eff icacy, and clinical 
safety.  
AXS-05 has been found to be  safe and generally well -tolerated in three  completed Phase 1 trials  which enrolled over 
100 healthy volunteers . In two ongoing blinded “adequate and well -controlled” clinical trials , blinded study 
med ication was well tolerated (AXS -05, BUP or placebo). AXS-05 is being evaluated under IND124813 for treatment 
resistant depre ssion (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) and under IND 129633  for Agitation associated with 
Alzheimer’s Disease (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).  
5.3. STUDY PURPOSE/RATIONALE  
1.  Experience with similar supportive care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (in term s of efficacy and tolerability): This is the first time that 
AXS-[ADDRESS_32961] on smoking. Abstinence rates for unassisted quit attempts are less than  5%4, 
and new approaches to successful treatment of our current population of smokers are urgently needed.  
Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment used by [CONTACT_33627], with 29.9% of smokers 
attempting to quit smoking with the use of a med ication3. Currently, there are seven FDA approved smoking 
cessation medications including varenicline, bupropio n, nicotine patch, gum, lozenge, inhaler, and nasal spray4. 
Approved medications vs. placebo roughly double the chances of quitting during an y given quit attempt; efficacy vs. 
placebo of RR=1.7 (nicotine gum) to RR=2.4 (varenicline)5.  Most of the medications used for smoking are moderately 
well tolerated.  One study comparing v arenicline vs. placebo found the following incidence rates: nausea (28.1% vs. 
8.4%), headache (15.5% vs. 12.2%), vivid drea ms (10.3% versus 5.5%)22. A meta -analysis23 (N > 177,000) on side 
effects from nicotine replacement (the most commonly used smoking cessation medications) showed the following 
rates vs. placebo (all p < 0.001): Headache (9.7% vs. 4.7), nausea (8.5% vs. 5.1%) , insomnia (11.4% vs. 8.0%), sk in 
irritation  – patch  (19.5% vs. 6.9% ), mouth soreness  – gum/lozenge (5.4% vs. 2.9%)23. A study on (N=225)24 nicotine 
patch adherence (daily use for 28 days), found that 64.7% of participants were non -adherent and stopped regular use 
(30% forgot to use it, 15% had side effects, 10% relapsed, 7% financial challenges). A study (N=662) on nicotine gum 
adherence (us ed of 75% of prescribed gum) showed that 73.4% were non -adherent, most frequently due to 
forgetting to use the gum25. A study on bup ropi[INVESTIGATOR_33540] (twice daily use x 6 weeks) showed non -adherence of 
only 37%61. Thus, most of the FDA appro ved smoking cessation medications, except perhaps bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], have 
significant associated side effects and problems with adherence for various reasons. Development of an orally 
administered medication (like bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]) with a low incidence of side effects ha s the potential for comparatively 
high -level adherence and subsequently higher associated smoking abstinence rates.  
2.  Description of how the study therapy is different from current treatment paradigms, and how this difference 
might help meet an unmet supportive care need:   The novel use of DXM for smoking cessation promises the 
potential approval of a new class of drugs in addition to current options for smoking cessation. The addition of 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  19 bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33541]. Usefulness of this drug in smokers would potentially open the door to further exploration of drugs with effects 
on sigma -1, NMDA, or α3β4 nAChR.   
3. What the potential benefits are for this supportive care intervention :  This study is designed to produce evidence 
that AXS-05 (primarily DXM) is significantly more effective than  bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33542] a spontaneous reduction 
in smoking. Additionally, an assessment of mechanism is provided to estimate the impacts of known physiologic 
activities. Each of these inquiries is designed to guide future study in a fully powered trial through the Strategic 
Alliance funding mechanism. The study is promising because DXM has shown to reduce nicotine self -administratio n 
in animals and AXS-[ADDRESS_32962] 
because AXS-05 could easily be made available  to thousands of smokers due to  an existing pharmaceutical 
infrastructure with large scale p roduction and national distribution.

Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  21 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. STUDY DESIGN  
1.  Specifics about study type:  The proposed study is a double -blind, randomized active -controlled  4-week  trial of 
[ADDRESS_32965] 60 randomized smokers’ complete assessments at study visit 4. Smokers will be 
randomized with 1:1 allocation to AXS-05 (45 mg Immediate Release DXM + 105 mg  Sustained Release BUP) vs. 105 
mg Sustained Release BUP. Medications will be  dosed  twice  daily ([ADDRESS_32966] 3 days) and continued for four 
weeks in each group with laboratory testing at baseline and then once per week to assess the number of cigare ttes 
smoked per day with objective confirmation through assessment of expi[INVESTIGATOR_33543] (CO) and 
salivary  cotinine. Additional testing on smoking behavior will include abstinence testing during a 7-day abstinence 
test (starting at midnight aft er the 3 -Week Follow -up Study Visit and ending at the 4 -Week Follow -up Study Visit ). 
Potential drug side effects will be assessed through repeated survey administration and spontaneous report. 
Adherence to drug use will be assessed through Medication Use d iaries . Urine  drug levels will be collected at Week 1 -
4 Follow up Visit s to allow for correlation of urine  drug leve ls to  the number of  cigarettes  smoked  per day (Cotin ine, 
CO) and side effects. B ecause DXM and BUP have independently  been shown to impact smoking urges, withdrawal, 
stress, depression, and anxiety, changes in these  psychiatric variables will be assessed throug hout the trial and 
evaluated as  potential mediators of effect on smoking behavior.   
2.  Design and supporting r ationale :  
  
Selection of Subjects  
Recruitment:  Subjects will be recruited through the Duke  Center for Smoking Cessation (CSC) using standard 
recruitment procedures including television, radio, web -based  (ex: Facebook, Instagram, Craigslist, JobFinder, 
StudyKik, etc.) , print -based media  (ex: JobFinder, etc.) , and flyers.  All ads  will feature a phone number and contact 
[CONTACT_33629]. This study will also recruit 
participants through the  Duke Primary Care Research Consortium (PCRC). Patients will be contact[CONTACT_33630]. Authorization has been provided by [CONTACT_33631], which will provide access to smok ers who have consented to be contact[CONTACT_33632]. The 
Research Consortium manages multiple studies to avoid conflict between studies and will provide access to a few DPC 
Clinics. DPC includes a network of [ADDRESS_32967] as 
being “current smokers” will be available for contact [CONTACT_33633]. Using a regularly generated report, research staff 
will mail these patients letters from their medical providers that describe the study. The letter will also include a phone 
num ber if the patient does not want to be contact[CONTACT_33634]. Research staff will call the patients that do not 
opt-out and describe the study. If they are interested and meet inclusion criteria, the research staff will schedule them 
for a screening vi sit at the Duke Center for Smoking Cessation (CSC) (central study site).  In addition, p articipants will 
be recruited using IRB-approved flyers placed around the Triangle Area (Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill). Examples of 
locations where flyers may be plac ed include: grocery stores, churches, retail stores (ex: Walmart, Target, etc.), 
restaurants, banks, bus stops and gas stations. In addition, this study will recruit participants through the Digital Signage 
program occurring throughout DUH, Duke South Clin ics, Duke Medicine Pavilion, Duke Cancer Center and other clinical 
facili ties at Duke University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Digital signage will also be used in other locations throughout the Triangle Area 
(Durham, Raleigh and Chapel Hill).  Futhermore, p otential subjects w ill be recruited through  pre-screen failures from 
other studies at the CSC. There are currently several studies recruiting smokers from communities in and around 
Durham, North Carolina through newspaper flyers, internet and TV advertisements, and word -of-mouth. If potential 
subjects fail to meet the pre -screening study requ irements for these studies (Pro00072077 , Pro00089760, 
Pro00042277 ) at the CSC, but are still interested in research, they will be routed to a CTA to be pre -screened for this 
study over th e phone. If potential subjects meet the pre -screening study requirements and are still interested in 
participation, they will attend a physical screening session at the Duke CSC, located at [ADDRESS_32968], 
Durham, NC   [ZIP_CODE].  At the screening on -site visit, a CTA will meet with the patient in a private area of the CSC (consent 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  22 room) and provide the patient with the Study Consent Form for review.  Finally, web -based recruitment methods will 
use a REDCap Survey that includes both the phone script as well as the screening questions . This survey will allow 
participants to complete the phone consent process immediately. Incoming survey responses will be reviewed  by a 
Technician at the Duke Center for Smoking Cessation (CSC). Potential participants who pass the phone consent will be 
called after review  to schedule a screening visit. Potential participants may also be called if survey responses require 
additional r eview or clarification. Survey responders who do not qualify for the study will not be called .  
CSC subject recruitment in the past has shown demographic distribution outlined in Table 2. We will recruit smokers 
into this study who state that they are willing to attempt to quit smoking for at least 7 days. Evaluation of this 
population should allow for an unencumbered assessment of pharmacological effec ts of the drug on smoking behavior.  
Table 2: Duke Center for Smoking C essation Recruitment Population  
Female  51.1%  
Mean Age  46.3  
White  49.2%  
Black  44.9%  
Educ. > high school  48.4%  
Mental Illness  30.5%  
Planned number of subjects:  A total  of approximately 120 subjects will be consented with 66 subjects being 
randomized and enrolled with the goal of having  60 randomized  subjects (30 per arm) complete  assessments through 
study visit 4.  With expected attrition of  10% between  enrollment and study completion, we expect to  enroll 
approximately  66 participants to obtain 60 completers  (completer is defined as having completed assessments 
through study visit 4) .  
Randomization: Subjects will be randomized with stratification by [CONTACT_33635]  
(assessment of nicotine dependence) and gender to ensure roughly equal distribution of these characteristics 
between the two groups.   
Phone Screening, Screening Visit, and Informed Consent: People who smoke who c all in to the CSC will be screened 
by [CONTACT_32216] a Clinical Research Specialist . If they pass phone -screening  criteria , they will be scheduled for a 
Screening Visit at the Duke Center for Smoking Cessation. At the Screening Visit,  after obtaining informed co nsent 
and signing the Study Consent Form,  they will complete several screening questionnaire s (PHQ -9, GAD -7. FTND, 
MMS, MDQ, SCOFF) , medical history  and personal information forms , a physical exam, CO breath testing, EKG, blood 
test, urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test (if applicable). If they pass criteria at the Screening Visit, they will be 
scheduled for the Baseline Assessment Visit. Patient will be assigned a unique screening number and a screening log 
will be maintained.  
Baseline Assessment  Visit:  At the Baseline Assessment Visit, participants will perform CO breath testing , urine 
pregnancy test (if applicable) , and a detailed review of systems . If cleared they will  be enrolled in the study (assigned 
a Study ID enrollment number) and randomi zed to either AXS-05 (study group) or Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (control group).  
Participants will then receive the Baseline Questionnaires (see below) as well as Baseline expi[INVESTIGATOR_33544]. 3.  Drug Dose : Subject s will be randomized with 1:1 allocat ion to AXS-05 (45 mg Immediate Release 
DXM + 105 mg Sustained Release BUP) vs. 105 mg Sustained Release BUP. Medications will be provided to 
participants at the Baseline Study Visit and continued for four  weeks in each group .   
Appointment Reminders: Participants will be provided with the option to receive text message appointment 
reminders. This is discussed at two different time points. At the Phone Screen, participants provide verbal consent via 
phone. If they pass the phone s creen and are scheduled for their Screening Visit, participants are asked if they would 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  23 like to receive an appointment reminder via text. If the participant “opts in”, then they are asked to confirm their 
phone number and cell phone provider. They will the n be sent up to two different text message appointment 
reminders —three days prior and one day prior. Each message will ask them to reply to confirm their appointment. If 
they confirm, no more text messages are sent. If they are unable to attend, they are a sked to call the Center for 
Smoking Cessation line to reschedule. Once the participant attends their Screening Visit, they are asked to sign the 
Adult Consent form, which will again ask if they would like to receive text message appointment reminders (in t he 
same fashion as discussed above). Participants can opt out at any time but must verbally convey this request to 
research staff or submit it in writing. All standard messaging rates will apply to the participant. Messages will 
originate via Microsoft out look, which has been approved by [CONTACT_33636]. 
Participants will be informed that because text messaging does not provide a completely secure and confidential 
means of communication, please do not text message if you w ish to communicate in private.  
Study Group  Dosing :  Dextromethorphan Immediate Release 45mg + Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33545] 105 mg  
Provided by [CONTACT_33637] a single  tablet  containing  both drugs  
Dose Timing: For the first three days, take one tablet in the morning on an empty stomach (one hour prior to the 
morning meal or two hours after the morning meal). Thereafter take one tablet two times per day, on an empty 
stomach, at least 8 hours apart and 1 hour prior to a meal, or 2 hours after a meal.  
Control Gro up: Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33545] 105 mg  
Provided by [CONTACT_33637] a single tablet  
Dose Timing: For the first three days, take one tablet in the morning on an empty stomach (one hour prior to the 
morning meal or two hours after the morning meal). Thereafter take  one tablet two times per day, on an empty 
stomach, at least 8 hours apart and 1 hour prior to a meal, or 2 hours after a meal.  
Packaging  of Medications :  Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33546] a way as to match study 
group medication appearance and sch edule. The Clinical Tri al Material s Manager  will package all medications such 
that AXS-[ADDRESS_32969] on pages 9 and 10.  
Use of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: The primary considerations for the use of inclusion/exclusion criteria include 
consent (English, age), patie nt safety (illness, medications, blood tests, pregnancy), and generalizability (willingness 
to quit, cigarette use, drug and alcohol use, psychiatric illness).  
5.  Number of subjects : Sample size will be N= 60 with pre -established randomization of numbers  from 1 -60 such 
that 30 are allocated to study group and 30 are allocated to controls. Participants who drop out and do not complete 
assessment through 3-week follow -up visit (Visit 4) will be replaced to reach a total of 60 study randomized  
completers and based on a 10% drop -out rate between enrollment and study completion, we are expecting to enroll 
approximately 70 subjects  after having consented up to 150.  
6.  Number of centers :  The study will be conducted at Duke Center for Smoking cessation (one site).   
7.  Treatment duration:  The study treatment and assessment duration is provided in the table  below. The study 
contains a  Screening Visit followed by a Baseline Visit and four  follow -up visit s (Table 3 below).

will complete the Brief Psychiatric  Rating Scale (BPRS) with a clinician.   
Special Tests  
[ADDRESS_32972]: At the Visit 4 , subjects  are asked not to smoke at all for the next 7 days. They will be paid an 
additional $ [ADDRESS_32973] using self -reported 
total abstinence during the period with biochemical  confirmation  via expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514] (CO) breath test < 
7ppm (96.0% sensitivity and 93.3% specificity)72 and salivary cotinine with  a cutoff of < 13 ng/ml to define abstinence 
(sensitivity, 86.5%; specificity, 95.9%)73.  
Participant Compensation: Participants will receive the following compensation for attending visits and completion  
of various aspects of the study.   
Screening Visit = $0  
Baseline Visit  (Visit 1)  = $20  
1 Week Follow -up Visit  (Visit 2)  = $30

Use of ClinCards for compensation :  Participants will be compensated using ClinCards to decrease attrition in the 
study. ClinCards are preloaded debit cards, on which credit can be added by [CONTACT_464]. This decreases the length of 
time until participants are compensated by [CONTACT_33638] p ay a check 
cashing fee. The Study Coordinator or C linical Research Specialist  will provide each participant with a ClinCard at the 
Baseline Visit and will add the compensation to the card. After approval by [CONTACT_33639] & Reimbursement, the participant 
will have  the money loaded onto the card.   8. Brief Agitation Measure (3 items)   X X X X X

BUP and 45 mg DX M (list provided in the Appendix 1 0). If part icipants  are found to  have any of these symptoms they 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_33640], whether it may have been 
caused  by [CONTACT_33641],  and whether it requires dose adjustment or discontinuation of the drug.    
7.1.3.  MISSED DOSES  
Missed doses of medications will  not be replaced. There will be no “catch up” for missed doses. We will capture data 
on missed doses through the medication adherence  diary.   
7.1.4.  CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_5165]  
A medication list is provided for medications which are contraindicated in the study (see Appendix 1 ). Participants 
will be asked to report the use of any new medications during the study , including medications containing 
Dextromethorphan . If new medicatio ns are started, the study physician or study medical provider will assess whether 
or not the participant must be removed from the study.   
7.1.5.  STUDY DRUG BLINDING  
The study is double blinded such that participants, research assistants, and the study physician (each of whom have 
contact [CONTACT_20688]) are unaware of group allocations. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_33549] (Medication X vs. Medication Z) through the Clinical Trial Materials (CTM) manager at the Duke 
Center  for Smoking Cessation . The Clinical Research Coordinator (CRC ), who oversees operations and has no contact 
[CONTACT_20688], will be aware of participant group allocation. Emergency un -blinding procedures are described in 
11.3   
7.1.6.  RANDOMIZATION  
Prior to th e study start date, a stratified (gender and FTND score) randomization list will be generated through the 
REDCap Randomization Module74 for a sample of 60 with 1:[ADDRESS_32977] will be accessed sequentially as each 
participant is enrolled. Patients not completing three weeks o f assessments (Visit 4) in this study will be replaced to 
previous randomized treatment group and will not be randomized.   
7.2. RATIONALE FO R SELECTION OF DOSE, REGIMEN, AND TREATMENT DURATION  
 A dosing regimen of DXM IR 45 mg combined with BUP SR 105 mg, twice -a-day, is utilized in this study because of 
the following: 1) it is believed that sufficient and sustained levels of DXM in the CNS will be obta ined  and 2) there is 
preliminary evidence that the proposed dose of AXS -05 for 28 days will be safe based on the three completed Phase 
1 studies and two ongoing Phase 2/[ADDRESS_32978] completed 4 of the 5 study visits.   
7.5. EARLY STUDY TERMINATION  
This study can be terminated at any time for any reason by [CONTACT_978] -sponsor. If this occurs, all subjects on study should 
be notified as soon as possible. Additional procedures and/or follow up should occur in accordance with Section 10.6 , 
which describes the procedure for prematurely withdrawn patients.

sheet  as well as within the blinded study medication dispensing log.  
8.5.   COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
The CTM Manager  will maintain an un -blinded inventory log only accessible to study team members who are not 
blinded, which will record date and amount dispensed of study drug(s) for every study visit, as well as the study and  
visit number. The l og will contain a section that “counts ” up and down the total inventory of each study drug as items 
are added and subtracted.  Separately, a blinded inventory log will be co -maintained by [CONTACT_33645], which will detail for every study visit the: date/time o rdered, date prepared, initials of individuals who 
conducted preparation, subject number, visit number, days of medication included, date received by [CONTACT_33646], initial s of study technician who received study drug s, date dispensed to subject, date s tudy drug(s) 
returned to the CTM Manager  and the initial s  of study technician who returned study drug s to CTM Man ager. 
8.6.   DISPOSAL AND DESTRUCTION  
The CTM Manager  will dispose of unused study drug(s) by [CONTACT_33647], which are collected by [CONTACT_33648] (waste

to quit, cigarette use, drug and alcohol use, psychiatric illness).   
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  30 10. TRIAL PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
Overview of Assessments : Medications will be continued for four  weeks in each group with laboratory testing at 
baseline and then once per week to assess the number of cigarettes smoked per day with objective confirmation via 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_33543] (CO) and salivary  cotinine at each visit. Additional testing on smoking behavior will 
include abstinence testing during a 1 week  “practice quit” abstinence test  (performed starting midnight after the 3 
Week Follow -up visit). Potential drug side effects will be assesse d through repeated survey administration and 
spontaneous report. Adherence to drug use will be assessed through Medication Use Diaries . Urine  drug levels will be 
collected at Visits 2 -5 to allow for correlation of urine  drug leve ls to the number of cigaret tes smoked  per day 
(Cotin ine, CO) and side effects. B ecause combination DXM and BUP have independently  been shown to impact 
smoking urges, withdrawal, stress, depression, and anxiety, changes in these  psychiatric variables will be assessed 
throug hout the t rial and evaluated as  potential mediators of effect on smoking behavior . All study visits (Visits 2, 3,  4, 
and 5) should be completed within +/ - [ADDRESS_32980]:  Starting at midnight after the 3  Week Follow -up Visit, s ubjects  will be  asked not to 
smok e at all for the following 7 days,  and will be  paid an additional $ [ADDRESS_32981] using self -reported total abstinence during the p eriod with biochemical 
confirmation  via expi[INVESTIGATOR_33552] (CO) breath test < 7ppm (96.0% sensitivity and 93.3% specificity)72 and 
salivary cotinine with  a cutoff of < 13 ng/ml to define abstinence (sensitivity, 86.5%; specif icity, 95.9%)73.  
10.1.  SCREENING EXAMINATION  
The screeni ng examination will take place during the screening visit. Informed C onsent will be signed by [CONTACT_33650] e physical  exam and blood testing is performed. Subject data to be collect ed at the Screening 
Visit  include s demographic information, contact [CONTACT_3031],  medical history,  smoking history, review of systems 
(ROS), as well as assessments for depressio n (PHQ -9), anxiety (GAD -7), nicotine dependence (FTND), psychotic and 
mood disorders (MMS and MDQ) and eating disorders (SCOFF). In addition, a physical exam, EKG, blood testing for 
CBC, CMP,  A1C level , saliva testing for cotinine , urine drug screen , and urine pregnancy test  will be done .   
Phone Screening Procedures  
The CRS will conduct phone screens to verify that potential subjects fit the basic inclusion criteria for this particular 
study.  The CRS will be familiar with the IRB -approved study protocol, informed consent form, and  phone script for 
the study. The CRS will be responsible for scheduling physical screens, documenting on the phone screen forms, and 
providing directions and appointment reminders for th ose callers that fit the inclusion criteria.  Each potential subject 
will be given a brief description of the study to assess eligibility and interest. An IRB -approved phone script will be 
followed while conducting the phone screen. During the phone screen, the CRS will use the AUDIT -C (Appendix 28) as 
one way to verify if po tential subjects fit the basic inclusion criteria. In addition, the CRS will ask potential subjects if 
they are willing to be smoke -free for [ADDRESS_32982] will be called up to three times and/or have three 
detailed messages left. If a subj ect is not contact[CONTACT_21116] a message is not left after two calls he/she will not be 
considered further for participation in the study. If the CRS leaves three messages for the potential subject and that 
subject does not call back, then no further attempts at  contact [CONTACT_33651] -establishes 
contact.  Participants will also be asked if they would like to receive text message reminders. If they opt in, phone 
number and cell phone carrier will be recorded. Participants will be infor med that standard messaging rates will 
apply and be their responsibility. They can choose to opt out at any time. Two appointment reminders will be sent 
three days prior and one day prior and they will be asked to reply to confirm their appointment.  
Once a subject has successfully completed the phone screening process and is eligible for a physical screening, the 
CRS will then schedule the appointment during the study Physician/Physician Assistant’s specific work hours. The 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  31 physical screening appointments will be entered on the Outlook calendar; changes to appointments, such as 
cancellations and rescheduled visits should be documented on the calendar. It will be the responsibility of the CRS to 
check the calendar on a regular basis to ensure pr oper scheduling and preparation for these visits. The CRS should 
mail or e -mail an appointment notification letter and driving directions to the potential subject as soon as possible 
after completing the phone screen. If the subject does not want to provid e a mailing address or e -mail address, then 
the CRS will be responsible for giving driving directions and instructions via telephone. The Preliminary Contact [CONTACT_33652] a report containing the potential subject’s preliminary phone contact [CONTACT_33653] (if the phone s creen is conducted using 
Access) will be completed by [CONTACT_33654].  
Screening Visit Procedures  
After granting their informed consent, potential subjects will be given the HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices  and sign 
an Ackno wledgement of Receipt Form . They will also complete a  demographics form  (Appendix 25) , contact 
[CONTACT_33655]  (Appendix 26) , medical histo ry form  and smoking history form. In addition, they will complete the 
ROS, PHQ -9, GAD -7, FTND , MMS, MDQ and SCOFF Qu estionnaire,  and will have their blood pressure, pulse,  weight, 
height,  temperature, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_33553]. Subjects will provide blood (maximum of 20mL  for tests to 
measure general health ), and urine for urinalysis and illicit drug testing. Women of  childbearing potential will also 
have a urine pregnancy test. The study physician or PA will perform a physical examination and an EKG. The 
screening visit will last approximately two hours.  They will be asked to complete a Cigarette Use Diary with the 
number of cigarettes they smoke from the day of the screening visit to Visit 1.   
Blood and urine specimens will be sent to LabCorp for processing.  The results of laboratory blood and urine tests will 
not routinely be given to participants to send or be sent to their physician to include in their medical record ; 
however, if the subject’s lab results are outside the acceptable range for participation in the study, the Physician/PA 
will send the subject a medical exclusion letter and a copy of the lab results. P articipants who are accepted in the 
study but need medical follow -up due to minor abnormalities in lab results will also be informed by [CONTACT_33656]/PA. A copy of the laboratory results will be included with the letter, which will also indicat e that the 
condition does not interfere with his/her participation in the study . If the participant does not appear for the 
Screening Visit within [ADDRESS_32983] study visit  (also referred to as Baseline Visit) will take place approximately [ADDRESS_32984] (if they are of child 
bearing potential ) to provide greater assurance that th is eligibility criteria h as not changed . Subjects will complete 
baseline questionnaires and tests and will be randomized to AXS-05 or Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. Baseline questionnaires include : 
Recent Smoking Question naire, MPSS -2, MNWS, PSS-4, STAI, CES -D, PSQI and mCEQ . Participants will also complete  
expi[INVESTIGATOR_33554] , heart rate  and weight  measured.  
Subjects will initially be given a 12-day supply of study medica tions . This includes [ADDRESS_32985] until 
the next study visit (all study visits are 1 week apart) and an additional 5 days of medications to allow for the 
possibility of a missed visit and the need to reschedule within 5 days of the missed visit. Participants will receive 
verbal and written instructions on how to take them.  At follow up visits, participants will be given enough 
medications so that their total supply allows for 1 week + 5 days in case of a missed visit.  At t he Week -3 Follow Up 
Visit  (Visit 4) , participants will be provided enough  medication  to continue to  the final day of medication use . 
(Subjects will be called within three days after the first day of treatment to make sure the medicati ons are being used 
as directed ). 
Subjects will also be given diaries to record medication use , irritability , urges , and the number of cigarettes smoked 
each day and will be instructed to return the diaries at the next visit. They will also be asked to return any unused

not blinded will  handl e the delivery of the urine samples to LabCorp. Only urine samples from those randomized into 
the AXS -05 arms will be sent to LabCorp for DXM testing.   Because only stud y subjects and not controls will be tested 
for urine DXM, Lab Corp will be instructed to send urine DXM results to the attention of the CRC.  The CRC will keep 
the results of the DXM testing private and secure so that blinded personnel do not see it. The C RC will make the urine 
DXM results available at the end of the study once the blind is removed.  
Subjects will also complete a Medications Side Effects Log and discuss any side effects with Physician or PA  at the 
next visit . Subjects will be given a supply  of study medications to use for one week  (+ 5 days in case of a missed visit) . 
Subjects will also be given diaries to record medication use, irritability , urges, and the number of cigarettes smoked 
each day and will be instructed to return the diaries at the next visit. Participants will be asked to bring all remaining 
medications to every visit.  Remaining medications will be reconciled with medication use data in participant diaries.  
Participants will be instructed not to “double dose” and not to take m edications to “catch up,” but only to take 
medications at specified times ([ADDRESS_32986] and 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_33556]).  At the end of the study,  any unused 
medications will be  collected and destroyed.

aversive  effects of smoking. It will be administered at the 1 week, 2 week, 3 week and 4 week -follow -up visits. The 
mCEQ can be found in Appendix 24.  
10.7.27.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS (ROS)  
The Review of systems  (ROS)  is a list of possible symptoms covering the organ systems. The ROS will be administered 
at the screening visit as part of the medical evaluation to assess for any current symptoms a potential participant  is 
experiencing. It can be found in Appendix 27.  
10.7.28.  AUDIT -C 
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test -C is a three -item questionnaire used to screen for people with alcohol use 
disorders.  A score of 4  or more  for men or 3  or more  for women will be considered  positive,  and will require 
physician discretion to determine if an active alcohol use disorder is present. If it is determined by a clinician that an 
active alcohol use disorder  is present, the potential participant will be excluded from the study. . The A UDIT -C will be 
asked during the phone screen.  It can be found in Appendix 28.  
 
 
 
Version : 02/05/[ADDRESS_33000] or 
evaluation of study assessments, whether an AE or SAE has occurred.  
11.1.  ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject receiving stud y therapy and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. For this protocol, the definition of AE also includes 
worsening of any pre -existing medical condition. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended or 
worseni ng sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use 
of study therapy  that may or may not be related to use of the study  therapy. Abnormal laboratory findings without 
clinical significance (based on the PI’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs. But laboratory value changes that 
require therapy or adjustment in prior therapy  are considered adverse events.  
From the time t he subject is randomized  through the End of Study visit (as defined in Section 10.3 ), all AEs must be 
recorded in the subject medical record and a dverse events case report form.  
AEs will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 4.0. If CTCAE grading does not exist for an AE, the severity of the 
AE will be graded as mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), life -threatening (4), or fatal (5).  
Attribution of AEs will be indicated as follows:  
- Definite:  The AE is clearly related to the study therapy  
- Probably:  The AE is likely related to the study therapy  
- Possible:  The AE may be related to the study therapy  
- Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to  the study therapy  
- Unrelated:  The AE is clearly NOT related to the study therapy  
11.1.1.  AES OF SPECIAL INTEREST  
Adverse Events related to AXS-[ADDRESS_33001] participation, whether 
the AE was resolved, and any other action taken.   
11.2.  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An AE is considered “serious” if in the opin ion of the investigator it is one of the following outcomes:  
• Fatal  
• Life-threatening  
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• A medically significant condition (defined as an event that compromises subject safety or may require 
medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the three outcomes above)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption to conduct normal life functions  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  39 11.2.1.  REPORTING OF SAES 
Life-threatening (grade 4 or 5) SAEs, deaths, and unknown reactions or unexpected events that occur in the course of 
any patient’s treatment of study (from the time of consent) or within [ADDRESS_33002] protocol. The initial report for each SAE or death should include at minimum  the following information:  
• Protocol # and title  
• Patient initials, study identification number, sex, age  
• Date the event occurred  
• Description of SAE  
• Description of patient’s condition  
• Indication whether the patient remains of study  
• Causality or causal relationship  
De-identified source documentation (i.e. discharge notes) m ust be sent with the SAE Report Form. Follow -up 
information including severity, action taken, concomitant medications, and outcome should be communicated to 
Duke as soon as possible using the same forms mentioned above.  
As soon as an investigator becomes a ware of an AE that m eets the definition of serious:  
• The Study Coordinator  will submit to Axsome Therapeutics or designee within 24 hours of Investigator’s 
awareness, even if it is not felt to be drug related  
• The investigator agrees to provide supplementary information requested by [CONTACT_33661] [INVESTIGATOR_33565] (DUHS) Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) office, NIDA, and FDA.  
SAEs will b e reported to the DUHS IRB using the following timelines:  
• 24 hours – for an unanticipated study -related death  
• 1 week (5 business days) – for an unanticipated problem that is a serious adverse event  
• 2 weeks (10 business days) – for an unanticipated problem that does not meet the criteria of a serious adverse 
event  
SAEs will be reported to the NIDA Serious Adverse Event Tracking and Reporting System (SAETRS) within [ADDRESS_33003]. Davis, the study PI i s responsible for reporting the serious adverse event to the FDA in 
accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. Any SAE that is possibly related and unexpected will be reported to the FDA no later 
than 15 calendar days upon noti fication of the event.  The FDA will be notified of any unexpected fatal or life -
threatening suspected adverse reactions no later than 7 calendar days after notification . This will be done by [CONTACT_33662].  
• These reports are to be filed utilizing t he Form FDA 3500 A (MedWatch Form) completed by [CONTACT_20234]/DCI . 
• The final MedWatch Form must be submitted by [CONTACT_33663].  
11.3.  EMERGENCY UN -BLINDING OF INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT  
The Clinical Research Coordinator will not be blinded to the treatment. The Principle Investigator as well as the 
Clinical Research Specialist and statistician will be blinded. In the case that Emergency un -blinding is required, the 
Version : 02/05/[ADDRESS_33004] information for un -blinding will be the email and cell phone number of Leah Thomas , the study 
CRC: [EMAIL_523] , [PHONE_529] .   
11.4.  OTHER REPORTABLE INFORMATION  
Other reportable information including pregnancy, development of disease , or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33566] -study related 
causes will be reported as AEs or SAEs depending on the severity and assessed as to whether these are related to 
study  procedures.    
11.5.  SPECIAL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
There are no special warnings or precautions for this study.  
11.6.  STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_33567]: 1. difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly 
impact the  ability to evaluate the study endpoints;  2. any new information becomes available during the study that 
necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]; 3. there are significant treatment related toxicities that become evident through the 
course of the study ; or 4. other  situations occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098] .  
11.7.  SAFETY OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE (SOC)  
The Duke Cancer Institute SOC is responsible for annual data and safety monitoring of DUHS sponsor -investigator 
phase I and II, therapeutic interventional studies th at do not have an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). The primary focus of the SOC is review of safety data, toxicities , and new information that may affect subject 
safety or efficacy. Annual safety reviews include but may not be limited to re view of safety data, enrollment status, 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12596], accrual, toxicities, reference literature, and interim anal ysis as provided by [CONTACT_456] -
investigator. The SOC in concert with the DC I Monitoring Team (see Section 12.1  for Monitoring Team description) 
oversees the conduct of DUHS cancer -related , sponsor -investigator greater -than -minimal -risk intervention studies 
that do not have an external monitoring plan, ensuring subject safety and that the protocol is conducted, recorded 
and reported in accordance with the protocol, standing operating procedures (SOPs), Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
and a pplicable regulatory requirements. The DCI Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) will perform annual reviews on 
findings from the DCI Monitoring Team visit and additional safety and toxicity data submitted by [CONTACT_9532].  
11.8.  EXTERNAL DATA AND SAFETY  MONITORING BOARD (DSMB)  
DSMBs are usually advised for Phase III multi -center clinical trials in which study participants are exposed to 
substantial risk or vulnerable populations are studied. This study, however, will be conducted at only one study site i n 
Durham, N orth Carolina . Based on extensive clinical experience with bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33568] -Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]  (AXS -05) demonstrating good 
medication tolerance and a favorable si de effect profile, there is no reason to expect significant risks to subjects . 
Additionally,  vulnerable populations will not be studied in this protocol. Hence, we have concluded that oversight by 
[CONTACT_33664] s tudy and that a formal DSMB will not be needed.  
 
  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  41 12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
12.1.  MONITORING  
This clinical research study will be monitored both internally by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_33569] 
(DCI).  In terms of internal review , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33570].  Appropriate 
reporting to the Duke University Medical Center IRB will be made.  If an unexpected frequency of Grade III or IV 
events occur, depending on their nature, action app ropriate to the nature and frequency of these adverse events will 
be taken.  This may require a protocol amendment, dose de -escalation, or potentially closure of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_33571], data, and safety of this study to ensure that:  
• Interim analyses occur as scheduled;  
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9480]/or response are met;  
• Risk/benefit ratio is not altered to the detriment of the subjects;  
• Appropriate internal monitoring of AEs and outcomes is done;  
• Over -accrual does not occur;  
• Under -accrual is addressed with appropriate amendments or actions;  
• Data are being appropriately collected in a reasonably timely manner.  
• DCI review and monitoring of this protocol occurs in accordance with the NCI -approved Data and Sa fety 
Monitoring Plan.   
Briefly, protocol review begins with an initial review by [CONTACT_33665] (CPC), which assesses the 
ethics and safety of the protocol.  Documentation of these assessments will be maintained.  Formal, independent 
monito ring will be conducted by [CONTACT_33666] 3 subjects are enrolled, followed by [CONTACT_33667] 1 -3 subjects until the study is closed to enrollment and subjects are no longer receiving study 
interventions that are more than min imal risk.  DCI Monitoring Team reports and additional data/safety/toxicity 
reports submitted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_33572] (SOC) on an annual basis.  Additional 
monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], unexpected frequency of serious and/or unexpected 
toxicities, or other concerns.  Monitoring visits may also be initiated upon request by [CONTACT_33668], CPC, 
SOC, a sponsor, an investigator, or the IRB.     
12.2.  AUDITS  
The Duke School of Medicine Clin ical Trials Quality Assurance (CTQA) office may conduct confidential audits to 
evaluate compliance with the protocol and the principles of GCP. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_33573](s) direct 
access to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of the study team to the CTQA auditor(s) 
in order to discuss fi ndings and any relevant issues.  
CTQA audits are designed to protect the rights and well -being of human research subjects. CTQA audits may be 
routine or directed (for cause). Routin e audits are selected based upon risk metrics generally geared towards high 
subject enrollment, studies with limited oversight or monitoring, Investigator -initiated Investigational Drugs or 
Devices, federally -funded studies, high degree of risk (based upon adverse events, type of study, or vulnerable 
populations), Phase I studies, or studies that involve Medicare populations. Directed audits occur at the directive of 
the IRB or an aut horized Institutional Official.  
CTQA audits examine research st udies/clinical trials methodology, processes , and systems to assess whether the 
research is conducted according to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_12638]. The primary purpose of the audit/review 
is to verify that the standards for safety of human subjects i n clinical trials and the quality of data produced by [CONTACT_33669]. The audit/review will serve as a quality assurance measure, internal to the institution. 
Additional goals of such audits are to detect both random and systemic error s occurring during the conduct of clinical 
research and to emphasize “best practices” in the research/clinical trials environment.  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  42 12.3.  DATA MANAGEMENT AND PROCESSING  
12.3.1.  CASE REPORT FORMS (CRFS)  
The electronic and paper CRF will be the primary data collection docu ment for the study. The CRFs will be updated in 
a timely manner following acquisition of new source data. Only approved study staff  including the PI, PA,  and CRS are 
permitted to make entries, chan ges, or corrections in the CRF.  
Errors will be crossed out with a single line, and this line will not obscure the original entry. Changes or corrections 
will be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_33574] a record of the 
changes and corrections.  
An audit trail w ill be maintained automatically by [CONTACT_33670] . Designated 
personnel  will complete user training, as required or appropriate per regulations.  
12.3.2.  DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND DATA VERIFICATION  
Designated personnel using  the el ectronic CRF will have access based on their specific roles in the protocol. The PI, 
PA, and CRS will have access.  
Completeness of entered data will be checked automatically by [CONTACT_1624], and users will be alerted to the 
presence of data inconsistenc ies. Additionally, the CRC will cross -reference the data to verify accuracy. Missing or 
implausible data will be highlighted for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12598] (i.e. confirmation of data, correction of 
data, completion or confirmation tha t data is not available, etc.).  
The database will be reviewed and discussed prior to database closure, and will be closed only after resolution of all 
remaining queries.  An audit trail will be kept of all subsequent changes to the data.  
12.3.3.  STUDY CLOSURE  
Following completion of the studies, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33575]:  
• Data clarification and/or resolution  
• Accounting, reconciliation, and destruction/return of used and unused study drugs  
• Review of site study records for c ompleteness  
• Shipment of all remaining laboratory samples to the designated laboratories  
 
  
Version : 02/05/[ADDRESS_33005] be approved by [CONTACT_33671].  
13.1.  ANALYSIS SETS  
Dataset will be collected through five visits: the Baseline Visit and four weekly study visits. Data will include 
information from self -report, diaries , and o bjective tests of urine, saliva , and expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559] . All data measures will be 
captured using REDCap78, an encrypted, HIPAA compliant, data collection system. Data entry is time -stamped for use 
in calendar -based assessment visits with capacity for upload into statistical programs Excel, Statview, SAS, SPSS, 
MPlus, and R. Trained Duke staff will conduct data integrity proc esses for REDCap data78. 
13.2.  PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND OTHER BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
Participants will be adult smokers recruited through the Duke Center for Smok ing Cessation   
13.3.  TREATMENTS  
Drug Dose: Smokers will be randomized with 1:1 allocation to AXS-05 (45 mg Immediate Release DXM + 105 mg 
Sustained Release BUP) vs. 105 mg Sustained Release BUP. Medications will be provided to participants at the 
Baseline Study Visit and continued for four  weeks in each group .   
Study Group  Dosing :  Dextromethorphan Imm ediate Release 45mg + Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33545] 105 mg  
Dose Timing  Administration: For the first three days, t ake one tablet  in the morning on an empty stomach (one hour 
prior to the morning meal or two hours after the morning meal) . Thereafter take one  tablet two times per day , on an 
empty stomach,  at least 8 hours apart and 1 hour prior to a meal, or 2 hours after a meal . 
Control Group: Bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_33545] 105 mg  
Dose Timing  Administration: For the first three days, take one tablet in the morni ng on an empty stomach (one hour 
prior to the morning meal or two hours after the morning meal). Thereafter take one tablet two times per day, on an 
empty stomach, at least [ADDRESS_33006] of AXS -05 compared to BUP on change in smoking intensity from baseline to the 3 -Week 
Follow -Up Visit.  Smoking intensity, refers to the total amount of smoke inhaled by [CONTACT_33672]. Smoking intensity will be assessed as a latent variable modeled through three 
predictive factors: 1. Salivary cotinine which will be assessed at all study visits. 2. Expi[INVESTIGATOR_33514] (CO) 
breath testing at all study visits and 3.  Number of c igarettes smoked per day assessed via daily smoking diaries.  
Because salivary cotinine and CO are measured at weekly intervals, weekly means of cigarettes smoked per day will 
be calculated for each participant and used in the latent variable analysis.    
13.4.1.  VARIA BLES 
Cigarettes smoked per day , expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559], salivary cotinine   
13.4.2.  STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS, MODEL, AND METHOD OF ANALYSIS  
Testing for our primary hypotheses will be based on  use of smoking intensity as a latent variable constructed through 
modeling of 3 predictor variables – salivary cotinine, CO, and the number of  cigarettes smoked per day. These 
variables will be assessed for the development of composite measure of smoking intensity through latent variable  
modeling .  Modeling of primary outcomes in this way is expected to provide a more powerful and accurate 
assessment of smoking behavior  by [CONTACT_33673] . Latent variable structure will be  developed using 
esta blished methods , with fit of the measurement model (i.e., latent variable) determined using standard fit criteria: 
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) < .05, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < .08, and 
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  44 comparative fit index (CFI) >  .90. The chi -squared test of model fit will also be consulted , with non -significance 
indicative of good model fit.   
For some comparisons conducted in this study, l ogistic regression models will be assessed for computation of odds 
ratio (OR) estimates and confidence intervals (CIs).  All analyses will follow an intent -to-treat approach with alpha 
criterion of 0.05 in comparisons. Given repeated observations across multiple individuals and time points, many of 
the analyses in this study will be derived from multilevel modeling (MLM). MLM hierarchically organize s data as a 
function of person -specific variables and time -point specific variables. Unlike repeated -measures ANOVA, MLM is 
able to handle data distributions with unequal variances across t ime points and individuals79. In addition to modeling 
between -person d ifferences, MLM is also able to model within -person variability in variables that change over time. 
Because MLM procedures are based on maximum likelihood estimation and use all available data, MLM can 
accommodate missing data at random and is often consid ered favorable to multiple imputation techniques, which 
can yield varied results depending on the imputation model80, 81.   
Multilevel structural equation modeling (MSEM ) will be used to test the primary hypothesis that participants in the 
study group will demonstrate decreased smoking intensity post -baseline relative to the control group. Specifically, 
the aforementioned smoking intensity latent variable will be modeled at the baseline, [ADDRESS_33007] trajectories of smoking intensity. Linear contrasts within the 
context of the model will be derived to estimate point differences in smoking intensity between the treatment 
groups at the 3 -week follow -up. 
13.4.3.  HANDLING OF MISSING VALUES, CENSORING, AND DISCONTINUATIONS  
Missing data will be examined to determine whether missingness is systematic or at random. To manage the problem 
of random positive findings when making multiple comparison s82, 83 (e.g. random significant findings occurring due to 
multiple proposed analyses), we will correct alpha by [CONTACT_33674]84. This methodology differentiates random findings from hypothesis -driven outcomes and is more powerful 
than Bonferroni -type alpha adjustments that control the false positive rate79, 81, 82, 83, 85.  
13.5.  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
Secondary Objectives (Smoking Behavior)  
1. To compare AXS -[ADDRESS_33008] conducted between the 3 -
week and 4 -Week Study Visits. Smoking Abstinence  and approximate time of lapse  will be assessed by [CONTACT_6270] -
report diaries and b iochemically confirmed via expi[INVESTIGATOR_33515].   
Secondary Objectives (Covariates and Potential Moderators)  
2. To assess specific baseline variables for an association with smoking behavior outcome, listed above. Baseline 
variables assessed will  include age, gender, race, education, baseline nicotine dependence, stress, anxiety, 
depression, and self -efficacy. If a baseline variable is found to be associated with change in smoking behavior, 
it will be treated as a covariate in a secondary analysis  of smoking behavior and assessed as a potential 
moderator of treatment effect.  
Secondary Objectives (Adherence, Side Effects, and Tolerance)  
3. To compare AXS -05 to BUP on adherence to self -administered drug through Medication Use diaries  
4. To compare AXS -05 to BUP on tolerability through weekly, open -ended survey to assess potential side 
effects.  
5. To compare AXS -05 to BUP on the incidence of adverse events or serious adverse events utilizing FDA 
accepted reporting guidelines on these outcomes.   
Secondary O bjectives (Pharmacokinetics)  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  45 6. To measure urine drug levels of DXM at weeks 1 -4 and assess potential associations of these levels with 
smoking behavior and side effects.  
Secondary Objectives (Potential Mediators)  
7. To compare AXS -05 to BUP on changes from b aseline vs. weeks 1 -4 Follow -up Visits on the following: 
smoking urges, withdrawal symptoms, smoking reward, stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and 
agitation .. 
8. To compare AXS -05 to BUP on change from baseline to weeks 1 -4 on daily assessment o f the following: urge 
frequency, urge severity, and irritability.  
 
13.5.1.  KEY SECONDARY OBJECTIVE  ANALYSIS  
1. Participants allocated to AXS -[ADDRESS_33009] of the difference in abstinence between AXS -05 and active with logistic regression 
used to compute odds ratio (OR) estimates and confidence intervals (CIs).  Survival analysis of time to lapse as 
a function of treatment will be analyzed using Cox regression86. Participants who remain abstinent through 
the end of the [ADDRESS_33010] ratios 
estimated for each group. The proportional -hazards assumption (that the relative hazard of lapse will remain 
constant within each tre atment group over time) will be tested via examination of Schoenfeld residuals87. It is 
hypothesized that participants receiving AXS -05 will be slower to lapse than participants receiving BUP.  
 
13.5.2.  OTHER SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
Secondary Hypotheses (Covariates):  
1. Potential baseline predictors of tobacco use will not be associated with smoking behavior outcomes listed in 
objectives 1 -6; these predictors include age, gender, race, education, baseline nicotine dependence, stress, 
anxiety, depression, and self -efficacy (motivation). Logistic regression models will assess group differences in 
the change in smoking rates controlling for demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, race) and baseline 
covariates k nown to predict abstinence (e.g., nicotine dependence) . 
Secondary Hypotheses (Adherence, Side Effects, and Tolerance)  
2. Participants allocated to AXS -05 vs. BUP alone will demonstrate no significant difference on adherence to 
self-administered drug via Medi cation Use Diaries .  This will be tested using non -inferiority testing through 
use of the two one -sided tests procedure (TOST) with determination of the equivalence margin, δ,  with f of 
0.5088.  
3. Participants allocated to AXS -05 vs. BUP alone will demonstrate no significant difference in spontaneous self -
reported side effects.  This will be tested using non -inferiority testing through use of the two one -sided tests 
procedure (TOST) with determinati on of the equivalence margin, δ,  with f of 0.5088.  
4. Participants allocated to AXS -05 vs. BUP alone will demonstrate no significant difference on adverse events 
or serious adverse events utilizing FDA accepted reporting guidelines on these outcomes.  This will be tested 
using n on-inferiority testing through use of the two one -sided tests procedure (TOST) with determination of 
the equivalence margin, δ,  with f of 0.5088.  
 
Secondary Hypot heses (Pharmacokinetics)  
5. Participants allocated to AXS -[ADDRESS_33011] to urine drug levels 
at the two and three week visit:  
Version : 02/05/2019  AXS -05 on Smoking Behavior  46 A. Relatively stable urine drug levels of DXM (< 50% below or above the mean) . This will be assessed using 
descriptive statistics.  
B. A majority of participants will show urine DXM concentrations that are in the “expected therapeutic 
range” for tobacco dependence treatment (30 ng/ml) . This will be assessed using descriptive statist ics. 
C. There will be a n association  between DXM levels and smoking behavior outcomes MSEM will be used to 
model the previously described smoking intensity latent variable at weeks 1 -4 as a function of urine levels of 
DXM measured at those time points.  
D. Urine levels of DXM will not be associated with a higher incidence side effects or adverse events 
(objectives 9 -11). To examine the association of urine levels of DXM with side effects, number of days of 
reported side effects will be summarized at weeks 1 -4 for each participant. These numbers will then be 
modeled (likely as a negative binomial distribution) via MLM as a function of urine levels of DXM.  We will 
also examine whether urine levels of DXM that are above the sample mean will be associated with a higher 
incidence of side effects or adverse events.  
Secondary Hypotheses (Potential Mediators)  
6. In comparison to participants allocated to BUP, participants allocated to AXS -05 will demonstrate the 
following:  
A. A significant reduction in smoking urges and withdrawal symptoms from baseline to all four post -drug 
initiation time points. MLM will be used to model each of the above variables as a function of treatment 
group and time (baseline, weeks 1 -4). Potential Treatment X Time effects will be explored t o determine 
whether the two treatments are associated with distinct trajectories of change in the above outcomes. Linear 
contrasts within the context of the model will be derived to estimate point differences in the outcome 
variables between the treatment groups at the 3 -week follow -up. 
B. The change in in smoking urges and withdrawal symptoms will be significantly associated with change in 
smoking behavior assessed through the primary objective, independent of treatment group.  MSEM will be 
used to model t he smoking intensity latent variable as a function of smoking urges and withdrawal 
symptoms, with treatment group and time (baseline, weeks 1 -4) covaried. Potential Treatment X Time effects 
will be examined to determine whether the two treatments are assoc iated with distinct trajectories of 
change in the behavioral and psychological outcomes. It is predicted that smoking urges and withdrawal 
symptoms will exert an effect on smoking intensity independent of treatment or Treatment X Time effects. 
Multicolline arity between each of the psychiatric variables will be examined and their independent effects as 
well as their joint effects will be tested. Pending evidence of mediation, indirect effects will be examined 
both independently and jointly. Multilevel analys es will be conducted using Mplus 7.   
7. In comparison to participants allocated to BUP, participants allocated to AXS -05 will demonstrate the 
following:  
A. A significant reduction in stress, anxiety, depression, and withdrawal symptoms and an increase in se lf-
efficacy and sleep quality from baseline to all four post -drug initiation time points. MLM will be used to 
model each of the above variables as a function of treatment group and time (baseline, weeks 1 -4). Potential 
Treatment X Time effects will be expl ored to determine whether the two treatments are associated with 
distinct trajectories of change in the above outcomes. Linear contrasts within the context of the model will 
be derived to estimate point differences in the outcome variables between the trea tment groups at the 3 -
week follow -up. 
B. The change in these constructs will be associated with change in smoking behavior assessed through the 
primary objective. MSEM will be used to model the smoking intensity latent variable as a function of the 
above p otential mediators, with treatment group and time (baseline, weeks 1 -4) covaried. Potential 
Version : 02/05/[ADDRESS_33012] 
effects will be examined both independently and jointly. Multilevel analyses will be conducted using Mplus 7.

Quality Control Analysis:  We plan to conduct an interim analysis on de -identified data after a total of 10 subjects (5 
in each group) comp lete Visit 5 (final visit) in the study. The study blind will not be broken for this analysis and as 
such it will not be known to which arm participants are allocated. This analysis will provide descriptive statistical 
assessments relevant to primary and s econdary outcomes.   This analysis will be conducted for the purpose of 
assessing the quality of our testing procedures, data collection, data storage etc.   Because the study blind will not be 
broken, this analysis will not provide meaningful information on  primary study outcomes.   Data outcomes of this 
analysis will be shared with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33576] w ith the funding agent (Axsome).  
Efficacy Interim Analysis: Please see the additional attachment for the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). This will also be 
submitted to the FDA per normal procedures.   
13.8.  SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
This is the first time we know of that DXM has been used in a study on human smoking behav ior. Thus,  the effect size 
of AXS -[ADDRESS_33013] at a minimum 80% power to detect an effect equivalent to Cohen’s d = 0.52. However, via the use of 
repeated -measures data, the proposed analysis will likely be sensitive to detect even smaller effects. The finding of 
spontaneous reduction  of smoking period most closely parallels our finding of spontaneous reduction in nicotine self -
administration in rats (who do not set a quit day or apply will power to bare on outcomes). Within the rat model, [CONTACT_33697] showed a reduction from 18 self -administrations to only 6 per day, a 66% reduction in use.

recent IRB approval, for as long as the protocol remains open to sub ject enrollment.  
14.3.  INFORMED CONSEN T 
The informed consent form must be written in a manner that is understandable to the subject population. Prior to its 
use, the informed consent fo rm must be approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_33581], methods, potential risks and benefits, subject concerns, and other study -related matters. This discussion 
will occur in a location that ensures subject privacy and in a manner t hat minimizes the possibility of coercion. 
Appropriate accommodations will be made available for potential subjects who cannot read or understand English or 
are visually impaired. Potential subjects will have the opportunity to contact [CONTACT_33675], and will be given as much time as needed to make an informed decision ab out 
participation in the study.  
Before conducting any study -specific procedures, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_33582] a legally acceptable representative. The original informed consent form will be stored with the 
subject’s study records, and a copy of the informed consent form will be provided to the subject. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12605]/her primary care physician 
about participation in the study. If the subject agrees to such notification, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_33583]’s primary care physician  about the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
14.4.  STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
Study documentation includes but is not limited to source documents, case report forms (CRFs), monitoring logs, 
appointment schedules, study team correspondence with sponsors or regulatory bodies/committees, and regulatory 
documents that can be found in the DCI -mandated “Regulatory Binder”, which includes but is not limited to signed 
protocol and amendments, approved and signed informed consent forms, FDA Form 1572, CA P and CLIA laboratory 
certifications, and clinical supplies receipts and distribution records.  
Source documents are original records that contain source data, which is all information in original records of clinical 
findings, observations, or other activit ies in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. 
Source documents include but are not limited to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pha rmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated 
Version : 02/05/[ADDRESS_33014] duplic ation of the original document.  
An electronic  case report form (CRF) will be the primary data collection document for the study. The CRFs will be 
updated within two weeks of acquisition of new source data. Only approved study staff , inclu ding the Principle 
Investigator, Study Physician/PA, and Clinical Research Specialist  are permitted to make entries, changes, or 
corrections in the CRF. For paper CRFs, errors will  be crossed out with a single line, and this line will not obscure the 
origi nal entry.  Changes or corrections will be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary). The Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_33574] a record of the changes and corrections. For electronic CRFs, an audit trail 
will be maintained by [CONTACT_12640]  (REDCap ). 
14.5.  PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY, AND DATA STORAGE

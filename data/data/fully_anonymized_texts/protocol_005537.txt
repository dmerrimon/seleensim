Title:  An Experimental Therapeutics Study of Ixekizumab, a Monoclonal 
Antibody Against Interleukin 17A, on Anhedonia, Reward Circuit Functi on, 
and Blood Brain Barrier Physiology in Patients with Treatment - Resistant 
Depression  
 
Study Description:  The proposed study aims to establish the feasibility and safety of 
ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against interleukin 17A (IL -17A), 
for patients with treatment -resistant depression (TRD ). IL-17A is a pro -
inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in subgroup of patients with TRD 
and we hypothesize that blocking IL -17A immune signaling with 
ixekizumab will improve depressive symptoms in adults with TRD . We also 
hypothesize that use of ixekizumab will be associated with changes in 
other symptom and functional domains (such as anhedonia), functional 
neuro -circuitry of brain’s reward system, permeability of blood -brain 
barrier, and circulating immu ne factors. These hypotheses will be tested in 
the context of a n open -label trial where  up to  n=[ADDRESS_1124939] will 
be treated with ixekizumab for 4 weeks and will undergo brain scans 
before and after the treatment period.

6 2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE 
This study aims to establish the safety and feasibility of ixekizumab, a monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) against interleukin 17A (IL -17A), for patients with treatment -resistant  depression (TRD)  and 
evaluate its open -label effects on depression severity, other clinical symptoms, blood -based immune 
markers, BBB permeability , and functional brain rewa rd circuitry . It is now clear that targeting the 
immune system holds enormous pote ntial to identify novel therapeutic agents for severe and resistant 
forms of depression. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_812403],  the promise of immune -modulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_812404]. In order to address this gap in knowledge , we propose to test an anti -IL-17A therapy for TRD. 
Based on the available clinical and preclinical work, IL -17A represents the most promising immune 
target for TRD that has yet to be tested in humans. If  the goals of the project are achieved, the 
knowledge gained can be used to inform larger, placebo -controlled, well -powered trials to determine 
efficacy and the mechanism of action of ixekizumab for TRD. Ultimately, this can be transferred to 
clinical prac tice because marketed monoclonal antibodies, like ixekizumab, can be repurposed. The 
knowledge gained from this project will also stimulate new avenues in immune -based treatment 
discovery for depression.

patients with MDD.1  There are few effective options for the subset of patients –those with treatment 
resistant depression (TRD) –who have failed multiple pharmacotherapy trials. The public health need of 
MDD in the Unite d States is compounded by [CONTACT_812419] (1 in 5 adults during their lifetime), cost 
(over $200 billion per year), and burden (second highest cause of disability -adjusted life years).2-4

IL-[ADDRESS_1124945] that major depressive disorder (MDD) – and TRD in particular 
– is as sociated with immune dysregulation, which is thought to drive symptoms of anhedonia via 
dysfunction within the brain reward circuit.5,6 Increased signaling of peripheral pro -inflammatory 
cytokines lead to anhedonia -like behavior in animals, and patients with depression (TRD in particular) are 
characterized by [CONTACT_812420], while systemic administration of pro -
inflammatory cytokines triggers depres sive symp toms a nd changes in brain responses to reward in 
humans.5,7 
2.2. C Role of blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability in depression  
Recent preclinical work from our team show that high levels of circulating immune factors gain 
access to the brain reward circuit to promote pro -depressive behaviors via increased permeability of the 
BBB.[ADDRESS_1124946] enhance magnetic resonance imaging 
(DCE -MRI) have facilitated quantification of BBB permeability in human for conditions ranging from 
multiple sclerosis and dementia .9,10 A recent study of patients with bipolar disorder and healthy controls 
found that higher BBB leakage on DCE -MRI was associated with more severe depr ession and more chronic 
course of illness.11   
2.2. D Role of interleukin 17 (IL -17) mediated immune signaling in depression  
IL-17A is a highly pro -inflammatory cytokine produced by T helper 17 (Th17) cells that induces the 
production of numerous other inflammatory cytokines such as IL -6, IL -1β and TNF -α. Preclinical studies 
show that a) stress -induced pro -depressive behaviors are associated with increased levels of IL -17A or 
Th17cells in brain,  b) peripheral infusion of IL -17A causes depression -like behaviors,  and c) peripheral 
blockade of IL -17A with MABs directed against IL -17A is sufficient to reverse the pro -depressive 
phenotype.[ADDRESS_1124947] found that IL -17A levels are elevated in 
patients with depression versus healthy controls (HC), and higher levels of circulating IL -17A are 
associated with more severe depression and anhedonia.13,[ADDRESS_1124948] (F=5.66; df=2,68; p=0.005), compared to HC or non -TRD forms 
of MDD. Critically, data show that IL -17A increases BBB permeability in preclinical models, providing a 
mechanism whereby [CONTACT_812421] -17A promotes depression in part by [CONTACT_812422] -inflamma tory factors to gain access to mood -relevant brain circuits such as the 
VTA-NAc system .5,15 
2.2. E Antidepressant effects of anti -IL-17A MABs.  
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
targeting either IL -17A directly (ixekizumab and secukinumab) or its receptor (brodalumab). In phase [ADDRESS_1124949] size (Cohen’s d = 0.81).[ADDRESS_1124950] during a n 8 week  open -label study. We are interested in 
evaluating ixekizumab and its effects on 1 ) depression severity; 2) other clinical symptoms; 3) the effect 
of IL -17A on brain function ; 4) blood -based immune markers, like CRP and other immune markers ; and 
changes in RSFC using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans  and changes in BBB 
permeability using  dynamic contrast enhanced MRI  . 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1124951] placing his/her head in a tube and some subjects may experience a feeling 
of claustrophobia while in the scanner. The subjects are always in voice contact [CONTACT_4490] a researcher or 
technician and the scanning session can be terminated quickly if the subject so requests. Subjects with 
metal objects in cluding surgical clips or metallic prostheses (such as an artificial hip or knee), or shrapnel 
(metal fragments) will be excluded. The risk to the subject in the event that there is susceptible metal in 
or on his or her body is significant and may include death. Every subject will be carefully screened using 
existing standard operating procedures of the Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Institute (BMEII) for 
the presence of susceptible metal.   
 
MRI with Contrast: Gadolinium (MRI dye) is routinely used in m edical imaging. As  described in the MRI 
safety literature, it is a substance that is not normally absorbed into  the tissues of the body. Once it is 
injected, it will stay in the blood stream and will be  eliminated a few hours later in the urine. Some 
patie nts may have a reaction to this  dye, which may be itching, nausea, breathing problems, vomiting, 
or a metallic taste.  These reactions are very rare and usually occur in people who already have severe 
lung disease. There is a slight  chance of an allergic reaction from the contrast which has a less than [ADDRESS_1124952] because it may lead to debilitating and potential fata l disease that involves the skin, muscles, 
and internal organs. Patients with kidney disease  can develop skin thickening that may prevent bending 
and extending joints, resulting in  decreased mobility of joints. The chance of developi[INVESTIGATOR_812405]  (NSF) is extremely low in individuals with normal kidney function. In addition, patients 
may experience scarring that has spread to other parts of the body such as the diaphragm,  muscles in 
the thigh and lower abdomen, and the interior areas of l ung.  
 
 
2.3.1.  B Risks of ixekizumab  
The risks of ixekizumab are summarized  below  from the package insert provided by [CONTACT_112607] (available at: 
https://uspl.lilly.com/taltz/taltz.html#pi ) and are based on  bi-weekly treatment in three placebo -
controlled studies for adult patients with plaque psoriasis (n = 1167).  Similar side effect profiles were 
observed in other studies that dosed ixekizumab once a month.   
 
IL-[ADDRESS_1124953] common (≥1%) adverse reaction s associated with ixekizumab treatment are injection site 
reactions, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], nausea, and tinea infections. Adverse reactions that 
occurred at rates less than 1% in the ixekizumab group and more frequently than in the placebo group 
during the 12 -week induction period included rhinitis, oral candidiasis, urticaria, influenza, conjunctivitis, 
inflammatory bowel disease, angioedema, and abnormal laboratory values (complete blood count) . 
Treatment with ixekizumab may worsen symptoms of active tuberculosis (TB) infection. Patients will be 
evaluated for TB infection prior to initiating treatment with ixekizumab .  
 
In the pooled data, infections occurred in 27% of subjects treated with ixekizumab compared to 23% of 
subjects treated with placebo. Serious infections occurred in 0.4% of subjects treated with ixekizumab  
and in 0.4% of subjects treated with placebo.  
 
There are no available data on ixekizumab use in pregnant women to inform any dr ug associated risks. 
Human IgG is known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, ixekizumab may be transmitted from the 
mother to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]. There are no data on the presence of ixekizumab in human milk, the 
effects on the breastfed infant, or  the effects on milk production.  
 
2.3.1.  C Psychological Screening Risks  
Answering questions related to mental health and past experiences may be stressful. Research 
interviews will be interrupted if subjects become distressed or object to answering questions. If in the 
judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_354240] -affiliated psychiatrist, the p atient has worsened to such a degree that 
further participation would put the patient at risk, then the subject will be discontinued from the study 
and provided appropriate clinical care. Also, at any point during the study any subject meeting DSM -[ADDRESS_1124954] 
12 weeks of biweekly dosing. The majority of side effects compared to placebo are injection site 
reactions. Ixekizumab may minimally increase the risk of infectio n, as the drug group had a higher rate 
of injections than placebo (27% vs. 23%). Overall , the cumulative risks stemming from ixekizumab 
treatment, psychological screening, medical screening, privacy and confidentiality, financial exposure  
are manageable, and the benefit of acquiring data on a novel medication for TRD outweighs the risks.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_1124955].  
 
 Completion of treatment measured as 
the receipt of all three Ixekizumab 
injections (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg 
at weeks 2 and 4). Drop -out rates will 
be calculated. The incidence and 
frequency of all anticipated and 
unanticipated serious and non -serious 
adverse events that occur between 
baseline and study exit visit will be 
determined.

4 STUDY  DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
We will enroll up to N=20 adults (aged 18 -70 years) with TRD, defined as inadequate 
improvement with two or more antidepressants in the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. If patients are on antidepressant 
medications, they must be on a stable dose for >[ADDRESS_1124960] inflammatory status. Primary inflammatory 
disorder or an unstable medical condition will also be exclusionary. Subjects will  receive 3 doses  (160 mg 
at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, 80 mg at week 4)  in total of ixekizumab injection , with dosing to occur every 
[ADDRESS_1124961] the 
stated hypotheses.  
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE 
The use of ixekizumab via subcutaneous route is consistent with the FDA -approved usage for other 
indications (psoriasis). The dosing regimen is based on the report by [CONTACT_344077].[ADDRESS_1124962] of ixekizumab on depressive symptoms in three Phase 3 trials. In their report, which included 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  13 patients with psoriasis and moderate -to-severe depression, ixekizumab was started at 160 mg. Over the 
next 12 weeks, patients  either received 80 mg of ixekizumab every 2 weeks (Q2W), 80 mg of ixekizumab 
every 4 weeks (Q4W), or placebo. Remission from depressive symptoms was more common in those 
who received ixekizumab Q2W (45.2%) as compared to ixekizumab Q4W (33.6%) or placebo (17.8%). 
Therefore, our planned use of ixekizumab with dose of [ADDRESS_1124963] sche duled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA), 
Section 1.3. Alternatively, a participant may be considered exited from the study due to early 
withdrawal, drop -out, or screen failure. See Section 7 for more details.

  15 5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
5.5.A   Plan ned Recruitment Activities  
 
The research strategy for the present study calls for the enrollment of up to N=20 adults (aged 18 -70 
years) with treatment -resistant depression  over the two-year project period . Our total enrollment target 
of up to N=[ADDRESS_1124967] -treatment , we plan to screen a total 
of N= 40 individuals over the proposed 24-month recruitment period. This enrollment period provides 
for a highly feasible ~2 subjects screened and ~ [ADDRESS_1124968] -to-patient advertising through radio, newspaper, internet -based and other media 
outlets. A centralized programmatic intake process (u nder protocol STUDY -10-[ZIP_CODE]; A Screening 
Protocol for Adult Patients with Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Chronic Medical Conditions, and 
Healthy Volunteers.)  is employed that includes a central phone line, a program -specific email, and a 
website featuring a web -based survey that patients can take to see if they qualify for studies. Individuals 
who contact [CONTACT_812426] -screener online survey are automatically entered into a secure 
web -based database in order to be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the rese arch staff for additional 
screening . 
  
In addition to recruiting individuals through the DAC centralized programmatic intake process, 
recruitment is also anticipated from the following additional sources: (1) patients with MDD who are 
currently receiving clinical care from providers (psychiatri sts and psychologists) in DAC; (2) the Mount 
Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812406]; (3) self -referrals from patients who have completed 
other research protocols through DAC; (4) clinicians within and outside of the Mount Sinai Health 
System, in cluding large departments of psychiatry at Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Mount Sinai West, Mount 
Sinai Morningside, and Mount Sinai South Nassau; and (5) self -referrals from individuals attending 
community outreach programs in the [LOCATION_001] State and tristate ar ea and from media advertisements.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_812407], so that any deviation from the anticipated enrollment schedule will be detected quickly.  All 
outreach and adve rtising activities will also be reviewed on a weekly basis.  
 
5.5.B Engagement Strategies for Retention  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_812408] s tudy procedures as intended.  
 
In terms of infrastructure, the data coordinating facilities at ISMMS provides a secure, validated, 
centralized electronic data management facility that is HIPAA and FDA -compliant (Research Electronic 
Data Capture, or REDCap) . The REDCap system employed in this study includes several components, 
including a Screening Database and a Subject Tracking Database, in addition to the Study Database 
proper. As subjects complete visits, the date of the visit will be entered into the da tabase. Missed visits 
will be coded for reason (such as ill, scheduling problem, inability to contact, etc.). If subjects terminate 
early, the date and reason will be coded in the Subject Tracking Database.  On a weekly basis, the study 
research coordinato r, who will also function as the data manager, will run a report on patient accrual 
IL-[ADDRESS_1124969]’s point of contact [CONTACT_61641]. Subjects will be 
provi ded with phone and email contact [CONTACT_809559], in addition to the contact 
[CONTACT_645787].  
 
5.5.C Strategies that will be used to ensure a diverse, representative  study sample  
 
The ISMMS is part of a large urban medical center, and benefits from a large and diverse catchment 
area. Located in the Manhattan borough of [LOCATION_001] City, the racial and ethnic distribution of Mount 
Sinai’s catchment area is 49% Hispanic, 38% African American, and 13% white non -Hispanics. The 
catchment area of the Mount Sinai’s affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812409] 22% 
Hispanics, 23% white non -Hispanics, 26% Asians and 24% African Americans. For the proposed clinical 
trial there are no special restrictions with regard to ethnicity o r race. It is expected that the study sample 
will closely approximate the racial and ethnic composition of the greater catchment area of the Mount 
Sinai Health System.  
 
5.5.D Potential recruitment/enrollment challenges and strategies that can be implemente d in the 
event of enrollment shortfalls  
 
Anticipated study related barriers may involve issues including staff workload and scheduling windows. 
This will be addressed by [CONTACT_812427] -up for the primary study coordinator 
respons ible for the proposed project. These back -up staff members will allow the study team to screen 
and enroll subjects and complete study visits within subject’s availability. All study staff will be trained 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_812410] w eekly project meetings to ensure consistency of 
study procedures across both primary and back -up study personnel.  
 
Some participant related barriers include appointment scheduling, transportation issues, and 
maintaining contact [CONTACT_242173]. To ens ure that subjects can attend appointments, whenever 
possible, the visit schedule will include flexibility. To help address transportation issues, the study team 
will offer patients metro cards and other transportation resources available through DAC. The r esearch 
staff will check voicemail and email daily to be able to respond to any patient contact [CONTACT_812428].   
 
6 STUDY  INTERVENTION  
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION  
 
Ixekizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) with 
neutralizing activity against IL -17A. Ixekizumab is produced by [CONTACT_94988] a 
recombinant mammalian cell line and purified using standard technology for bioprocessing. Ixekizumab 
is comprised of two identical light chain polypeptides of 219 amino acids each and two identical heavy 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  17 chain polypeptides of 445 amino acid s each, and has a molecular weight of 146,158 Daltons for the 
protein backbone of the molecule.  
 
Ixekizumab injection is a sterile, preservative free, clear and colorless to slightly yellow solution, for 
subcutaneous use available as 80 mg of ixekizumab i n a 1 mL single -dose prefilled auto injector  or a 
single -dose prefilled syringe. The prefilled auto injector  and prefilled syringe each contain a 1 mL glass 
syringe with a fixed 27 gauge ½ inch needle. The ixekizumab 80 mg prefilled auto injector  and prefi lled 
syringe are manufactured to deliver 80 mg of ixekizumab. Each mL is composed of ixekizumab (80 mg);

● Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
● Lost to follow -up 
● Sponsor request for early termination of study  
● Positive pregnancy tes t (females)  
  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early discontinuation visit as soon as 
possible. For patients who are lost to follow up, it may not be possible to complete early discontinuation 
procedures. For subjects who wish  to withdraw consent, they will be asked to do so in writing following 
the completing of an early discontinuation visit. Some subjects may not agree and wish to withdraw 
consent immediately in which case these early discontinuation procedures may not occur . Reasonable 
attempts will be made by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for subject discontinuation from study 
treatment.  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the subject or the investigator -sponsor feels 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue. All subjects are free to withdraw from participation 
at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
  
Reasonable attempts will be made by t he investigator to provide a reason for subject withdrawals. The 
reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the subject’s source documents. 
As noted above, subjects who discontinue study treatment early (i.e., they withdraw pri or to Visit 6) 
should have an early discontinuation visit.

● The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_812429]/or should continue in the study.  
● Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s medical record or study file.  
● Should the parti cipant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 
 
8 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND  PROCEDURES  
8.1 CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND SAFETY MEASURES  
Clinical Assessments  
 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  20 Demographics : Demographic information (date of birth, gender, race/ethnicity) will be recorded at 
screening.  
 
Medical History : Relevant medical history, including history of current disease, other pertinent history, 
and information regarding underlying diseases will be recorded at screening.  
 
Physical Examination : A complete physical examination  will be performed by [CONTACT_3436] (M D, NP, RN, 
or PA) at screening and primary outcome (week 6 ). New abnormal physical exam findings must be 
documented and will be followed b y a physician or other qualified staff at the next scheduled visit. If a 
novel adverse event is found at study exit, subjects will be followed for up to 30 days or until resolved.  
 
Vital Signs:  Body temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_414098] 
5 minutes  at screening, each of the three treatment visits, and at Visit 4, the primary outcome visit .  
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 (SCID -5). The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 (First et al. 
2015) is a se mi-structured interview guide for making DSM -[ADDRESS_1124974] comprehensive 
version of the SCID -5, the SCID -5-Research Version (RV), which contains more disorders than the Clinician 
Version and includes all of the relevant subtypes, s everity, and course specifiers. An important feature of 
the SCID -5-RV is its customizability, allowing the instrument to be tailored to meet the requirements of a 
particular study. The SCID -5-RV comes in a standard "core" configuration that includes the di sorders most 
researchers are likely to assess routinely for most studies, as well as in an “enhanced” configuration that 
includes a number of optional disorders, in addition to the disorders from the "core" configuration.  
  
Antidepressant Treatment History  Questionnaire (ATRQ) : The ATRQ17 is a self -rated scale used to 
determine treatment resistance in major depressive disorder (MDD) during the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The ATRQ 
defines [ADDRESS_1124975] commonly used antidepressant medications.  
  
Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) :18 this is a 10  
-item instrument used for the evaluation of depressive symptoms in adults and for the assessment of any 
changes to those symptoms.  Each of the 10 items is rated on a scale of 0 to 6, with diffe ring descriptors 
for each item. These individual item scores are added together to form a total score, which can range 
between 0 and 60 points. The MADRS provides a measure of the overall level of depression.  
  
Snaith -Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS):  The S HAPS19 is a well -validated 14 -item self -report questionnaire 
commonly used to assess anhedonia. Each item on the SHAPS is worded so that higher score s indicate 
greater pleasure capacity. A total score can be derived by [CONTACT_415965]. Items 
answered with “strongly agree” are coded as “1”, while a “strongly disagree” response was assigned a 
score of “4.” Total scores on the SHAPS can  range from 14 to 56, with higher scores corresponding to 
higher levels of anhedonia.  
 
Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale (TEPS) : The TEPS is an [ADDRESS_1124976] be rated acc ording to how accurate they are 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  21 for the individual.20  The scale produces two sub -scores that differentiate the role of anticipatory pleasure 
(‘wanting’) from consummatory pleasure (‘liking’). The anticipatory sub -score (TEPS -ant) is derived of 10 
items while the consummatory sub -score (TEP S-cons) is derived from 8 items.  
 
The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Self -Report (QIDS -SR): The QIDS -SR21 is a 16 -item 
self-rated instrument designed to assess the severity of depressive symptoms. The 16 items cover the 
nine symptom domains of major depression and are rated on a scale of 0 -3. Total sco re ranges from 0 to 
27, with ranges of 0 -5 (normal), 6 -10 (mild), 11 -15 (moderate), 16 -20 (moderate to severe), and 21+ 
(severe).  
 
The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Clinician Rated (QIDS -C): The QIDS -C21 is a 16 -item 
instrument designed to assess the seve rity of depressive symptoms. The 16 items cover the nine symptom 
domains of major depression and are rated on a scale of 0 -3. Total score ranges from 0 to 27, with ranges 
of 0 -5 (normal), 6 -10 (mild), 11 -15 (moderate), 16 -20 (moderate to severe), and 21+ ( severe).  This 
instrument will be used at the screening visit.  
 
Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI -S): this is a widely administered clinician rated global measure 
of subject overall illness severity. Subjects are rated on a 1 -7 scale where 1 corres ponds to “Normal, Not 
at All Ill”, 2 is “Borderline Mentally Ill”, the anchor for 3 is “Mildly Ill”, the anchor for 4 is “Moderately Ill”, 
5 is “Markedly Ill”, 6 is “Severely Ill”, and 7 is “Among the Most Extremely Ill Patients”.  
 
Clinical Global Impressi on - Improvement (CGI -I): this is a widely administered clinician rated global 
measure of the degree of improvement from the initial assessment in subject overall illness severity. 
Subjects are rated on a 1 -7 scale where 1 corresponds to “Very Much Improve d”, 2 is “Much Improved”, 
the anchor for 3 is “Minimally Improved”, the anchor for 4 is “No Change”, 5 is “Minimally Worse”, 6 is 
“Much Worse”, and 7 is “Very Much Worse”.  
  
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) : The Columbia -Suicide Severity Rat ing Scale (C -SSRS)[ADDRESS_1124977] week and with either a CGI -S score ≥6 (indicating extreme illne ss severity) or a CGI -I 
score ≥ 6 (indicating an extreme worseness of the symptoms), the site PI, or his designee, will conduct  a 
safety review to determine the appropriate course of action including whether acute intervention is 
needed and whether it is i n the best interests of the subject to continue in the study . 
 
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A): The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) is a scale of 
assessments of anxiety states. The scale consists of 14 ite ms, each defined by a series of symptom s, and 
measur es both psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychologica l distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
complaints related to anxiety).  Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (not present) to 4 (severe), with a total 
score range of 0 –56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 18 –24 mild to moderate severity and 25–30 
moderate to severe . 
  
Neuro imaging Measurements  
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  22  
Resting State fMRI (R -fMRI):  Approximately [ADDRESS_1124978] 
targeted analysis to e xplore whether treatment alters connectivity and network patterns with known 
abnormalities and that are specifically impacted by [CONTACT_812430] (e.g., fronto -striatal connectivity 
implicated in reward; see Heller et al., 201324).  
 
Clinical Laboratory Measurements  
 
Hematology and Blood Chemistry Profile:  Blood will be obtained at scree ning and primary outcome (week 
6) and sent to each site’s clinical hematology lab for a Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Electrolytes, Metabolic 
Panel, Thyroid Function Tests, Hepatic and Renal Function Tests. At screening, blood will also be obtained 
to assess for existing  TB infection.  
 
Pregnancy Test : A urine pregnancy test will be obtained from female subjects who are of childbearing age 
prior to their participation in the study (screening visit), at Visit 1 (Week 0), Visit 2 (Week 2), Visit 3 (Week 
4), and primary outco me Visit 4 (Week 6).  
 
Urinalysis and Urine Toxicology:  Urine will be obtained at the site’s clinical laboratory for determination 
of color, urine specific gravity, osmolality, cellules, proteins and bacteria prior to their participation in the 
study (scree ning visit) and at study primary outcome (week 6 ). A urine toxicology screen for drugs of abuse 
will be performed at screening and on the day of both the pre -treatment and post -treatment scans (Visit 
1 and 4).  
 
Blood Immunological Measures : Blood will be obtained at baseline and primary outcome to be analyzed 
for inflammatory biomarkers and neurotrophic biomarkers. In brief, inflammatory biomarkers and 
neurotrophic factors  will be measured using commercially available enzyme -linked immunosorbent 
assays  or multiplex panels to analyze several biomarkers at once . Serum  cytokine levels were chosen as 
biomarkers of inflammation because prior studies revealed a link between these biomarkers and 
depression.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered as an 
investigational product and that does  not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
  
An AE therefore can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laboratory finding), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with participation in an investigational study, whether o r not considered 
drug -related.  In addition to new events, any increase in the severity or frequency of a pre -existing 
condition that occurs after the subject signs a consent form for participation is considered an AE.  This 
includes any side effect, injur y, toxicity, or sensitivity reaction.  
IL-[ADDRESS_1124982]’s medical 
history and will not be recorded as AEs.  
 
8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)   
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
· Death  
· Life  threatening experience defined as any adverse experience t hat places the subject, in the view of 
the treating physician, at immediate risk of death at the time of occurrence; i.e, it does not include a 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
· Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_812411] (except scheduled 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29128] -acute, unrelated cause such as an elective surgery)  
· Results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
· Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of an exposed subject  
· Important  medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it j eopardizes the subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  
· Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1124983] be reported as an SAE.  
 
 
8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with func tioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equ ate to “serious”.]  
 
 
RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_21217]/her clinical jud gment. 
The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  27 • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The response to withdrawal of the 
study intervention (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related – Ther e is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within 
a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to  be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events).  Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or 
“definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, includ ing an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship 
improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention) and in w hich other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or 
evid ence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].]  
 
EXPECTEDNESS  
 
The Principal Investigator (PI)  will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event (AE) is 
expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of 
the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the s tudy intervention.]  
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND 
FOLLOW -UP 
 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study partic ipant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes event d escription, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study m ust be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  28 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. Howev er, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be perf ormed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21191] 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabili zation.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1124984] be recorded on the appropriate CRF/eCRF. All AE/SAEs that are considered related to study 
drugs must be followed to resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected. AE/SAEs that 
completely resolve and then recur should be recorded as a new AE/SAE. AE/SAEs that are considered 
related to study drug and continuing at [ADDRESS_1124985] a comment in the source 
documents by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_812412].  
  
Any SAE occurring during the study period (beginning with informed consent and lasting until [ADDRESS_1124986] dose of study drug) must be immediately reported no later than 3 business days  after 
learning of an SAE to the Study PI.  
  
All AE/SAEs with an onset date after the subject signs consent for study participation must be reported to 
the IRB at the time of annual renewal. Details of the event must include seriousness, severity, 
expectedness, rela tionship to study drug, duration, action taken, and outcome.   
  
All AE/SAEs that are drug -related and unexpected (not listed as treatment -related in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure) must be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_812413] 11.5 
“Unanticipated Problem Reporting”.  
 
To FDA  
A report on the MedWatch 3500A form must be sent to the FDA when the event is:  
 
(1) serious unexpected suspected reaction (the investigator judges there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship);  
(2) findings from other clinical, animal, or in -vitro studies that suggest significant human risk and  
(3) a clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction no later than 15 days 
after determining that the information qualifies for repo rting.  
  
The relevant health authorities will be notified of any unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) 
within the required reporting timelines (within 7 calendar days for fatal and life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs, or 
15 calendar days for all other S[LOCATION_003]Rs).  
IL-[ADDRESS_1124987] 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence s uggesting a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until satisfac tory resolution or until the site 
investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable.  
 
The study sponsor will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected ad verse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later 
than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.  In addition, the sponsor must 
notify FDA and all participating investigators in an Investigational New Drug (IND) safety report of 
potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later 
than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.  
 
 
8.3.7  REPORTING EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS   
 
Participants will be notified of any abnormal clinical lab findings and directed to appropriate medical 
care. In the event that a participant’s pregnancy test returns positive, the participant will be notified 
immediately and exited from the study.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1124988]  
 
Not applicable.  
 
8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
Subjects will be asked to immediately inform the study team and their  doctor if any of the following occur:  
· They  becom e pregnant while taking the study drug  
· They  miss their  menstrual period, or experiences unusual menstrual bleeding  
· They  stop using birth control  
· They  think, FOR ANY REASON, that they  may be pregnant  
  
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is participating in the study or within [ADDRESS_1124989] ’s 
administration of study drug are  considered expedited reportable events. The pregnancy will be 
considered an immediately reportable event and will be reported to the study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_874] 5 business days 
of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_223305].  
 
8.4 UNANTICIP ATED PROBLEMS  
8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol 11 March 2024  
30 The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the 
following criteria:  
•Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the
participant population being studied;
•Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome ma y have been caused by [CONTACT_572781]); and
•Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING 
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC)/lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will 
include the followi ng information:  
•Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project
number;
•A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;
•An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome
represents an UP;
•A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or
are proposed in response to the UP.
8.4.3 REPORTING  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS 
Not applicable. 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
●Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):
The primary efficacy endpoint is the completion of treatment measured as the receipt of all three 
Ixekizumab (160  mg at week 0, 80 mg at weeks 2 and 4) to assess the safety and feasibility of ixekizumab 
in patients with TRD. The analysis of the primary endpoint for this study will be descriptive and no 
formal hypothesis testing with be conducted.  
●Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):
Secondary efficacy endpoints include 1) Baseline -to-week -6 changes in depression severity, as measured 
by [CONTACT_45689] ; 2) Response and remission rates at week 6; 3) changes in other clinical symptoms ;4) 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  31 Baseline -to-week -6 changes in RSFC as evaluated by [CONTACT_812432]; 5) 
Baseline -to-week -6 changes in blood -based immune markers, including CRP and other immune markers; 
6) the relationship between baseline -to-week -6 changes in bl ood-based immune markers and RSFC with 
changes in depression severity scores. Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints will be considered 
exploratory and hypothesis -generating. Therefore, no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted.  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMI NATION  
 
In this study, up to 20 patients will be enrolled. We anticipate 80% of more of the sample will complete 
treatment (<20% early drop out) and the treatment will be well -tolerated with no treatment -related 
adverse effects. A sample size of 20 patients will produce a two -sided 95% confidence interval around 
the proportion who completed treatment with a width equal to 0.35 when the sample proportion is 0.8. 
Precision was estimated using PASS 2019  (26). 
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES  
 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population will consist of all enrolled subjects regardless of whether or not they actually 
received ixekizumab . This sample will be used for summaries and analyses of the primary endpoint and 
the secondary endpoints.  
 
 
Safety Analysis set  
The saf ety analysis set will include all enrolled  participants  who were given at least one dose of 
ixekizumab , and on whom any post -dose data are available and are classified according to the treatment 
actually received. The safety analysis set will be used to as sess safety and tolerability variables.   
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH  
 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive statistics: number of non -missing 
values, means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile range, maximum, and minimum.  Categorical 
variables will be summarized using number of non -missing values, counts and percentages .  
 
Rates of events will be calculated as the ratio of the total number of events recorded divided by [CONTACT_809572] -time. Total patient -time will be calculated by [CONTACT_260968] (in study time units, e.g., days o r  
months) that patients were at risk for a specific event from the reference time point until either study exit or 
the end of the time period of interest. Rates and their 95% confidence intervals will be reported.   
 
Time -to-event variables will be summar ized using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
 
For any variable measured at multiple points in time, change from baseline will be calculated as the 
difference between the value of the variable at a specific point in time (e.g. 6 weeks) minus the baseline 
value.  Rel ative change from baseline will be calculated as the value of a parameter at a specific point in 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  32 time minus the baseline value of the parameter divided by [CONTACT_812433].  Percent 
change will be calculated as the relative change multip lied by 100.  
All hypothesis  testing  will be conducted  at the 0.05  two-sided  significance  level  unless otherwise specified .   
P-values  will be rounded to three decimal  places. P-values  less than  0.001 will be reported as <0.001 in tables. 
P-values  greater than 0.999 will  be reported as  >0.999.  
Should any  of the statistical  methods  proposed prove  unsuitable during  data  analysis,  more  appropriate 
methods  will be used. These include data transformation  (for example  to a logarithmic  scale)  to satisfy  model  
assumptions  such as  normally  distributed residuals with constant  variance,  the application of non -parametric  
techniques or the use of a different link function or modeling technique. The SAP will be updated with the 
methods used and the justification for t he change prior to data set and database lock.  
 
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT (S) 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the completion of treatment measured by [CONTACT_812434] (160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at weeks 2 and 4)  to assess the safety and feasibility of 
ixekizumab in patients with TRD. The analysis of the primary endpoint for this study will be descriptive. 
The proportion of enrolled patients that complete treatment and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval wil l be reported.  
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S) 
1) Baseline -to-week -[ADDRESS_1124990] deviation, median, and interquartile range. Individual patient trajectories will be plotted over 
time to explore patterns in treatment response. Mean c hange in MADRS scores from baseline and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals will also be reported at each time point.  
2) Response and remission rates at week 6  
The number and proportion of patients who respond ot treatment and who remain in remission wi ll be 
reported at each time point.  
3) Baseline -to-week 6 changes in other clinical symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_139800]-S, CGI -I, QIDS -SR, C -SSRS, 
SHAPS, TEPS, and HAM -A. 
 
4) Baseline -to-week -6 changes in RSFC as evaluated by [CONTACT_812435].  
5) Baseline -to-week -6 changes in blood -based immune markers, including CRP and other immune markers  
Biomarkers will be analyzed in the same manner described  for MADRS scores above.  
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol  11 March 2024  
  33 6) the relationship between baseline -to-week -6 changes in blood -based immune markers and RSFC and 
BBB permeability with changes in depression severity scores.  
We will explore whether improving depressive symptoms correlate with ch anges in blood -based 
immune markers and RSFC and BBB permeability. MADRS scores will be plotted with biomarkers, RSFC, 
and BBB over time to evaluate trends descriptively. Fixed and mixed effects regression models may also 
be explored to estimate associatio ns and 95% confidence intervals.  
 
9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
All safety analyses will be conducted in the safety population . 
 
Safety and tolerability data will also be summarized descriptively. Adverse events will be categorized 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred terms. 
For each group, number and rates of  events and number and percent of patients will  be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_82523].  
 
All laboratory test results, vital signs, weight, and BMI will be summarized using descriptive statistics at 
each visit for raw numbers and change from  baseline. Suicidality measures based on the C -SSRS will be 
summarized for each treatment group using descriptive statistics at each assessment.   
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1124991] deviations, medians, interquartile range, maximum, and 
minimum.  Categorical variables will be summarized using number of non -missing values, counts and 
percentages .  
 
9.4.6 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
No interim analyses are planned.  
 
9.4.7 SUB-GROUP ANALYSES  
 
No sub -group analyses are planned.  
 
9.4.8 TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPAN T DATA 
 
Per NIMH policy, we will submit a final deidentified data set, listed by [CONTACT_8707],  as part of 
the data sharing plan.   
 
9.4.9 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
 
IL-17 Version V1.1  
Protocol 11 March 2024  
34 Treatment effects on R -fMRI data will be explored . It is hypothesized that Ixekizumab  will result in 
neuroimaging changes in resting state functional connectivity, and blood brain barrier permeabi lity, 
evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. As there are a number of serious, potential 
confound ers to the analysis of R -fMRI, advanced processing and analytic methods will be employed, 
including the use of robust artifact detection and re moval (Pruim et al., 2015). We will conduct targeted 
analysis to explore whether treatment alters connectivity and network patterns with known 
abnormalities and that are specifically impacted by [CONTACT_812430] (e.g., fronto -striatal connectivity 
implicated in reward; see Heller et al., 2013).

data) and clinical laboratory data will be entered into Redcap. The data system includes password 
protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear 
inconsistent, i ncomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source 
documents.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1124997] approval of a marketing 
application in an International Confer ence on Harminosation (ICH) region and until there are no pending 
or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least [ADDRESS_1124998] elapsed since the 
formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study intervention. These docum ents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be destroyed 
without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform 
the investigator when these do cuments no longer need to be retained.  
10.1.10  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS 
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP), or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participa nt, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP: 
•4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3
•5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1
•5.[ADDRESS_1124999] (IRB) per  their policies. The 
site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements. Further 
details about the handling of protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.

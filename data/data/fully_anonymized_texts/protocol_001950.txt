SPECIFIC AIMS    
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of trauma that can persist for decades 
and result in a major reduction in quality of life.2 Symptoms of PTSD occur in 21 - 31% of soldiers previously 
deployed to Iraq, 10 -31% of Veterans who served in Vietnam, and in similar percentages of victims of 
assaultive violence and civilian populations exposed to war or acts of violence.[ADDRESS_243145] two decades over the lifespan and has a significant 
lifetime risk of suicide.3 PTSD often disrupts interpersonal relationships, reduces the ability to work, decreases 
quality of life, and increases the risk of physical illnesses, substance abuse, and affective disorders.4  
The VA National Center  for PTSD recommends evidence -based pharmacologic and behavioral 
interventions for PTSD, including medications  (selective serotonin -reuptake inhibitors and prazosin), and 
psychotherapeutic approaches (cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, stress management skills training, and 
eye movement desensitization reprocessing -EMDR).5 Cognitive processing therapy (CPT), has been found to 
be effective in the treatment of PTSD in randomized clinical trials.6 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_203894], many persons with PTSD continue to experience persistent PTSD symptoms, as well as anger, 
difficulties with interpersonal relationships, shame, and grief.7  
Increasing evidence suggests that as many as half of Veterans seen in VA primary care settings report  
using Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) interventions to address a variety of difficulties8 and 
that many do so to limit their use of medications and to ensure that their social and spi[INVESTIGATOR_203895].9 A CAM intervention that holds promise for addressing PTSD  and depression among Veterans is 
Loving -Kindness Meditation (LKM). Consistent with Fredrickson’s broaden -and-build model of positive 
emotions, LKM has been shown to broaden individuals’ emotional repertoires through increased positive 
emotions, which medi ates the building of a range of personal resources  (e.g., improved social support or a 
sense of environmental mastery), which in turn leads to improved clinical outcomes (e.g., reduced 
depression).10 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_203896], enhanced persona l resources, and reductions 
in PTSD and depressive symptoms.  
The proposed study is a randomized, controlled non -inferiority trial that will assess whether LKM results 
in improvement in PTSD symptoms and depression that are not meaningfully different than Cognitive 
Processing Therapy —Cognitive only (CPT -C), among Veterans with current PTSD. PTSD symptoms will be 
measured by [CONTACT_26055] - CAPS and depression will be measured by [CONTACT_203931].11  Additional analyses will assess whether mediators of response are consistent with the 
mechanisms conceptualized for each intervention. One hundred seventy Veterans with PTSD will be 
randomized to LKM (n = 85) or CPT -C (n = 85). Comprehensive assessments will take place post -treatment 
and 3 - and 6 - months later. The following specific aims will be accomplished through the proposed clinical trial:  
Aim 1:  Evaluate if LKM is non-inferior  to CPT-C in producing reductions in PTSD symptoms among Veterans 
with current PTSD.   
Hypothesis 1:  Veterans randomized to LKM will report mean reductions in PTSD symptom severity  
that are no t meaningfully  worse than CPT-C, as indicated by a lower limit of t he 95% confidence 
interval for  difference in 6-month mean CAPS scores  that is greater than -10 (corresponding to a 
standardized effect size of 0.5 between randomization arms ). Results will also be assessed  at the 
immediate post -test and 3 -month time intervals.  
Aim 2:  Evaluate the non -inferiority of LKM and CPT -C in producing reductions in depressive symptoms among 
Veterans with current PTSD.   
Hypothesis 2:  Veterans randomized to LKM will report mean reduct ions in depressive symptoms that 
are not meaningfully worse than CPT -C, as indicated by a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for 
difference in [ADDRESS_243146] and 3 -month time intervals.  
Exploratory Aim:  Evaluate potential mediators of response to LKM and to CPT to provide preliminary 
information regarding whether they are consistent with the mechanisms of change conceptualized by [CONTACT_203932].  
Exploratory Hypothesis 1:  Enhanced self -compassion will more strongly mediate PTSD and 
depressive symptom improvement for those assigned to LKM than those assigned to CPT -C. 
Exploratory Hypothesis  2: Reductions in posttraumatic maladaptive beliefs will more strongly mediate 
PTSD and depressive symptom improvement for those a ssigned to CPT -C than those assigned to 
LKM. 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNI FICANCE  
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of trauma that can persist for decades 
and result in a major reduction in quality of life.2 PTSD affects approximately 8% of the general population of 
the US. The clinical hallmarks of PTSD include recurrent, intrusive recollections or reexperiencing of a 
trauma tic event, avoidance of external or internal cues that can trigger reexperiencing, emotional numbing, and 
hyperarousal.[ADDRESS_243147] on quality of life than major depression and 
obsessive -compulsive disorder.14 Symptoms of PTSD occur in 21 to 31% of soldiers previously deployed to 
Iraq,15 10-31%[ADDRESS_243148] two decades over the lifespan2 and has a significant lifetime 
risk of suicide; PTSD has a stronger association with suicidality than any other anxiety disorder.3 PTSD often 
disrupts interpersonal relationships, reduces the ability to work, impairs quality of life, and increases the risk of 
physical illnesses, substance abuse, and  affective disorders.4 Among  individuals seeking treatment for PTSD, 
the rate of PTSD/depression comorbidity was found to be nearly 50% in the original national comorbidity study 
sample.[ADDRESS_243149] higher rates of suicidal  ideation than 
those with either disorder alone, though rates of actual suicide attempts are consistent across those with PTSD 
only and comorbid PTSD/depression, and both groups report significantly higher rates than those with 
depression only.18 Comorbid PTSD and depression is also associated with grea ter risk of various physical 
conditions than is PTSD alone.4 Thus, PTSD complicated by [CONTACT_3252] -occurring depression is associated with even 
greater suffering and compromised functioning than is PTSD alone.  
The VA National Center for PTSD recommends evidenc e-based pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic 
interventions for PTSD, including medications (selective serotonin -reuptake inhibitors and prazosin), and 
psychotherapeutic approaches (cognitive therapy, exposure therapy, stress management skills training, and 
eye movement desensitization reprocessing -EMDR).5 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) produce 
improvement in the major symptom clusters of PTSD, although the magnitude of the treatment effect is 
modest.[ADDRESS_243150] on all of the PTSD symptom clusters.19 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_203897], 
many persons with PTSD continue to experience persistent PTSD symptoms, as well as anger, difficulties with 
interpersonal relationships, shame, and grief.7 Psychotherapeutic techniques are often combined with 
pharmacotherapy in the treatment of PTSD.  Prolonged exp osure (PE) therapy facilitates emotional processing 
of the traumatic event, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_203898].20 However, PE is difficult for many Veteran s to complete, as evidenced by a high dropout rate (38%).[ADDRESS_243151] 
rather than as a group treatment, which limits the ability to efficiently deliver these interventions to large 
numbers of persons.  Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) can be delivered either individually or in group 
settings and has some initial supp ort for efficacy in addressing PTSD among Veteran s. In addition to concerns 
about dropout for some Veteran s, another potential shortcoming of current treatment for PTSD is the lack of 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_203899]. Psychiatric conditions other 
than PTSD commonly co -occur with PTSD,[ADDRESS_243152] implementation are needed . 
Evidence indicates that about 15% of the US adult population utilizes mind -body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], with a 
significantly higher rate found among persons with two or more chronic dise ases.24 Emerging evidence 
indicates that Veteran s also use various co mplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions at high 
rates.  A large multisite study of VA outpatients found that 27% of Veteran s had utilized some form of CAM in 
the past year.25  Another study of Veteran s found that nearly 5 0% reported using a CAM intervention, and high 
daily stress, chronic medical illness and a perceived negative impact of military service on mental or physical 
health were significant predictors of CAM use.[ADDRESS_243153] 
experience offering meditation -based interventions as a clinical service to Veteran s provides additional 
evidence that LKM is likely to be an acceptable treatment modality among Veteran s.  
Loving -Kindness Meditation (LKM) is a CAM approach that facilitates increased positive emotions 
through meditation exercises designed to develop feeli ngs of warmth, kindness, and compassion for self and 
others. A growing body of literature indicates that self -compassion is associated with healthy psychological 
functioning (including life satisfaction and social connectedness), and negatively associated with self -criticism, 
rumination, thought suppression, anxiety and depression.[ADDRESS_243154] clinical manifestations of PTSD.  In a study of PTSD symptoms in university 
students, greater self -compassion significantly correlated with lower rates of avoidance symptoms, but not re -
experiencing or hyperarousal,28 suggesting that individuals with higher self -compassion may engage in fewer 
avoidance strategies. ‘Compassionate mind training,’ which is an intervention designed to teach self -
compassion, was offered to six individuals in a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_203900]. [ADDRESS_243155] rarely felt 
safe or reassured. Pervasive feelings of shame and guilt are common in the setting of PTSD.  
Increasing evidence supports LKM as a technique for enhancing positive emotions and health 
generally.  Support for the efficacy o f LKM to increase positive emotions was found in a study by [CONTACT_203933].10 This study was conducted with 13 9 community dwelling individuals employed by a single 
company. The subjects were randomized to either LKM (n=67) or waitlist control (n=72). Those in the LKM 
group reported significantly greater positive emotions and were significantly less depressed at th e end -point 
assessment than the no -LKM group, even though both groups reported a similar frequency of negative 
emotions day -to-day. They also found that positive emotions persisted after meditation sessions ended, and 
that over time, repeated LKM practice produced a cumulative increase in positive emotions on subsequent 
days, regardless of whether the individual had practiced meditation on that day.10 A pi[INVESTIGATOR_203901] a group that underwent LKM (n=18) with a group receiving 
standard care (n = 22) and found that those in the LKM group reported lower pain ratings, less anger , and less 
psychological distress (note: positive emotions do not appear to have been assessed).30 Another study of LKM, 
performed in a  group of community participants, indicated that a single brief session of LKM training led to 
increased self -esteem and sense of social connectedness relati ve to a control condition.31 In a report of case 
studies in which LKM was taught to persons with schizophrenia, LKM appeared to be of potential benefit for 
persistent negative symptoms.32 
In LKM practice, a person sits quietly and calls to mind a particular person (e.g., a good friend) and 
focuses on bringing a sense of positive regard to that ind ividual through a series of standard phrases invoking 
the desire for safety, happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], health, and ease or peace for them. Classically, four phrases are used, such 
as: “may you be safe, ” “may you be happy, ” “may you be healthy,” and  “may your life unfold with ease.” Next, 
the person brings positive regard to other individuals or categories of people, including themselves, neutral 
persons , and those who have caused difficulty or harm (see Approach section), changing the phrases as 
needed (i.e., “ may you be safe” becomes “ may I be safe”).[ADDRESS_243156] 
self and others is intended to change the orientation to one’s self, others, one’s life experiences, and to result 
in a broadening of the range of emotional responses and choices available. Loving -kindness practice has its 
roots in t he Buddhist tradition, but as described above an increasing number of studies have successfully 
applied it as a non -religious practice. The phrase loving -kindness derives from the Pali word metta, which can 
be translated as “love” or “unconditional friendl iness,” or “loving -kindness,” akin to the Greek word “agape,” 
which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_203902]. The words loving -kindness are intended to 
describe an emotional state that is not a sentimental love or a feeling of passion. Rathe r, it can be described as 
an unconditional friendliness, benevolence, and openness toward experience – even difficult experience.  
It can be postulated that the intentional cultivation of kindness and acceptance promoted in LKM 
practice will positively inf luenc e multiple aspects of recovery from trauma.  Although the factors described 
below might also be developed through mindfulness practice (e.g. , in MBSR through breathing meditation),  
LKM is a distinct form of practice that is often considered more accessible and therefore more helpful to 
persons who are in significant ongoing distress.  Simply said, many persons find it easier , and more helpful , to 
adopt and stay with a  practice of LKM, which relies on the repetition of simple phrases meant to foster 
kindness and compassion towards self and others , as compared to practicing breathing or body scan 
meditation. This may be particularly true when an individual is in severe emotional pain.   This is in agreement 
with the recommendations of Buddhist teachers, who have been reported to recommend  LKM practice instead 
of other forms of practice when people are in significant distress.33  The lives of persons with PTSD are marked 
by [CONTACT_203934] (and often accompanying physical) pain , including the hallmark emotion of fear . 
In the historical Buddhist record, LKM was originally taught as a way of working with and ‘staying with’ the 
strong emotion of fear, which , as noted,  is the predominant emotional experience in PTSD. Indeed, one of th e 
core features of PTSD  is thought to be a phobic response to reminders of a traumatic event and to the 
memories associated with that event, which in conjunction with information processing problems, lead to 
pervasive fear and poor functioning.[ADDRESS_243157], as well the tendency to avoid 
reminders of the trauma in social situations, often result in withdrawal from close relationships.35 The repetition 
of LKM phrases can be hypothesized to  represent a mechanism to recreate a  safe ‘holding environment ,’ 
which in LKM is created by [CONTACT_6270]-directed phrases of positive intention .  This may prove particularly helpful when 
kindness and support are lacking in the environment.   Social support has been shown to be an important factor 
in recovery from PTSD .[ADDRESS_243158], behaviors, and quality of life.10, 37  The broaden -and-build theory 
proposes that positive emotions momentarily broaden a person’s attention and thinking, and with this 
broadened outlook they are able to build personal resources. A key postulate in the broaden -and-build theory 
is that posit ive emotions broaden a person’s thought -action repertoire.37  As described by [CONTACT_3717]: “Joy 
sparks the urge to play, interest sparks the urge to explore, contentment sparks the urge to savour and 
integrate, and love sparks a recurring cycle of each of these urges within safe, close relationships.”37 The 
broadened mindset associated with positive emotions is contrasted to a narrow focus often associated with 
negative emotions, and characterized by [CONTACT_203935], repetitious thought -action tendencies (e.g., fight or flight).  A 
second key postulate of the broaden -and-build theory is that the broadened mindset associated with positive 
emotions leads to the building of enduring personal resources.  These  personal resources are thought to arise 
through new thought -action sequences such as play, curiosity, and openness to new situations and ideas, as 
well as new social interactions. Personal resources built may include cognitive resources (e.g., the ability  to 
mindfully attend to the present moment), psychological (e.g., a sense of purpose in life, self -acceptance  or self -
compassion , or a sense of environmental mastery) social (e.g., improved ability to give and receive social 
support) or physical (e.g., red uced susceptibility to stress -associated illnesses).[ADDRESS_243159] developed these personal resources are more likely to successfully 
navigate life’s challenges and live happi[INVESTIGATOR_3694], heal thier lives.  
There is growing evidence in support of the broaden -and-build theory.  The ‘broaden’ hypothesis 
predicts that positive emotions broaden a person’s attention and thinking.  Support for this hypothesis comes 
from studies of experimentally -induc ed positive emotional states (through LKM in some cases as well as 
through other means), which show that positive emotions broaden the scope of a person’s visual attention, 
increases one’s openness to new experiences,  improves ability to accept critical fe edback, improves ability to 
recognize persons of another race,38 broadens one’s repertoire of desired ac tions, and enhances a sense of 
connection with others.[ADDRESS_243160] control (d escribed in detail 
above), the findings supported both the ‘broaden’ aspect (enhanced positive emotions) as well as the ‘build’ 
part of the theory (enhanced personal resources).[ADDRESS_243161] 
off symptoms of depression.  Similarly, in the proposed trial, we hypothesize that personal resources will be 
built as a resul t of LKM practice, which will positively influence both depressive and PTSD symptoms.  
Mediators  
Identification of active components  of treatments is a priority for treatment research.39  The proposed study will 
evaluate potential mediators of  change thought to be specific to each intervention.   
LKM:  We will evaluate  whether enhanced self -compassion  mediates change  in PTSD and depression  for 
LKM. Self-compassion can be considered a healthy form of self -acceptance. Neff defines self -compassion as 
comprised of three facets:  (1) treating oneself kindly and without harsh judgment in the setting of pain and 
failure, (2) perceiving that mistakes and hardships are part of the common huma n experience rather than 
isolating, and (3) maintaining mindful, non -judgmental awareness of thoughts and feelings rather than or 
overidentifying with them.[ADDRESS_243162] from self -esteem, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_203903]’s abilities and characteristics are compared to standards.[ADDRESS_243163] than for those in the LKM arm of the study.  
CPT-C:  We will evaluate whether reductions in posttraumatic maladaptive cognitions mediates improvement  in 
PTSD and in depression for CPT -C. CPT is hypothesized to facilitate improved emotional processing through 
repeated practice restructuring dysfunctional beliefs and appraisals of situations that are related to the 
individual’s trauma history, which lead  to painful affect and reactive behavioral choices.43, [ADDRESS_243164] the opportunity to evaluate whether this is the case for Veterans who participate in group -based 
CPT-C. 46 We will also be able to assess whether  reductions in maladaptive cognitions also mediates 
reductions in PTSD for those who receive training in LKM.  
The Approach:  What LKM Is and Isn’t 
Having provided an overview of what LKM is, we also believe it is important to delineate it from other 
approaches with which it may be confused. First, although both LKM and mindfulness meditation practices 
involve sitting meditation, typi[INVESTIGATOR_203904], the y differ  in several 
respects. Mindfulness meditation cultivates the ability to pay attention, without judgment in the present 
moment, whereas LKM specifically develops the ability to experience kindness, w armth, and openheartedness 
toward self and others. The intentionality of LKM is toward developi[INVESTIGATOR_203905], rather than developi[INVESTIGATOR_55765] -judgmental awareness. Second, LKM differs from intercessory prayer. 
Although in LKM pr actice the phrases repeated express the intention of wellbeing for self and others (see 
below), it is made clear that there is no expectation that the LKM phrases will actually benefit others. Instead, it 
is made explicit that the goal of LKM practice is t o benefit oneself, such that in developi[INVESTIGATOR_203906] , the person who holds this intention actually benefits. 
Unfortunately the intercessory prayer literature has not evaluated whether praying for others has a salutary 
effect on the people doing the praying, though research on spi[INVESTIGATOR_203907], including prayer activity, has 
found that Veteran s with greater spi[INVESTIGATOR_203908].[ADDRESS_243165] of LKM is 
that in the process of choosing phrases of positive intention (which carry personal meaning for a participant), 
clarification of values and one’s intentions occurs.  LKM is also distinct from practices explicitly intended to 
promote forgiveness, although forgiveness may occur through LKM practice. For the purposes of scientific 
study, we have chosen to not include explicit forgiveness practice as part of our study. In LKM, the practice is 
intended to develop the ability to look at others and see oneself, and in so doing, develop self -compassion and 
compassion for others. An expanded understanding of the commonality of human experience, such that  all 
humans suffer and all desire happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], which is fostered by [CONTACT_203936], is likely to lead to forgiveness. In addition , 
LKM is also distinct from the practice of verbalizing positive affirmations. While there may be some overlap with 
regard to the shared emp hasis on positivity, affirmations tend to be stated as though they are definite personal 
qualities and are intended to strengthen self -confidence (e.g., “I am a good, kind person”), whereas LKM is 
usually stated as an invitation or request that is intended  to tap into the intention for kindness and compassion 
for oneself and for others (e.g., “ may I be safe from harm;” “ may you be happy and healthy”). Importantly, 
another way that LKM is distinct from positive affirmations is that LKM is a meditation practi ce intended to 
broaden attention and allow positive emotions to remain in awareness for sustained periods of time. Finally, 
LKM is not intended to be used to remove painful thoughts or feelings. Rather than attempting to rid oneself of 
these experiences, i t is anticipated that individuals with PTSD can learn through LKM that pain can co -exist 
with positive feelings because, after all, it is part of being human to experience both. This may help address the 
phenomenon that we have frequently observed clinical ly wherein individuals with PTSD are afraid to 
experience positive emotions because it is painful when they end. By [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -learning (or learning for the first time) 
that it is safe to feel good and that it is normal to have good feelings (and painful ones) tha t wax and wane, the 
often profound emotional numbing typi[INVESTIGATOR_203909].48  
Overview of Proposed Intervention s 
Intervention #1 :  Loving -Kindness Meditation (LKM)  
The LKM course follows the instructions for LKM as described by [CONTACT_203937].33 During the12 meetings 
the ten to  twelve  group participants will receive instruction from two expert meditation teacher s (who will co -
teach the sessions)  in the practice of LKM, including both in -session  practice of LKM and group discussions. 
The intervention is designed to allow patients to adopt skills and techniques they can continue to practice 
without the need for an ongoing relationship with a therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. LKM is taught in a non -religious format.  A class-
by-class outline is provided in the participant workbook (Appendix 3). 
In order to help develop concentration, a necessary component of LKM practice, the first two sessions 
focus on cultivating mindful attention of one’s breath. The primary LKM practic e begins in week 3, and involves 
sitting in a comfortable, relaxed position with closed eyes or a neutral visual focus and then bringing to mind 
various categories of beings – self and others. The meditator is then asked to gently repeat phrases to the 
person who he or she has brought to mind; these phrases are intended to have meaning in terms of what is 
wished for that person. In order to facilitate stepped learning, the class begins their LKM practice focusing on a 
positive benefactor and over the remain ing nine weeks other individuals and categories of individuals are 
introduced, including the self and people who have caused the participant difficulty or harm.  
Intervention #2:  Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT). The CPT intervention is based on Patricia  Resick and 
colleagues’ manual for treating PTSD among military veterans.49 This version of CPT highlights both combat traumas 
and interpersonal violence and is therefore more appropriate for our population than the original version, which 
focuses on adult rape survivors. (See CPT manual:  Appendix 4) CPT evolved directly out of S ocial-cognitive 
Information Processing Theory (SCIPT), which posits that deficits in emotional and cognitive processing of traumatic 
events lead to the development of PTSD.[ADDRESS_243166] self -
blame or hindsight bias. Later sessions address over -generalized beliefs about the self and others that result 
from a traumatic event. CPT focuses on over -generalized trauma -related beliefs relevant to five key areas:  
safety, trust, power, esteem, and intimacy. Over the course of treatment, clients learn to identify and modify 
these beliefs in order to develop more balanced, flexible, and ultimately, more adaptive beliefs.  
Cognitive processing therapy (CPT), has been found to be effective in the treatment of PTSD in 
randomized clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_203938], including survivors of sexual and physical assaul t51 and combat Veterans.52 In these trials, CPT 
was effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression for up to 5 to ten years.51  CPT has also been 
found to be effective in reducing negative emotions such as grief, shame, guilt and anger.51, 52 Based on these 
randomized clinical trials, CPT is being widely disseminated, including to the US Veterans’ Administration (VA) 
mental health system.  
A version of CPT that does not include writing a trauma narrative has also been evaluated, CPT -C, and 
has been found to be as sociated with more rapid improvement than standard CPT -C as well as comparable 
outcomes to standard CPT.44 The elimination of the trauma narrative mak es CPT -C more conducive to a 
group -based delivery platform as it reduces the risk that group participants will be traumatized by [CONTACT_203939]’s 
stories. CPT -C has recently been shown to be effective in a group format for Veterans, active duty military 
perso nnel, and reservists with PTSD.6 In a randomized controlled trial (N=107), group CPT -C was compared to 
present -centered therapy (PCT) and the former found to be more effective than the latter in reducing PTSD 
and depressive symptoms in active duty military personal with PTSD.  Between group comparisons showed 
that the CPT -C group had significantly greater improvement in PTSD symptoms than PCT with a medium 
effect size (d=0.42; p = 0.03).6  
Importance of Study Findings to VHA :  The demand for mental health services provided by [CONTACT_203940] - more than a half millions Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom 
(OIF/OEF) Veterans have sought VHA care while the number of Vietnam Veterans receiving VHA mental 
health servic es has doubled over the past decade.53 PTSD is highly prevalent among Veterans, with 
prevalence rates 14of approximately 20 - 30% of combat Veterans.15 16 A study of approximately 104,000 
OIF/OEF Veterans found that  25% received a mental health diagnosis when they accessed VA health care, 
and of these, 13% were diagnosed with PTSD.[ADDRESS_243167] effective, approach to mental health care delivery.    
A key tenet of patient -centered care is that health care practitioners listen to and honor patient and 
family perspectives and ch oices. Patient and family knowledge, values, beliefs , and cultural backgrounds are 
incorporated into the planning and delivery of care.  This study would provide information to help patients 
decide whether a contemplative practice , such as LKM meditation , presents a viable alternative to a trauma -
focused behavioral intervention such as CPT -C.  
PRELIMINARY STUDIES  
Drs. Kearney, Simpson, Rodgers , and Zhou are an experienced team of investigators that has conducted 
and/or collaborated on numerous interventions for PTSD ,56-59 including other studies of a meditation -based 
intervention  (MBSR) , as well as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_203910].[ADDRESS_243168] measures o n a frequent basis . In addition, the research team has experience in 
managing longitudinal data and enhancing participant recruitment and retention in populations that typi[INVESTIGATOR_203911].  
LKM for PTSD  
In an open pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], 42 Veteran s with PTSD (mean age 54 years, 58% male) took part in a once 
weekly, [ADDRESS_243169] -LKM. Analyses calculated standardized mean differences (SMD; with 95% confidence 
intervals) between b aseline and post -LKM, and between baseline and 3 -month follow -up. Measures included 
assessment of clinical phenomena hypothesized to be broadened by [CONTACT_203941] (built) by [CONTACT_203942] . Clinical ou tcomes assessed were PTSD symptoms 
and depression, assessed using the PTSD symptom scale interview (PSS -I)61 and NIH PROMIS measure for 
depression.11  Potentially broadened phenomena assessed included positive emotions, identification with one’s 
symptoms ( decenter ing), and executive cognitive function (attention allocation) . Personal resources w ith the 
potential to be ‘built’ through LKM were assessed, and are summarized in the table below.  Using procedures 
recommended to assess mediation in within -subject designs, the influence of self -compassion (assessed by 
[CONTACT_193526] -compassion scale; SCS40) as a potential mediator of change in PTSD symptoms and depression, 
between baseline and follow -up was analyzed.  Results:  Compliance with the intervention was high; 86% 
attended 5 or more classes, and 74% attended 9 -12 classes.  Additi onally, compliance with the research 
protocol was high , with 38 of 42 participants (90%) providing data at the post -test and at the [ADDRESS_243170] sizes (SMD) are presented in Table 1 below:

These results indicate that following involvement in the LKM intervention, the participants showed both 
broadening via improvements in attention allocation, increases in less activ ated positive emotions (i.e., calm, 
serene, content, relaxed), a decrease in unpleasant emotions (activated and deactivated ) and increased ability 
to decenter or detach from identi fication with their symptoms.  The results also demonstrate an increase in built 
personal resources, including improved self -compassion, mindfulness, sense of purpose in life, environmental 
mastery, and sense of social support. In addition, a large effect size was found for PTSD symptoms from 
baseline to [ADDRESS_243171] -LKM (d = -0.89), and a medium effect size was found for depression from baseline to 
3-month follow -up (d = -0.49).  Mediation analyses showed that self -compassion mediated change s in PTSD 
symptoms and depression.  Conclusions :  LKM appears safe and acceptable for Veteran s with PTSD, and is 
associated with reduced symptoms of PTDS and depression.  We also found evidence that participation in 
LKM is associated with an increase in key personal resources suggested by [CONTACT_3717]’s broaden -and-build 
theory.   
Other Studies of Meditation Interventions for PTSD:  Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)  
Drs. Kearney and Simpson have performed two pi[INVESTIGATOR_203912].   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] #1:  Relationship between MBSR participation, PTSD symptoms and QOL (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_203913],

MBSR, delivered in groups of 20 -30 Veteran s representing a mix of clinical and research patients.  Of 
92 subjects (22 female), nearly three -quarters screened positive for P TSD.  Results:   The mean 
number of class sessions attended was 5.7 ± 2.83, out of 9 possible classes.  Sixty -nine participants 
(74%) attended at least 4 class sessions. Main results are presented below in Table 2.

Additional Ongoing Randomized Controlled Trial of MBSR   
          We are conducting a study titled “A randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a mindfulness -based 
intervention for Gulf War Syndrome,” funded as a VA merit review.  (Co -P.I.’s [CONTACT_203968] and Dr. S. Hunt, 
with [CONTACT_137229] is a co -invest igator). The goals are to establish feasibility and collect efficacy data regarding 
MBSR for Veteran s with medically unexplained illnesses (Gulf War Syndrome). Outcomes include fatigue, 
pain, cognitive failures, and neuropsychological testing.  PTSD, depre ssion, and QOL are also assessed.  
Recruitment and follow -up has been completed and data analysis is underway . This project allowed us to 
refine recruitment methods that consistently result ed in recruitment of 6 -8 Veteran s per month with Gulf War 
Syndrome - a relatively uncommon condition.  The rate of recruitment in this study is approximately the same 
as will be required for the current grant application.    
Additional Experience with Treatment Outcome Studies  
• Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating Prazosin for Alcohol Dependence (AD).  [CONTACT_137229] conducted a 6 -
week, double -blind, placebo -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_203916].68 
Participants entering treatment for alcohol dependence (AD) were randomized (N=24) and completed IVR 
telephone monitoring once per day to provide reports of alcohol use and cravings. Twenty of the 24 (83%) 
completed the tr ial. The compliance rate on the IVR daily monitoring for the 20 completers was 94.5%. [CONTACT_137230] is currently extending this research in an NIAAA -funded R01 evaluating prazosin for AD and as 
part of an NIAAA funded center P20 evaluating prazosin for indiv iduals with comorbid PTSD and AD 
(R01AA017184, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_203917]; P20 AA017839 -01, Center PI: [INVESTIGATOR_203918]; Study PI: [INVESTIGATOR_203917] ). Both studies use 
daily Interactive Voice Response (IVR) monitoring to collect close to real -time information regarding 
drinking, mood, PTSD ( P20 only), and medication compliance.  
• IVR Daily Monitoring of Reducing Alcohol Use & PTSD w/ Cognitive Restructuring and Experiential 
Acceptance.  [CONTACT_137229] (PI) and colleagues have completed recruitment for a study examining use of 
IVR to evaluate mechan isms of change associated with two copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], experiential acceptance and 
cognitive restructuring, as compared to an attention control, for decreasing alcohol use and PTSD in 
PTSD/AUD individuals (n = 78). Preliminary results indicate that the over all follow -up rate and IVR 
compliance rate are both 91%. These findings support the feasibility of using frequent monitoring strategies 
and demonstrate our ability to recruit and retain individuals with pronounced psychiatric impairment ( 1 R21 
AA [ZIP_CODE] -01, PI: [INVESTIGATOR_203917]) . 
Summary of Preliminary Studies   
 Our previous research demonstrates: (1) empi[INVESTIGATOR_203919] a relationship between participation in LKM 
and reduced PTSD symptomatology and reduced depressive symptoms; (2) that Veteran s with PTSD can 
safely participate in LKM, and find the intervention acceptable; ( 3) our ability to successfully screen, recruit and 
retain Veteran s with PTSD in clinical trials; ( 4) support for our ability to collect and effectively analyze  frequent 
monitoring data in P TSD populations ; Together, these examples of our past accomplishments indicate that we 
have a strong team with relevant experience and expertise that is capable of carrying out the proposed work 
and thus adding important information to the knowledge base r egarding treatment options for Veteran  with 
PTSD.  
APPROACH  
Design Overview and Rationale  
The proposed study is a randomized controlled non -inferiority trial comparing Loving -Kindness Meditation 
(LKM) w ith Cognitive Processi ng Therapy – Cognitive only (CPT -C) for treatment of PTSD and depression 
among Veterans recruited from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System. Veterans (N = 1 70) with PTSD will 
be randomized to receive 12 weeks of either LKM (n = 85) or CPT -C (n = 85).  The two interventions are 
structurally similar - Each intervention meets for 90 minutes per week for twelve weeks; t he overall amount of 
treatment time is the same across the two interventions. Both interventions will be delivered to groups of 
Veterans by [CONTACT_203945], and f idelity coding from audiotapes will evaluate protocol adherence. 
Participants will complete brief online assessments weekly for the [ADDRESS_243172] -intervention.  I n-person assessment s 
will be performed by a blinded assessor.  
Use of an Active Control Arm:   The active control will account for the non -specific elements of LKM (e.g., 
group support, positive expectancy). The proposed control arm is  CPT-C, which will provide the same amount 
of clinician -exposure time  (it is also a group -based, 12 -week duration, 90 -minute per session program ).  Similar 
to LKM, CPT-C is taught by [CONTACT_203946] ; allegiance of the 
researcher/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_203920] n to be strong predictor of treatment outcomes .69  CPT-C therefore 
contains key elements of an active control – it is structurally similar to LKM (thus controlling for non -specific 
elements of the intervention)  and given that it is an accepted PTSD treatment, CPT -C will  foster positive 
expectation for inte rvention success by [CONTACT_203947][INVESTIGATOR_133224].  Each of these elements ha s been 
described as necessary for an appropriate active control.70  
Settings, Recruitment, and Participants  
Settings.  The study’s clinical activities will take place at VAPSHCS; Seattle Division. In FY10 over 17,700 
Veteran s with chart diagnoses of PTSD received care at VAPSHCS and over 10,000 of them had a mental 
health stop code, indicating that the majority were likely invested in addressing their PTSD symptoms. VA 
Puget Sound has the nation’s largest clinical program for  PTSD.   
Recruitment.  The primary mechanism of recruitment will be letters sent to Veteran s with a diagnosis of 
PTSD (as identified using a VA database called the Corporate Data Warehouse ; CDW ).  To illustrate the 
effectiveness of this method, we are currently conducting a trial of MBSR for Gulf War Syndrome (see 
preliminary studies) for which we are already successfully recruiting at the same rate as for the proposed RCT.  
Thus, the goal of re cruiting [ADDRESS_243173] 250 male and female Veterans over age 18 with a current 
DSM -IV diagnosis of PTSD  enrolled at VAPSHCS who will provide informed consent and undergo in -perso n 
screening .  Of these, we anticipate that  170 individuals with PTSD who meet study criteria  will be randomized . 
Gender and ethnic/racial distribution of the participants is expected to mirror that of our prior PTSD MBSR 
studies in which similar recruitmen t strategies were used; that is 40% female, 79% Caucasian, 8% African 
American, 6.5% Hispanic, and 6.5% other .  
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria.  Inclusion criteria: current DSM -IV diagnosis of PTSD, age  [ADDRESS_243174] be willing to not participate in Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)  
or other meditation/yoga programs, as well as Prolonged Exposure (PE) th erapy  during the study period.  
Exclusion criteria: current substance use dependence disorder other than alcohol; alcohol involvement that 
poses a safety concern (i.e., currently drinking and has a past year history of alcohol -related seizures or 
delirium t remens) or is associated with an inability to follow through on assessments and class attendance as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_203948], suicide attempt or suicidal ideation with 
intent or plan, self -harm in the past month, a ps ychotic disorder, uncontrolled bipolar disorder, chart diagnoses 
of borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder, in -patient admission for psychiatric reasons 
within the past month, prior participation in  MBSR , LKM, or CPT . Medication , supportive individual or group 
counseling, case management, and self -help programs will be allowed concurrently and assessed as potential 
covariates. Note: we will use DSM -V criteria for all inclusion/exclusion criteria and relevant outcomes when 
they be come available.  
Sequence of Study Visits  
Telephone Screen.  Veteran s who contact [CONTACT_203949]. 
Veteran s who remain interested will undergo a 15 -20 minute telephone screen to ascertain basic 
inclusion/exclusio n criteria.  
In-person Screen and Baseline Assessment.  Following informed consent, participants will undergo a [ADDRESS_243175] standardized interviews for the presence of exclusionary 
disorders (relevant subsections of th e MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview) and for diagnosing PTSD 
(Clinician Administered PTSD Survey; CAPS).71 Self-report measures will be administered on a VA -approved 
computer.  Those who are eligible to continue the study will receive their randomization assignment within 
approximately one week and will begin either LKM or CPT-C within one month.  
Weekly Onlin e Assessments.  Participants will complete brief online measures of PTSD and depressive 
symptomatology, the hypothesized mediators of change  (self-compassion and maladaptive posttraumatic 
cognitions), and homework activity for [ADDRESS_243176] -treatment assessment within a week of 
completing LKM or CPT-C, and will repeat the assessment battery 3 - and 6-months thereafter.  
Randomization  
We will utilize a blocked randomization approach stratified by  [CONTACT_203950][INVESTIGATOR_203921] (60 or higher)[ADDRESS_243177]. 
Baseline severity of PTSD will be dichotomiz ed based on CAPS scores > 59. Because our pi[INVESTIGATOR_203922], we will not include that in the randomization 
stratification. Similarly, we  chose not to stratify on gender because our pi[INVESTIGATOR_203923] -up. A series of randomization tables will be constructed and will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_23164] . Subjects will be randomized in small blocks of varying size using 
concealed allocation, after the baseline assessment and within two weeks before the next study cohort is set to 
begin treatment .   
Study Intervention s:  
#[ADDRESS_243178] about the LKM class or the research.  
Each class meeting will begin with either a brief mindfulness meditation (weeks 1 and 2) or an LKM 
meditation followed by  [CONTACT_203951]. New material will then be presented, typi[INVESTIGATOR_203924] a new category of 
beings (i.e., benefactor, oneself, strangers, etc.)  and particular challenges associated with working with that 
category of beings will be discussed. The class will then practice LKM incorporating the new category and then 
discuss the experience. At the end of each class the homework for the next week will  be presented and class 
will end with another brief LKM practice. Participants will be provided with an LKM meditation CD and a 
workbook to accompany the class. (See appendix 3, LKM manual, for additional details) . An overview of the 
class schedule is provided below:  
Classes [ADDRESS_243179]. Participants will be asked to recall the ways this benefactor has helped them, 
and the goodness within this person.  
Class 4  introduces  the theme of commitment to our own happi[INVESTIGATOR_203925] a basis for intimacy and connection with 
self and others. Exercise: “Remembering the good within you” (Instructions: “For [ADDRESS_243180] said or done that was a kind or good action”). Acknowledgement and discussion of the 
finding that LKM toward our self is often difficult. If participant is unable to practice LKM toward self, suggestion 
of the concept that underlying all action is a desire to be happy – this may provide a method of noticing 
kindness toward oneself that alr eady exists; this may act as a starting point for feeling positive emotion for 
oneself. LKM toward benefactor and self with the [ADDRESS_243181] a benefactor and self. 
Introduction o f walking meditation and the concept of a beloved friend (may be a person or an animal).  
Class [ADDRESS_243182] our 
experience practicing LKM.  
Class 7  introduces  the concept of a neutral person – someone we do not strongly like or dislike. Perhaps this is 
a person we do not know well. This may bring up the awareness that this may be difficult because of the 
judgments we hold for people around us  as well as pervasi ve fears and mistrust .  
Class [ADDRESS_243183] your feelings for that person 
changed? Introduction of a difficult person: a person with whom we have experienced conflict and toward 
whom we feel anger or  lack of forgiveness. This could be someone who has been unsupportive or who 
responded to us in ways that were not helpful when we needed them. At this stage, participants will be 
instructed at this stage to not choose the person who has caused them the mo st pain or suffering in their lives 
– while acknowledging that this is a suggested goal of LKM practice. Discussion of how practicing LKM does 
not mean a sentimental love toward that person, as well as a discussion of anger – how it can serve the 
purpose o f setting boundaries and can challenge injustice, but can also cause suffering for the person who 
holds anger as well as for the person who receives it.  
Class 9  introduces  the difficulties involved in LKM to a difficult person. Discussion: When you are fe eling anger, 
who is the person suffering from anger? Include discussion that LKM toward difficult person is actually 
compassionate toward oneself, because it promotes letting go of this anger. Introduction of concept of difficult 
aspects of oneself, includ ing painful feelings, thoughts, memories, and symptoms. What aspects of ourselves 
do we reject and feel anger or hatred toward?  
Class [ADDRESS_243184] one part of a 
group. Examples of groups include: males/females, young/elderly, Veteran /civilian, all those known to me/all 
those unknown to me, those near/those far.  
Class [ADDRESS_243185] groups, wit h an emphasis on whether unconscious affinity or 
bias was detected in the ability to practice LKM.  
Class 12  begins with d iscussion of walking meditation. Introduction of LKM for all beings. Discussion of 
different categories of beings as appropriate for e ach person – alive or dead, human or animal. Practice LKM  
toward self, friend, benefactor, neutral person, difficult person, groups,  toward all beings.  
Homework for those randomized to LKM  homework  will consist of 30 minutes of sitting or walking 
mindfulness (first two weeks) or LKM meditation facilitated by [CONTACT_203952]. Participants will also be instructed to identify opportunities for inform al LKM 
practice each week .   
#[ADDRESS_243186] completed the VA’s CPT -C training and certification program or the equiv alent in the 
community. In addition, the se clinicians  will go through the necessary background checks and credentialing 
procedures prior to having contact [CONTACT_203953] .  
Those randomized to CPT -C will attend a 45 -minute session to watch the VA’s [ADDRESS_243187] on their lives in the following areas: safety, trust, 
power/control, esteem, and intimacy. The concept of trauma -related cognitive “stuck points” is introduced.  
Session 3  introduces a basic cognitive therapy overview of the relationship between thoug hts and feelings 
prompted by [CONTACT_203954] (A = activating event; B = beliefs; C = consequences).  
Session 4  elaborates on the idea of “stuck points” (e.g., “I am damaged goods;” “I’m a failure because I 
couldn’t save my best buddy,” etc.) that may have arisen as a result of the trauma exposure and each group 
member is assisted in identifying their own specific “stuck points.”  
Session [ADDRESS_243188] of challenging questions that patients use to help themselves identify stuck 
points.  
Session 6  provides an overview of common patterns of problematic thinking (e.g., all/none thinking, confusing 
feelings  with facts, etc.). The Challenging Beliefs Worksheet is introduced in this session.  
Session [ADDRESS_243189] -related issue when 
completing worksheets for homework.  
Session 10  reviews issues related t o power/control and patients are instructed to focus on at least one 
power/control -related issue when completing worksheets for homework.  
Session [ADDRESS_243190] statement.  
Session 12  reviews intimacy issues and the patients’ current sense of the event’s meaning.  
Homework for those randomized to CPT -C will consist of [ADDRESS_243191], power/control, esteem, and intimacy.   
Procedures for Maxim izing Research Integrity and Patient Safety  
LKM Fidelity.  The LKM teachers are highly experienced meditation teachers with experience teaching 
meditation to Veteran s with PTSD at VAPSHCS.  These teachers currently teach  LKM groups and  
Mindfulness -Based St ress Reduction (MBSR) groups at VAPSHCS, which are offered as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -wide clinical 
program s.  These teachers have extensive personal experience involving  LKM. LKM is also included as a 
small component of the MBSR program, although the primary focus of MB SR is on mindfulness meditation. 
Each of these teachers is employed as a WOC -status contract employee, and meets stringent foundational 
teacher training requirements for MBSR, which we also apply to LKM  teaching requirements : longstanding 
practice of mindfulness and loving -kindness meditation, experience with a body -centered awareness practice, 
attendance at silent mindfulness meditation retreats of at least 7 days duration, completion of the University of 
MA Center for Mindf ulness Residential Training/Retreat as well as a teacher practicum in MBSR.  We believe 
that these teacher training requirements and prior experience teaching MBSR will be directly applicable to 
high-quality teaching of LKM.  
To assure quality control, [CONTACT_203969] will review at least 2 early session tapes from each LKM 
cohort to provide supervisory feedback. Teaching responsibilities will be shared by  [CONTACT_203955], PT, MA 
and Jonas Batt, MA, MHC, both of whom currently teach LKM at VAPSHCS.  They w ill co-teach the LKM 
courses to provide different perspectives and gender balance across the facilitators. If either of these teachers 
become s unavailable, there are 3 additional experienced mindfulness and loving -kindness meditation teachers 
who are curre ntly teaching other meditation classes at VAPSHCS who  will be available to teach LKM . A subset 
of 20% of LKM classes will be coded for protocol adherence by [CONTACT_203956] (see Appendix 5). 
Adherence and competence will be measured using treatment fidelity ratings based on the LKM curriculum. 
Our pool of undergraduate raters will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kearney, who will provide ongoing supervision 
regarding fidelity ratings.  
CPT-C Fidelity.  CPT-C group leaders selected to provide CPT -C will have complet ed either the VA’s 
national rollout dissemination training and certification process or the community equivalent, and thus will have 
had at least [ADDRESS_243192]. Patricia Resick  and has extensive experience both 
delivering group -based CPT -C herself within VHA and supervising others..  She will provide weekly supervision 
based on both review of session tapes and oral reports from the group co -leaders to assure real -time quality 
control of CPT -C delivery.  
A random subset of 20% of each group’s 12 sessions will be coded for protocol adherence and 
competence by [CONTACT_203957] (see Appendix 6 for coding 
forms). Adherence and competence will be measured using established published measures of CPT -C 
treatment fidelity. Raters will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Galovski (CPT -C) with ongoing supervision provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Rodgers .  
CAPS Interview Fidelity.  The Study Assessor  will a be master’s level clinician  who will undergo training on 
the CAPS interview by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Simpson. [CONTACT_137229] will listen to at least 5% of the CAPS interviews to provide 
ongoing supervision. Also, a random subset of 5% of the CAPS assessments will be coded for adherence and 
competence by t wo independent raters. Raters will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Simpson.  
Maintaining the Assessment Blind.  The Study Assessor will be kept blind to participant condition: 
participants will be reminded not to disclose treatment assignment, and other study personnel will avoid 
communications that could provide such information.  
Procedures for Maximizing Retention.  Participants will update contact [CONTACT_203958] $ [ADDRESS_243193],  $ 30 for the 3- and 6-month assessments, and $ 5 per week for the 12 online 
assessments. The maximum remuneration is $ [ADDRESS_243194] Management.  We will utilize web -based software, including a dedicated Sharepoint portal,  to 
ensure coordination among study team members and reliable participant tracking.  
Electronic Data Capture.  We will utilize the version of Survey Monkey that conforms to VHA pri vacy and 
security requirements to create user friendly electronic versions of our measures that participants will complete 
either using VA desktop computers during the in -person major assessment appointments. Similarly, the Study 
Assessors will administer the interview portions of these assessments using Survey Monkey templates. Study 
participants will be able to login to complete the Survey Monkey weekly assessments  from home or other 
Internet access points (paper -and-pencil options will be available for t he various self -report measures, 
including the weekly measures ). This method of collecting data will ensure that items that are skipped are 
intentionally skipped, thus cutting down on missing data. It will also reduce the need for manual data entry, 
thereb y decreasing the risk of introducing human error into the dataset and increasing the efficiency of moving 
from data collection to data cleaning and analysis.  
Maintaining Participant Safety.   Participants will be provided a phone number to call if they require 
psychiatric assistance, as well as the local county crisis clinic phone number.   See also Appendix 7 for a full 
description of safety procedures.

Baseline (B), Post -test (P),  Weekly,  3- and [ADDRESS_243197] the amount of homework practice completed (for both LKM and CPT-C), in order to provide the ability to 
assess whether homework practice is predictive of improved outcomes.   
PTSD Symptoms . Participants’ PTSD symptomatology will be assessed using the Clinician -Administered 
PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD checklist (PCL).   
The CAPS  is the primary outcome measure.  The CAPS requires a clinician to rate 17 diagnostic 
symptoms of PTSD, as defined by [CONTACT_2681] -IV criteria. (Note: because a new version of the DSM is due out in May 
2013, we will update our inclusion/exclusion criteria  and the main outcome assessment materials once DSM -V 
is made available). The CAPS gives both a continuous measure of PTSD severity and a dichotomous 
diagnosis of PTSD. The psychometric properties of the CAPS have been evaluated in several studies and 
have  been found to be excellent.71 The CAPS takes approximately 45 minutes to complete and will be 
administered at baseline , week 8, and at each major assessment (post -LKM/CPT -C, 3- and 6-months).  
The PCL -C is a 17 -item self -report measure that correlates highly with scores derived from th e Clinician 
Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS).[ADDRESS_243198] mor e 
severe PTSD.59 The PCL will be administered during the weekly monitoring phase in order to allow 
assessment of clinical outcomes as part of mediation analyses, and will be included at weekly time points 
(post -LKM/CPT -C, 3- and 6 -months) as a secondary ou tcome measure.  
Traumatic events . The number and type of traumatic events sustained over the course of each the Veteran ’s 
life will be assessed using the Life Events Checklist  (LEC) .  The LEC assesses lifetime history of exposure to 
a wide range of potentially traumatic events.77  The LEC will be used to describe the study population, and to 
establish PTSD diagnostic status as part of the inclusion criteria.  
Depression . The depression measure at each time point wil l be from the NIH -sponsored Patient -Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)  assessment suite . PROMIS was developed in 
order to measure patient -reported outcomes using item response theory (IRT)  and computerized adaptive 
testing (CAT) which allows for efficient, psychometrically robust assessment of patient -reported outcomes in 
clinical trials involving a wide range of chronic conditions, and they have been validated in over 21,[ADDRESS_243199], 
i.e., the instrument used is not “static” for each subject. Using CAT and IRT, the PROMIS measures are 
designed to gain the maximal informa tion cont ent from each question  by [CONTACT_203960] 
a question is most efficient.  The greater precision gained by [CONTACT_203961] “static” pe n and paper instruments.[ADDRESS_243200] PROMIS item banks utilize a 7 -day recall period.   These measures utilize item -response theory82 and 
computerized adaptive testing (CAT), in order to provide a high degree of precision. Using CAT, each dom ain 
measures average 5 -8 questions in length and takes only 1 -2 minutes to complete.  We will utilize the CAT 
version of the PROMIS depression measure for the major assessment points , and  the static version of the 
PROMIS depression measure  (SF8a)  at the wee kly assessments (using  Survey Monkey for electronic data 
capture).    
Self-compassion.  The Self-Com passion Scale – Short Form (SCS -SF)78 is a 12 -item measure of self -
compassion (see also broaden -and-build section of background/significance).  It has been shown to be reliable 
(Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86) and to have a very high degree of correlation (r ≥ 0.97) with the longer and 
previously validated self -compassion scale.40 
Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI).79 The PTCI is a 36 -item measure that assesses trauma -related 
thoughts  and beliefs including negative cognitions about self, about the world, and self -blame. Items are rated 
on a 7 -point scale ranging from “totally disagree” to “totally agree.” The PTCI has been found to discriminate 
well between people who do and do not hav e PTSD and has been found to have good internal consistency, 
test-retest reliability, and construct validity. The PTCI will be administered at baseline and follow -up time points 
as a secondary outcome measure.  The abbreviated [ADDRESS_243201] traumatic cognitions mediate changes in the primary outcome measures.  
Weekly monitoring assessment protocol. Weekly assessment of type and duration of LKM and CPT -C 
homework practices completed along with measures of PTSD and depression and the proposed intervention 
mediators will be assessed weekly during the twelve weeks of LKM or CPT -C treatment .  The weekly 
assessments will be adm inistered via novel web -based technology ( Survey  Monkey ; paper -and-pencil options 
will be available for those without internet access). (See Appendi x 9 for weekly items .) 
Assessment of Usual VA Mental Health Care.  In order to quantify the amount of VA mental health care that 
study participants obtain during their involvement in the proposed study, data extraction from both the VA  
Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)  and from the computerized patient record system ( CPRS ).  The number of 
individual and group psychotherapy stopcodes and mental health medication management stopcodes will be 
recorded for all participants for the period of time they are directly involved in LKM (and equivalent time period 
for CPT-C) from the CDW. These numbers will be cross -checked via CPRS and CPRS therapy notes will be 
assessed to determine whether study participants were involved in treatments for PTSD during their 
involvement in LKM or the follow -up period (and equivalent time period for  CPT-C).  We will also use CPRS to 
code for psychiatric and pain medication adjustments during study involvement.  
Data Analysis  
Overview. Before performing the primary analyses, outliers, shape of distributions, and associations 
between outcomes  will be determined . Covariates or propensity scores will be utilized to adjust for differences 
if imbalance s between treatment groups on key variables  are identified . Gender and type of trauma will also be 
considered as covariates . All analyses will be pe rformed using an intention -to-treat sample as well as per 
protocol analyses.  Per protocol analyses are the preferred method for non -inferiority analyses, in order to 
avoid biasing the results toward no difference between groups, which could occur in inten tion-to-treat samples. 
In addition, pattern -mixture models will be used to identify potential missing data patterns,[ADDRESS_243202] of 
LKM vs. CPT -C using a multilevel mixed effects model with random effects for repeated measures.  If 
significant correlation exists between outcomes among participants in the same therapy group ( i.e., ICC>0), 
therapy group also will be included as a random effect in the model. The primary outcomes for AIM 1 are 
participant scores on the CAPS.77  As the models for AIM 1 and AIM 2 (PTSD and depressive symptoms, 
respectively) will be identical, we focus on the CAPS. The analysis will include all of the primary asses sment 
time points (Baseline, post -LKM/CPT -C, 3- and 6 - months). Mixed models are an appropriate choice for three 
reasons. First, they accommodate the clustered nature of the data at multiple levels (i.e., repeated measures 
within persons). Second, should s ignificant correlation exist among participants in the same therapy group, 
inclusion of group as a random factor allows for generalization of results to LKM and CPT -C groups in general 
(not just the groups in the study). Third, they are flexible with respe ct to missing data.85 Mixed effects models 
will include treatment condition (LKM vs. CPT -C), time, and time by [CONTACT_203962]. Time will be modeled as a dummy variable to allow for 
variation in effects over t ime. Both unadjusted and adjusted (covariates include baseline PROMIS depression 
score for Aim 1 and baseline CAPS  for Aim2 , age, gender ) models will be run. Subgroup effects of PTSD  
severity on outcomes will be explored using tests of interaction.  
 A non -inferiority analysis determines if the effects of a new intervention are similar to an established 
treatment within a pre -stated margin of or range of non -inferiority that is considered clinically acceptable ( δ).86 
We chose a non -inferiority margin of 10 points on the CAPS.  A difference of 10 points on the CAPS 
represents Cohen’s d = 0.[ADDRESS_243203] that would be clinically 
meaningful .87 [Addendum:  The above description of the non -inferiority margin was based on the CAPS -IV 
measure of PTSD. The CAPS -[ADDRESS_243204] size of Cohen’s d =  0.5. We therefore defined the non -inferiority margin as 5 
points on the CAPS -5 (based on data indicating the SD of baseline CAPS -5 scores is approximately 10 in a 
large sample (N=198) of treatment -seeking veterans; personal communication, Marx) ]. A reduction of [ADDRESS_243205] formulation. The null hypothesis (H 0) states that LKM is at least an amount δ worse than CPT -C. The 
alternative (H A) states that the post -treatment mean in LKM is no worse than amount δ as compared to CPT -
C.88 We will assess non -inferiority at 6 month follow -up, as well as other time points (post -LKM/CPT -C, 3-
month follow -up) using methods outlined by [CONTACT_203963].1 Non-inferiority of LKM to CPT -C for 
reduction in PTSD symptoms will be claimed if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for difference in 6 -
month  mean CAPS scores  is greater than -10.  Non -inferiority of LKM to CPT -C for reduction in depressive 
symptoms will be claimed if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for difference in [ADDRESS_243206] error.1

will be u tilized to determine the optimal time points (from baseline) to assess change scores in mediators and 
outcomes for the mediation models described below.    
 Mediation :  Within -treatment intraindividual changes will first be analyzed for self -compassion, 
maladaptive cognitions, PTSD and depression using difference scores  (each week’s score minus baseline 
score for each measure)  using procedures defined by [CONTACT_203964] (2012) .[ADDRESS_243213] of treatment condition (LKM vs. CPT -C) on intraindividual change in PTSD 
symptoms via intraindividual change in self -compassion.   
     These procedures will be repeated to evaluate t he degree to which change in maladaptive cognitions 
mediates change in CPT -C relative to LKM by [CONTACT_203965] (CPT -C vs. 
LKM) on intraindividual change in PTSD symptoms via intraindividual change in maladaptive cognit ions.  The 
above analysis will be repeated for depressive symptoms.  
 Indirect effects will b e calculated to yield bias -corrected and accelerated bootstrapped confidence 
intervals of indirect effects. If the confidence interval of the indirect effect does n ot include zero, mediation will 
be shown.  
   
Project Timeline  
The overarching project timeline is reflected in Table 4. Approximately [ADDRESS_243214] cohort will undergo baselines assessments in month 5 (following a 4 -
month  recruitment phase) and the final follow -up for cohort 8 will happen by [CONTACT_203966] (Table 5) . Cohorts will 
be approximately evenly distributed over the course of the study.  We have previously been successful in 
obtaining timely regulatory approvals for LKM and MBSR studies at VAPSHCS, including the two randomized 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_203926].

Limitations  
The study design is a fairly ambitious  one with a weekly monitoring feature that could pose challenges for 
retention and compliance with the research protocol. A modest remuneration schedule is likely to help maintain 
compliance with the study protocol, and our previous research with PTSD and alcohol dependent individuals 
examining frequent monitoring has shown excellent compliance. Other design considerations include the 
inclusion of male and female participants with mixed trauma histories and inclusion of individuals with 
Substance Abuse and/ or Alcohol Dependence (AD). Briefly, most PTSD treatment trials have involved fairly 
homogeneous samples, which while likely reducing experimental noise, also limit the generalizability of the 
findings. We felt that the ability to obtain data that has a ch ance of being highly generalizable to Veteran s who 
are seeking care for PTSD, which is more often than not associated with comorbid conditions,[ADDRESS_243215] successfully delivered LKM in mixed -gender 
groups and  our clinical impression is that both the male and the female Veteran s benefited from the exposure 
to the opposite gender in this therapeutic context.  
Another design consideration is that each of the two interventions will be delivered in closed -group 
format and there is some risk that people within each of the groups will influence one another to the extent that 
there are group effects on outcomes.91  If ICC’s are significant in the proposed study, this would result in 
decreased statistical power to detect the primary outcomes.  
   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_203927] a 
necessary step in examining whether LKM is associated with clinical benefit for Veteran s with PTSD. Results 
of this research can be readily applied in both VA and community settings to treat PTSD.  
Application Summary  
The proposed research is an extension of our previous and ongoing work. This  application will address 
a relative void in the intervention literature for PTSD by [CONTACT_203967] -inferiority of a standardized 
meditation intervention, LKM. In light of the growing interest in complementary and alternative medicine among 
Veteran s and the lack of empi[INVESTIGATOR_203928] r common disorders, such as PTSD, this 
research will make an important contribution to the field. We believe the proposed research is timely, 
important, and innovative, and the track records of Drs. Kearney and Simpson and the research team indicate 
we are  capable of successfully carrying out and completing the proposed work.

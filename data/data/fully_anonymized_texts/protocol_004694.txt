 3 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Study Title  Opaganib, a Sphingosine Kinase -2 (SK2) Inhibitor in COVID -19 Pneumonia: a 
Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2/[ADDRESS_482388]  Opaganib (ABC294640)  
Opaganib  Opaganib [3 -(4-chlorophenyl) -adamantane -1-carboxylic acid (pyridin -4-
ylmethyl)amide, hydrochloride salt] is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme 
sphingosine kinase -2 (SK2) (French, 2010).  SK2 is an innovative molecular 
target due to its critical ro le in sphingolipid metabolism, which is known to 
regulate many cellular functions, including the replication-transcription complex 
(RTC) of +single -strand RNA viruses  
Rationale - 
Preclinical  Opaganib is an investigational product in mid-stage clinical dev elopment with 
anti-viral properties targeting RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, by [CONTACT_385629], combined with anti-inflammatory effects as detailed below.  
Opaganib has been studied in pre -clinical models of RNA viral disease, 
inflammatio n and cancer (see Investigator Brochure). Recent pre-clinical studies 
have demonstrated that opaganib is a potent inhibitor of SARS -CoV -2 replication , 
at concentrations that are achievable in human serum . Inhibition of the enzyme 
sphingosine kinase -2 (SK2) with opaganib has demonstrated a decrease in viral 
titers of influenza virus in an in vitro model system (with an EC50 well within the 
achievable concentrations of opaganib in humans, based on the phase 1 human 
trial) as well as improved survival in a preclinical study of influenza infected mice receiving opaganib daily for two days. Opaganib has also demonstrated a substantial inhibitory effect in a dose dependent manner in a preliminary Ebola 
cell-based inhibition assay with near complete inhibition of Ebola cellular 
infection with the same achievable concentrations of opaganib in humans. 
Targeted knockdown of SK2 also inhibited Hepatitis C virus replication and 
substantially reduced Chikungunya Virus in infected HepG2 cells.  The pre-
clinical effect on C hikungunya Virus is particularly relevant as they also contain a 
+single stranded RNA genome like SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_482389] inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo by [CONTACT_385630] -1-
phosphate (S1P), preventing the pro-inflammatory effects of S1P in a number of 
disease models as well as in a radioprotection model. Opaganib has shown a 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
7 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 decrease in IL -6 levels, in TLR4 expression, NF -κB activation and TNF α-induced 
activation of NF κB pro -inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine (TNF α, IL-1β and 
CXCL -10) production; a decrease in monocyte/ macrophage and neutrophil tissue 
infiltration; blocking of CD4+ T cell infiltration and IFN γ production; abrogation 
of TNF α-induced expression of adhesion proteins and blockade of TNF α-induced 
PGE2 (as a measure of COX -2 activity).  
In an in vivo model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, opaganib has been 
shown to reduce TNF -alpha and IL -6 concentrations in bronchioloalveolar lavage 
fluid to near non-infected control levels.  
The decision to enroll patients into this study and, in some cases, add opaganib to 
other experimental  medicines, will be at the discretion the study physician, based 
on the pharmacological action, existing data and dosage form described in this 
protocol.  Of note, in patients who ar e unable to swallow capsules, opaganib made 
into a suspension form may be administered via a nasogastric tube (administering 
opaganib suspension via nasogastric tube did not substantiall y alter the 
bioavailability of opaganib after a tube fee d in a healthy volunteer study).  
Rationale - 
Clinical Studies to Date  To date, three clinical trials have been completed with opaganib, a phase [ADDRESS_482390] study in healthy volunteers, a phase 1b study in advanced solid tumor patients, and a phase 1b/2 study in patients with advanced 
multiple myelo ma. Two additional studies are currently in progress, a phase 2 
study in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and a phase 2 study in patients with castration -resistant prostate cancer. In May 2020 the U.S. FDA approved a Phase 
2a clinical study evaluating opag anib in patients with confirmed moderate -to-
severe SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
Based on the Phase 1b studies, the dose of 500 mg of opaganib every 12 hours was determined as the maximum safe and tolerable dose in treatment in oncology 
patients. This same dose will be utilized in the COVID -19 studies.  
Of note, the dose and duration (exposure) proposed for COVID -[ADDRESS_482391] been completed in the US, 
randomizing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], hypoxic patients suffering from COVID -19 pneumonia 
to be treated with either opaganib, 500 mg Q12 hours or placebo on the same 
schedule for 14 days  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The investigational pr oduct was given on 
top of standard of care therapy. The preliminary results demonstrated that 
opaganib as compared to placebo led to improved time to 50% reduction of 
supplemental oxygen requirement; a greater  percent age of patients no longer 
need ing suppl emental oxygen by D ay14 of treatment  and less total oxygen 
requirements during the 14 days of treatment , as measured by [CONTACT_385631] (AUC). Further evaluations showed a greater percent age of patients on 
opaganib no longer need ed supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_2006] 7 and had improved 
time to discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , compared to placebo.  In addition, there was no 
substantial safety difference between opaganib and placebo treated patients.

 Compassionate 
Use Experience  
in COVID-19 
Infection   Under an compassio nate exemption, 7 patients with severe COVID -19 infections 
were  treated with opaganib. These results are uncontrolled,  however provide 
important clinical data within the compassionate use context.  
One patient improved 36 hours after initiation of treatment  to room air and was 
discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Five other patients were treated with opaganib for up to 
14 days.  All patients had clinical improvement and were discharged from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patients treated with opaganib in the compassionate use program did not 
progress to requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
Patients receiving opaganib via compassionate use were compared to a matched 
case-control group of 18 patients. Opaganib treated patients had faster 
improvement in lymphocyte counts, decrease d CRP and faster time to being 
weaned off high flow oxygen. Of the 18 matched  controls, 6/[ADDRESS_482392] of 
Care 
Considerations   As the approval and/or guidance for treating COVID -[ADDRESS_482393] of care, and/or 
experimental treatments in patients enrolled in this study will be guided by [CONTACT_296070]/exclusion criteria, prohibited medic ations and precautionary 
medications as outlined in the protocol and the study physician’s discretion.  
Justification for 
Opaganib, 
Population, 
Study Design, 
Primary  
Endpoint  The population to be enrolled in this study will have severe COVID -[ADDRESS_482394] that opaganib may  be beneficial in this population by 
[CONTACT_385632][INVESTIGATOR_307].   
As the primary objective of opaganib therapy is to improve and/or stabilize the 
clinical status of the patient, the primary analysis is based on the proportion of 
patients who  no longer need supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_2006] 14 (end of treatment) .  
This outcome will be considered a treatment success . The primary endpoint is 
consistent with achieving a score of 3 or better  (0-3, inclusive) on the WHO 
Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvem ent by [CONTACT_2006] 14 of treatment . 
The duration of treatment is 14 days, aligning with approved anti -viral treatment 
regimens for COVID -19, such as remdesivir.

 supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_385635] . Patients must be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385594] 
(Day 1).  
Study Design 
and Description  This is a phase 2/[ADDRESS_482397] of care, in a randomization ratio of 1:1. Treatment 
assignments will remain blinded to the patient, investigator and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717], as 
well as the sponsor.   
Study participants will receive either opaganib 2 x 250 mg capsules (500 mg) every 
[ADDRESS_482398] of care (pharmacological as 
defined above and/or supportive) at any given institution . Study drug will be 
administered every day for 14 days (Day 1 to Day 14). All participants will be 
followed up for [ADDRESS_482399] of care, in a randomization ratio of 1:1.  
As the treatments in the r ecommended schemes of treatment according to the 
severity of the di sease may differ, standard of care administered to patients may 
differ by [CONTACT_14189].  
In order to ensure balance of standard treatment regimens in both treatment arms 
as well as with  
regard to patient risk status, randomization will be determined based upon two 
stratification factors:  
a)  Patients will be stratified on w hether SoC treatment has established efficacy (yes 
versus no). The proven effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385595] . 
b) Patients will be stratified based on meeting three or more high risk (out of 
possible 8)  clinical parameters for COVID -19 outcomes at baseline (yes versus no).  
 
The 8 parameters are: 1) age at screening, ≥60 years of age, (yes or no); 2) male, 
(yes or no); 3) HbA1c at screening,  ≥6.5 and/or on active treatment with insulin or 
oral hypoglycem ics (yes or no); 4) hypoxemia without commensurate increased 
work of  breathing (defined as increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], nasal flaring and/or 
increase use of respi[INVESTIGATOR_385596] [yes or no]; 5) known 
underlying chronic lung disease ( yes or no); 6) known cardiovascular disease or 
hypertension (yes or no); 7) BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m2 (yes or no); 8) known renal disease 
(yes or no).

Medications 
during the 
Study  The following medications are prohibited during the study, including the safety 
follow -up period:  
• Medications that are sensitive substrates and narrow therapeutic range 
drugs which are substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 CYP2D6 , CYP3A4, P -gP, BCRP and OATP1B1 should be 
avoided with opaganib.  .Please see Appendix 2.    
• Moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 or P -gP are 
prohibited. Please see Appendix 2.  Warfarin, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], argatroban and

https://www.crediblemeds.org/index.php/drugsearch  
Precautionary 
Medications 
during the 
Study  • Substrates for MATE1 and MATE2-K should be used with caution and 
monitored for safety due the potential for inhibition of this transporter 
protein. As the clinical relevance of these in -vitro interactions hasn’t been 
established, these should be decided in discussion with the Medical 
Monitor on a case -by-case basis.  
• Moderate to strong inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 may influence the 
exposure of opaganib.  
Adverse Events 
of Special 
Interest  Opaganib may cause neuropsychiatric toxicity that may be due to incre ases in 
ceramides.  
In a Phase [ADDRESS_482415] study, these toxicities were found to be 
reduced by [CONTACT_188103] a light to moderate meal prior to each dose administration and 
this was likely due to delayed absorption and reduced Cmax.  
Neuropsychiatric events reported in clinical studies to date include: 
hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, lethargy, agitation, distress and dysarthria.   
These neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred at higher frequencies at the 
highest dose administered, which is a bove the dose selected ( maximum tolerated 
dose) for the current and future clinical studies.   
For further info rmation , refer to  Section 17.6.3.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_385601], participants will stop study drug if it is determined 
that they have experienced any of the following adverse events (using Grading 
criteria as defined in the revised  NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events 
[CTCAE v.5.0])  
• Any neuropsychiatric adverse event of Grade 3 severity  
• Hallucinations of any severity (any Grade)  
• Nausea of Grade 3 severity  
• Vomiting of Grade 3 severity  
• Any Grade [ADDRESS_482416] of care (n= 232), or 
matching placebo added to standard of care (n= 232). The sample size calculation 
was based on  powering the study with respect to the primary efficacy endpoint of 
proportions of patients no longer requiring supplemental oxygen for at least 24 
hours by 14 days. It was assumed that the treatment success rate at 14 days in the 
control arm would be 40% and that opaganib is expected to provide absolute 15% 
increase of this rate, to a success rate of 55%. A total of 464 subjects provides 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
18 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 90% power to detect the assumed difference in success  rate, using chi square test, 
at a two -sided α=0.05 level of signi ficance.  
Statistical 
Methods  The primary efficacy endpoint will be based on a success (Yes/No) variable, 
indicating if a subject is no longer requiring supplemental oxygen, for at least 24 
hours by [CONTACT_385639] 14 (patient death or subsequent requirement of supplemental 
oxygen or lost to follow -up through Day 42 will be regarded as  failure for the 
primary efficacy endpoint) . Any subject reported as not requiring supplemental 
oxygen on any given study day will be counted as a subject who has not  required 
oxygen for at least [ADDRESS_482417] informative time.  
The number and percentages of subjects achieving success (as defined above) will 
be tabulated per treatment gr oup. A 95% confidence interval will be constructed 
for each proportion. A Cochran Mantel -Haenzel (CMH) test will compare the 
proportion of success between the two groups, using the study stratification factors used for randomization, and a corresponding st ratified risk difference 
estimate will be presented with 95% confidence interval.   
The significance level for this test will be two -sided 5%. The primary analysis 
will be based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT  analysis set ) which 
consists of all patients that were randomized and treated with at least one dose of 
study drug and who met entry criteria #3 ( The patient requires, at baseline, high 
flow supplemental oxygen or positive pressure ventilation, or is receiving oxygen 
via non-rebreathe r mask or reservoir mask , capable of delivering high 
concentra tions of oxygen. Patients who requir e mechanical ventilation or no 
longer requir e supplemental oxygen prior to receiving the first dose  of study drug 
will not be included in the mITT analysis set .

 [ADDRESS_482429] that SAR -CoV -2 infection ranges from 
asymptomatic infection to pneumonia and Adult Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053] (ARDS) with multiorgan failure that may lead to de ath (Zhou, 2020). In the Zhou study, the median duration of viral 
shedding was 20 days, with an interquartile range of 17- 24 days and a maximum of 37 days. Common 
symptoms reported in the Zhou study for 191 patients were fever (94%), cough (79%), sputum 
production and fatigue (each 23%) and myalgia (15%).  Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates were noted in 
75% of patients on chest X -ray. Patients over [ADDRESS_482430] availability, utilizing Polymerase Chan Reaction ( PCR ) performed on nasopharyngeal 
swabs or other body fluids, has been limited.   
For most individuals testing positive, COVID -[ADDRESS_482431] (van 
Doremalen, 2020) and potential fecal spread ( Chen , 2020).  As this is a newly ide ntified disease, first 
noted in December 2019, and as testing and interpretation of data are in a very early stage, no specific therapy has demonstrated antiviral efficacy.  
7.[ADDRESS_482432]  
Opaganib [3-(4 -chlorophenyl) -adamantane -1-carboxylic acid ( pyridin-4 -ylmethyl)amide, 
hydrochloride salt] is an orally available inhibitor of the enzyme sphingosine kinase -2 (SK2) (French, 
2010).  SK2 is an innovative molecular target due to its critical role in sphingolipid metabolism, which is known to regulate m any cellular functions, including the replication-transcription complex (RTC) of 
+single -strand RNA viruses (Reid, 2015).  
7.3 Preclinical Rationale  
Recent pre -clinical studies in vitro  data demonstrate that opaganib completely inhibits viral replication 
of SARS -CoV -2, at concentrations that are achievable in human serum. . Working in collaboration 
with the University of Louisville Center for Predictive Medicine and Biodefense, opaganib was studied in a 3D tissue model of human bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_385605]™, HBEC) which 
morphologically and functionally resembles the human airway and is similar to the model used to 
discover SARS -CoV -2. This study was designed to evaluate the in vi tro efficacy of opaganib in 
inhibiting SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_482433] of opaganib resulting 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
25 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 in complete inhibition of SA RS-CoV -2 viral replication (Figure 1). Treatment of cells infected with 
SARS- CoV -2 resulted in a dose -dependent inhibition of infectious virus production without 
compromising cell membrane integrity, a measure of cell viability and drug safety, demonstrati ng 
opaganib’s promising potential for treating patients with COVID -19 (Figure 2)  
 
   Figure 1.               Figure 2.  
 
 
Addition aly, preclinical studies demonstrate that opaganib both inhibits host inflammation and has 
anti-viral properties. Using SK2−/− mice and differential gene expression analysis, it was demonstrated 
that SK2/sphingosie -1-phosphate ( S1P) signaling could play a key role in promoting pneumonia via 
promoting inflammation and suppressing other factors that inhibit inflammation and host def ense 
(Ebenezer, 2019).  The results suggested that inhibition of SK2 may both inhibit viral replication and 
decrease pulmonary inflammation, ameliorating lung  injury. Additional evidence for the anti -
inflammatory properties of opaganib is derived from muri ne inflammatory bowl disease  (IBD ) models 
of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease and rodent models of inflammatory arthritis and liver ischemia 
reperfusion.  Opaganib has been shown to suppress anti -inflammatory responses in -vitro and in-vivo, 
including:  
1) decreased IL -6 levels, TLR4 express ion, NF -κB activation and TNF α-induced activation of 
NFκB pro -inflammatory cytokine/ chemokine (TNF α, IL-1β and CXCL -10) production 
(Liu, 2010, Maines , 2008, Maines , 2010)  
2) decreased infiltration of monocytes/ macrophages and neutrophils ( Liu,  2012)  
3) blocke d CD4+ T cell infiltration and IFN γ production (Liu, 2012)  
4) abrogation of TNF α-induced expression of adhesion proteins and blockade of TNF α-
induced PGE2 as a measure of COX -2 activity (Maines, 2008).  
Several other studies have reported that SK2 regulates cellular gene expression during Chikungunya 
virus (CHIKV) infection (Reid, 2015) and can maintain viral latency for Kaposi’s sarcoma -associated 
herpesvirus (Dai, 2014). SK2 recruitment into the RTC has been demonstrated in CHIKV in the 
Togavirida e family of viruses which contains a non-segmented +single stranded RNA genome 
(COVID -19 is a +single stranded RNA genome). Treatment of infected HepG2 cells with opaganib

 significantly reduced CHIKV infection ( Reid, 2015).  Targeted knockdown of SK2 also inhibited 
hepatitis c virus ( HCV ) replication (Yamane, 2014).  
Inhibition of SK2 with opaganib has also demonstrated a decrease in viral titers of influenza virus in 
an in vitro model system (with an EC50 well within the achievable concentrations of opaganib in 
humans, based on the phase 1 human trial) a s well as  improve d survival in a preclinical study of 
influenza infected mice receiving  opaganib daily for two days (Xia , 2018).  
Opaganib has also demonstrated a substantial inhibitory effect in a dose dependent manner in a 
preliminary Ebola cell-based inhibition assay (RedHill  Biopharma,  unpublished data). The doses that 
displayed near complete inhibition of Ebola cellular infection are also achievable in humans.  
7.[ADDRESS_482434] study in healthy volunteers, a phase 1b study in advanced solid tumor patients, a phase 
1b/2 study in patients with advanced multiple myeloma  and a Phase 2a s tudy evaluating opaganib in 
patients with moderate -to-severe SARS -CoV -2 infection. . Two additional studies are currently in 
progress, a phase 2 study in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and a phase 2 study in patients with castration -resistant prostate can cer. Based on the Phase 1b studies, described in Section 7 .4.1.1 and 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], based on safety and tolerability, the dose of 500 mg of opaganib every 12 hours was 
selected for future studies. The duration of treatment in oncology patients has been c onsiderably 
longer than that proposed for COVID -19 patients, with oncology patients receiving opaganib daily for 
more than  2 years.  
7.4.1 Completed Studies  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1b Study in patients with advanced solid tumors (Study No. ABC-101) 
Twenty -two patients were enrolled, of whom [ADDRESS_482435] 1.1 criteria. Patients received treatment continuously in 28 
day cycles and treatment was given  while  fasting. Mean age of patients entered was 58 years. Seventy 
one percent were male, 67% white. All patients had received prior chemotherapy and approximately 
half had prior surgery and/or radiotherapy. Patients had a variety of concomitant medical conditions 
and were receiving a variety of medications in addition to their antitumor therapy.  
The administered oral dose of 500 mg Q12 hours was the maximum tolerated dose. There were no deaths reported during the administration of opaganib. There were no discontinuations due to adverse 
events (AEs), in 250 mg QD and 250 mg bid cohorts. Common adverse events were nausea (12 
patients, 57%), fatigue (12 patients, 57%), vomiting (8 patients, 38%) and neuropsychiatric effects (14 
patients, 67%) including anxiety, insomnia, agitation and dysarthria.  Of these, only fatigue appeared 
to be dose -related.  Nausea and vomiting were common but not dose -limiting and rarely required 
discontinuation of treatment. Neuropsychiatric effects were seen at all dose levels, though were more 
common and bothersome at the highest dose level, 750 mg Q12 hours, considered an intolerable dose.    
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
27 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 There were no consistent trends toward increases or grade shifts in liver function tests, hematologic 
parameters, or other biochemical parameters except for creatinine and lymphocytes. No patient 
developed clinically significant ECG abnormalities on study.  There were no treatment group 
differences noted for the changes from baseline of QTcF . For more detailed data refer to Investigator 
Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1b Study in patients with advanced multiple myeloma (Study No. ABC-
103 
Thirteen  patients received  study drug:  3 at 250 mg Q12 hours , 4 at 500 mg Q12 hours  and 6 at 750 mg 
Q12 hours .  Median age of patients was 69 years (range 57 -89), 7 were males, 7 were white and 6 
black.  All patients had received multiple courses of therapy with a median of 7 prior lines of  treatment 
(range 3 -13) excluding stem cell transplantation.  Eight patients had autologous hematopoietic stem 
cell transplantation.  
The administered oral dose of 500 mg Q12 hours was the maximum tolerated dose. There were no 
deaths reported during the administration of opaganib. Common adverse events included dyspepsia, 
nausea and vomiting. Eight patients experienced neuropsychiatric effects including altered menta l 
state, confusion, dizziness, hallucinations and insomnia.  All patients experiencing neuropsychiatric 
effects were receiving concomitant narcotic analgesics and several patients were also receiving other 
psychotropic medications. In several patients, afte r adjustment of the narcotic analgesic dosing 
regimen, the symptoms subsided, with maintenance or improvement of pain control. For more detailed 
data refer to Investigator Brochure.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 1a Study  of food and administration route effect study in healthy 
volunteers (Study No, ABC-109)  
A total of 23 subjects participated in the study, 19 each received the drug orally in the fed and fasted 
states, and 21 via nasogastric ( NG) tube. Mean and median ages of the subjects were 48.2 and 50.0 
years, respectively (range 22 -72 years). Of the subjects, 56.5% were males, 78.3% were white, and 
47.8% were Hispanic. Median weight was 75.2 kg (range 52.0-123.3).  
Subjects received a single 500 mg dose of opaganib (two 250 mg capsules) after a large standard meal, 
while fasting, and via nasogastric tube. Overall, 13 subjects (56.5%) experienced at least one 
treatment -emergent event (TEAE). Of these, 9/13 and 4/[ADDRESS_482436] common TEAEs were nausea (3 subjects, 13%), diarrhea (3 subjects, 13%), 
dizziness (5 subjects, 21.7%) and headache (5 subjects, 21.7%). The drug was better tolerated after 
food as compared to the fasting state,  with double the proportion of subjects experiencing TEAEs after 
fasted administration of opaganib  compared to the fed state.  
Administration with a large standard meal (fed state) resulted in prolongation of absorption, with an increase in time to maximum  concentration by [CONTACT_385642] a 43% decrease in peak plasma 
concentration. Overall bioavailability (AUC0 -inf) was reduced by 17% compared to fasted state. The 
change in bioavailability did not appear to affect pharmacologic activity, as S1P suppression, a

[IP_ADDRESS] A Phase 2a (Proof of Concept) Study in patients with moderate to severe COVID-
19 Pneumonia (Study No. ABC- 110) 
A Phase 2a Proof of Concept study was completed in the US evaluating 40 patients (mITT population) 
with moderate to severe COVID -19 pneumonia  (aligning with WHO Ord inal Scale of Improvement 
Scores of 4 and 5)  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The primary endpoint was a comparison of the AUC for 
supplemental oxygen requirements  in opaganib treated vs. placebo control patients over the [ADDRESS_482437] a difference in the efficacy measurements.  
 
The preliminary results demonstr ated that opaganib as compared to placebo led to improved time to 
50% reduction of supplemental oxygen requirement; a greater percentage of patients no longer 
needing supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_2006]14 of treatment and less total oxygen requirements during the 14 
days of treatment, as measured by [CONTACT_385644] (AUC). Further evaluations showed a greater 
percentage of patients on opaganib no longer needed supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_2006] 7 and had improved 
time to discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], compared to placebo.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Compassionate Use Experience  
Under compassionate exemption, [ADDRESS_482438] been treated with 
opaganib. These results are uncontrolled however provide important clinical data within the 
compassionate use context. One p atient improved 36 hours after initiation of treatment to room air and 
was discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Five other patients were treated with opaganib for up to 14 days.  All 
patients had clinical improvement and were discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Patients treat ed with opaganib 
in the compassionate use program did not progress to requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.  
Patients receiving opaganib via compassionate use were compared to a matched case-control group of 18 patients  (Kurd, 2020) . Opaganib treated patients had faster improvement in lymphocyte counts, 
decreased CRP and faster time to being weaned off high flow oxygen. Of the 18 match controls, 6/[ADDRESS_482439] possibly related to opaganib.

11.3  Women of Childbearing Potential Definition  
For the purpose of this protocol, a woman is considered of childbearing potential (WOCBP),  
i.e. fertile, following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently 
sterile. Permanent sterilisation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] , bilateral tubal 
ligation  and bilateral oophorecto my. 
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical  
cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be  
used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
34 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 hormonal replacement therapy. However , in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.  
Highly effective contraceptive measures for WOCBP include:  
a. intrauterine device  
b. vasectomized partner (provided that the male vasectomized partner is the sole sexual partner of the 
WOCBP study participant and that the vasectomized partner has obtained medical assessment of 
surgical success for the procedure)  
c. and/or sexual abstinence.  
Sexual abstinence i s considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drugs. The reliability 
of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of t he clinical trial and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
d. If combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, 
transdermal) or progestogen-only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) , intrauterine 
hormone -releasing system associated with inhibition of ovulation is utilized then a back -up method of 
highly effective birth control is required, for example condom plus spermicide, cervical cap plus spermicide.  
Periodic abstinence (calendar , symptothermal, post ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods .

 12 STUDY DESIGN  
12.1  Overall Investigation Plan  
This is a phase 2/ [ADDRESS_482451] of care, in a randomization 
ratio of 1:1.  Treatment assignments will remain blinded to the patient, investigator and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717], as well as the sponsor.  Study participants will receive either opaganib 2 x 250 mg capsules (500 mg) eve ry [ADDRESS_482452] of care (pharmacological as defined above and/or 
supportive) at any given institution. Study drug will be administered every day for 14 days (Day 1 to Day 14).  
All participants will be followed up for [ADDRESS_482453]  dose of study drug.  The maximum 
duration of study participation will be up to 45 days (including up to 3 days screening; up to 14 days 
of double -blind treatment and completion of study at Day 42).  
12.2 Randomization Strategy  
Randomization will be done centrally, using pre -determined  schedule, and will assign subjects in a 1:[ADDRESS_482454] to patient risk status, randomization will be determined according to two stratification factors:  
a) Whether SoC treatment has established efficacy (yes versus no). The proven effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385607] a stand -alone document entitled Approved COVID -19 Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385608].   
b) Patients will further be stratified based on meeting three  or more  high risk clinical parameters 
for COVID -19 outcomes at baseline (yes or no) . 
The parameters are: 1) age at screening, ≥60 years of age, (yes or no); 2) male, (yes or no); 3) HbA1c 
at screening,  ≥6.5 and/ or on active treatment with in sulin or oral hypoglycemics  (yes or no); 4) 
hypoxemia without commensurate increased work of  breathing (defined as increased respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
nasal flaring and/or increase use of respi[INVESTIGATOR_385596] [yes or no]; 5) known 
underlying chronic lung disease (yes or no); 6) known cardiovascular disease or hypertension (yes or 
no); 7) BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m2 (yes or no); 8) known renal disease (yes or no).  
 
Should clinical or laboratory changes occur between screening and randomization-or between 
randomization and first dose of study drug- that affect patient eligibility, the patient should not be

be accomplished in the shortest time  interval possible.  
12.3  Study Assessments   
The assessments for this study are listed in Section  14.1 
12.4  Patient Discontinuation Criteria  
A patient may be withdrawn from the study treatment or  the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Request of the patient or patient’s representative  
• AEs or adverse device effects (ADEs) based on the judgment of the Investigator  
• The patient has experienced an AE that meets protocol defined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (refer to 
Section 12.6.2) 
• The Investigator decides that it is in the patient’s best interest  
• The patient is noncompliant with the protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Death  
If a subject is withdrawn at any time, the reason(s) will be recorded in the relevant section of the 
eCRF.  Patients  who discontinue from study treatment  and remain in the study,  will continued to be 
monitored per the Schedule of Assessments  until Day 14 and the safety follow -up phase to Day 42.

13.1.4 Prohibited Medications  
The following medications are prohibited during the study, including the safety follow -up period:  
• Medications that are sensitive substrates and narrow therapeutic range drugs which are 
substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 CYP2D6, CYP3A4, P -gP, 
BCRP and OATP1B1 should be avoided with opaganib.  
• Moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6 or P -gP are prohibited as they 
may increase the systemic exposure (plasma concentrations) of opaganib.   
• As azithromycin carries a r isk of QTc prolongation and/or t orsades de p ointe, it should not be 
co-administered with opaganib.  
• Warfarin, api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], argatroban and rivaroxaban are prohibited due to drug-drug interaction 
based on CYP450 metabolism . The washout periods for these drugs:  
o Warfarin  ~ 1 week  
o Api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]- 2.5 days  
o Argatroban- 5 hours  
o Rivaroxaban- 2 days  
13.1.5 Precautionary Medications  
• Substrates for MATE1 and MATE2-K should be used with caution and monitored for safety due the potential for inhibition of this transporter protein. As the  clinical relevance of these in -
vitro interactions hasn’t been established, these should be decided in discussion with the 
Medical Monitor on a case -by-case basis.  
Moderate to strong inducers of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 may influence the exposure of 
opaganib.

 17 ADVERSE EVENTS DEFINITIONS  
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_120291] (21 
CFR 312.32(a)) and are included here.  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE (may also be referred to as an adverse experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational or marketed) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
(investigational or marketed) product and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Adverse events will be reported from the first study drug administration . 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any of 
the following  outcomes :   
• death;  
• is a life -threatening adverse event (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe);  
• requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312];  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• is an im portant medical event.  This is defined as a medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or  surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.  Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
If either the sponsor or investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered 
serious and be evaluated by [CONTACT_80220].  
A suspected adverse reaction  means a ny adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specific ity or severity that has been observed.    
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any (suspected) adverse reaction (any 
adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event) that is 
both serious and unexpected.  
17.[ADDRESS_482467](s) are provided as a guide to be used for evaluating adverse events reported in

 this study to determine “suspected adverse reactions” that require expedited reported to regulatory 
agencies if they are unexpected.  In addition to the assessment below, the aggregate number of 
occurrences will be considered to decide whether the event is a reportable event and requires an IND 
safety report.  
Table 3.  Relationship of Study Medication to Adverse Events  
Unrelated  The study drug almost certainly (or certainly) did not cause the event.   
Guidelines:  
There is no reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the administration of drug;  
The pattern is inconsistent with that known for the drug; and/or  
There is another obvious etiology.  
Probably 
not related  It is more likely that the event is due to an other etiology than due to the study drug.   
Guidelines:  
There is no reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the administration of drug;  
The pattern is inconsistent with that known for the drug; and/or  
There is another more likely etiology.  
Possi bly 
related  It is approximately equally likely that the event is due to the study drug as it is due to another etiology.  
Guidelines:  
There is a reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the study drug;  
The drug seems as likely as other etiologies to have caused the effect  
Probably related  It is more likely that the event is due to the study drug than due to another etiology.   
Guidelines:
 
There is a reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the study drug;  
The event may be consistent with a known pattern of drug (or drug class) effects;  
The drug seems more likely than other etiologies to cause the effect;  
The adverse event  diminished upon cessation of study drug exposure or reduction in dose; and/or  
The adverse event worsened or recurred upon unintentional re -exposure to the study drug (Intentional 
rechallenge for the purpose of assigning causality should not be performed.)  
Definitely 
related  The evidence is compelling that the study drug caused the adverse event.   
Guidelines:  
There is a reasonable temporal relationship of the event to the study drug;  
The event is consistent with a known pattern of drug (or drug class) eff ects; 
The drug is far more likely than other etiologies to have caused the effect;  
The adverse event diminished upon cessation of study drug exposure or reduction in dose;  
The adverse event worsened or recurred upon unintentional re -exposure to the study drug (Intentional 
rechallenge for the purpose of assigning causality should not be performed.)  
 
17.2 Adverse Event  Grading  
Adverse events will be graded according to the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE version 5.0).   
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
49 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 If an AE is not listed in the NCI -CTCAE v.5.0, then the Physician will use the terms: mild, moderate, 
severe, life -threaten ing, or death to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of 
consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows:  
Table 4: Adverse Event Grade Definitions  
GRADE    
1 Mild  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL  
3 Severe  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL

 Life-threatening  Life-threatening consequences;  urgent intervention indicated 
[ADDRESS_482468] be 
provided to the sponsor within 24 hours of the study site personnel’s initial notification/awareness of the event.  All telephone communication regarding SAE must be followed by a written report.  Duly 
authorized study site personnel may sign completed SAE report forms; however, it is recommended 
that the investigator sign each final SAE report.  
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important.  Thus, follow -up 
information that becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], additional lab and test results, autopsy reports, etc.), should be collected 
subsequently, if not available at the time o f the initial report, and immediately sent to the CRO using 
the same procedure as the initial SAE report. Information on the SAE must be in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of causality.  
For ease of analysis, worldwide standardization, and regulatory reporting, the sponsor will code each 
reported adverse event or symptom to its corresponding preferred term and body system/organ class in 
the MedDRA dictionary version adopted for the study.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_385616] 17.2 Table 4. 
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021  
 
50 CONFIDENTIAL: PROPRIETARY INFORMATION  
 
 All SAE reports must be sent to the CRO, who will notify the sponsor’s medical mon itor and the 
sponsor’s regulatory/clinical affairs contact  [CONTACT_385651] a separate document.  
As required, all investigators will be notified of all AE reports that are determined to be serious, 
unexpected, and related (by [CONTACT_385652]) to the investigational product.  The 
notification will be in the form of a Safety Update (Dear [CONTACT_344952]).  
The notification is considered an addendum to the current Investigator’s Brochure; therefore, upon receiving such notices, the investigator m ust review and immediately submit a copy to the IRB 
according to local regulations.  The notification must be retained within the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent requires revision.  
17.4 Pregnancy  
Pregnan cy is not an adverse event  but requires emergent reporting to the Sponsor. In case of a patient 
or patient’s partner  becoming pregnant during study participation,  the pregnancy will be followed up to 
confinement and for 6 months after delivery. Corresponding information will be filed with the  source 
documents  at the clinical site. Pregnancy should be reported in the same time period as SAE  using the 
Pregnancy Form. If there are corresponding adverse events, these should be reported as separate AEs .  
17.5 Laboratory Abnormalities  
All new abnormal laboratory findings and those abnormal at baseline which change significantly ( e.g., 
by [CONTACT_385653] [NCI CTCAE] v5.0) are considered AEs.  Laboratory AEs for which there 
is no clinical intervention will be recorded only on the labor atory data pages of the eCRF.  Laboratory 
AEs not listed in the NCI CTCAE v5.0 will be considered as grade 1 (mild) if there is no clinical 
effect or intervention.  Laboratory values outside the normal range for certain parameters will not be 
considered AE s if they are generally not considered as indicating an abnormality; this includes such 
parameters as liver enzymes which are below the normal range.  If there is a clinical sequela or intervention, the laboratory abnormality is to be graded according to t he criteria used for clinical AEs, 
described above.

 Any clinically significant changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these 
procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF . 
17.6.1 Serious Adverse Events  
A written report of all SAEs that occur after the administration of study drug and during the study 
(ending with the safety follow -up visit, 28 days  off-study drug) must be submitted to the IRB/ethics 
committee (EC) and the sponsor. SAEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_482470] be submitted to the IRB/EC in an annual report per local reporting 
guidelines.

light to moderate meal prior to each dose administration and this was likely due to delayed absorption 
and reduced Cmax.  
Neuropsychiatric events reported in clinical studies to date include: hallucinations, anxiety, insomnia, 
lethargy, agitation, distress and dysarthria.   
These neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred at higher frequencies at the highest dose administered, 
which is above the dose selected (best tolerated dose) for the current and future clinical studies.   
The following adverse events are of special interes t. 
Patients who experience either of the following, at the discretion of the investigator, the medical 
monitor must be  notified immediately  (by [CONTACT_61529]) , as feasible, but no longer than 24 hours:  
• a sudden and clinically important increase in oxygen requirements  
• a rapid decline in clinical status leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation  
• clinically important increases in inflammatory markers

code breaks are performed using the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). When the investigator 
contacts the system to break a treatment code for a participant, they must provide the requested 
participant identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the 
participant. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the 
specified participant via IWRS. The system will automatically inform the CRO site monitor and the 
Sponsor that the code has been broken, but no treatment assignment will be communicated.  
It is the investigator’s sole responsibility to break the treatment code in emergency situations and to 
ensur e that there is a procedure in place to allow access to the IWRS in case of emergency. The 
investigator will inform the participant how to contact [CONTACT_385654]. The investigator will provide the protocol numb er, investigational treatment name [CONTACT_385670], participant number, and instructions for contact[CONTACT_385655] a

the protocol  and before breaking the blind of the study.  A supplementary document will provide 
further details regarding the planned futility analysis.

care (n= 232). The sample size calculation was based on powering the study with respect t o the primary 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint of proportions of patients no longer requiring supplemental 
oxygen for at least 24 hours by [CONTACT_2006] 14 (refer to S ection 15.1). It was assumed that the treatment 
success rate at 14 days in the control arm would be 40% and that opaganib is expected to provide 
absolute 15% increase of this rate, to a success rate of 55%. A total of 464 subjects provides 90% 
power to detect the assumed difference in success rate, using chi square test, at a two -sided α=0.[ADDRESS_482486] been evaluated for the primary 
endpoint.  
19.2 Stratification  
Randomization will be done centrally, using pre -determined  schedule, and will assign subjects in a 1:[ADDRESS_482487] to patient risk status, randomization will be determined based upon two stratification factors:  
a) Whether SoC treatmen t has established efficacy (yes versus no) . The proven effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385619] a stand -alone document entitled Approved COVID -19 Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_385608].  
b) Patients will further be stratified based on meeting three or more high risk clinical parameters for COVID -19 outcomes at baseline (yes or no).  
Refer to Section  12.2 for further details.  
19.3 Populations for A nalysis  
The primary analysis will be based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT), which consist s 
of all patients that were randomized and treated with at least one dose  of study drug and who met entry 
criteria #3 (The patient requires, prior to first dose of study drug, high flow supplemental oxygen or positive pressure ventilation, o r is receiving oxygen via a non -rebrea ther or reservoir mask , capable of 
delivering high concentra tions of oxygen. Patients who require mechanical ventilation or no longer

 require supplemental oxygen prior to receiving the first dose of study drug will not be included in the 
mITT analysis set.   
The primary analysis will also be analyzed using a Per -Protocol (PP) population that will be further 
defined in the S AP and the I ntention -to-treat (I TT) population who consists of all randomized patients.  
In all efficacy analyses, treatment group will be  assigned per randomization assignment.  
Safety analyses will be based on the safety analysis set, which consists of  all patients who received at 
least one dose of study drug and analyzed based on the actual treatment the subject received.  
19.4 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be based on a success (Yes/No) variable, indicating if a subject is 
no longer requiring supplemental oxygen,  for at least 24 hours  by [CONTACT_385639] 14 (patient death or 
subsequent requirement of supplemental oxygen or lost to follow -up through Day 42 will be regarded 
as a failure for the primary efficacy endpoint) . Any subject reported as not requiring supplemental 
oxygen on any given study day will be counted as a subject who has not required oxy gen for at least 
[ADDRESS_482488] has reached success (e.g . loss to follow up) thus 
preventing continued follow -up for success by [CONTACT_2006] 14,  will be considered as missing data and  will be 
counted as fa ilure for the primary analysis . Sensitivity analysis using time to event method will be 
performed censoring these cases at the latest informative time.  
 
The number and percentages of subjects achieving success  (as defined above) will be tabulated per 
treatment group. A 95% confidence interval will be constructed for each proportion. A Cochran 
Mantel -Haenzel (CMH) test will compare the proportion of success between the two groups, using the 
study stratification factors used for randomization, and a corresponding stratified risk difference 
estimate will be presented with 95% confidence interval.   
 
The significance level for this test will be two -sided 5%.  
 
The primary analysis will be based on the modified Intent to treat population (mITT)  as defined in 
Section 19.3.  
 Sensitivity and supportive analyses for the primary endpoint analysis will be defined and detailed in 
the statistical analysis plan. These will address at least the following aspects:  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd Protocol ABC -201 Version 5.0 15 April 2021

 • Negation of achieved Day [ADDRESS_482489] -day 14 failure event:  in a sensitivity analysis, 
events occurring after day [ADDRESS_482490] day 14 success.  
• Negation  of achieved  Day [ADDRESS_482491] -success failure: an analysis of endpoint 
targeting achieving any success will be performed.  
• Missing data due to early discontinuation of follow -up before achieving success  (prior to day 
14):  the primary endpoint analysis imputed these cases as Failures, however in this sensitivity 
analysis, these cases will be handled via censoring, using time to event methodology. Kaplan-
Meier method will be used to estimate cumulative incidence of success at day 14.  In this 
analysis death will be censored at 1 4 days.  
• Joining a different clinical trial prior to day 14 while patients do not withdraw consent from 
being followed up under ABC -201 protocol:  a sensitivity analysis will be performed where 
data collected during the patient participation in another clinical trial are not included . 
• A sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis using the subset of patients in the m ITT 
population regardless of meeting inclusion criteria #[ADDRESS_482492] dose of study drug.  
• PP analysis: Criteria for PP protocol will be bas ed on inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
protocol violations during the study and that confound the interpretation of analyses.  Patients who do not meet PP requirement will be defined blindly before database lock.  
• To account for the possibility of error s in values of stratification factors used for 
randomization, the primary analysis will supportively be repeated using the correct values.  
• Difference between the treatment and control groups when controlling for possible imbalance in important baseline fac tors will be analysed by [CONTACT_56620] a multiple logistic regression 
model. The list of baseline variables will be finalized in the SAP, prior to database lock.  
• To understand the possible impact of any initiation of allowed post -randomization effective 
anti-COVID 19 SOC treatments, descriptive statistics of such usage (frequency and timing of initiation) will be presented for each group.  
• The distribution of patient’s baseline SoC regimen will be summarized and presented by [CONTACT_19313]. Further, opaganib treatment effect will be assessed to confirm comparability of effect across 
these strata.

improvement/recovery type by a certain time frame (such as the percentage of patients with ≥2 
category improvement on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement by [CONTACT_2006] 14, secondary 
endpoints #1) will be defined using the following rules: a binary success variable (Yes/No) will 
indicate if the subject achieved the success of interest within specified timeframe , or not .  A recorded 
failure (within timeframe ) after success has been achieved , will be followed -up for re -achievi ng of 
success of interest  - at the target timeframe . Comparison of these endpoints between treatment groups 
will employ similar methods as those specified for the primary endpoint . In case there are subjects 
who discontinue the study before achieving success and before timeframe ending , the cumulative 
incidence probabilities at desired  time-point  will be estimated using time to event analysis, censoring 
these subjects  at last valid observation date  . In this analysis, d eath before event of interest will be 
censored at timeframe end , thus taking the highest unfavorable possible outcome for the endpoint .

 For the comparison of percent of patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation by [CONTACT_4475] 42,  
this endpoint is aimed to be assessed as a binary endpoint analysis, unless there are subjects who 
discontinue the study before meeting event of interest . Otherwise, c umulative incidence probabilities 
at day [ADDRESS_482494]  (within endpoint timeframe) . A patient 
for whom event of interest will not be observed will be regarded as right censored. Unless ot herwise 
specified in the SAP, the time frame for primary analysis of these endpoints is from Day [ADDRESS_482495] is of Improvement/Recover y type  (such as time to recovery) , death within the 
timeframe for each endpoint, will be addressed corresponding to the highest unfavorable possible outcome for the endpoint , which is censor ing at the end of time frame .  
 
Time to event endpoints will be compared using the stratified Log-rank test and the stratified Cox 
proportional hazards regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) along with 95% 
confidence interval, comparing opaganib versus control group. Kaplan-Meier plot by [CONTACT_385661] 95% 
confidence interval for each group at several time points within timeframe.  
 
Mortality endpoint s will be defined per subject as a binary variable s indicating if a subject had died by 
[CONTACT_385662] (28 and 42)  days from first dose date. Th ese binary endpoint s will be analyzed using the 
same methods specified for the binary endpoints  above .  To note, in case of early discontinuation of 
follow -up, time to event analysis to derive the -days mortality rate will be applied, censoring such 
subjects at their last valid observation date.  
 All secondary endpoints analyses will be based on mITT population and PP population and undergo 
the same sensitivity analyses as the primary analysis , as applicable . 
19.6 Safety Analyses  
The safety and tolerability of opaganib will be determined by [CONTACT_385663] (TEAEs), physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Patients who receive at leas t 
one dose of study drug are considered evaluable for safety (Safety population).  
Detailed specification of the safety analyses will be provided in the SAP.

 19.7 Type 1 error control  
The overall study-wise type I error will be 5%. The non-binding futility ana lysis does not increase type 
[ADDRESS_482496] final analysis significance level (Guidance for Industry on 
Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics, November 2019).  
To protect the study from type I error infla tion, the secondary efficacy endpoints will be interpreted 
inferentially only if a statistically significant treatment effect (p -value ≤0.05) is detected in the primary 
endpoint. Type I error will be further controlled by [CONTACT_385664]: each endpoint will be formally analyzed only in case the previous endpoint will be statistically significant (p -value ≤0.05).  
19.[ADDRESS_482497] futility boundaries will be prospectively determined and documented in the 
final version of the SAP prior to the interim analysis  and in the DSMB charter . The analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_385665] D SMB of the futility outcome  
(futile/non -futile) . Strict procedures will be employed to maintain the confidentiality of the interim 
results. To safeguard study integrity, the pre -defined details of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_385620] .

 1 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background and Rationale  
Premise  
Contemporary antiretroviral therapy (ART) -treated HIV -infected patients are at 
increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and other HIV -associated non -
AIDS conditions. This excess risk is due to multiple facto rs, including a higher burden of 
traditional risk factors, persistent inflammation and sub -optimal immune recovery after 
starting ART .  Independent of HIV infection, older age increases risk for non -AIDS 
conditions and is itself associated with greater inf lammation, reduced immune recovery 
after starting ART, and declining immune function (so called immune senescence).  Safe 
treatments that target this pathology, beyond HIV treatment with ART, represent a major 
unmet need for older HIV positive patients . 
 
The LIFE -HIV trial is a critical step to advance this field, prior to conducting a clinical 
outcome trial, by [CONTACT_56999] a translational clinical trial 
that will improve our understanding of non -AIDS disease pathogenesis. On going 
inflammation contributes to excess CVD, cancer and disease in multiple organ systems .  
Specific to HIV pathogenesis, immune activation and associated inflammation also 
drives collagen deposition  (i.e., fibrosis)  in lymphatic tissue (LT), disrupting  T-cell 
homeostasis and limiting immune recovery, which further increases non -AIDS risk. 
Losartan is a safe, inexpensive, medication with immunomodulatory and anti -fibrotic 
properties, quite apart from lowering blood pressure .  We will test the hypothesis  that 
losartan will reduce  inflammation  and improve  tissue fibrosis  leading to additional 
immunologic recovery.  These treatment effects have been demonstrated in uninfected 
populations (e.g., those with renal or connective tissue diseases ), but have not be en 
tested among  HIV positive patients where the mechanisms driving ongoing immune 
activation are somewhat unique to this disease.  
Scientific Background  
The Changing Spectrum of Morbidity and Mortality Among HIV Positive Patients:  
Antiretroviral therapy (AR T) effectively and durably suppresses HIV replication, leads to 
immune recovery (increasing CD4+ T -cell counts) and  prolonged life expectancy, and 
has changed the spectrum of morbidity and mortality among HIV positive persons.2-[ADDRESS_62165] relevant serious non -AIDS -related diseases in current clinical 
practice include atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, liver disease, 
end-stage renal disease, bone disease and subclinical neurocognitive dysfunction. Of 
these, CVD and cancer constitute the vast majority  of clinical events.5, 10-13 
 
What Contributes to Persistent Inflammation in Persons with ART -treated HIV Infection?   
HIV treatment with ART reduces activation of the immune response, including levels of 
inflammatory cytokines, though most immunologic abnormalities persist compared to 
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 2 HIV uninfected persons.14, 15 The level of T -cell activation (e.g., CD38/HLA -DR 
expression), reflecting adaptive immunity, predicts risk for AIDS16 and has been 
associated with CVD risk in cross -sectional studies.17, 18 More recent data demonstrate 
that innate immune activation also contributes to chronic inflamma tion.19-21 Activated 
monocytes (e.g., CD16+) are more frequent with HIV infection .22, 23 The CD16+ 
monocyte subset may be preferentially infected by [CONTACT_10840], demonstrate greater production 
of cytokines, and is independently predictive of coronary a rtery calcium (CAC) among 
HIV+ patients.24-26  
 
The precise mechanisms driving high level immune activation are not entirely clear, but 
appear to involve both a persistent anti -HIV response (even with HIV RNA at low levels) 
and a more generalized immune activation (e.g., cytokine release).15, 27-29 Potential 
factors specific  to HIV infection that may account for excess inflammation include: a) 
destruction of gut epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], which leads to chronic translocation of bacterial products, 
b) dysregulat ed inflammatory responses to co -pathogens (e.g., cytomegalovirus ), and c) 
loss of key regulatory response . Given that drivers of HIV -related inflammation are 
multi -factorial and diverse, a treatment that down regulates the inflammatory response 
more broadl y irrespective of the cause, like losartan, may be  more likely to show 
efficacy.     
 
Pathologic Consequences of Ongoing Immune Activation For Immune Recovery:  
An important pathologic consequence of persistent immune activation is fibrosis of  
lymph node  (LN) structures necessary for T -cell homeostasis.[ADDRESS_62166] fibrosis damages the fibroblastic reticular 
cell network (FRCn) that forms the skeletal anatomy of the T -cell zone, produces IL -7, 
and directs movement of T -cells within the LN.  The loss of naïve T -cells further 
perpetuates the process through declines in lymphotoxin -β (from T -cells) that is 
essential for FRCn vitality.  The vicious cycle leads to more reductions in IL -[ADDRESS_62167] collagen is therefore not only a cause of T -cell depletion but also 
contributes to incomplete immune recovery with ART via impaired survival of naïve T -
cells. Losartan  has been shown, both in vitro and in vivo, to inhibit TGF -ß and reverse 
existing fibrosis.31-35 These treatment effects may be  particularly importan t for older HIV 
patients, given that normal aging leads to thymic involution and increased apoptosis, 
reducing circulating naïve T -cells.36, 37  
 
Study Outcomes: IL -[ADDRESS_62168] Non -AIDS Risk:   
Excess risk for non -AIDS conditions is due to multiple factors, including a higher burden 
of traditional risk factors, but persistent immune depletion and ongoing inflammation 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_56977].  
We have previously reported that CD4+ T -cell count, including changes after starting 
ART, predict risk for a composite of non -AIDS conditions (including CVD and cancer).38, 
39 Although risk for both AIDS and non -AIDS conditions decline with higher CD4+ 
counts, this is more drastic for AIDS events.39, 40  Non-AIDS conditions  are therefore 
much more common than AIDS events at moderate to higher (e.g., >500 cells/mm3) 
CD4+ counts.41, [ADDRESS_62169] non -AIDS conditions, but 
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 3 associations between CD4+ count and risk for these conditions has been  reproduc ed in 
multiple cohorts.6, 43-[ADDRESS_62170] shown that inflammatory 
biomarkers well validated in the aging and cardiovascular fields22, 48-51 are elevated with 
untreated and (to a lesser degree) treated HIV infection,14, 52, [ADDRESS_62171] risk for CVD, 
cancer, and non -AIDS mo rtality.54-60 Our group conducted a series of nested case -
control and cohort studies , using data from 3 large H IV trials (SMART, ESPRIT, and 
SILCAAT), and determined that associations  for risk of  CVD, cancer, a composite of 
serious non -AIDS events, and all-cause mortality  was most robust for levels of 
interleukin -6 (IL-6).61-[ADDRESS_62172] composite of non -AIDS conditions .54, 62, 64, 65 
Rationale for Losartan  
Losartan has well -established off -target, or non -blood pressure lowering, effects that 
may benefit HIV positive patients. Angiotensin -2 (AT -2), a potent vasocon strictor, is a 
key regulator of the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone system (RAAS) that is also pro -
inflammatory (through Nuclear Factor -Kappa B [NF -B] pathways) and pro -fibrotic (via 
transforming growth factor beta [TGFβ1] induced connective tissue growth f actor 
[CTGF] expression).31-35 ARBs (angiotensin receptor blo ckers) selectively block AT 
receptor -1, mitigating the consequences for inflammation an d fibrosis, but importantly, 
have  fewer side effects than ACE -I.  Tolerability to losartan (100mg) is considered 
excellent, with self -reported side effects no different than for placebo in clinical trials.66   
 
There exists a large body of evidence that ARBs (e.g., losartan) down -regulate immune 
activation.  Angiotensin -2 induces ac tivity of NF -B,67, 68 a transcription factor that, in 
part, regulates immune activation and cytokine release (e.g., IL -6 and TNF -α).67, 69, 70 
Numerous (HIV uninfected) studies of ARBs or ACE -Is demonstrate reduc tions in  
inflammatory markers (e.g., IL -6, TNF -α, and CRP) via mechanisms both related to and 
independent of angiotensin  receptor blockade.71-75 In hemodialysis patients, losartan 
also decreased monocyte activation (CD16 +) in vivo  (to levels seen in healthy controls) 
and prevented monocyte activation (or CD16 expression) in vitro .76  In animal models, 
ARBs suppress transcription and release of IL -6 and other cytokines by [CONTACT_51920].77-79 
 
Independent of reducing immu ne activation, losartan may improve T -cell homeostasis 
and immune recovery by [CONTACT_57000] a well characterized 
mechanism of blocking TGF -ß at the level of phosphorylation of SMAD -2,3.31-35, 80-83 In 
animal models (of vascular, renal and cardiac fibrosis), losartan therapy inhibits TGF-ß 
activity and  improves histologic abnormalities .84, 85 In humans, losartan reduces urinary 
levels of TGF -ß among those with transplant related kidney fibrosis,86, 87 reversed 
fibrosis and improved in cardiac function a mong those with myocardial fibrosis.88 
Losartan’s net effect is also to shift the balance of matrix metalloproteases and their 
inhibitors in favor of tissue remodeling, which then reduces fibrosis.89-91  
 
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 4 Finally, the  100mg dose of losartan was chosen: a) to maximize the treatment effect  on 
inflammation  and fibrosis,76, 86, 92, 93 b) due to the excellent  safety  profile and lack of 
difference  in adverse events between 50mg an d 100mg doses (data from 20 clinical 
trials),66 and c) due to the predictable CVD risk reduction  through BP lowering.  
 
1.2 Objectives  
Our general goal is to evaluate the potential effectiveness of losartan (1 00mg daily) for 
reducing inflammation and improving immune recovery, given the potential for these 
treatment effects to reduce risk for long -term non -AIDS -defining complications among  
older  HIV positive participants.  Prior to conducting a clinical  outcome  trial, candidate 
treatments must be st udied among  HIV positive  patients given the unique pathogenesis  
driving inflammation  and disease risk .  Study objectives then include : 
 
 Primary Objective: Evaluate the treatment effects of losartan on systemic 
inflammation  
 
 (Main) Secondary Objective:  Evaluate the treatment effects of losartan on T -cell 
homeostasis and immune recovery  of T-cell population  
 
2 METHODOLOGY  
2.1 Trial Design  
The potential benefits of losartan (100mg daily) will be studied among HIV positive 
individuals over age 50 years whose  CD4 counts remain ≤ 600 cells/mm3. Participants 
(n=120, 60 per group) will be randomized to receive losartan  or matching placebo daily .  
After randomization, participants will start losartan (or placebo) at a dose of 50mg once 
daily, increas ing to 100mg once daily at the 2 -week  study visit pending results of a week  
2 toxicity lab evaluation (see 2.4 below for criteria).  Following month 1, participants will 
return for follow -up study visit procedures  at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 .  A lymph node 
biopsy will also be performed at baseline and month 12 from a subset of participants 
(n≥30). 
 
Changes from baseline in measures of inflammation, immune activation, immune 
recovery and fibrosis within lymphatic tissues will be studied.  The prim ary outcome will 
be the average of  IL-6 levels  over 12 months , and the main secondary outcome will be 
change in  CD4 count in blood over 12 months.  
  
2.2 Study Population  
The target population is HIV positive patients receiving effective treatment with ART and 
at low risk for AIDS defining complications.  For these participants, non -AIDS defining 
long-term complications (e.g., CVD and cancer) dominate the spectrum of morbid ity and 
mortality.  We will also focus on participants over age 5 0, as a dvanced age is 
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 5 associated with inflammation, poor immune recovery, and also increased  risk for long-
term complications such as CVD and cancer .  Any antiretroviral medications can be 
used.  Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below.  There are n o 
restrictions on the use of  concurrent mediations  other than ARB or ACE -I, but 
participants with common diseases known to be pro -inflammatory will be excluded.

 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 6 NOTE:   For participants consented to co -enroll into the LN biopsy substudy, the 
following approach based on BMI at screening visit will be applied:  
i. BMI ≤30:  participants can be co-enrolled in to LN substudy. A LN assessment 
should done upon consent ( by [CONTACT_28839], NP, or RN)  to determine if the participant 
has palpable LN in the inguinal region.  Findings  will be documented  on the 
LN Biopsy Referral Form . 
ii. BMI 30 -40: participants must have documentation of p alpable LN in the 
inguinal region at the screening visit.  
iii. BMI >40: participants are not eligible for LN biopsy substudy.  
 
2.4 Study Medication Intervention   
At baseline, p articipants will start losartan or matching placebo at 50mg daily. At 2 
weeks, side effects and blood chemistries  (BMP)  will be assessed. The dose of 
losartan/placebo will increase to 100mg daily at the week 2 assessment i f no toxicities 
or side effects are present that are attributable to study medication (see section 3.2 
below for speci fic study drug dose modification criteria).  A similar repeat assessment 
will then be performed at month 1 to verify that the 100mg dose is tolerated.  
Randomization and Blinding  
Eligible participants who consent to study procedures will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_62173] biopsy. Treatment assignments will be generated 
using a permuted block randomization scheme. Sites will use a secure, on -line program 
to obtain trea tment assignments.  The program  will also verify eligibility and the 
existence of key baseline data. Treatment assignments will be verified and recorded in 
a dataset blinded to view by [CONTACT_6624].   
A bottle ID number (BID) unique t o each bottle will be assigned to participants, and 
used by [CONTACT_57004]. Sites will not have access to 
the treatment assignment linked to each bottle number, and bottle numbers will not be 
assigned in sequence.  
Blinding will occur at 3 levels:  1) treatment assignment will be blinded, 2) interim data 
summaries will blinded to all but the unblinded statistician and 3) core lab staff will be 
blinded to treatment group. In the rare event that the blind must be broke n, every effort 
will be made to minimize the extent of the unblinding (for staff and participants) and an 
assessment of blinding will occur at the end of the study . 
Study Drug Production and Distribution   
Active losartan 50mg tablets and matching placebo will be provided  and distributed  by 
[CONTACT_57005]. From baseline to 1 -month visit, participants will take one 50mg 
tablet daily.  When/if the study drug dose is increased to 100mg, participants will take 2x 
50mg tabs once daily ( for 100mg).  S tudy drugs will be provided in 100 count bottles.  
One bottle will be dispensed at baseline, and one additional bottle at the 1 -month visit.  
Following this, 2 bottles will be dispensed at all subsequent visits (months 3, 6, and 9). 
Sites will order study drug from the DCC, which will communicate with [COMPANY_006]  to ship  
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 7 drug to sites.  [COMPANY_006] will provide the DCC with the key linking the BID (unique to each 
bottle) with whether the contents are active losartan or matching placebo.  The DCC will 
then instruct sites whic h bottle(s) to dispense to patients based on the BID. 
Risks Associated with Study Drug  
Losartan is approved by [CONTACT_57006]. Possible side 
effects of losartan include dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, fatigue, cough, upset 
stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, fever, sweating, fast heart rate, chest p ain, 
weakness, anemia, allergic reaction and kidney damage. In clinical studies, most of 
these side effects were no more common than what was experienced with placebo 
medication.   Participants will undergo a side effect assessment at each visit (see case 
report form and protocol implementation manual  for ‘symptom check list’ ). 
Losartan should not be used during pregnancy. If a developi[INVESTIGATOR_56980], injury or even death may result. For this reason, pregnancy is an exclusion 
criteri on and any pre-menopausal women  of child bearing potential  must be willing to 
use birth control  during the study .

 8 2.6 Study Visit Schedule  
Participants will be screened and, i f eligibility criteria are met, will be randomized at the 
baseline visit  to start active study drug or matched placebo (blinded).  Randomization 
must  occur within 90 days  of all screening  labs.  NOTE: the [ADDRESS_62174] specimen is not obtained at baseline, the participant will still be 
eligible to be randomized into the main study (but not the LN subst udy).  NOTE:  the 
biopsy procedure may occur after the baseline labs are obtained but still prior to 
randomization.   
 
After screening  and baseline visit s, participants will start losartan 50mg daily (or 
placebo) and return for a lab draw to assess toxicity (BMP only) at week 2.  At the week 
2 visit  (after toxicity lab results return) , participants will increase  to losartan 100mg daily 
(or placebo) if they me et criteria based on results from the 2 -week  assessment (see 
section 2.4 above).  Subsequent study visit procedures will occur in the context of visits 
at month s 1, 3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_62175] biopsy substudy, month 
12 visit labs cannot be drawn within the 7 days following the month 12 biopsy procedure 
(NOTE:  the biopsy procedure may occur after the month 12 labs are obtained).  
Participant should continue to take study medication until all study visits are completed; 
for participants enrolled in the LN biopsy substudy this  includes BOTH the month [ADDRESS_62176] at the time. For week 2 and month 1, this corresponds to a 
14-day tar get window (or +/ - 7 days).  Corresponding  target windows for month 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 study visits are 32 days (or +/ - 16 days).   
 
NOTE:  the ‘actual’ visit window for months 3, 6, 9, and 12 will  be +/ - 42 days (i.e., no 
gaps between visits where participan ts would not be in a visit window), but if >16days 
additional study drug should be dispensed to the participant —consistent with making 
every effort to capture study visit data while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_56981].  
 
The visit schedule i s outlined in the  table below. Patients will be fasting for all blood 
draws (except screening).  
 
Toxicity labs and a clinical assessment  will be ascertained as part of  follow -up study 
visits.  If clinical labs (e.g., HIV RNA level, CD4 count, BMP, hepatic panel, and CBC) 
are available as part of routine clinical monitoring during the study visit window, these 
results may be used in place of repeating clinic labs at the study visit.  If new sympt oms 
develop that may be related to study medications, the site study investigator  is to be 
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 9 notified within 24 hours and a clinical determination is to be made whether additional 
toxicity labs and/or  adherence requires assessing .

2.7 Sample Size Considerations  
Power for Reduced Inflammation (IL -6 levels)  
 The primary analysis will compare baseline -adjusted log IL -6 measurements at 1, 3, 6, 
9 and 12  months between treatment groups.  
 Standard deviation (SD) data from SMART (n=122 ; baseline and month 1) and 
ESPRIT (n =147; baseline and month 12) on participants who were on continuous ART 
between both time points were used to estimate a log IL -6 SD of 0. 74 pg/mL .   
 We assumed a 28 % reduction in IL -6 with losartan was plausible based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_56982].73, 74, 94  
Based on assumptions above, assuming 5% missing data, and considering the potential 
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 10 clinical risk reduction associated with IL-6 changes of this magnitude ( see epi[INVESTIGATOR_56983], following paragraph), a total sample size of n= [ADDRESS_62177] 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of 0. 3 log(IL -6), 
corresponding to a 26% reduction in IL -6, with a two -sided Type I error  of 0.05.  
Pooled  data fr om 3,766 participants in SMART, ESPRIT and SILCAAT trials  who were 
taking continuous ART with an HIV RNA level <400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at entry —a group that 
resembles our target population —indicate that a 26% lower baseline IL -6 level is 
associated with a 34% lower  risk of serious non -AIDS events or death from any cause.62  
Power for Immune Recovery (CD4+ T -cell count)  
 The primary analysis  will consider average changes in log10 blood CD4 levels (total 
and naïve) over 12 months. Total CD4 count will be measured at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months, and 4 pre -treatment baseline values (2 historical  within prior year , 1 
screening, 1 baseline) will be averaged to compute baseline CD4+ count for analyses. 
Averaging multiple baseline measurements will reduce variability and thereby [CONTACT_57007]. The log10 naïve CD4+ subset count will be measured at baseline 
and months 6 and 12.  
 Based  on participants  ≥ age 50 in the SMART and ESPRIT studies (n=510 total), the 
estimated SD of yearly changes in log10 total CD4+ count is 0.11. Based on 
preliminary data from [CONTACT_57046]’s lab , the estimated SD of yearly changes in  the log10 
naïve CD4 subset  is 0.24.  
With our sample size of n= 110, we estimate that we will have 80% power to detect a 
9.6% (19.8%) difference  in total (naïve) CD4 count. Assuming a baseline total CD4 level 
of ~300 -400 cells/mm3, a 9.6% increase in CD4 count corresponds to an approximate 
average annual increase of 30 -40 cells per year. From our prior epi[INVESTIGATOR_56984]4+ count in blood after treatment with ART, a 
difference in this range would correspond to 5-8% difference in risk for a composite of 
non-AIDS events.38, [ADDRESS_62178] clinical and drug toxicity assessments as indicated 
during the study.   
3.2 Study Drug Dose Modification  
At baseline, participants will start losartan or matching placebo at 50mg daily. At 2 
weeks, side effects and blood chemistries ( basic metabolic panel [ BMP ]) will be 
assessed. The dose of losartan/placebo will increase to 100mg daily at  this week 2 visit 
(i.e., once lab results return)  if all of the following criteria are met:  
a) Systolic blood pressure  (BP) ≥90 mmHg  
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 11 b) Potassium ≤5.0  mmol/L  
c) eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2 
d) Lack of a grade ≥[ADDRESS_62179] evaluation deemed possibly/ probably 
related to the study drug .  
e) Lack  of significant side effects deemed related to study drug  (e.g., lig htheaded 
upon standing)  
f) Lack of other concerns to increase study drug dosing, as determined by [CONTACT_57008] 100mg dose at the week 2 visit and continue to tolerate 
this dose at the month 1 visit, they will be contact[CONTACT_57009] 2 -4 
weeks following the month 1 visit.  Participants may be evaluated by [CONTACT_57010]/or 
have side effects assessed at any poi nt during the study, per the discretion of the site 
investigator.  If participants are increased to 100mg daily (or matching placebo) they will 
maintain this dose for the duration of the 12 -month study unless new side effects or 
adverse events necessitate re-evaluation (see below criteria).  
 
If participants do NOT increase dose to 100mg daily at the week 2 visit (e.g.,  if 
symptomatic or if systolic BP is not ≥90 mmHg ), the criteria for dose escalation may be 
reassessed at the 1 -month visit. If participants do not meet criteria for dose increase 
(from 50mg to 100mg daily)  after the 1 -month visit , they will be maintained on 50mg 
dose until  the month 3 visit, at which time the dose may be increased to 100mg daily if 
the five criteria above are met (a -e).  At an y point when p articipants have dose 
increased from 50mg to 100mg, they will be contact[CONTACT_57011]  [ADDRESS_62180] clinical labs drawn to assess toxicity; a full study visit for 
side effect and adverse event documentation can  occur at any point, per the discretion 
of the site investigator.  
 
Dose Reduction:  Tolerability , side effects , and clinical laboratory monitoring  will be 
assessed at each study visit (via participant report and clinical labs) , and at any other 
time point at the discretion of the clinical site investigator .  Adverse events that are 
assessed as related to study drug  will prompt re -evaluation via phone or as an adverse 
event visit, per clinical discretion of the site investigator. If this event worsens or doe s 
not resolve after re -evaluation, then study medication dose should be decreased (i.e., 
from 100mg to 50mg) or stopped (if taking 50mg daily).  If signs and symptoms resolve 
after 2 wee ks, then the participant may  resume or  increase dose (i.e., back to 10 0mg if 
previously reduced to 50mg  daily) , per the clinical discretion of the site investigator.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_56985]:   If an adverse event of grade ≥3 is assessed as related to 
study drug, study medication should be stopped and the participant should  be re -
evaluated in 2 weeks.  If a grade 2 rash is persistent, study medication may also be 
stopped at the discretion of the site investigator and the participant should be re -
evaluated in 2 weeks.  If signs and symptoms resolve after 2 weeks, then the part icipant 
may be re -challenged at a lower dose (i.e., at 50mg if previously taking 100mg daily) 
per the clinical discretion of the site investigator.  If study medication i s stop ped for an 
adverse event that i s later determined NOT to be related to study med ication, then  the 
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 12 medication may be resumed at 50mg and increased to 100mg per initial criteria for dose 
escalation and at the discretion of the clinical site investigator.  
3.3 Adherence and Tolerability  
Adherence will be assessed via participant self -report and pi[INVESTIGATOR_692] (by [CONTACT_57012]) 
during each follow -up visit.  Tolerability will also be assessed via self -report, with 
additional laboratory assessments performed for toxicity.  
3.4 Data Collection  
All data will be entered into web -based case report forms and transferred to servers at 
the data coordinating center (DCC) at University of Minnesota School of Public Health 
using REDCap software.  Paper source documentation will also be kept in a secure, 
locked location at each clinical site.  Study nurses and/or ot her qualified research 
technicians will perform all blood draws and blood specimen processing.  The blood 
specimen collection tubes and processing protocols are outlined in the study laboratory 
manual.  
 
3.5 Blood Specimen Processing  
See the LIFE -HIV study  laboratory manual for details on blood specimen processing.  
Participants will be fasting for all study visit blood draws (optional for screening visit).  
Plasma and serum specimens will need to be processed  from whole blood  within 4 
hours  of collection.    
3.6 Clinical Labs  
All clinical labs will be measured on fresh blood specimens the day of the study visit, at 
the site  clinical lab using CLIA approved standards .  Plasma HIV RNA level will be 
estimated using COBAS® AmpliPrep/COBAS® TaqMan® HIV -[ADDRESS_62181], v2.0.  
 
The following clinical labs will be assessed to monitor for toxicity  per Table 2 above : 
i. Complete Blood Count (CBC, with platelet count and differential)  
ii. Basic Metabolic Panel (B MP) 
iii. Hepatic panel (AST, ALT, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphat ase) 
3.7 Plasma Biomarke rs 
Plasma specimens will be analyzed at the Laboratory for Clinical Biochemistry 
Research (U of Vermont), under the direction of [CONTACT_57047]. IL-6 will be 
measured  with Chemiluminescent Sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems ).  A high degree of 
repeatability (low analytic variability) has been reported by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tracy’s lab  for assessing 
IL-6 and other plasma biomarkers.95-101

 13 Panels of fluorochrome -conjugated antibod ies for cell surface markers not affected by 
[CONTACT_57013] (e.g., CD3, CD4, CD8, CD38, HLA -DR, CD14, CD16, CD142 or tissue 
factor (TF) and viability dye to exclude non -viable cells) have been validated previously 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sereti.102 The prevalence of classic al (CD1 4+/CD16 -), intermedia te 
(CD14+/CD16+) , and non -classic al (CD14dim/CD16+)  monocyte phenotypes and T cells 
phenotypes reflecting activation (HLA -DR+/ CD38+) with be  characterized;  and with 
these methods additional phenotypes may be easily characterized (e.g. TF expression 
on mon ocytes, T -regulatory cells, or senescent T -cells). Only live cells will be included; 
samples with low (<75%) viability will not be processed.  
3.9 Lymphatic Tissue Assessment  
Lymph node ( LN) biopsy  will be performed in a subset of at least [ADDRESS_62182] substudy  include: a) 
participant consent , b) lack of contraindications to the LN biopsy procedure,  and c) 
palpable lymph nodes on exam by [CONTACT_57014].  All 
participan ts at NIH will be offered participation into the LN substudy, and participants at 
HCMC and Allina/ Abbott Northwestern (in Minneapolis) will be offered participation 
until/if 25 patients are enrolled.  Planned analyses  will be  exploratory in nature focused 
on assessment of : a) collagen deposition reflecting fibrosis in T -cell zone, b) changes in 
CD4 T -cell populations, c) changes in the structure of the FRCn, and d) changes in 
cellular immune activation in lymphatic tissue.  
 
Biopsies will be  performed at the University of Minnesota (for HCMC and Abbot 
Northwestern sites) and the NIH clinical center, by [CONTACT_57015] a research 
facility equ ipped with inpatient rooms.  T issue specimens are placed into fresh 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and then tran sferred to 80% ethanol for paraffin 
embedding.  LN tissue can also be divided at the bedside prior to processing to 
accommodate additional methods that requiring non -fixed tissue.  
 
Changes  in LN T -cell zone  collagen,  the size of T-cell populations, and the  FRCn 
structure  will be measured using established methods of IHC with antibody staining and 
quantitative image analysis (QIA) developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Schacker’s lab  at the University of 
Minnesota .80, 81, 91, 103-107 A similar approach will be used to assess cellular immune 
activation within lymphatic tissue.  
 
4  SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
4.1 Measures to reduce risk for adverse events  
Risks related to low blood pressure, or hypotension, are minimal but may increase with 
dehydration/hypovolemia.  To reduce this risk, participants will be counseled on 
maintaining good hydration and diet, and on the potential  effects of orthostatic 
hypotension.  
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 14 4.2 Adverse Event Definition s 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical research 
participant administe red an investigational product , which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the investigational product. As such, an AE can be an unfavorable or 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom or 
disease temporally  associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the product.  
 
If a preexisting condition worsens post -enrollment (frequency increases and/or severity 
grade increases), it should be reported as an adverse event.  
 
A symptom check -list will be included in the CRF (detailed in the protocol 
implementation manual) that includes common symptoms or side effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_56987].  
 
Appendix D provides a table of adverse events, with grading criteria, adopted from the 
DAIDS 2009 Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Advers e Events  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  Any adverse event occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the fol lowing outcomes:  
i. Death,  
ii. A life -threatening condition,  
iii. A congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
iv. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
v. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
vi. An important medical event that, based upo n appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above.  
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  is any event that is:  
i. Unexpected , AND  
ii. Related to study participation in this study , AND  
iii. Increase the risk of harm to the participant or others (or be an SAE)  
4.3 Documenting Adverse Events  
All new adverse events of grade ≥3 or deemed related to study drug  will be ascertained 
and recorded on study vi sit CRFs (through the online REDCAP  interface). Criteria for 
assigning a grade of severity of adverse events  are summarized in Appendix D.  
NOTE:   adverse events based on laboratory criteria will only be 
ascertained/recorded if ≥ grade 3, and no adverse events will be 
ascertained/recorded b ased on CD4+ T -cell count criteria.  
 
There are five severity grades that can be assigned to adverse events, which are 
defined as follows:  
i. Grade 1 = Mild  
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 15 ii. Grade 2 = Moderate  
iii. Grade 3 = Severe  
iv. Grade 4 = Potentially life -threatening  
v. Grade 5 = Death  
 
Additi onal information ascertained for each adverse event includes:  a) date of onset, b) 
relationshi p to study drug (see section 4. 4 below ), c) any action taken on study drug, 
and d) whether the adverse event qualifies as a serious adverse event (including the 
SAE criteria fulfilled).  
 
Source documentation (in addition to the CRF variables for AEs) will collected at clinical 
sites for all serious adverse events, as well as any other problems involving risks to 
participants that are unanticipated or unexpected and are reasonably believed to be 
related to research participation.   
4.4 Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
For all adverse event s grade ≥3 that occur after randomization , study investigator(s) will 
assess the potential rel ationship of the event to the study medication.  One of the 
following designations will be used:   
 
i. Related: There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to the study 
agent(s).  
 
ii. Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the AE may be related to 
the study agent(s).  Alternative etiology, diagnosis or, explanation for the AE 
should be provided.  
 
4.5 Reporting Adverse Events   
The IRB (or Human Subjects Committee ) for the site where the event occurred will 
receive immediate notification of all serious adverse events (SAE) that are  ALSO 
deemed protocol related , OR for any an unanticipated problem (UP ; which are by 
[CONTACT_57016]) .  NOTE:  an adverse event (of any grade) that is unexpected , 
is reasonably believed to be related to study participation, and involves risk  to the 
participant  or others should be captured as a UP (per definition above 4.2).   
 
The site will enter this information into the adverse event log and SAE/UP case report 
form ( via REDCap reporting).  The data coordinating center (DCC) will distribute a 
summary of each SAE/UP event to the remaining clinical sites and participating 
institutions for submission to their respective IRBs.  
 
The site will also complete FDA Form 3500 (Me dWatch; see below), and submit this 
form to the FDA (via online reporting) and also to the DCC. Within [ADDRESS_62183]:  
 
a) Inform local IRB per institutional guidelines and timelines

visit, including all v isit procedures . 
 
5 Data and Safety Monitoring  Plan  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety on a 
daily basis. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be formed with [CONTACT_57049] as the un -blinded statistician; other members will not be from institutions 
involved in the study and will be approved by [CONTACT_45455]. Committee members will have 
experience with HIV/AIDS clinical research studies.  Prior to enrollment the DSMB will 
review the protocol and data analysis plan.   
The DSMB  will act in an advisory capacity to the NIA Director to monitor participant 
safety, evaluate the progress of the study, and review procedures for maintaining the 
confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and analyses. During 
the study the DSMB will meet at least yearly.   
Refer to the DSMB Charter  and data and safety monitoring plan for details.  
5.[ADDRESS_62185] of the primary blood and tissue outcomes will not be available until after visits are 
completed, as samples will b e batch processed at our participating laboratory site. 
Hence, there will be no formal interim analyses for efficacy or futility related to the main 
study outcomes.  
 Protocol Version 3.0  
JAN 2017  
 17 However,  the lead study statistician will prepare and submit reports to the DSMB every 
3 months documenting study enrollment totals and adverse events. While we do not 
anticipate significant issues with safety in this short -term study, a recommendation by 
[CONTACT_57017] u nacceptably high . 
Recommendations from the DSMB (e.g., continue the study as planned), and a letter 
summarizing the findings at the end of the study, will be transmitted to each site for 
submission to their IRB.  
5.[ADDRESS_62186] yearly either in -person or by [CONTACT_31523], data 
quality, and participant safety. An initial DSMB meeting will be scheduled as soon as 
any of the following occurs:  
i. Six months have elapsed since enrollment of the first patient  
ii. 50% o f goal enrollment is achieved  
iii. 30 person -years of follow -up is achieved  
  
The data and safety monitoring report will include  data on : enrollment (including 
progress), visit attendance, completeness of data, completeness and quality of 
specimen collection, b aseline characteristics, adherence and discontinuation of 
medication, and side effects and adverse events.   
 
5.3 DSMB Membership and Affiliation  
The following individual(s) has/have accepted position(s) as part of the DSMB. DSMB

[ADDRESS_62189] of 
losartan on systemic inflammation, the outcome will be the average of log IL -6 levels 
(plasma) from samples obtained at months, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12; two pre -treatment log IL -
[ADDRESS_62190] will be assessed by [CONTACT_57019] .  Additional analyses will consider change in IL -6 at specific 
visit time points, as well as the percent of participants that achieve an IL -6 level <1.1 
pg/mL (i.e., the 25th percentile among HIV+ patients with viral suppression in the 
SMART/ESPRIT/SILCAAT trials)  
 
Immune recovery will be assessed by [CONTACT_57020] 10 CD4+ T -cell count s in blood, using 
a linear mixed effects model that , in addition to the model components described for the 
systemic inflammation analysis above,  incorporate s a main effect for tim e (in months) , a 
treatment -by-time interaction , and individual -specific intercepts and slopes (for time) . 
The hypothesis of no treatment effect on rate of yearly change in log10 CD4 counts will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_57021] e treatment -by-time 
interaction term.  
 
Subgroup analyses will be performed to explore potential for differential treatment 
effects (e.g., entry CD4 count [including ≥ vs. < 350] , CD4:CD8 ratio,  use of statins , 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or other drugs with potential anti-inflammatory or anti -fibrotic properties, and co -
morbidities or polymorbidities).  Trends in treatment effects on the primary outcome (log 
IL-6) over time will be assessed using linear mixed effects models similar to those 
described for the modeling of  log10 CD4+.  
 
The main analyses for primary and secondary outcomes will be intention to treat . As 
secondary analyses, we will perform p er-protocol (‘on treatment’) and compliance -
adjusted analyses , and will also carry out analyses using all available data by [CONTACT_57022], using linear mixed effects models incorporating baseline covariates, the 
treatment indicator, and non -missing outcome measurements.

CONSENT FOR PARTICIPATING IN AN NIA/NIH -FUNDED RESEARCH TRIAL  
 
INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE: WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
You are invited to be in a research study that looks at the use of a medication that may 
improve the health of HIV positive people who are already on HIV medicines.  The 
medication (losartan , or COZAAR ) is approved  by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA), 
but not for treatment of HIV infection; it is commonly used to treat high blood pressure.  
Howev er, this medication may help address some of the damage that HIV causes in the 
body.   One hundred HIV positive patie nts will be enrolled in this study , at 5 clinical sites in 
the U.S .  
 
Damage caused by [CONTACT_57027] .  These 
problems cannot be fully corrected, even with  effective treatment using  antiretroviral 
medications.  One of these problems is inflammation.  ‘Inflammation’ occurs when the 
body’s immune system is  responding to injury or infection.  Inflammation can be helpful in 
the short term , but when i t is persistent it can also caus e more damage to the body over 
time.  HI V also damages the immune system by [CONTACT_57028].  This scarring limits recovery of the immune system after treatment with 
antiretroviral therapy is started.   
 
Ongoing inflammation and damage to the immune system is thought to  contribute to risk for 
heart disease and cancer among HIV positive persons.  This study will determine if 
losartan , a commonly used medication for blood pressure,  reduces  inflammation and 
improves immune recovery  (possibly by [CONTACT_57029] i n lymph nodes) .   
 
YOUR PARTICIPATION IS VOLUNTARY  
This consent form gives you information about the clinical research study that will be 
discussed with you.  Once you understand the study, and if you agree to take part, you will 
be asked to sign this consent form. You will be given a copy to keep.  
 
Befor e you learn about the study, it is important that you know the following:  
Your participation is entirely voluntary .  
 
     
    
 You may decide not to take part or to withdraw from the study at any time without losing the 
benefits of your routine medical care.  
 
Eligi bility:  Who is being asked to be part of this research study?  
You may be  eligible for this study if you are over age [ADDRESS_62228] contraindications 
to study  procedures .  Your HIV ‘viral load’ must be undetectable.  If your doctor or the study 
investigators feel that it would not be safe to take the study medication then you will not be 
eligible to participate. Some factors that could make you ineligible for t his study include low 
blood pressure, chronic inflammatory disease, and liver or kidney disease.  
 
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE  IN THE STUDY?  
The study will last approximately 12 months.  After the screening visit, if you qualify, you  
will come in for a ‘baseline’ study visit, receive a blood draw after 2 weeks and then a 
follow -up visit at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12  months.  
 
HOW WILL THE STUDY W ORK?  
If you agree to participate in this study, you will be randomly assigned (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin ) 
to start either losartan or a placebo (inactive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  for 12 months . Neither you, nor the study 
investigators, will know which study medication you will take.  You will start out taking 50mg 
of losartan or matching placebo .  If you are not having any pro blems  after 2 weeks, the 
dose will be increased to 100mg of losartan or matching placebo for the duration of the 
study.   
 
PROCEDURES:  WHAT DO  YOU HAVE TO DO IF Y OU ARE IN THIS STUDY ? 
 
Screening visit:  
You will be asked to come in for a screening visit, wh ere your study investigators will review 
the study procedures and this consent form.  If you agree to participate, you will have your 
blood drawn (approximately 2 tablespoons) and medical history reviewed (similar to a  
routine  clinic visit) to determine if  you are eligible to participate.  If you meet study criteri a, 
you will then return within 2  month s to begin the study.  
 
Baseline and follow -up (month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) clinic study v isits: 
The baseline and follow -up clinical  visit will last approximately 1-[ADDRESS_62229] of:  
 
Medical History: You will be interviewed to review your medical history and assess your risk 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_56995].  We will also access your medical chart to obtain the results 
of recent lab tests and medications you are taking.  
 
Blood Draw:  We w ill obtain a blood sample ( up to  8 tablespoons) from a vein in your arm.  
The total blood draw volumes per visi t will be less than [ADDRESS_62230] 6 hours  prior to having your blood drawn at study visits. Blood samples will be use d to 
measure markers in the blood related to inflammation and other markers that may 
contribute to heart disease and other complications of HIV infection.  These samples may 
be stored for up to 20 years.  
     
    
  
At the baseline visit, you will start taking losart an (or placebo). You will take 1 tablet (50 
mg) every day , until  a member of the study team tells you to stop or changes your dose. 
The nurses will give you the study medicine during your clinic visits. At follow -up visits you 
will be asked to bring in all  of your study medication , and adherence and tolerability to the 
treatment will be assessed.  
 
Blood draw at week 2: 
Two weeks after you start taking study medication (at baseline), you will be asked to have 
your blood drawn to make sure you are not having significant toxicity from the study 
medication.  You will also be asked several questions to determine if you are experiencing 
any side effects.  If the study investigators determine that you are not having any toxicity or 
side effects, the dose of the stu dy medication will be increased from 50mg to 100mg at (or 
immediately after) this visit . 
 
Biopsy procedure visits (baseline and month 12):  
If you agree  to a lymph node biopsy  and study investigators can palpate a candidate lymph 
node to biopsy , a surgeon will collect a lymph node from your groin twice during the study.  
This procedure will occur after or very close to the baseline and month 12 study visit s.  The 
purpose of this biopsy is to see if losartan reduces scarring in immune system tissue , that 
in-turn improves recovery of immune cells (such as T -cells).  
 
Lymph node biopsies of your groin will be done at [the University of Minnesota  or NIH 
Clinical Center ]. The actual surgery will only take [ADDRESS_62231] 6 hours before 
surgery. You will be given one dose of an oral antibiotic 30 minutes prior to the biopsy. The 
groin area will be scrubbed with an antiseptic solution. Local anesthetics (similar t o 
Novocain) will be injected to numb the area. An incision between [ADDRESS_62232] (baseline, month 6 and month 12):  
     
    
 We will also ask you to perform a short physical function test at three times during the  
study.  The first test is grip strength.  You will be asked to squeeze a hand held device for a 
few seconds that measures the force you can generate. The second test involves having 
you walk a short distance of four meters at your usual pace.  This will b e done twice.  
These physical functions tests will take [ADDRESS_62233] blood drawing 
techniques.  Lymph node tissue will be collected by [CONTACT_9256].   
 
Samples will be used  to evaluate the potential benefits of losartan. Additional samples will 
be store d up to 20 years for future research.  These samples can help us learn more about 
HIV, AIDS, immune function, inflammation, fibrosis (scarring), or other related diseases.  In  
general , the research tests we perform are not like routine medical tests and may not relate 
directly to your medical care.  For this reason, we may not put future test results in your 
medical record or share these test results with your medical provider  
 
Genetic Testing  
Future research on stored samples might involve genetic testing.  Genetic testing may tell 
researchers something about how health or illness is passed on to you by [CONTACT_57030].  Some genetic information, such as the ability to make certain 
proteins in the body, has been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases like 
arthritis.  
 
Any genetic information collected or discovered about you or your family will be 
confidential. G enetic information about you will not be revealed to others, including your 
relatives, without your permission.  We will not release any information about you or your 
family to any insurance company or employer unless you sign a document allowing release 
of information.  
 
HOW WILL YOU GET MEDICINES FOR THE STUDY?  
Study medications will be provided to you by [CONTACT_57031].   You will be provided with sufficient supply to last the duration of 
the study.  You will be asked to return any unused study medicat ion, including empty 
containers . 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS OF THIS STUDY?  
 
You will be monitored for side effects at each visit, and your lab tests will include an 
evaluation f or signs of med ication toxicity . 
 
Risks of Study Procedures  
You will have your blood drawn at each study visit. This is identical to having your blood 
drawn at a medical clinic, and can involve discomfort , light -headedness  and/or minor 
bruising. Physical examination of the groin may be uncomfortable and cause 
embarrassment. Discussion of past medical history or risk factors for HIV infection may be 
     
    
 stressful and cause anxiety. You may decline to answer any questions that you do not feel 
comfortabl e answering.  
 
Study Medication: Losartan  
This medication is approved by [CONTACT_1622]. Losartan is used to treat high blood pressure. 
The possible side effects of Losartan include dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, 
fatigue, cough, upset stomach, vomiting, dia rrhea, sore throat, fever, sweating, fast heart 
rate, chest pain, weakness, anemia (low red blood cell count), allergic reaction and kidney 
damage. We do not expect that losartan will interact with any of your HIV medicines.   In 
clinical studies, most of t hese side effects were no more common than what was 
experienced with placebo medication.  
 
This medication should not be used during pregnancy. If a developi[INVESTIGATOR_56980], injury or even death may result. For this reason, if you are a woma n of 
childbearing potential , you  will be asked whether or not you are sexually active and if you 
are, what type of birth control you use. You must be willing to use a reliable form of birth 
control for the duration of the study period, such as  a barrier me thod or  spermicide. 
Condoms cannot be the only form of birth control you use. If you become pregnant during 
the study or think you may be pregnant, you should inform either the site investigator or a 
study nurse immediately. We will ask that you return any  study medication. We will ask 
permission to contact [CONTACT_57032].  
 
Lymph Node Biopsies  
If you have agreed to a lymph node biopsy, t he biopsy procedure may cause pain, even 
though you have been given an anesthetic. There may be bleeding associated with the 
procedure. There is the risk of infection ; however , it is less than 1-[ADDRESS_62234] pain after the lymph 
node biopsy. Occasionally, when we do a lymph node biopsy we cannot find the lymph 
node that was felt prior to the procedure. This is unlikely; however, it does happen  on 
occasion . 
 
Physical Function Tests  
You may fall during the short [ADDRESS_62235], you will not n eed to perform them. We will not ask you to perform 
any activities that put you at more than a minimal risk of falling or injuring yourself.  
 
WHAT ABOUT PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING?  
If you are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant, you will not be eligible 
for this study.  If you become pregnant during the study, you will be asked to stop study 
medications and withdraw.  Therefore, if it is possible that you could bec ome pregnant, we 
ask that you use a reliable form of birth control  for the duration of the study  (listed above in 
‘Study Medication’).  
 
     
    
 WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THIS STUDY?  
If you take part in this study, there are no anticipated benefits to  your health.  The research 
has the potential to benefit people with HIV infection , after the study is completed and the 
findings are analyzed .   
  
COMPENSATION  
You will be paid $XX for each study visit you attend after the screening visit.  You will 
recei ve $XXX for each biopsy of a groin lymph node you complete. If you complete two 
study -related lymph node biopsies, y ou may receive a total of $XXX for participating in the 
study.  Study investigators may ask for your social security number as part of the 
monitoring process for this compensation.  
 
WHAT IF THERE ARE NEW FINDINGS?  
We will not be analyzing data during the study.  However, if during the course of this 
research study, there are significant new findings discovered which might influence your 
willingness to continue, the researchers will inform you of those developments.   You may 
request your own results after the study by [CONTACT_57033].  
 
WHAT IF YOU DON’T WANT TO BE IN THE STUDY ANY LONGER?  
If you enroll in this study , you may decide to stop participating at any time.  Withdrawing 
from this study will not affect the benefits of your regular medical care.   
 
CAN YOUR STUDY PARTICIPATION BE STOPPED WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT?  
You may be taken off of study medicines befor e the  end of the study if investigators or your 
doctor recommend this.  You may be taken off the entire study without your consent if:  
 Your study doctor decides that continuing in the study would harm you;  
 Your lab results indicate that you are experiencing tox icity from study medications;  
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO YOU HAVE BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
You may discuss other strategies for improving your health  with your doctor.  
 
WHAT ARE THE COSTS TO YOU?  
The medications that are part of this study will be provided free -of-cost to you, and will be 
distributed during study visits.    During the study, you, your insurance company, or some 
other third -party payer must pay for all other medicines, including HIV medicines not paid 
by [CONTACT_57034].  We will provide all 
clinical and professional services, lab work, and other tests that are part of this study and 
not part of your regular care at no cost to you.

Before you learn about the study, it is important that you know the following:  
Your participation is entirely voluntary.  
 
     
    
 You may decide not to take part or to withdraw from the study at any time without losing the 
benefits of your routine medical care.  
 
Eligibility:  Who is being asked to be part of this research study?  
You may be  eligible for this study if you are over age 50, you have HIV infection , you are 
doing well with taking your antiretroviral medications , and you do not have contraindications 
to study procedures .  Your  HIV ‘viral load’ must be undetectable.  If your doctor or the study 
investigators feel that it would not be safe to take the study medi cation then you will not be 
eligible to participate. Some factors that could make you ineligible for this study include low

HOW WILL THE STUDY W ORK?  
If you agree to par ticipate in this study, you will be randomly assigned (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) 
to start either losartan or a placebo (inactive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382])  for 12 months . Neither you, nor the study

PROCEDURES:  WHAT DO  YOU HAVE TO DO IF Y OU ARE IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Screening visit:  
You will be asked to come in for a screening visit, where your study investigators will review 
the study procedures and this consent form.  If you agree to participate, you will have your 
blood drawn (approximately 2 tablespoons) a nd medical history reviewed (similar to a  
routine  clinic visit) to determine if you are eligible to participate.  If you meet study criteria, 
you will then return within 2 months to begin the study.  
 
Baseline and follow -up (month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12) clinic stu dy visits:  
The baseline and follow -up clinical visit will last approximately 1-[ADDRESS_62236] of:  
 
Medical History: You will be interviewed to review your medical history and assess your risk 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_56995].  We will also access yo ur medical chart to obtain the results 
of recent lab tests and medications you are taking.  
 
Blood Draw:  We will obtain a blood sample (up to 7 -8 tablespoons) from a vein in your 
arm.  The total blood draw volumes per visit will be less than [ADDRESS_62237] 6 hours  prior to having your blood drawn at study visits. Blood samples will be 
used to measure markers in the blood related to inflammation and other markers that may 
contribute to heart disease and other complications of HIV infection.  These samples may 
be stored for up to 20 years.  
     
    
  
At the baseline visit, you will start taking losartan (or placebo). You will take 1 tablet (50 
mg) every day , until  a member of the study team tells you to stop or changes your dose. 
The nurses w ill give you the study medicine during your clinic visits. At follow -up visits you 
will be asked to bring in all of your study medication, and adherence and tolerability to the 
treatment will be assessed.  
 
Blood draw at week 2: 
Two weeks after you start taking study medication (at baseline), you will be asked to have 
your blood drawn to make sure you are not having significant toxicity from the study 
medication.  You will also be asked several questions to determine if you are ex periencing 
any side effects.  If the study investigators determine that you are not having any toxicity or 
side effects, the dose of the study medication will be increased from 50mg to 100mg at (or 
immediately after) this visit . 
 
Physical function assessme nts (baseline, month 6 and month 12):  
We will also ask you to perform a short physical function test at three times during the 
study.  The first test is grip strength.  You will be asked to squeeze a hand held device for a 
few seconds that measures the for ce you can generate. The second test involves having 
you walk a short distance of four meters at your usual pace.  This will be done twice.  
These physical functions tests will take [ADDRESS_62238] blood drawing 
techniques.  
 
Samples will be used to evaluate the potential benefits of losartan. Additional samples will 
be store d up to 20 years for future research.  These samples can help us learn more about 
HIV, AIDS, immu ne function, inflammation, fibrosis (scarring), or other related diseases.  In 
general , the research tests we perform are not like routine medical tests and may not relate 
directly to your medical care.  For this reason, we may not put future test results in your 
medical record or share these test results with your medical provider  
 
Genetic Testing  
Future research on stored samples might involve genetic testing.  Genetic testing may tell 
researchers something about how health or illness is passed on to you by [CONTACT_57030].  Some genetic information, such as the ability to make certain 
proteins in the body, has been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases like

family to any insurance company or empl oyer unless you sign a document allowing release 
of information.  
 
     
    
 HOW WILL YOU GET MEDICINES FOR THE STUDY?  
Study medications will be provided to you by [CONTACT_57031].   You will be provided with suf ficient supply to last the duration of 
the study.  You will be asked to return any unused study medication, including empty 
containers.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND/OR DISCOMFORTS OF THIS STUDY?  
 
You will be monitored for side effects at each visit, and your la b tests will include an 
evaluation fo r signs of medication toxicity.  
 
Risks of Study Procedures  
You will have your blood drawn at each study visit. This is identical to having your blood 
drawn at a medical clinic, and can involve discomfort, light headedne ss and/or minor

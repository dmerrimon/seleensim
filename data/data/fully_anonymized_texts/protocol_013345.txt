V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135514] has emerged in 5-  
fluorouracil (5 -FU) and leucovorin (LV) -based combinations in advanced pancreatic 
cancer, with some recently published impressive results. Thus, a new platform to which novel combinations of active cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_819666].  
 
1.2 Pancreatic Cancer  Therapy  
Systemic cytotoxic therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer was historically limited to 5 - 
fluorouracil (5 -FU) and leucovorin (LV). In the metastatic setting, these agents produced 
response rates of <10%, clinical benefit rates of <10% and a median overall survival  (OS) 
of 4.5 months. 4,5 However, with the development of gemcitabine, clinical trials 
suggested  an improvement  in both the quality  of life and survival  of patients  receiving  
this drug despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a relatively low objective response rate of still < 10%. 6 There was 
also a statistically significant, but not clinically meaningful, increase in the median 
surviva l (5.7 vs 4.4 months, p= 0.0025) and one year survival (18% vs 2%) favoring 
those treated with gemcitabine. Confirmatory studies rapi[INVESTIGATOR_819667]. 7,[ADDRESS_1135515] been similarly disappointing, with only a marginal improvement in 
survival noted (median OS 6.24 months vs 5.91 months; HR 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69- 0.99]; 
p= 0.038) with the addition of the anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]  (EGFR) 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib.  12  Alternative approaches to gemcitabine-  
based combination therapy are desperately  needed.

V6.0; 07/26/2018   1.3 FOLFOX Activity and Safety  
Systemic disease control using 5- fluorouracil (5 -FU), leucovorin, and oxaliplatin as 
second -line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer has been prospectively 
evaluated.  13, 14  In these previously treated patients,  the combination resulted in a 
partial response rate of 23% with stable disease seen in an additional 17- 30%. Median 
OS was 17 -25 weeks with notable improvements in some patient’s performance status. 
Toxicity was tolerable and consistent with previous experiences using this combination 
therapy in patients with colorectal cancer. Specifically, Grade 3/4 toxicity included 
leukopenia  16%, anemia  3.2%, thrombocytopenia  3.2%, diarrhea  14.2%,  fatigue  
16.1% and neurotoxicity 4.2%. There were no treatment related deaths. In a phase III 
RCT, the combination of 5- FU/LV/Oxaliplatin was determined to be superior to 5 - 
FU/LV alone in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who progressed on 
gemcitabine therapy. 15 The specific combination of these agents (FOLFOX) has also  
been prospectively evaluated in the first -line setting with a similar response rate of 
27%, stable disease in another 30% of patients, median PFS of 4 months and median 
OS of 7.4 months. 16, 17 
 
At the 2010 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinica l Oncology, results  
were presented from the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD [ADDRESS_1135516] the combination of 5- FU/LV/oxaliplatin/irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX ). At a 
median follow -up of 26 months, 342 randomized patients demonstrated superior OS for 
the combination therapy (11.1 months) compared to gemcitabine (6.8 months; HR  0.57;  
95% CI, 0.45 -0.73; p< 0.001). Progression free survival (PFS) (6.4 months vs 3.3 
months; HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.37- 0.59; p< 0.001) and response rate (32% vs 9%; 
p< 0.001) also favored the combination treatment. However, toxicities  were 
significantly increased with FOLFIRINOX including diarrhea (13% vs 2%), peripheral 
neuropathy (9% vs 0), thrombocytopenia (9% vs 3%), neutropenia (46% vs 21%), and febrile neutropenia (5% vs 1%). There were also trends towards worsening vomiting 
(14% vs 8%) and fatigue (23% vs 17%) with FOLFIRINOX. There was one toxicity - 
related death in each arm. 
[ADDRESS_1135517] failed to produce meaningful 
improvements. FOLFOX remains an interna tionally recognized combination  treatment  
in widespread use for colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal malignancies. 
22 
Academic, community, and institutional oncology providers are familiar with FOLFOX  
10 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135518] shown that Src tyrosine kinase activity is commonly activated 
and elevated in many human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, with prognostic 
implications as associated with disease stage and patient survival. 23,24,25,26,27, The major 
consequence of increased Src activity is to promote an invasive and metastatic cancer 
phenotype characterized by [CONTACT_819691] -cell adhesion, increased cell -matrix 
adhesion, mediation of lymph/angiogenesis, and formation of focal adhesions. 28,29,30,31 
Intracellular cytoplasmic Src (c -Src) activates a number of substrates critical to these 
processes including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), signal transducers and activators of 
transcript ion 3 (STAT -3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia -inducible  
factor -1 alpha (HIF), and other components of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF) 
pathway. 28,32,33,34 Inhibition of Src activity in preclinical models restores cell- cell 
adhesion, inhibits cell migration and invasion, and reverses the Src -mediated invasive 
and metastatic cancer phenotype. 35,36,37,38 
Dasatinib (SPRYCEL®, Bristol -Myers Squibb [BMS] -354825)  is a potent, broad 
spectrum inhibitor of 5 critical oncogenic tyrosine kinases/kinase families, including the 
Src family of kinases with sub -nanomolar inhibition constant (IC 50). Dasatinib is 
approved in the [LOCATION_002], Europe, and several other countr ies for chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior treatment including imatinib.  
Dasatinib has been studied in more than 2500 subjects with CML or Ph+ ALL and with solid tumors. Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data indicate that d asatinib has good oral 
absorption, is > 90% protein bound, and is predicted to have a large volume of distribution. The overall mean terminal half life is around [ADDRESS_1135519] populations studied. In cases of 
severe myelosuppression, recovery generally occurred following brief (2 to 4 weeks) 
dose interruptions or reductions. Other severe hematologic toxicities were uncommon. 
Most subjects continued treatment without further evidence of myelosuppression. The most common nonhematologic toxicities include gastrointestinal AEs, in particular 
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Most g astrointestinal events were mild to moderate in 
severity. Other dasatinib toxicities to note included fluid retention, bleeding -related 
events, and QT prolongation. The incidence of edema associated with dasatinib treatment was similar across all phases of  CML and Ph+ ALL, and pleural effusion in 
dasatinib -treated subjects mostly occurred in advanced stage CML and Ph+ ALL. 
Overall, one third of subjects had a bleeding event and of those, half were considered  
11 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135520] -line metastatic pancreatic cancer (Protocol ID# 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 42 Nevertheless, incorporating dasatinib with cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_819668]. Constitutively active Src is associated with increased gemcitabine and 5 -FU chemoresistence in pancreatic cancer cells. 
43,44 Inhibition of Src 
reduces tumor expression of thymidylate synthase (TS), the target enzyme of 5 -FU. 
Lowering TS levels is associated with subsequent 5- FU chemoresistance reversal 
resulting in substantially decreased in vivo tumor growth and inhibition of distant 
metastases. 45  Dasatinib can synergistically inhibit oxaliplatin -induced Src  activation.  
45,46 Src inhibition also increases oxaliplatin activity both in vitro and in vivo. 47 
Safety regarding the specific combination of FOLFOX and dasatinib in patients with 
previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer was presented at the 2010 Annual Meetin g 
of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. 48 In this study of thirty total patients, all 
received FOLFOX plus cetuximab plus dasatinib in one of 3 dasatinib dosing cohorts. 
This phase IB prospective protocol with escalating doses of dasatinib includi ng an  
expansion cohort included patients who had received a median of 3 prior regimens, 
making this a heavily pretreated population of subjects. Grade 3- 4 toxicities included 
neutropenia (23%), fatigue (20%), pleural effusions (3%), and thrombocytopenia (3%). 
The dose limiting toxicity was fatigue and myelosuppression with maximum tolerated 
dose of dasatinib in combination with FOLFOX being [ADDRESS_1135521] atin.

V6.0; 07/26/2018   1.6 Summary of Results of Dasatinib Investigational 
Program  
 
SPRYCEL®50 (dasatinib, Bristol -Myers Squibb [BMS] -354825) is a potent, broad 
spectrum inhibitor of 5 critical oncogenic tyrosine kinases/kinase families (BCR -ABL, 
Src, c- KIT, PDGF receptor β [PDGFRβ], and ephrin [EPH] receptor kinases), each of 
which is linked to multiple forms of human malignancies, and was discovered and  
developed by [CONTACT_20444]. SPRYCEL is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US)50, Europe (EU)51, 
and several other countries for the treatment of adults in all phases of chronic myeloid 
leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib, and 
Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) who are 
resistant or intolerant to prior therapy.  
 
The recommended starting dosage for subjects with chronic phase CML is 100 mg 
administered orally once daily (QD). The recommended starting dosage for accelerated phase CML, myeloid or lymphoid blast phase CML, or Ph+ ALL is 140 mg/day administered orally once daily. In clinical studies of adult CML and Ph+ ALL patients, dose escalation to 140 mg once daily (chronic phase CML) or 180 mg once daily (advanced phase CML and Ph+ ALL) was allowed in patients who did not achieve a hematologic or cytogenetic response at the recommended starting dosage.  
 
1.6.1  Human Pharmacokinetics of  Dasatinib  
 
Dasatinib is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_819669].52 
Across all treatment regimens, disease status, and study days, mean C max values were 
attained at median T max values that ranged  from 0.45 to 3.18 hours postdose. The overall  
median T max value was approximately 1 hour. There was no influence of treatment 
regimens, disease status, or study days on the half -life (T -HALF) of dasatinib. The 
overall mean T -HALF value was approximately 3  to 5 hours. Dasatinib has an apparent 
volume of distribution of 2505 L, suggesting that the drug is extensively distributed in the 
extravascular space. There were no clinically meaningful relationships between steady state CLo and body weight or body surf ace area. Statistical linear regression analyses 
were performed on log (AUC) versus log (DOSE) to assess dose proportionality. The AUC of dasatinib is approximately dose proportional in the dose range of 15 to 
240 mg/day, suggesting that the drug exhibited linear kinetics over the entire dose range. However, the 90% CIs are wide, indicating that the variability in AUC is high. There was no marked effect of disease state, age, gender, and race on the PK parameters CLo, Vz/F, and T -HALF, suggesting that dose adjustment in these subpopulations may not be  
necessary.
53 The geometric mean accumulation index (AI) ranged from 1.01 to 1.61 
between days 5/8 and 26/29 and no consistent dose -related trends were observed in the 
accumulation of dasatinib after repeated ad ministration. Data from a study of 54 healthy 
subjects administered a single, 100 mg dose of dasatinib 30 minutes following 
consumption of a high- fat meal resulted in a 14% increase in the mean AUC of  
dasatinib.54 The observed food effects were not clinically relevant.  
Dasatinib is extensively metabolized in humans. Unchanged dasatinib represented 29%  
13 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   of circulating radioactivity in plasma after a 100 mg dose of [14C]-labeled dasatinib was 
administere d to 8 healthy subjects in study CA180019.55 Elimination is predominantly in 
the feces, mostly as metabolites. Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labeled dasatinib, 
approximately 85% of the dose was recovered in the feces within 10 days, and 
approximate ly 4% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in the urine. 
 
The cytochrome p450 enzyme CYP3A4 plays a major role in the metabolism of dasatinib 
in the humans. Dasatinib has little potential to induce CYP3A4 and, at concentrations  
≤ 25 μM (1 μM = 488 ng/mL), dasatinib did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, 
and CYP3A4 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.56 Based on these data and 
plasma concentrations observed in vivo, dasatinib is unlikely to decrease the exposure of 
co-administered drugs that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, or 
CYP3A4. In human liver microsomes, dasatinib did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP2E1 at concentrations up to 50 μM.57 It inhibited CYP2A6 
(IC50 = 35 μM), CYP2C8 (IC50 = 12 μM), CYP2C9 (IC50 =  50 μM), and CYP3A4 
(IC50 values of 18 and 10 μM for midazolam and testosterone substrates, respectively).  
 
 
1.6.2  Clinical Experience with Dasatinib in Solid  Tumors  
 
Studies in the solid tumor program for dasatinib include four Phase 1 studies (CA180003, 
CA180021, CA180004, CA180086) and three Phase 2 studies (CA180059, CA180088, CA180085). CA180003 and CA180021 were exploratory studies in refractory solid tumors and advanced solid tumors, respectively, and have been completed. CA180004, CA180059, and CA180088 are ongoing in breast cancer, and CA180085 and CA180086 are ongoing in prostate cancer (ongoing as of November 2008).  
 
The efficacy and safety observations in the solid tumor studies are presented in the following sections. 
1.7 Safety of Dasatinib in Clinical  Studies  
1.7.1  Experience in CML and Ph+ ALL Clinical Trials  
 
The data presented in Table 1.7.[ADDRESS_1135522] exposure to dasatinib in 2182 patients with leukemia in clinical studies (starting dosage 100 mg once daily, 140 mg once daily,  
50 mg twice daily, or 70 mg twice daily). The median duration of therapy was 11 months (range 0.03 -26 months).  
 
The majority of dasatinib -treated patients (1,864 [85%]) experienced at least 1 drug - 
related adverse reactions at some time. Drug was discontinued for adverse reacti ons in 
14% (296/2182) of subjects. Drug related AEs leading to discontinuation in any  
1 category occurred in ≤  1% of the subjects with the exception of pleural effusion 
(85/2182; 4%). In subjects with chronic phase CML, drug- related pleural effusion 
accoun ted for discontinuation in [ADDRESS_1135523] in the 100 mg 
QD group had discontinuation due to drug- related pleural effusion compared with 
35 subjects in the 70 mg BID group. In subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, drug- related pleural effusion accounted for discontinuation in 33 of the 1032 subjects. Six 
subjects in the 140 mg QD group had discontinuation due to drug- related pleural effusion  
14 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   compared with 27 subjects in the 70 mg BID group. 
 
Overall, 59% (1287/2182) of subjects across all disease phases reported SAEs (any 
grade). Drug -related SAEs were reported in 53% (681/2182) of subjects. In subjects with 
chronic phase CML, notable common drug- related AEs included dyspnea, pleural 
effusion, congestive heart fai lure, febrile neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. In most 
cases, a lower proportion of subjects in the 100 mg QD group reported drug -related SAEs 
than subjects in the 70 mg BID or other dose groups. In subjects with advanced phase CML or Ph+ ALL, notable common drug- related AEs included dyspnea, pleural effusion, 
diarrhea, and hematological toxicities. In most cases, there was little difference in these SAEs between the 140 mg QD and 70 mg BID groups. Rates of severe drug- related 
pleural effusion were lower in the 140 mg QD group (3%) vs the 70 mg BID (6%).  
 
 
The most frequently reported AEs are presented in Table 1.7.1

1.7.3  Anticipated Adverse Events with  Dasatinib  
 
Myelosuppression  
Treatment with dasatinib is associated with severe (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4) 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. Their occurrence is more frequent in patients with advanced CML or Ph+ ALL than in chronic phase CML. Myelosuppression was generally reversible and usually managed by [CONTACT_819693].
51 In a Phase 3 dose -optimization study in patients with chronic phase 
CML, Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression was reported less frequently in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than in patients treated with 70 mg twice daily. At doses of  
150 mg in combination with FOLFOX, empi[INVESTIGATOR_819670]. (Personal Communication, Kopetz S.)  
18 
V6.0; 07/26/2018    
        Bleeding Related Events  
Severe CNS hemorrhages, including fatalities, occurred in ≤  1% of patients receiving 
dasatinib. Severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurred in 4% of patients and generally 
required treatment interruptions and transfusions. Other cases of severe hemorrhage occurred in 2% of patients. Most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia. (Incidences in this paragraph reflect drug -related adverse reactions 
based on investigator’s attribution.)  
 
Patients were excluded from participation in dasatinib clinical studies if they took medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. In some trials, the use of anticoagulants, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was 
allowed concurrently with dasatinib if the plat elet count was 50,000 to 75,000. Caution 
should be exercised if patients are required to take medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants.
51 
 
Fluid Retention  
Dasatinib is associated with fluid retention. In all clinical studies, severe flu id retention 
was reported in 10% of patients, including pleural and pericardial effusion reported in 7% and 1% of patients, respectively. Severe ascites and generalized edema were each reported in < 1% of patients. Severe pulmonary edema was reported in 1%  of patients. 
Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of pleural effusion such as dyspnea or dry cough should be evaluated by [CONTACT_13190] X -ray. Severe pleural effusion may require 
thoracentesis and oxygen therapy. Fluid retention events were typi[INVESTIGATOR_804629]. (Incidences in this paragraph reflect drug -related adverse reactions based on investigator’s attribution). 
52 
 
 
In the Phase 3 dose -optimization study in patients with chronic  phase CML, fluid 
retention events were reported less frequently in patients treated with 100 mg once daily than in patients treated with 70 mg twice daily.
51 
 
QT Prolongation  
A comprehensive evaluation of data from Phase 2 studies (N = 865) examined the 
possible effect of dasatinib on ECG parameters, particularly the QTc interval. The mean 
QTc interval changes from baseline using Fridericia’s method (QTcF) were 4 to 6 msec; the upper 95% confidence intervals for all mean changes from baseline were < 7 msec . 
On-study, a total of 5 subjects (< 1%) reported a QTcF > 500 msec; 1 of these 5 subjects 
reported a QTcF > 500 msec on both Day 1 and Day 8. No events of torsade de pointes were reported.
52 
 
Nine of the 1150 subjects with chronic phase CML had QTc prolon gation reported as an 
adverse event. Of these 9 subjects, 7 were considered related to drug. None of the  
9 subjects who reported QTc prolongation were from the 100 mg QD group compared with 8 subjects from the 70 mg BID group. Ten of the 1032 subjects with advanced disease had QTc prolongation reported as an adverse event. Of these 10 subjects, 7 were considered drug -related. All 10 of the subjects who reported QTc prolongation were from 
the 70 mg BID group. Overall, of the 2182 subjects treated with dasati nib, 21 (1%) 
subjects across the studies reported a QTcF > 500 msec.

V6.0; 07/26/2018   1.8 Overall Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
The clinical studies discussed in Section [ADDRESS_1135529] synergy with restoring inherent chemosensitivity. The addition of dasatinib to FOLFOX (FOLFOX -D) represents a novel therapeutic regimen in pancreatic cancer with 
safety an d pharmacokinetic data already having been established in colorectal cancer.  
This protocol will test the safety and activity of this combination in pancreatic cancer where current clinical outcomes remain far from optimal.

3 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
3.1 Good Clinical  Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as 
defined by [CONTACT_5787] (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).  
 
The study will be conducted in compliance wit h the protocol. The protocol, any 
amendments, and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_8594].  
 
All potential serious breaches must be  reported to Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) 
immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant  degree, 
the safety or physical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific value of the  study.  
 
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and experience to perform their respective tasks. This study will not use the services of  study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been 
scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure; debarment). Systems with procedures that ensure the quality of every aspect of the study will be implemented.  
21 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135530]/Independent Ethics 
Committee  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_5698]/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment materials/process (eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be provided 
to subjects. The investigator should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling, information to be provided to subjects, and any updates. The investigator should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates, and other information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory requirements or institution procedures.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1135531]  ensure that subjects (or, in those situations where consent cannot be 
given by [CONTACT_1766], the legally acceptable representative) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in 
whic h they volunteer to participate. Freely given written informed consent must be 
obtained from every subject (or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by 
[CONTACT_1766], the legally acceptable representative) before clinical study participation, inclu ding informed consent for any screening procedures conducted to establish subject 
eligibility for the study.  
 
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study subjects are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke patients, or those with severe 
dementia) may be enrolled in the study only with the consent of a legally acceptable 
representative. The subject must also be informed about the nature of the study to the 
extent compatible with the subjects’ understanding, and should they become capable, 
they must personally sign and date the consent form as soon as possible. The explicit 
wish of a subject unable to give his or her written consent, who is capable of forming an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_121137], or to be withdrawn from, 
the clinical study at any time, should be considered by [CONTACT_11168].

n) Inability to comply with study and/or follow -up procedures  
Eligibility crite ria for this study have been carefully considered to ensure the safety of the 
study subjects and to ensure that the results of the study can be used. It is imperative that subjects fully meet all eligibility criteria.  
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1135542] of these patients will be maintained by [CONTACT_3452].  
26 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135543] discontinue study t reatment for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of informed consent (subject’s decision to withdraw for any  reason)  
• Progressive disease at any  time 
• Patient meets criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_819674]  5.5 
• Any cl inical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness 
which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], indicates that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the  subject  
• The patient uses illicit drugs or other sub stances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], have a reasonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise interfering with  results  
• Pregnancy  
− Instruct WOCBP to contact [CONTACT_157325] (eg, missed or late menstrual period) at any time 
during study participation. Institutional policy and local regulations should 
determine the frequency of on- study pregnancy tests for WOCBP enrolled in 
the study.  
− The investigator must immediately notify BMS if a study subject becomes 
pregnant. The mechanism for reporting pregnancy is described in Section 7.6. 
• Termination of the study by  [CONTACT_20444].  
• Loss of ability to freely provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily 
incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infectious disease)  
illness  
• Substantial non- compliance with the requirements of the  study  
• The patient is lost to follow  up 
 
The Investigator will make every reasonable effort to keep each patient in the study 
unless  it is in the patient’s best interests to discontinue participation. If a patient is 
removed from the study or declines further participation, all End of Treatment evaluations should be performed if the patient is willing and able to be assessed. A descrip tion of the reason(s) for withdrawal from the study must be recorded on the case 
report form (CRF). The Investigator should also ensure that all patients are followed up for survival status after the Final Visit. Patients who elect to withdraw from treatme nt 
prematurely may still be followed per the study calendar with their permission.  
 
Relevant visit data should be entered on the CRF and any unused study medication will be accounted for and returned for all patients participating in the study, even for a brief period of time. Patients who discontinue following entry will have relevant information completed and recorded on the CRF. All patients who discontinue because of adverse events or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should be followed up until they recover or stabilize, and the subsequent outcome will be recorded. If any patient should die during the trial or within 30 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262], the Investigator will inform the BMS representative. The cause of death should be recor ded in detail, within 
24 hours, on a serious adverse event (SAE) form and reported to the sponsor Drug Safety Unit (refer to Section for SAE reporting).

V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135544] in some 
regions, is defined as follows: A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled (form ulated or packaged) in a way 
different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form. In this protocol, the investigational product is dasatinib. 
 
Other medications used  in the study for therapeutic reasons as components of a given 
standard of care are considered non- investigational products. In this protocol, non-  
investigational products include oxaliplatin, 5- fluorouracil, and leucovorin.  
 
5.1.1  Agent  Administration  
 
One treatment cycle is equal to 14 days.  
 
Agent  Dose  Route/Duration  Schedule  
Dasatinib*  150 mg Oral Daily on days 1 -14 
Oxaliplatin+ 85 mg/m2 IV over 120 minutes  1 every 14 days  
Leucovorin+ 400 mg/m2 IV over 120 minutes  1 every 14 days  
5-fluorouracil  
bolus+ 400mg/m2 IV push over less than 5  
minutes  1 every 14 days  
5-fluorouracil  
infusion+ 2400mg/m2 IV continuous infusion for  
46 hours  1 every 14 days  
* If the start of a cycle is delayed due to scheduling, logistical issues or non -dasatinib 
related toxicities, dasatinib may be continued in the interim.  
+Administer sequentially as written, except oxaliplatin and leucovorin, which may be  
administered concurrently in separate bags using a Y -line. In the event that oxaliplatin is 
discontinued, leucovorin can be administered alone and the administration duration may  
be shortened to 15 min. See section 5.5 for levoleucovorin substitution.  
 
 
5.1.2  mFOLFOX -6 
 
Doses should be based on actual body weight. Body surface area (BSA) will be calculated prior to each treatment cycle from body weight in kg, recorded up to 72 hrs prior to day 1 of each cycle, and height in cm, recorded at baseline. The formula for BSA calculation should remain consistent throughout treatment. Pre -medications should be 
administered per in stitutional practice.  
28 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135545] 3 hours prior 
to chemotherapy, even if this represents a time different from the patient’s usual 
administration time. Please note, there is no dose adjustment for BSA.  
 
5.1.4  Supportive  Care  
 
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be given throughout the study.  
 
Nausea: Antiemetics should be administered per institutional guidelines.  
 
Diarrhea: Patients should be provided with instructions on use of loperamide (Imodium) in the event of diarrhea, as well as instructions to contact [CONTACT_1963]. Other anti -diarrheals are also allowed. Patients should be given mouth 
care instructions per institutional guidelines.  
 
Neutropenia: Prophylactic use of G -CSF or Peg -G-CSF is not permitted. Please 
refer to table 5.5.2 for neutropenia adverse event guidelines. When needed, either G-CSF 5mcg/kg/dose (total dose rounded per institutional guidelines) SQ on days 
4-10 of each cy cle or Peg -G-CSF 6mg SQ on day 4 of each cycle are acceptable 
options. 
 
Peripheral Nerve Cold Hypersensitivity: When appropriate, intravenous calcium gluconate plus magnesium sulfate, may be administered immediately before and after each dose of oxaliplati n per institutional protocol (see table 5.5.3 for details). 
 
Infusional Hypersensitivity: Platinum hypersensitivity can cause dyspnea, bronchospasm, itching and hypoxia. Appropriate treatment includes  supplemental 
oxygen, steroids, antihistamines and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]; bronchodilators and vasopressors may be required. Platinum hypersensitivity is an extremely rare event (approximately 0.5% of patients) and should be treated  promptly.  
 
Pharyngo -laryngeal Dysesthesias: Oxaliplatin may cause discomfort in the larynx 
or pharnyx associated with dyspnea, anxiety and/or swallowing difficulty and is exacerbated by [CONTACT_119403]. Appropriate therapy includes use of anxiolytics and cold avoidance. If grade 1 (mild) pharyngo- laryngeal dysesthesias occurs while 
treatment is being  administered, increase the duration of infusion to 6 hours. If 
grade 2 (moderate) or grade 3 (severe) pharyngo -laryngeal dysesthesias occurs 
during treatment administration, stop oxaliplatin infusion, administer benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], reassure the patient and monitor. At the discretion of the  
29 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   investigator, the infusion may be re -started at 1/3 original infusion rate. Increased 
duration of infusions is not required for subsequent treatment administration. 
 
Inflammation: Signs of inflammation, including pneumonitis, colitis, or skin rash, 
have been observed during dasatinib therapy. During interruption and short -term 
steroid treatment (i.e. 5 -7 days methylprednisolone with rapid taper) may be 
appropriate. Concurrent antibiotics are appropriate i f there is a clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_819675].  
 
Fluid Retention: Fluid retention, commonly including pleural effusion, has been 
noted during treatment with dasatinib. Early institution of diuresis is appropriate (i.e. furosemide 20 -40 mg, PO, daily, and/or  spi[INVESTIGATOR_819676] 25- 50 mg, PO, daily 
with titration to symptoms). Pleural effusions that remain or become symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_819677]. Steroid may also be effective for pleural effusion. Chest discomfort may be related to a pericardial effusion; an echocardiogram should be performed to investigate this side effect, at the discretion of the treating  physician.

20 mg  
white to off -white, biconvex, round, film coated tablet with either “20” 
or “BMS” debossed on one side and “527” on the other side  
50 mg white to off -white, biconvex, oval, film coated tablet with either “50” or 
“BMS” debossed on one side and “528” on the other side  
 
 
5.2.2  Packaging and  Labeling 
 
Dasatinib is supplied as 5 mg, 20 mg, and 50 mg film -coated tablets containing dasatinib 
with lactose monohydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, and magnesium stearate. The tablet coating contains hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide, and polyethylene glycol (triacetin in the 5 mg film- coated  tablet). Tablets for clinical studies are supplied in high- density 
polyethylene bottles containing a desiccant and cotton. The bottles are heat -induction 
sealed with child resistant caps.  
 
Each bottle is labeled in an open label manner. Labels contain, at  a minimum, the  
30 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   following information: product name, tablet strength, batch number, directions for use, 
storage conditions, and appropriate caution statements. 
 
5.2.3  Storage, Handling, and Dispensing  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Storage  
 
Bottles containing dasatinib tablets should be stored at 15° -  25°C.  
 
All investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that it is dispensed only to study subjects and only from official study sites by [CONTACT_4144], as dictated by [CONTACT_427]. 
 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the investigational product is stored under the appropriate environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity.  
 
If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the investigational product arise, do not dispense the investigational product, and contact [CONTACT_20445].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Handling and Dispensing  
 
Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered.  
 
Dasatinib  tablets consist of a core tablet (containing the active drug substance), 
surrounded by a film coating to prevent exposure of pharmacy and clinical personnel to the active drug substance. If tablets are crushed or broken, pharmacy and clinical personnel should wear disposable chemotherapy gloves. Personnel who are pregnant should avoid exposure to crushed and/or broken tablets. 
 
The Investigator (or assigned designee, i.e., study pharmacist) will dispense the proper number of each strength tablet to the subject to satisfy dosing requirements for the study. The containers provided to the subject should be labeled with proper instructions for use. The lot numbers, dosing start dates and the number of tablets for each dosage strength must be recorded on the drug accountability pages of record for the site. The subject must be instructed to return all unused dasatinib in the provided packaging at each subsequent visit.  
 
5.3 Drug Ordering and Accountability  
5.3.1  Initial Orders  
 
Initial Orders of dasatinib should be requested by [CONTACT_384002] (Sprycel®) 
Drug Supply Form for Investigator Sponsored Studies and submitting the request form electronically via e- mail at least [ADDRESS_1135546].  
31 
V6.0; 07/26/2018    
5.3.2  Re-Supply  
 
Re-supply requests should be sent to [EMAIL_7409] . 
 
Please check “Re- supply” on the  drug supply form. Re -supply requests should be 
submitted at least 5 -7 business days before the expected delivery date. Deliveries will be 
made Tuesday through Friday.  
 
5.3.3  Drug Accountability  
 
Please refer to Section 9.2 for drug accountability requirements.  
 
5.3.4  IND Status  
 
The use of Dasatinib in this trial is classified as “off -label” or approved use of FDA - 
approved drugs. When a drug or combination of drugs used in an off -label manner as part 
of a clinical trial, it is, by [CONTACT_819696], considered as an investigation al treatment regimen.  
However, while these treatment regimens are not approved by [CONTACT_1622], their use is 
exempt from the requirements for an IND to conduct this study as defined under Title 21 CFR 312.2(b) of the codified FDA regulations.  
 
5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to a  Treatment  
This is a single arm phase II study where all subjects receive the same treatment.  
 
5.5 Dose  Modifications  
All toxicities should be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0.  
 
Dose modifications are based on dose level administered on the last treatment day. Dose adjustments of each agent may be made independently based on the specific types of toxicities observed. If oxaliplatin is discontinued due to toxicity dasatinib, 5- FU a nd LV 
may be continued. If dasatinib is discontinued due to toxicity oxaliplatin, 5- FU and LV 
may be continued. If more than two dose reductions are required for 5- FU/LV, the 
patient must discontinue protocol therapy. In general, a dose reduction of 5 -FU is always 
associated with an equal dose reduction of LV, except in the setting of a LV -specific AE. 
Levoleucovorin can be substituted for LV, with the appropriate pharmacologic  equivalent 
dose (ie, 50%), at the discretion of the treating physician. If treat ment is held for greater 
than 2 cycles (28 days) the patient must discontinue protocol therapy, unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_45822].  
 
If criteria for treatment discontinuation is met, but the treating oncologist feels that it is in the best interest of the patient to receive additional therapy (for example, if the patient has  
32 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   demonstrated a response to therapy), additional therapy may only be given after 
discussion with the Principal Investigator [CONTACT_43638] a resolution of t he toxicity to Grade 1 
or to baseline level.  
 
If a dasatinib dose is not taken due to an error, it may be taken up to 12 hours later. If 
vomiting occurs, the dose should not be replaced.  
 
If a dose level had been reduced due to toxicity, re -escalation is n ot permitted.

Hypersensitivity reaction  In the event of an acute oxaliplatin hypersensitivity reaction, the treating 
physician may attempt to administer subsequent oxaliplatin doses with steroid 
and antihistamine pre -medication, and lengthening of the oxaliplatin infusion 
time to 4 -6 hours. Partial dose reduction in oxaliplatin is not undertaken for 
hypersensitivity reaction. In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction that the 
treating ph ysician believes warrants discontinuation of oxaliplatin, the other  
agents should be continued without dose modification  
 
 
Pulmonary fibrosis  Signs and symptoms associated with PF (cough, dyspnea, rales, hypoxia, 
tachypnea) should be investigated to rule out PF as their cause. If suspected, 
hold oxaliplatin until PF is ruled out or an alternate diagnosis is confirmed.  
Oxaliplatin may then be resumed at previous dose. If PF is confirmed, 
discontinue oxaliplatin.

5.6 Blinding/Unblinding  
Not applicable to this protocol. 
 
5.7 Concomitant Treatments  
5.7.1  Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments  
 
No other systemic therapy for treatment of pancreatic cancer is permitted while subject is  
on study. Concomitant palliative radiotherapy is not permitted for disease progression on 
treatment, but may be allowed for pre -existing non- target lesions with approval of BMS  
36 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   Medical Monitor. Bisphosphonate treatment may not be initiated during study; if already 
begun, it may be continued at Investigator discretion (see Sections 4.2.1).  
 
Subjects requiring any prohibited therapy should not be enrolled. If enrolled, the 
prohibited agent(s) will be withdrawn prior to first dose of study drug . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potent CYP3A4  Inhibitors  
 
Dasatinib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 enzyme. In drug -drug interaction 
studies, concomitant use of ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) produced an 
increase of > 5 -fold in dasatinib exposure. Therefore, potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 are 
prohibited during study; for such medications, a wash- out period of ≥  7 days is required 
prior to starting dasatinib. Subjects should be advised not to consume substantial quantities of grapefruit or pomegranate juice. (Less -potent  inhibitors, inducers and 
substrates of CYP3A4 are restricted, see Section [IP_ADDRESS].) Most commonly -used potent 
CYP3A4 inhibitors are:  
• itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, voriconazole;  
• amprenavir, atazanavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritona vir; 
• ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, diclofenac, doxycycline, enoxacin, imatinib, 
isoniazid, ketamine, nefazodone, nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], propofol, quinidine, telithromycin.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medications that prolong QT Interval  
 
Subjects enrolled in this study may not take concomitant medications known to prolong 
the QT interval (Class I; see http://www.qtdrugs.org/medical- pros/drug- lists/drug - 
lists.htm). For  such medications, a wash -out period of ≥  7 days is required prior to 
starting dasatinib. Agents which possibly prolong the QT interval are restricted; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Medications known to prolong the QT interval are:  
• quinidine, procainamide, disopyra mide, amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide; 
• erythromycins,  clarithromycin;  
• chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924];  
• cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, 
halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, lidoflazine.  
5.7.2  Other Restrictions and  Precautions  
 
The following restricted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_97091], but are permitted with caution when clearly medically indicated.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CYP3A4 Inducers, Inhibitors, Substrates  
 
Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations. In subjects in whom enzyme -inducing anticonvulsants (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
phenobarbital) are used, alternative agents with lesser enzyme -induction potential should 
be considered.  
 
Dasatinib is predominantly metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A4 isoenzyme. Potent inhibitors are prohibited, but less -potent inhibitors may also increase exposure to dasatinib. If  
37 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135549] a narrow therapeutic  index such as alfentanil, 
astemizole, terfenadine, cisapride, cyclosporine, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, or ergot alkaloids (ergotamine, dihydroergotamine) should be administered with caution in subjects receiving dasatinib. Note:  subjects treated with a fentanyl patch 
are eligible for this trial.  
 
As warfarin is metabolized through the CYP450 system, therapeutic anticoagulation with 
warfarin (eg, Coumadin or Cournadine) is not recommended. As an alternative, 
therapeutic anticoag ulation may be accomplished using low -molecular weight heparin 
(eg, Lovenox) or heparin. Mini Dose Coumadin (eg, 1 mg QD) is permitted for 
prophylaxis of central venous catheter thrombosis. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medications that may Prolong QT Interval  
 
Concomitant medicatio ns known to prolong the QT interval are prohibited  
(Section 5.7.1); medications which may possibly prolong the QT interval (non- Class I; 
see http://www.qtdrugs.org/medical- pros/drug- lists/drug -lists.htm)  are restricted. Should 
the Investigator believe that beginning therapy with a potentially QT -prolonging 
medication (other than those prohibited) is vital to an individual subject’s care, the 
Investigator must check that the pr ior on- therapy ECG does not show QTc ≥  475 msec or 
an increase in QTc ≥  60 msec over the baseline value.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Antacids  
 
Nonclinical data demonstrate that the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent and a 
clinical study has shown that dasatinib exposure is subs tantially and durably reduced  after 
treatment with famotidine. Administration of dasatinib with H2 inhibitors or proton pump inhibitors should therefore be avoided. If antacid therapy is needed, a locally -acting 
antacid may be used, and should be administe red at least 2 hours before or after the dose 
of dasatinib.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  St. John's Wort (Hypericum  perforatum)  
 
Data suggests that St. John’s Wort may decrease dasatinib plasma concentrations unpredictably. Subjects receiving dasatinib should not take St. John's Wort. Subjects should discontinue St. John’s Wort at least 5 days before starting dasatinib. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medications that Inhibit Platelet Function and Anticoagulants  
 
Src-family kinase inhibition potentially reduces platelet aggregation. Caution should thus 
be exercised if subjects are required to take medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants. Such medications include:  
38 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   • aspi[INVESTIGATOR_8427]- containing combinations, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], dipyridamole  
• tirofiban, dipyridamole, epoprostenol, eptifibatide, cilostazol,  abciximab, 
ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325],  cilostazol  
• warfarin, heparin/low molecular weight heparin [eg, danaparoid, dalteparin, 
tinzaparin, enoxaparin]  
• exceptions are low -dose warfarin for prophylaxis to prevent catheter thrombosis 
and heparin for flushe s of intravenous  lines.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bisphosphonates  
 
Subjects who had been receiving bisphosphonates prior to study entry may continue on 
therapy with caution. Bisphosphonates should be temporarily discontinued during the first 8 weeks of protocol therapy however they may be resumed after that time at the discretion of the treating physician. Please refer to section 4.2.1 for protocol required treatment modifications. Although concomitant use of bisphosphonates is not recommended, clinically -significant hypocalcemia has been uncommon. Oral serum  
calcium (Ca
+2) supplementation, including Vitamin D if appropriate, is warranted.  
 
5.7.3  Additional Supportive Care Guidance for  Dasatinib  
 
Supportive care, especially pain control, will be optimized in all subjects. Guidance is provided for management of common side effects of dasatinib in order to maximize opportunity for benefit. Investigators are strongly urged to discuss with Medical Monitor and/or the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_819680]. 
 
Non-hematologic side effects are typi[INVESTIGATOR_97092] v4.0 Grade 1 - 2. Interruption and/or 
dose reduction may be necessary, especially if Grade ≥  2. Usual supportive care measures 
should be used for nausea/emesis, diarrhea, pain, fever or headache. Neither clinically significant myelosuppression nor use of hematopoietic growth factors is expected.  
 
Osteoclast inhibition is expected; therefore, calcium supplementation (eg, calcium 
carbonate 500 mg PO TID) may be warranted to maintain serum Ca
+[ADDRESS_1135550] during 
dasatinib treatment. Vitamin D supplementation (eg, ergocalciferol 400 IU PO QD) may 
be appropriate for persistent hypocalcemia. Bisphosphona te therapy should be deferred in 
the presence of hypocalcemia.  
 
Fluid retention, including clinically -significant pleural effusion, has been observed during 
dasatinib treatment. Refer to Section 5.1.4 for treatment recommendations.  
 
5.8 Treatment  Complianc e 
Patients will be required to return all bottles of study medication at the beginning of each 
cycle. The number of tablets remaining should be documented and recorded on the Case Report Form
. In addition, each patient will complete a dasatinib pi[INVESTIGATOR_819681] (see Appendix II). When possible, drug reconciliation will take place in the presence of the patient in order to account for  
39 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   possible discrepancies. Deviations from prescribed therapy will be recorded. Deviations 
greater than 10% from the expected dose (accounting for delays and dose modifications per protocol) will be considered deviations for IRB reporting purposes.

a. All screening procedures should be completed within 28 days of treatment except for serum pregnancy testing 
which should be completed within 7 days of treatment. History & Physical, Vital Signs, ECOG PS, CMP, CBC w 
Diff and CA19-9 are not required to be repeated at treatment initiation if they were completed within 7 days prior 
to Cycle 1 Day  1. 
b. Vital signs include height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, temperature and pain level (subjective 1 -10 self -reported 
scale). Height should be obtained at screening  only.  
c. ECGs will be obtained at screening as well as prior to cycle #3 (day 28; +/ - 7 days). Patients who are placed on QT 
prolonging medications while on study should have ECGs performed at regular intervals ( interval timing is at the 
discretion of the treating  investigator).  
d. Only enough dasatinib for 2 cycles of therapy (28 days) may be given to a patient prior to reassessment.  
e. Laboratory testing may be performed up to 72 hours prior to day 1 of the next cycle  of therapy.  
f. CMP:  Na, K, Cl, CO 2, Glucose,  BUN,  Creatinine,  Ca, Albumin,  Total  Bilirubin,  Alk Phos,  Total  Protein,  AST, 
ALT.  
g. PT/INR should be followed closely for patients on warfarin.  
h. CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis or CT of the chest and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis are allowed. 
Consistent imaging modality should be used throughout the study. Imaging should be performed every 8 weeks 
(+/- 7 days) until disease  progression.  
i. FACT -Hep should be completed at screening, every fourth cycle starting at cycle 5, and at EOT. CTSQ should be 
completed at C2, every fourth cycle starting at cycle 5, and at  EOT.  
j. Baseline blood sample will be collected prior to first dose of therapy administered. Additional blood samples will 
be collected at completion of cycle 1 infusional 5- FU (day 3; cycle 1 only), day 1 of every cycle starting with  cycle 
2, and at EOT. Reasonable efforts to obtain the C1D3 sample will be made however collection is optional. Red, green top and cell prep tubes will be collected at all time poin ts. EDTA tubes will be collected once, preferably at 
screening.  
k. H&P is required at 30 days (+ 7 days) following the last dose of study drug. Additional H&Ps are required as 
needed to follow ongoing  AEs.  
l. Adverse events should be followed for [ADDRESS_1135551] dose of protocol therapy or until the initiation of 
subsequent treatment. AEs continuing > 30 days should be monitored until  resolution.  
m. Patients or providers should be contact[CONTACT_457] 8 weeks to assess survival status and subsequent  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
41 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   6.2 Study  Materials  
Bristol- Myers Squibb (BMS) will provide dasatinib at no cost for this study. Oxaliplatin, 
5-fluorouracil and leucovorin will be obtained from commercial supply and will be billed 
to the patient or patient’s insurance.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1135552] undergo a history and physical examination by a licensed provider at the 
beginning of each treatment cycle. Vital signs and AE assessments should be done concurrently with the H&P. 
 
Laboratory testing should be completed as outli ned in the study schedule and procedures 
table as outlined above. Additional laboratory testing may be done at the Investigator’s discretion. 
 
An ECG is required pre -treatment (baseline) and prior to cycle 3 (day 28). Additional 
ECGs may be done at the Inv estigator’s discretion to ensure the subject’s safety.  
Concomitant medications should be monitored by [CONTACT_737]. In the event the subject undergoes an on- study drug treatment modification with a potentially QT 
prolonging medication, ECGs should occur at regular intervals throughout treatment.  
 
 
6.[ADDRESS_1135553] 1.159 criteria.  
Tumor measurement  
• Measurable disease: the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable 
disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by  
[CONTACT_3973]/histology.  
• Measurable lesions: lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (the longest diameter), and with a minimum size of [ADDRESS_1135554]  X-ray. 
− A malignant lymph node may be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurable if it is ≥  [ADDRESS_1135555]  scan.  
− A lytic or mixed blastic -lytic bone lesion, with identifiable soft tissue 
component which is evaluable by [CONTACT_462], may be considered as measurable 
lesion if the soft tissue component meets the criteria for measurable  lesions.  
− Cystic metastases may be considered as measurable lesions if they meet the 
criteria for measurable lesions, however, non- cystic lesions, if present, are 
preferred as target lesions.  
42 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   − Tumor lesions in an area previously subjected to loco- regional treatment, may 
be considered measurable if there has been demonstrated  progression.  
• Non-measurable lesions: all other lesions, including simple cysts, small lesions 
(longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥  10 to < 15 mm short 
axis) and other truly non- measurable lesions. These include: leptomeningeal 
diseas e; ascites; pleural/pericardial effusion; inflammatory breast disease; 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis; abdominal masses that are not measurable by 
[CONTACT_128694]; blastic bone  lesions. 
 
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to c haracterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. 
 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes), and ≥  [ADDRESS_1135556] 
slice thickness is ≤  5 mm.  
 
Baseline documentation of target and non -target lesions  
• When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a 
maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longer diameter) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_819697]).  
• A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) 
for all t arget lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. 
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the  disease.  
• All other lesions (or sites  of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’ ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’. Multiple non- target lesions 
involving the same organ may be recorded as a single  item.  
 
Response criteria  
43 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   Evaluation of target lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes must ha ve reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. 
• Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progression (PD): at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of the target 
lesions taking as reference the smallest sum on study, and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.  
• Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor suffi cient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum diameters while on the study.  
Evaluation of non- target lesions  
• Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes m ust be non- pathological (< 10 mm short  
axis).  
• Non-complete response (non- CR)/non- progression (non- PD): persistence of one or 
more non- target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal  limits.  
• Progressive disease (PD): unequivocal a ppearance of one or more new malignant 
lesions. Unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions. Although a clear 
progression of non -target lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_819682] a review panel (or study chair/primary  investigator).  
Evaluation of best overall response  
• The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). In general, the patient’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.  
• Table 6.4.[ADDRESS_1135557] non-measurable (therefore non -target) disease only, Table 6.4.2 should be used.

a ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is increasingly used as 
endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be 
measured is not  advised.  
 
 
• When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decrease 
to ‘normal’ size (<10 mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans. This measurement should be recorde d even though the nodes are normal in order 
not to overstate progression should it be based on increase in size of the  nodes. 
• Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease  progression at that time should be 
reported as “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to  document the objective progression even after discontinuation of  treatment.  
• In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual dise ase from 
normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status. FDG -PET 
may be used t o upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in  cases 
where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  
• For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; 
cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next  
scheduled  assessment.  If at the next scheduled  assessment,  progression  is 
45 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   confirmed, the date of progression should be the earlier date when progression was 
suspected.  
Confirmation  
• In non- randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of 
PR or CR must be confirmed by [CONTACT_819698] [ADDRESS_1135558]  met. 
• In randomized trial s or studies where the primary endpoints are stable disease or 
progression, confirmation of response is not required. Elimination of the 
requirement for response confirmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against bias, particular ly in studies which are not  blinded. 
• In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least 
once after study entry at a minimum interval of 6 -8 weeks.  
 
6.4.2  Primary Efficacy  Assessment  
 
Determine activity of 5 -fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) plus 
dasatinib on progression free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1135559] 1.1 criteria, the rate of freedom from me tastasis (FFM), the time to progression (TTP), the overall survival (OS), the 
clinical benefit rate (CBR), the site of failure of this regimen in this population, the safety profile and tolerability of this regimen in this population, the patient complianc e with oral 
therapy, and the quality of life (QOL) of patients receiving this therapy. All radiographic images and responses will be reviewed and confirmed by a 3
rd party investigator - 
independent radiographic review.  
 
Quality of life and Satisfaction measurements will be collected and recorded by  [CONTACT_1962] 
(see Appendix III) with subsequent analysis performed on all patients. Specifically, the 
Cancer Quality Satisfaction Survey (CTSQ, 2007)[ADDRESS_1135560] -Hep (Functional  
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy; Hepatobiliary Cancer -  Version 4.0) [ADDRESS_1135561] blood products for the following purposes: 1) serially collected blood specimens to measure alterations in circulating factors during therapy, identify potential non - 
invasive biomarkers of Src  inhibition, and to assess correlations with outcome; and 2)  
46 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   DNA to identify relevant pharmacogenetic markers. Biospecimens will be banked and 
stored until funding can be secured from the industry sponsor of the trial and/or other sources. Approximately 40mL of whole blood will be collected and processed for future use at study enrollment as well as periodically throughout the period of active study participation. An additional 20mL of whole blood will be collected at one time point during the  study, preferably screening, for genomic analysis (see Table 6.1).  
 
Extracted mononuclear cells will be analyzed with regard to thymidylate synthase (TS) 
expression and correlated with tissue/tumor expression. Src levels and downstream 
targets in mononucl ear cells will also be analyzed to document inhibition during 
treatment. Blood will be analyzed for specific pathway molecules see below, evidence of tumor injury, and predictive factors which may correlate to therapeutic outcomes or target selection, including plasma deoxyuridine levels as an indirect measure of TS inhibition. Additional molecular or chemical analyses may also be undertaken either during the study progress or in a post -hoc fashion, including assessment of circulating 
tumor  cells.  
 
Previous ly obtained and stored individual patient tumor samples will be requested and 
retrieved. Specifically, formalin fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue will be sought. 
No additional biopsies are required as part of this protocol, however, if biopsies are obtained for clinical reasons, submission of this tissue block for analysis is included in 
the standard protocol consent document and is required. Subsequent molecular or genomic analyses may also be undertaken either during the study progress or in a post - 
hoc fashion (see below).  
 
All collected tissue will undergo immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of expression and when relevant, phosphorylation status for  c -Src , thymidylate synthase (TS), 
ribonuclease reductase (RNR), dihidrofolate reductase (DHFR), integrins, EGFR, AKT, 
STAT, M ET, FAK, HIF, and TRAIL pathway molecules. Additional molecules may also 
be examined either during the study progress or in a post -hoc fashion pending novel 
discoveries. When adequate sample is available, mutational analysis of k-ras and b- raf 
will be perf ormed. While beyond feasible scope at this time, high quality microRNA 
should be extractable from these specimens, and microarray expression patterns with confirmatory PCR of relevant MiRNAs of interest may be analyzed in the  future. 
 
Collection, handling and storage of whole blood specimens:  
1. Fill serum separator tubes (red top, approximately 20mL total), 
plasma separator tubes (sodium heparin green top, 10mL  total), 
cell prep tubes (sodium heparin green/red top, 16mL total), and EDTA tubes (purple top, 20mL total)  completely  
2. Do not spin or manipulate the green top or cell prep tubes other than ensuring good distribution in the  tube 
3. Transfer green top and cell prep tubes to lab immediately  for 
further processing  
4. Red top and EDTA tubes will be processed an d stored per  CTSI 
guidelines

V6.0; 07/26/2018   7 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
7.1 Adverse  Events  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation  subject 
administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. 
 
7.1.1  Serious Adverse Events  
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
• results in  death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death  at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_819683] (see note below for  exceptions)  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be 
immediatel y life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based on 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention (eg, medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. Ex amples of such events include but are not limited to 
intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
All pregnancies, regardless of outcome, must be reported to BMS, including 
pregnancies that occur in the female partner of a male study subject. All 
pregnancies must be followed to outcome. See Section 7.6 for instructions on reporting 
pregnancies.  
 
Although overdose and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these events should also be reported to BMS in an expedited manner, as described in Section 7.2. 
 
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l department lasting less than 
24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an “important 
medical event” or a life -threatening  event)  
• elective surgery planned before signing  consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of  health  
48 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   status (eg, routine colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state  that 
was planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these 
cases.  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on 
health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of  housing, 
economic inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], f amily circumstances,  administrative).  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1135562]  
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  
(NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0. 
 
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to investigational product  
as determined by a physician should be used:  
• Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational  product 
administration and the adverse  event.  
• Not Related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship to  investigational 
product administration and the adverse  event.  
 
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there are facts (eg, evidence such as de- challenge/re- challenge) or other arguments to suggest a 
positive causal relationship.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1135563]. To prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.  
 
If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than its individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and treatment required. If treatment for the event was administered, it should be recorded in the medical record. The investigator must supply BMS and the IRB/IEC with any additional information requested, notably for  reported deaths of subjects. 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_1135564]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs must be collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures.  
49 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135565] be collected that relate to any later 
protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy). The investigator should notify 
BMS of any SAE occurring after this time period that is believed to be related to the investigational product or protocol -specified procedure.  
 
All SAEs, whether considered related or unrelated to dasatinib, must be reported to BMS 
(by [CONTACT_819699]) within [ADDRESS_1135566] be kept on file at the study site.  
 
All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34237] -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: 609- 818-3804 
Email: [EMAIL_178]  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND , any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as soon as 
possible and no later than 7 days (for a death or life -threatening event) or 15 days (for 
all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or inst itution’s initial receipt of the 
information. BMS will be provided with a simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be 
accessed at: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/. 
 
MedWatch SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at: 
MEDWATCH  
[ADDRESS_1135567]  
Rockville, MD [ZIP_CODE]- 9787 
Fax: 1 -800-FDA -0178 (1- [PHONE_189])  
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/  
 
All SAEs should simultaneously be faxed or e -mailed to BMS at: 
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epi[INVESTIGATOR_34237] -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number : 609- 818-3804 
Email: [EMAIL_178]  
 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the investigational product but is potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as wit hdrawal of previous therapy, 
or a complication of a study procedure), the potential relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE report.  
 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the investigational product, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to BMS. As follow -up information 
becomes available it should be sent within 24 hours using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
50 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   7.3.2  Handling of Expedited Safety  Reports  
 
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all SAEs that are 
suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously described in the Investigator Brochure). In the European Union, an event meeting these 
criteria is termed a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). BMS will send investigators an expedited safety report (ESR) to notify them of such an event.  
 
Other important  findings that BMS may report as ESRs include increased frequency of a 
clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered associated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard to stu dy subjects, clinically significant safety findings from a nonclinical (eg, animal) 
study, important safety recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or the decision by [CONTACT_296900] a clinical study for safety reasons. 
 
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR with the Investigator Brochure. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central IRB/IEC for the study, BMS will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The invest igator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. When 
BMS has a written agreement with a local IRB/IEC, BMS will directly submit ESR(s).  
The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.  
 
In addition, BMS will report suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or unexpected) to the relevant health authorities in all concerned countries according to local regulations (either as expedited and/or in aggregate report s). 
7.3.3  Nonserious Adverse Events  
 
The investigator will begin collecting nonserious adverse event (NSAE) information once administration of the investigational product is initiated. This NSAE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo le ad-in period or other observational period 
intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects. 
 
All identified NSAEs must be recorded and described in the medical record. If an ongoing NSAE worsens in its intensity, or if its relationship to the inve stigational product 
changes, a new NSAE entry for the event should be completed. NSAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become  serious. 
Follow -up is also required for NSAEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
investigational product, or those that are present at the end of study participation. Subjects with NSAEs at study completion should receive post -treatment follow -up as 
appropriate.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1135568] result that constitutes an adverse event, the 
51 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   clinical term should be used; for example, the event should be reported as “anemia” not 
“low hemoglobin.” Test results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported as such.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1135569] use an effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in such a manner that the risk of failure is minimized. (See Section 4.2.1 for the definition of WOCBP.) Before enrolling WOCBP in this study, investigators must review the BMS -provided information about study participation for WOCBP. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_819684]:

Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study participation and of the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  
 
7.6.[ADDRESS_1135570] be 25 IU/L or equivalent 
units of HCG. If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive dasatinib and 
must not continue in the study.  
 
In addition, all WOCBP m ust be instructed to contact [CONTACT_1755]/or other  
study personnel immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or  
late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
 
7.6.[ADDRESS_1135571]  will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for subject safety). The investigator must immediately notify BMS of this 
event and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form (not on an SAE  
52 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   form). Initial information on a pregnancy must be reported immediately to BMS, and 
information on the outcome provided once it is available. Completed Pregnancy Surveillance Forms must be forwarded to BMS according to SAE reporting procedure s. 
 
Note:  Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study subject  must be 
reported to BMS using the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
for the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. Information regarding 
the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome, must be reported to BMS on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1135572]’s condition noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety 
assessments, whether or not the se procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be 
recorded in the medical record.  
 
7.8 Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
This protocol will adhere to the policies of the University of [LOCATION_012] Shands Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, in accordan ce with NCI regulations. The Data 
and Safety Monitoring Committee will review all serious adverse events and toxicity reports as well as annual reviews. The investigator will continuously monitor the progress of the study and the safety of the participants . All adverse events will be 
evaluated for causality and reported to the appropriate oversight committees as required.  
 
7.9 Data Management  System  
To provide data collection we will utilize the ONCORE database for both accrual entry and trial data management. ONCORE is a Clinical Trials Management System designed with the capability for: study setup, activation, tracking, reporting, data monitoring and review and eligibility verification. It is housed on secured servers maintained at the University of [LOCATION_012] H ealth Science Center on the University of [LOCATION_012] campus. The e - 
CRFs on ONCORE are [ADDRESS_1135573] protected user accounts.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The primary statistical analysis will use the modified In tention -to-Treat (mITT) 
population consisting of patients who are enrolled and received any dose of study medication. The mITT population will be included in summary tables of patient demographics and disease characteristics, and in analysis of efficacy.  
 
Statistical analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_698275] v9.1 (SAS  
53 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   institute, Cary, NC).  
 
Routine data listing or tabulation review during the study conduct will be performed to 
identify missing data, anomalies, outliers,  etc. Missing data will generally not be 
imputed. Baseline is defined as the last non- missing measurement for a variable prior to 
the initial dose of any investigational product.  
 
Descriptive statistics will be provided to summarize demographic and baselin e 
characteristic parameters. Categorical data will be summarized as frequency and its corresponding percentage. For continuous data, frequency (n), mean, standard deviation, median (as appropriate), minimum, and maximum will be provided for each parameter.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1135574] patient is enrolled. This sample size will allo w detection of median PFS of 6 
months or greater with a 50% increase in comparison to historical controls (4 months), with a one -sided log -rank test at the 0.05 significance level and a power of 80%. At an 
attrition rate of 5%, [ADDRESS_1135575] of either (1) documented disease progression or (2) death as a result of any cause. Patients who did not progress nor die or are lost to follow -up will be censore d at the day of their last objective tumor 
assessment. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the median PFS time, 
together with a 95% confidence interval (CI). PFS will be determined by [CONTACT_13407].  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1135576] overall response of partial or complete response (CR + PR), according to RECIST from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence. Clinical benefit rate is equal to the objective RR plus the proportion of patients attaining stable disease (CR + PR + SD). Patients who do not have a tumor response assessment for any reason will be considered nonresponders and will be included in the denominator when calculating the respons e 
rate. The number of patients achieving a response will be divided by [CONTACT_819700]. Exact confidence bounds (95% CI) will be calculated.  
 
Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of treatment start to the date of death from any cause. If the patient is alive at the end of the follow -up period or is lost to 
follow -up, OS will be censored on the last date the patient is known to be alive. OS will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method and a 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided for the 
median OS.  
54 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   The time to progression (TTP) for responders only is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the crit eria for PD are met, or death. TTP will be estimated with the Kaplan - 
Meier method; a 90% CI will be provided for the median TTP. Patients who do not relapse are censored at the day of their last objective tumor assessment. The freedom from metastasis rate  is defined below and will be calculated based on an intention to treat 
principle. Determination of the anatomic site of first failure for patients with PD will be recorded and analyzed. Duration of response is also defined below.  
 
Proportion and exact con fidence boundaries (95% CI) will be estimated for toxicity and 
compliance with oral therapy. Mean and 95% confidence interval will be estimated for quality of life (QOL). QOL measurements will be analyzed with regards to changes from baseline including tot al scores as well as subscores consistent with the previously 
validated instruments in use. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1135577] one occurrence of a preferred term (according to the most severe NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 grade) will be included. The number of AEs reported will also 
be summarized. Causality (relationship to study drug) will be summarized separately.  
Duration of AE will be determined and included in listings along with action taken and outcome. Laboratory AEs will be monitored from the time that treatment starts until [ADDRESS_1135578] dose of study therapy. Laboratory results will be classified according to NCI -CTCAE, Version 4.0. Incidence of laboratory abnormalities will be summarized; 
laboratory results not corresponding to an NCI -CTCAE Version 4.[ADDRESS_1135579] grade will also be  provided. 
The results from physical examination and vital sign measurement will be tabulated. Descriptive statistics will be provided as appropriate.  
 
8.5 Duration of Response and Other Endpoint  Definitions  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first d ate that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started), or death.  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented, or death.  
55 
V6.0; 07/26/[ADDRESS_1135580] measurements recorded since the treatment 
started.  
 
Rate of freedom from metastasis (FFM) is defined as the proportion of patients with 
documentation of progression of disease, during study participation, in whom no new 
lesions appeared.  
 
In rare situ ations where PD or other endpoints could not be clearly assessed, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_819685] a clinical judgment for purposes of endpoint documentation. 
 
[ADDRESS_1135581] be conducted as described in the final IRB/IEC -approved protocol. 
Documentation of approval, signed by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC chairperson or designee, will be sent to the BMS protocol manager.  
 
All protocol amendments and revisions to the informed consent wi ll be submitted to the 
BMS protocol manager and to the IRB/IEC. No protocol amendments will be implemented until written approval has been given by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. Administrative letter s 
should also be sent to the BMS protocol manager and IRB/IEC; however, they do not require approval.  
 
If a protocol amendment mandates a revision to the informed consent, the revised consent must be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the study if it affects them (eg, if it contains new information regarding safety), and the revised consent must be used to obtain consent from new subjects before enrollment.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1135582] all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation (eg, the medical record) for the maximum period required by [CONTACT_296903]. If the investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation or retirement), the records will be transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee, such as another investigator or an IRB. 
Written documentation of such transfer will be provided to BMS.  
 
The investigator will ensure that a current record of disposition of investigational product is maintained at each study site whe re the investigational product is inventoried and 
disposed. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and should include:  
• amount received and placed in storage area  
56 
V6.0; 07/26/2018   • amount currently in storage  area 
• label identific ation number or batch number and use date or expi[INVESTIGATOR_11313] 
• dates and initials of person responsible for each inventory  entry/movement  
• amount dispensed to and returned by [CONTACT_6992], including unique  subject 
identifiers  
• amount transferred to another area/si te for dispensing or  storage  
• non-study disposition (eg, lost, wasted, broken)  
• amount destroyed at study site, if applicable,  and 
• retain samples sent to third party for bioavailability/bioequivalence, if  applicable.  
 
Dasatinib dispensing record/inventory logs and copi[INVESTIGATOR_410300]. Batch numbers for dasatinib must be recorded in the drug accountability records.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1135583] is to be destroy ed on site, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for disposal, and that procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, guidelines, and institutional procedures. Approp riate records of the disposal must be 
maintained.

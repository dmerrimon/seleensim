THIS STUDY DOES NOT REQUIRE BAYLOR IRB APPROVAL.  
 
 
1) Funding Source  
The researchers' primary funding will come from Baylor St. Luke's Friends of Nursing 
Foundation. This foundation's aim is to support nurses in their professional practice 
development. They have no financial conflict of interest with the researchers or the researchers' 
institution.  
 
2) Objectives and Hypothesis(es)  
The project goal is to investigate the efficacy of proning  COVID -[ADDRESS_687978]. Luke’s in an acute care, telemetry -
monitored unit. The researchers will be using a systematic approach to educate 
patients and staff about patient self -proning, implementing self -proning every  2 
hours, and monitoring escalation of oxygen levels, as well as length of the study 
period.  
Objectives:  This study is intended to explore the effects of proning on non -
ventilated COVID -19 hypoxemic patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42868] a telemetry -monitored, 
acute ca re unit.   In addition, the hope is to delay intubation and/or escalation of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_264456], while contributing to the growing body of knowledge 
related to   COVID -19 treatment and care.  
Hypotheses: The researchers expect to see an improvement in oxygen 
saturation levels as evidenced by [CONTACT_529516][INVESTIGATOR_45507] (i.e. higher 
levels of oxygen needed, transfer to higher level of care),  resulting in shorter 
lengths of stay for the intervention population.   
 
3) Background/Scientific Rationale and Significance  
Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge.  
Colloquially, proning has been propagated to increase oxygen saturation in 
patients in respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]. Since the COVID -19 virus’s primary 
symptomatology is respi[INVESTIGATOR_529503], proning has re -emerged as a viable 
option, and research is ongoing in the intensive care unit (ICU) patient population 
about its effectiveness. However, there has been minimal research around 
proning methodology in the alert, oriented, and inde pendent patient who has 
been confirmed COVID -19 positive and has been admitted to a non -ICU setting. 
Therefore this study aims to address this lack of evidence.  
Describe any relevant preliminary data.  
Kallet (2015) summarized the physiological mechanism th at prone position 
improves oxygenation in moderate to severe ARDS patients. First, a prone 
position can make the dorsal region more elevated, which leads to evenly 
distributed tidal volume in the lung. Second, a prone position decreases the 
pressure that t he lung receives from the heart and abdomen, which can increase 
resting lung volume in dorsocaudal regions. Third, when patients are in a prone 
position, the pressure from mass tissue in the dorsal wall can make pleural 
pressure more evenly distributed in the lung.  
A meta -analysis with randomized controlled trials indicated that prone positioning 
became a life -saving intervention for mechanically ventilated ICU patients with 
moderate to severe ARDS when it is applied for at least 12 hours daily (Munshi 
et al., 2017). Ding et al. (2020) evaluated the outcome of intubation in ARDS 
patients whose average prone positioning (PP) was 2 hours. These patients 
received   oxygen with high -flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and non -invasive 
ventilation (NIV), or only non -invasiv e ventilation. Ding et al. (2020) concluded 
that the prone position helped ICU ARDS patients avoid intubation when 
combined with other non – invasive oxygenation intervention in the early stage of 
ARDS. The results of a randomized controlled trial indicate d that the outcome of 
early application of prone position in ICU ARDS patients demonstrated a 
significantly decreased 28 -day and 90 -days mortality (Guerin et al., 2013). The 
study included [ADDRESS_687979], the patients in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_529504].  The study found a   28-day mortality; 16% in prone group vs. 
32.8% in supi[INVESTIGATOR_179415] (P, 0.001); hazard ratio for death was 0.39 in prone group 
vs. 0.44 in supi[INVESTIGATOR_179415] (P, 0.001), and unadjusted 90 -day mortality was 23.6% 
in prone group vs. 41.0% in su pi[INVESTIGATOR_179415] (P, 0.001) (Guerin et al., 2013). Based 
on the above evidence - prone positioning has been recommended by [CONTACT_103210] (WHO) as one of the better interventions for mechanically 
ventilated patients with moderate -severe ARDS withi n ICU (World Health 
Organization, 2020). Cardona et al. (2021) in a meta -analysis of observational 
studies found ICU patients with COVID -19 with non -invasive oxygen 
interventions and awake prone positioning, the intubation rate was 28% and 
mortality rate w as 14%.  
Weatherald et al. (2021) reported that prone positioning promised an 
improvement in oxygenation while patients were in the prone position. The 
review included 35 studies with 414 patients from various clinical settings. 
Twenty -nine of these studie s report on the use of awake prone positioning in 
COVID -19 patients. Among 35 studies, only one study included data from the 
control group. All studies demonstrated improvement in oxygenation while 
patients were in the prone position except one.   
Another s tudy of 50 patients in an ED setting reported that using an awake prone 
position in managing COVID 19 pneumonia showed some benefits in improving 
acute hypoxemia (Caputo et al., 2020). McNicholas et al. (2020) 
emphasized   that to date there is still a lack  of randomized control trials that 
support the benefit of awake prone position on COVID -19 pneumonia patients 
with hypoxia. Furthermore, there was no study that revealed whether or not non -
ventilated prone positions change mortality rate in patients with C OVID -19 
ARDS.   
Proning has been attempted before in the healthcare setting. An emergency 
department (ED) in [LOCATION_001] asked [ADDRESS_687980] 10% in oxygen saturation across the 
sample, although 13 of those patients later had to be intubated within 24 hours of 
arriving at this ED (Caputo et al., 2020). Another study, conducted in non -ICU 
units in Italy, surveyed 50 pat ients confirmed with COVID -19, reported increased 
PaO2 levels from proning for 10 minutes, and those levels were able to be 
sustained after proning in approximately half the patients (Coppa, et.al., 2020).  
Nursing clinicians Holland (2020) and McKenna et a l. (2018) discussed the 
important role of nurse clinicians utilizing prone position therapy to promote 
positive patient outcomes. These authors describe clinician roles as initiating 
multidisciplinary discussions, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_529505], educatin g on the 
technique of prone position, supporting patients who undergo prone positioning, 
and evaluating outcomes. Our nurse researchers aim to add to the body of 
evidence surrounding positive outcomes of proning in the acute care setting of 
non-intubated C OVID -19 patients.  
4) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
 
The inclusion criteria for this research study are patients that have been confirmed COVID -19 
positive on an acute -care, telemetry -monitored, non -ICU unit and are considered  hypoxemic. 
Hypoxemic is defined as experiencing rising oxygen requirements as evidenced by [CONTACT_529517] (i.e. starting at 1 -2 L nasal cannula and increasing oxygen need 
from that level, up to 6 L on nasal cannula.) The patient must also be conscious and oriented, as 
well as able to change positions independently (meaning that it would not take an increased 
amount of energy or effort to position independently. Subjects will be patients 18 years and older. 
If the patient is unable  to speak, read, or write English, an alternative consent in their language 
will be utilized.  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
 
The exclusion criteria included those that are not COVID 19 positive. Those patients that are 
COVID -19 positive and in an ICU setting, or in need of ICU level respi[INVESTIGATOR_529506], as well as those with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (defined as immediate 
need for intubation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_306535] 35, PaCO2 level above 65, and accessory muscle use) 
or in hemodynam ic instability (systolic blood pressure below 90) or arrhythmia. The researchers 
would also exclude patients that have agitation or who have altered mental status, unstable 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/thoracic injury or recent abdominal surgery, significant pressure ulcers (abo ve stage 1), 
pregnant patients past the 2nd trimester, and patients that have concerning neurological issues 
(such as seizures). Patients that are unable to change positions independently will also be 
excluded.  
Describe how individuals will be screened fo r eligibility.   
This is a single -center prospective study which will be conducted over a period of 8 
months on a telemetry -monitored, acute care unit in a large tertiary teaching hospi[INVESTIGATOR_529507], [LOCATION_007].   Randomized sampling will be used  to recruit and consent 96 patients 
that meet the study inclusion criteria (48 in the intervention group and 48 in the control 
group). This study will seek approval from the Common Spi[INVESTIGATOR_529508], and all participants receiving th e intervention will be consented (see consent form 
attached).  
5) Number of Subjects  
The sample size will be 96 patients (48 patients in the intervention group and 48 
patients in the control group).  
6) Study Timelines  
1. June 2021 - obtain IRB approval  
2. End of June 20 21 - meet with manager/unit educator of covid positive unit to 
discuss unit education and data collection  
3. July 2021 - approximately January 2022 - Data Collection, enroll subjects as 
collection occurs  
4. February - March 2022 - Data analysis  
5. April 2022 - Finish analysis and write study  
 
7) Study Endpoints  
Primary endpoint of this study is a shorter length of stay for the intervention group. Secondary 
endpoints include decreased need for oxygen supplementation as evidenced by [CONTACT_529518], d ecreased need to be admitted to the intensive care unit, and decreased 
reports of pressure injuries (as identified by [CONTACT_529519]).  
8) Procedures Involved  
 
Study Design:   This will be a prospective randomized cohort study in which data will be collected 
for over 14 days or until discharged or transferred to a lower level of care from the telemetry -
monitored, acute care unit. Data collected on study participants will include the need for escalating 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_529509]. Comparative analysis will be 
conducted with retrospective data collected from  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] (the control group) with a 
diagnosis of COVID -[ADDRESS_687981] their discharge date.  
                  
On a confirmed COVID -19 non -ICU acute care, telemetry -monitored unit, there  will be two sets 
of patients: patients that will receive the intervention of proning plus standard of care, and patients 
that receive standard of care, but not the proning intervention. Confirmed COVID -19 positive 
patients are randomly assigned by [CONTACT_529520] a room upon admission to the unit. Patients will 
be randomized upon admission to the acute care, telemetry -monitored unit, and selected based 
on inclusion criteria. The patients that will be prone will be identified by a door slot "slider" that is 
purple. Timing devices will be purchased and placed at the nurses’ station, and checklists to 
indicate proning times will be placed inside the room with a patient identification sticker. The 
researchers will be following the proning protocol for acute care  patients provided by 
[CONTACT_529521][INVESTIGATOR_529510] (CSH).  
          
Patients will consent to participation (using an approved consent document from the CSH IRB), 
and an order for the proning protocol will be entered in the EMR by [CONTACT_099]. The patient will 
be educated about self -proning, and instructed to self -prone every 2 hours. The nursing staff will 
document patient position on the checklists every 2 hours.  
1. Upon initiation of the initial proning, the patient will be monitored by [CONTACT_529522] 15 minutes (such as inability to tolerate position or signs of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]).  
2.  If the patient tolerates the proning well, the procedure can continue and the RN 
will set the timer for 2 hours, enter the patient’s oxygen saturation into t he EMR, 
and document the position (prone or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) on the checklist. O2 saturation will be 
documented at least every 4 hours per unit protocol.  
3. The 2 hour timer will be reset each set of 2 hours by [CONTACT_60397], and the 
intervention will continue until the end of the study period or until the patient is 
discharged or transferred from that unit.  
4. The checklists will be placed in a binder at  the nurses’ station at the end of each 
shift and collected daily by a member of the research team.  
5. This intervention for each "proned" patient will continue until either of the 
following occur: either the patient is discharged or transferred to a lower  level of 
care from the acute care floor, or [ADDRESS_687982] of care treatment designated by [CONTACT_529523] r condition on 
the COVID -19, acute care, telemetry -monitored unit.  
Data Analysis:  Retrospective data analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_529524] (oxygen saturation, 
demo graphics, proning protocol) for both the interventional and control group. See attached 
documents for consent/proning protocol documents.  
  
This study will be a prospective cohort study in which data will be collected on subjects for the 
designated time p eriod. Data will be collected from the electronic medical record as well as the 
checklists.   Data collection will include basic patient demographics, specifically age and gender, 
height, weight and ethnicity.  Clinical data to be collected include O2 satu ration, respi[INVESTIGATOR_529511], proning duration/compliance, presence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_529512] , 
and need to escalate care to ICU, including initiation of mechanical ventilation.  The same data 
will be collected for the control group - except for proning duration/compliance as they wil l not 
receive this intervention.  
 
9) Data and Specimen Banking  
The data obtained from this study will be basic patient demographics, specifically age 
and gender, height, weight and ethnicity. T he patient medical  record number, name, and 
date of admission/discharge are included as PHI necessary to complete this study.  
Clinical data to be collected include O2 saturation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_529513], proning 
duration/compliance, presence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_529514] , and need to 
escalate care to ICU, including initiation of mechanical ventilation. The REDCap project 
IDs are 2817 and 3682 for reference.  
Upon consent to the study, the patient’s medical record number will be recorded as the 
principal identif ier, and the above demographic data will be collected from the electronic 
medical record. This information will be coded to a personal ID generated by [CONTACT_82456]’ REDCap software by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_529515]. The clini cal data obtained during and after the intervention will be recorded from 
the electronic medical record and also linked to the personal ID in the REDCap software.  
The list linking the medical record number to the personal ID will only be handled by 
[CONTACT_40193] s of the research team and will be destroyed electronically upon completion of 
data collection - approximately [ADDRESS_687983] their data removed, the patient would communicate that to the nurse assigned, 
who would then call the principal investigator (number provided to the unit). The 
investigator would then delete the profile fro m REDCap and remove the medical record 
number from the study records.  
Data collection will proceed as follows:  
1. Every calendar day after the patient has been consented and the intervention is 
occurring, the nurse assigned to the patient will chart O2 satu ration, any 
presence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_529512], and need to escalate care. This 
data will be recorded in the electronic medical record, and members of the 
research team will daily update the REDCap profile with that data.  
2. The nurse assigned to  the patient will also chart the position of the patient every 
2 hours via a paper document (also attached). These paper documents will be 
placed in a binder at the nurse’s station at the end of each shift and collected by 
[CONTACT_529525]. The rese arch team will document for each profile the 
patient’s compliance with proning.  
The risk of loss of confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_395244]: (1) Data 
collected from study participants will be maintained in locked file cabinets or in password 
protected CHI servers managed and maintained by [CONTACT_529526]. (2) 
Subject names and other identifiers will be removed from study data and will be replaced 
by [CONTACT_529527]. (3) The documents connecting the subjects to their  study 
numbers will be kept separately from subject data and in locked file cabinets, in 
password protected CHI servers managed and maintained by [CONTACT_529528]. (4) Study 
personnel will be the only individuals with filing cabinet keys and computer passwords. 
Study personnel will only access this data while at work.  
10) Data Analysis Plan  
 
Retrospective data analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_529529] (oxygen saturation, demographics, proning 
protocol) for both the interventional and control group. See attached documents for 
consent/proning protocol documents.  
 
This study will be a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome will be time (days) until 
discharge from the acute care u nit to home or lower level of care (e.g., long -term care), and the 
primary hypothesis test will compare time -to-discharge between "prone" and "not prone" 
treatment arms.  
A sample size of 48 patients per group (N=96) will provide 80% power to detect a 50% decline 
in time -to-discharge using a log -rank test.  
 
11) Withdrawal of Subjects  
The researchers do not anticipate circumstances in which the subjects will be withdrawn from 
the research study without their consent. Patients who otherwise withdraw from the stud y will be 
censored on the withdrawal day with the following process:  If the patient started the study and 
then wished to have their data removed, the patient would communicate that to the nurse 
assigned, who would then call the principal investigator (num ber provided to the unit). The 
investigator would then delete the profile from REDCap and remove the medical record number 
from the study records.  
 
12) Risks to Subjects  
The researchers foresee minimal risks in this study to the participant. Possible 
risks in clude:  
● Inability to maintain the prone position, possibly resulting in O2 
desaturation and other negative respi[INVESTIGATOR_229857], such as intubation  
● Skin breakdown  
● Patient discomfort in turning every 2 hours/patient inconvenience for 
documentation, especially  overnight  
 
13) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
 
The researchers foresee benefits to the patient for being involved in the study. 
These benefits should last for at least the length of the data collection on the 
patient. The benefits include:  
● Shorter time to di scharge or transfer to lower level of care (measured in 
days)  
● Decreased need for O2 supplementation; higher O2 saturations recorded  
 
14) Setting  
The research study will be conducted in St. Luke's Health - Baylor St. Luke's 
Medical Center - Houston, TX (addres s: [ADDRESS_687984], Houston, TX [ZIP_CODE]), 
in a telemetry -monitored, acute care unit for covid -positive patients. The 
researchers will consent randomly assigned patients from that unit, and the 
intervention will be contained to that unit.  
The study is being  propagated by [CONTACT_529530]’s Nursing Research and Education 
Council after having been approved by [CONTACT_529531], and is being submitted for 
review by [CONTACT_529532]. After approval, the study will be 
commenced.  
15) Resources Available  
 
The members of the research team are Marie Hodges, Nishant Varghese, Michael Guffey, 
Christi Knapp, Jenny Li, and [CONTACT_529537].  
All team members involved in the study are registered nurses (RNs) with bedside 
experience in an acute -care facility tha t provides high acuity patient care. The 
aforementioned team members have completed CITI training specific to conducting 
research via IRB approval and oversight under institutional guidelines, policies, and 
ethics. The members of this research team  will b e conducting this research for the 
continuation of evidence based practice amidst the COVID -[ADDRESS_687985] 
access to the unit’s patients at time of data collection per the unit manager and approval 
of the facility for the estimated time of data collection.  
The research study will t ake place on a COVID -19, acute care, telemetry -monitored unit.  
Each member of the research team is expected to devote time to this research study 
daily during the data collection period for approximately a half an hour each day. This 
will entail education  of the nursing staff affected and collection of both the electronic and 
paper records. That process is as follows:  
● At the beginning of each day, staff huddles occur on the unit at approximately 
6:45 AM. A member of the research team will be present at hud dle daily to 
educate the staff nurses on the proning intervention.  
● Once each intervention patient is confirmed via random assignment, the research 
team member assigned that day will meet with the nurse assigned to the 
intervention patient. The research te am member will obtain consent from the 
patient. That team member will assess if the nurse needs help monitoring the 
patient for the initial [ADDRESS_687986] as needed.  
● That team member will also educate the nurse assigned as to how often p roning 
occurs (every 2 hours), to document patient position on the checklist every two 
hours, the proning protocol, and where to put the checklist at the end of their 
shift. The team member will leave upon confirmation of correct implementation of 
the stud y. 
● The checklists from the intervention patients will end up in a binder at the end of 
the shift, and the binder will be emptied at that time by a member of the research 
team. These checklists’ data will be entered into the computer by [CONTACT_17881], k ept until the end of data collection period in a locked filing cabinet, and 
then destroyed at the end of the data collection period.  
The resources for the patient should there be more than minimal harm caused include 
the medical resources of our facility.   
16) Confidentiality  
 
There are 2 sets of data to be protected during this study: electronic and paper sets of 
data. The paper data will be only transported by [CONTACT_529533]. Thi s data will be destroyed at the 
end of the data collection period - approximately [ADDRESS_687987] numbers will be 
destroyed at the end of the data analysis period - approximately 8 months. The 
REDCAP software is a web -based application used to capture da ta and create 
databases in an encrypted environment that is user -protected and HIPAA compliant.  
This electronic data will only be accessed by [CONTACT_529534], on CHI protected servers managed and maintained  by [CONTACT_529535].  
 
The researchers do not anticipate any necessary breaks in confidentiality for the 
duration of this study.  
 
The risk of loss of confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_395244]: (1) Data 
collected from study participants will be maintained in locked file cabinets, in password 
protected CHI servers managed and maintained by [CONTACT_529526]. (2) Subject 
names and other identifiers will be removed from study data and will be replaced by [CONTACT_529536]. (3) The documents connecting the subjects to their study numbers will be kept 
separately from subject data and in locked file cabinets, in password protected CHI servers 
managed and maintained by [CONTACT_529528]. (4) Study personnel will be the only individu als with filing 
cabinet keys and computer passwords. Study personnel will only access this data while at work.  
 
17) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subject  
During the informed consent process, the patient will be given the opportunity to 
ask que stions and disclose any discomfort with the study or study procedure, 
with both the research team member and the nurse assigned to the patient. The 
process of patient confidentiality within the study will be fully explained to the 
patient, as specified abo ve - the fact that the researchers will only have access to 
demographic information, and not personal identifiers outside of medical record 
numbers, and that the data will be encoded upon entry into the secure database. 
If the patient wishes to withdraw fr om the study at any time, that process will be 
explained.  
 
18) Consent Process  
Informed consent will be obtained at the bedside of the patient on the COVID -19 
acute care, telemetry -monitored covid positive unit who is assigned to the 
intervention by a member of the research team. This process will be as follows:  
● An order to self -prone and verify consent for proning will be entered into 
the computer by [CONTACT_106224].  
● The research team member will bring a paper copy of the consent to the 
patient (copy stored on th e unit, attached to this submission), and fully 
explain the consent.  
● The patient will be given the opportunity to ask questions and ask for 
further clarification.  
● At the end of the consent process, the patient will be asked to explain the 
intervention bac k to the member getting consent.  
This process should take in total about 15 minutes, and will be the same for every 
patient assigned for the intervention group. The patient will be allowed to decline the 
intervention.  
If the patient cannot speak, read, o r write English, an alternative consent will be provided 
in their language of choice, and consent will be obtained through the facility’s 
interpretation device.  
 
Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process  
For our patients assigned to the control group, a waiver of consent will be requested.  
 
19) Process to Document Consent in Writing  
 
The study should present no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects. 
Nevertheless, the researchers will be collecting a writ ten informed consent from 
the study participant, and storing those in a secure filing cabinet until the study 
analysis is complete (approximately 1 year). The consent document is attached 
to this submission.

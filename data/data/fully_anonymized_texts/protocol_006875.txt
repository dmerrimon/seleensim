Section C:  Background Information
     Neurogenic pain (NP) arises or is caused by [CONTACT_363598]. The types of NP  can be
derived from its origin including: 1) central, due to a lesion derived from the brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]; 2) neuropathic, due to
injury to a peripheral nerve, or 3) deaf ferentation, due to stemming from loss or interruption of sensory nerve fiber
transmissions. Each of these types may manifest with dif ferent pain characteristics in relation to frequency , duration,
intensity , and severity . The most common NP  are peripheral neuropathy or fibromyalgia. Standard of care treatment for
these conditions is pharmacologic-derived; however , other alternatives such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS) have demonstrated its ability to manage pain in patients with peripheral neuropathy (Najafi et al, JDST , 2017) and
fibromyalgia (Jamison et al, JPR, 2021).
In this matter , Neurometrix Inc. (W oburn, MA, [LOCATION_003]) has created a wireless TENS device (Quell®) to address pain and its
associated symptoms (fatigue, reduced gait, sleep). This technology is a portable wireless non-invasive device placed in
the lower-extremity that works through the stimulation of nerves that carry non-painful sensations (A-beta fibers) by [CONTACT_363599]
a neurological "gate" in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], thus, reducing transmission from pain nerves (A-delta and C fibers) to the brain.
This device utilizes a wireless technology manageable through a smart phone application (Quell App) that also tracks
symptom-status. Unlike other devices, it utilizes position and motion sensing to automatically adjust stimulation to the
patient both day and night. The device is practical by [CONTACT_363600] a smartphone/smartwatch apps that help
the patient personalize and control their treatment.
The Quell® device has been employed for treatment of various NP  etiologies such as fibromyalgia, chemotherapy induced
peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), chronic back pain, post-acute sequelae of Sars-Cov-2 (P ASC), neuromyelitis optica
spectrum disorder , restless leg syndrome, and painful diabetic neuropathy . Recently , Quell® has received FDA
breakthrough device designation for treatment of fibromyalgia and CIPN.
We purpose the use of Quell TENS device to explore its benefits in patients with NP  derived by [CONTACT_363601].
Study #1: One population that has shown vast symptoms related to NP  includes P ASC. This is an emerging entity that has
been clearly recognized by [CONTACT_363602], fatigue, cognitive, and sleep disturbances, among other symptoms, in
patients who have recovered from severe Sars-CoV -[ADDRESS_452949] reported a significant excess
1/18/24, 2:18 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=476700 4/13burden of many of these symptoms up to [ADDRESS_452950]-COVID-19 Clinic (McNair Campus, BCM St Luke's, Houston, TX, [LOCATION_003]) supervised by
[CONTACT_363603]. This Clinic has a high volume of patients that present with P ACS, particularly
those with associated fibromyalgia (i.e., persistent muscle pain, fatigue, weakness, atrophy , sleep problems, and/or
anxiety). Therefore, we believe our institution is a suitable place to perform this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] .
Study #2: Chemotherapy and other cancer treatments can cause damage to the peripheral nerves mainly reflected in
severe pain in the upper and/or lower extremities. Additional to pain, cancer treatment may cause loss of balance which
affects motor capacity and is a major cause of poor quality of life. There are only minimally ef fective treatments for CIPN
despi[INVESTIGATOR_140566] [ADDRESS_452951] limitation of access for
those who live in the remote areas (e.g., rural area), or could be too frail to travel after chemotherapy . This raised a
significant disparity for delivering an ef fective therapy for those who are living in remote areas or those who are too frail to
travel. Therefore, we believe the user-friendly design, and wireless practicality of Quell® is a suitable option for our CIPN
population at BCM.
Our institution's Duncan Cancer Center (McNair Campus, BCM St Luke's, Houston, TX, [LOCATION_003]) supervised by [CONTACT_363604] , has a high volume of patients that present with CIPN. Therefore, we believe our institution is
a suitable place to perform this sub-study . The premise of this sub-study is that daily basis of TENS therapy could be
effective to reduce pain, reduce numbness and improve both motor-capacity and mobility performance leading to improve
quality of life in those who suf fer from CIPN and have limited access to health care.
 
Section D:  Purpose and Objectives
     The purpose of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_363596] a wireless TENS
technology to address NP  due to dif ferent etiologies.Sample size (n=60) is convenient and designed to explore
acceptability and feasibility .
Study #1: P ASC associated FM. Eligible participants (N=30) will be screened at the BCM Post-COVID-19 Clinic for
inclusion criteria.
Study #2: Patients with CIPN (N=30). Eligibility will be screened at the Duncan Cancer Center at BCM.
Participants, who satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria and sign the informed consent form will be randomly assigned
with ratio of 1:1 into two groups. One group will utilize TENS functional devices (Active group, AG); the other group will
utilize TENS non-functional devices (Placebo group, PG). The baseline measurements will be performed, and the patients
will take the programmed device home for a duration of 4 weeks. Then, the patients will come back after four weeks (4W).
At this 4th week visit, both groups will be unblinded and the AG will keep their functional device and the PG group will
receive a functional device. Both groups will continue to deliver 3-5 hour of stimulation daily , until their final 8th week follow
up visit (8W). The primary outcomes will be pain symptoms, sleep and fatigue. Secondary outcomes include limb strength
and perfusion, gait assessment (gait speed, stride length, double stance, and gait steadiness), balance, pulse oximetry ,
and quality of life. The coordinator will utilize a weekly spreadsheet showing utilization (therapy sessions/day , logged in the
Quell health Cloud) so compliance can be monitored and those that are not using the device can be encouraged.

1/18/24, 2:18 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=476700 6/13(those who wore sham will get an active device).
The cohorts (per sub-study) will be randomized in two arms: Active group (AG). The AG (n=15) will be undergoing TENS
therapy with an active device during [ADDRESS_452952] at the location of stimulation. To get localized
effects in both limbs the subjects will alternate limbs. W e also recommend this in any case to minimize the risk of skin
irritation from the hydrogel pads. According to previous studies, perceived af ferent stimulation by [CONTACT_363606]. Therefore, both limbs will be assessed for therapy outcomes.
Placebo Group (PG). The PG (n=15) will be undergoing TENS therapy with a sham device as described in the AG. The
sham device is identical to the active device in all respects except that it stimulates for 6 minutes during each therapy
session instead of 60 minutes, and is therefore 10% of the dose.
Both groups will receive their respective devices at the initial visit (BL) and will be asked to return in 4 weeks for follow-up
assessment (4W visit). At this 4 week visit, study participants will be unblinded and the active group will keep their active
device, while the placebo group will receive a placebo device. Study participants will return for a final in-person visit at the
8th week (8W), which will include the assessments described above. Throughout this 8-week period the participants may
receive follow-up phone calls assessing their compliance. All subjects will keep their active device after completion of the
8-week study .

F2.  Procedure
     30 subjects per sub-study (study #1: 30 subjects, study#2: 30 subjects):
Aim 1 (acceptability): To examine feasibility and acceptability of TENS in patients with NP .
At the baseline visit and each of the follow-up visits (at four weeks, 4W ; and eight weeks, 8W), electrical stimulation using
the TENS device, will be administered by [CONTACT_14676] . Daily electrical stimulation, between the baseline and follow-up
visit, will be administered by [CONTACT_363608]. They will be asked to use the device at least [ADDRESS_452953] 4 days per week. At follow-up study visits (4W and 8W), a Technology Acceptance Model (T AM) survey adopted
for tele-health and smart wearables applications perception of benefit, technological anxiety , technology acceptance, trust,
facilitation conditions, risk, and attitude of use will be obtained for each subject.
Aim 2 (proof of concept ef fectiveness): To examine ef fectiveness of TENS for NP .
At the baseline visit (BL) and each of the follow-up visits (at four weeks, 4W ; and eight weeks, 8W), electrical stimulation
using the TENS device, will be administered by [CONTACT_14676] . This trial will have 30 patients divided into two groups.
Group 1 (Active group, n=15) will receive a functional Neurometrix Quell Relief Device; Group 2 (Placebo group, n=15) will
receive a non-functional Neurometrix Quell Relief Device that will administer 6 minutes of stimulation per hour of
stimulation. Lower extremity muscle activation will be assessed by [CONTACT_53778] (electromyography) at each study visit
during the delivery of stimulation. At the 4th week (4W), both groups will be unblinded and the AG will keep their functional
device, will the PG will return their non-functional device and receive a functional device. The patients will be monitored for
another 4 weeks with a final follow-up visit at 8 weeks (8W). Both the AG and PG will have the option to take home their
functional device at the end of the 8-week study

item scale (EOR TC-CIPN20), Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS), European Organization for Research and Treatment
Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EOR TC-QLQC30).
Peripheral Neuropathy: Peripheral neuropathy will be assessed at BL, 4W , and 8W using DPNCheck (Neurometrix,
Woburn, MA, [LOCATION_003]). This is a noninvasive device which will measure conduction velocity and amplitude. V ibration
perception threshold (VPT) will also be used to assess sensitivity of patients' lower extremity .
Optional assessments: Oxygen Level Assessment: Oxygen saturation will be measured using a pulse oximeter .
Gait assessment: Gait performance will be assessed using a validated body worn sensors (LegSys, Biosensics LLC, [LOCATION_003]).
The device uses five sensor modules respectively attached to right and left anterior shins, right and left anterior thighs, and
posteriorly to the lower back. Based on the subject's height and using a two-link inverse pendulum model the following
spatio-temporal gait parameters will be estimated: velocity , stride length, stride time, double support, single support, stride-
to-stride variability , and gait initiation. In addition, the center of mass (COM) range of motion during walking will be
calculated by [CONTACT_363609]-back. Gait will be assessed over a distance of 20 meters
under 2 conditions: (1) walking at habitual speed (2) walking at maximum speed (fast walking).
Balance assessment: Balance will be quantified using validated body worn sensors (BalanSens, Biosensics LLC, [LOCATION_003]).
The system measures ankle and hip motion in three dimensions (3D), 2D COM sway as well as RCI in ML  and AP
directions. Balance will be assessed according to Romberg protocol during eyes-open and eyes-closed condition during
double, semi-tandem, and full tandem stances. For those patients who may not be able to do gait and balance test, we will
use alternative upper extremity test, which according to our previous studies provide similar results as gait bit do not
require subject to walk. (See Attachment)
Upper Extremity Frailty Test: Investigators will measure arm motion from each participant by [CONTACT_363610] (e.g. accelerometer , gyroscope) such as LegSys (Biosensics LLC, MA, [LOCATION_003]), Frailty Meter
(Biosensics LLC, MA, [LOCATION_003]), or BioStamp (MC10, MA, [LOCATION_003]). These inertial sensors will assess respectively kinematic of
upper extremities (e.g., arm and shoulder) motion as well as joint coordination. W e will be used at least [ADDRESS_452954] to capture arm motion.
Physical Activity and Health Monitoring: The subject will be given a wearable device (P AMSys) and/or a smart watch
(Vivosmart 4) that will be measuring several parameters including number of steps taken, duration of sitting, standing,
walking and lying, time taken and number of transitions from sit to stand, and walking speed for a minimum of [ADDRESS_452955] to return
the wearable device at study completion. Subjects will either return the device at their next research visit or be given a
prepaid package to mail the device back.
Optional Questionnaires at each study visit: pain, weakness, sleep, quality of life, frailty , depression, life and space, beck
anxiety scale, Katz-daily living, fatigue, and user acceptability .
The supervision of this study will be by [CONTACT_53780] (Study #1), and cancer care specialists (study #2) and
the location will be at Baylor College of Medicine McNair Campus.
 
Section G:  Sample Size/Data Analysis
G1.  Sample Size

     Local: 60              W orldwide: 60
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
     Convenient and selected based on available resources to demonstrate feasibility and the proof of concept ef fectiveness of
TENS therapy for patients with NP . We plan to recruit 60 eligible subjects.
Study #1: 30 subjects Study #2: 30 subjects
G2.  Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     Independent t-test, U-test, or Chi-square (depends on type of variables) to compare between groups (AG, and PG for key
baseline descriptors including demographics and relevant clinical characteristics. Those descriptors which show statistical
1/18/24, 2:18 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=476700 8/13significant dif ference, baseline value of the outcomes measured in the model, and other variables that are deemed to be
prognostic, will be considered as covariates for adjusting the results in the following assessments. Appropriate mixed
models (linear for continuous or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) for non-continuous or non-parametric variables)
will be used to test the intervention ef fect for each of the primary or secondary outcomes. Results will be adjusted by
[CONTACT_363611].
 
Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:
     The risk to participants of this study is considered to be minimal in a controlled environment with an attendant present. This
research routine will not place subjects at higher risk than normal activities of daily living, and no more risk of harm or
discomfort is associated with these tests than the discomfort normally incurred while performing normal muscle stretching.
Subjects will be allowed rest time between trials as needed. The EMG device will detect level of fatigue and based on that
we will determine the length of the sessions.
The devices and technologies are completely non-invasive, safe, non-toxic and non-ionizing. The potential risks to subject
are minimal. However , like any battery powered systems, there is a minimum risk of sensor malfunctioning. In addition, the
study devices are not waterproof, and although they use a low powered battery (similar to a cellphone battery), in order to
avoid any risk of shock the monitor should not be submerged or saturated with fluids during operations or cleaning. It does
not emit any radiation to the human body , and does not of fer any significant risk to the subject.
Subjects may experience mild discomfort from the band or hydrogel pads on their legs. W e will inform the subject to please
notify the investigators if the band or hydrogel pads are uncomfortable.
All information we will collect about the subject will be stored in a secure location and coded in a way to maintain
confidentiality . Only study personnel will have access to their records. Data collected during the study may be published
and made publicly available. Data may also be shared with other research groups. However , data that could in any way
identify them will not be made public or shared.
Some of potential risks of using TENS therapy could be: (1) Skin related discomfort, such as tingling or (2) Skin reaction to
hydrogel pads (irritation, rash).
If the tingling sensation is too intense for the participant, they have the ability to reduce the intensity for their best level of
comfort.
The peripheral neuropathy device (DPNCheck) has minimal risks to the subjects as it is non-invasive, safe, non-toxic, and
non-ionizing. The subjects may feel a tingling sensation during its use, and if it is too intense, the research staf f will stop
the test.
H2.  Data and safety monitoring plan
     Do the study activities impart greater than minimal risk to subjects?

Section I:  Potential Benefits
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned work.
1/18/24, 2:18 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=476700 9/13     Study #1: W e cannot promise any benefit to you or to others from you joining this research. However , the proposed
treatment may assist in reducing symptoms of P ACS associated FM. In addition, the participation in this study may help
the investigators better understand how COVID-[ADDRESS_452956] help these patients to
recover from NP . This may allow physicians to provide personalized care by [CONTACT_363612] P ASC.
Study #2: W e cannot promise any benefit to you or to others from you joining this research. However , the proposed
treatment may assist in reducing symptoms of pain associated to your chemotherapy . In addition, the participation in this
study may help the investigators better understand how TENS help patients with CIPN. This may allow physicians to
provide personalized care by [CONTACT_363613].
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
     As described above, this type of work may allow physicians to provide more personalized care for patients with NP .
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
     Study #1:
This study brings no more than minimal risk to subjects as it only involves a non-invasive device. There are some risks
associated with lack of comfort from TENS, skin allergy to the TENS band, risk associated with electrical mal-function of
the TENS device, and other unknown risks. All TENS devices will be checked before any use to minimize the risk
associated with electrical malfunction. All TENS devices are FDA  approved for the purpose of temporary relief of pain.
However , these devices have not been used before for purpose of managing COVID-[ADDRESS_452957] of COVID-19. The peripheral neuropathy device (DPNCheck) has
minimal risks to the subjects as it is non-invasive, safe, non-toxic, and non-ionizing. The subjects may feel a tingling
sensation during its use, and if it is too intense, the research staf f will stop the test.
Study #2:
The risk to participants of this study is considered to be minimal because all that is required is simple walking in a
controlled environment with a research staf f present (all subjects will be mobile, and walking as a regular part of their
activities of daily living this research routine will not place them at higher risk than normal activities of daily living). No more
risk of harm or discomfort is associated with these tests than the discomfort normally incurred while walking or during
normal muscle stretching. The peripheral neuropathy device (DPNCheck) has minimal risks to the subjects as it is non-
invasive, safe, non-toxic, and non-ionizing. The subjects may feel a tingling sensation during its use, and if it is too intense,
the research staf f will stop the test.

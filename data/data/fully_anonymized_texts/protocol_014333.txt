Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality,  
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm (i .e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are d ue 
to a device deficiency. The i nvestigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any 
patient harm separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet produc t specifications (e .g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens/solution cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging deficit (e .g., mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)  
• Suspect product contamination

will be reported regardless of causality.   
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), ou tcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the i nvestigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator  product s on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must 
submit all available informatio n on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study 
Sponsor immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the i nvestigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the i nvestigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.   
• Docum ent any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary, Autopsy Report,  
• Certificate of Death etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event  and Adverse Device Ef fect eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become n onoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect  and/or Device Deficiency  Form. The 
completed form is emailed to the Study Sponsor at msus.safety@Alco n.com  according to the 
timelines outlined above; however, the reported information must be entered into the EDC 
system once it becomes operational.

Alcon – Business Use Only  Any AEs and device deficiencies for non study marketed devices/products (i.e. CLEAR 
CARE contact [CONTACT_13293] s olution ) will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the 
postmarket vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the device ’s/product ’s 
manufacturer as per local requirements.  
Study Sponsor representatives may be contact[CONTACT_443410].  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the Study 
Sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_443389] e portions of the subject ’s medical records. The 
investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appro priate, the i nvestigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate  the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the  
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the i nvestigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_271456], as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not  been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_443411].

unlikely to be related (i .e., there are oth er more likely causes for the AE).  
The Study Sponsor will asse ss the AEs and may upgrade the i nvestigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The  Study Sponsor will notify the i nvestigator of an y AEs that is

11.5 Unmasking of the Study Tre atment  
Masked information on the identity of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the study (See Section 9.4 for details on the masking procedure) . If the treatment code 
needs to be broken in the i nterest of subject safety, the i nvestigator is encouraged to contact 
[CONTACT_443414]. Dependent upon the individual circumstances (i.e., medical emergency), the 
code may be broken prior to contact [CONTACT_125606]. The Study Sponsor must be 
informed of all cases in which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. 
Additionally, the Study Sponsor may be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill 
expedited regulatory  reporting requirements.  
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The i nvesti gator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The i nvestigator should provide the Study Sponsor with an y new safety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of discontinuation , any 
additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs up to study 
completion (i .e., database lock).   Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_564060] 
completed the study should be documented and available upon the Study Sponsor ’s request.

ocular and nonocular AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_443415]. AEs leading to study discontinuation, signi ficant nonserious AEs, and SAEs 
will be  identified. Individual subject listings will be provided, as necessary.  
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur  after signing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP.  
Each biomicroscopy parameter will be tabulated by [CONTACT_13296]. For each biomicroscopy  
parameter, counts and percentages of eyes that experience an increase of ≥ 2 grades from  
baseline (last assessment prior to study lens exposure) to any subsequent visit within the  
same period will be presented. A supportive li sting will be generated which will include all  
biomicroscopy data from all visits within the same period for those eyes experiencing the  
increase.  
Two listings for device deficiencies, prior to expos ure to study contact [CONTACT_443416] -

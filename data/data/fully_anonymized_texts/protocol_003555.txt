Detailed Title A Phase IIa, open -label, non-randomized, controlled, mono -
center stud y to evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity  and
safet y of a fractional (Fx) booster dose of GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals’ malaria candidate vaccine RTS,S/AS01 Ewhen 
given to healthy  adults subjects previously  receiving various 
primary  dose schedules in a sporozoite challenge model.
Indication Primary  immunization against malaria disease caused by  
[CONTACT_284396] (P. falciparum ).
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the study
This follow -up study  (MALARIA -102) to the MALARIA -092
study will be 
conducted at the Walter Reed Arm y Institute of 
Research (WRAI R) and is designed to evaluate the waning 
efficacy  with the fractional schedule sand to confirm if 
protection can be extended with an additional Fxdose.
In this booster study , 
vaccinated subjects from the 
MAL ARIA -092 study  [previously  protected orunprotected 
following controlled human malaria infection (CHMI)] will 
receive a booster and undergo a second CHMI three to four 
weeks after vaccination.
Rationale for the study design
The MALARIA -092 study  was designed to evaluate vary ing 
vaccination schedules, a Fx dose and the use of the pediatric 
formulation, RTS,S/AS01 E, in the adult CHMI  model. Th e
current study  will assess 
if a Fx dose booster will maintain 
protection in those previously  protected a nd convert 
previously  unprotected individuals to protected status .
Given the positive efficacy  derived in MALAR IA-092 study  
in the group that received RTS,S/AS01 E(PedFx) , a decision 
has been taken to boost subjects only  with a Fx dose from the 
RTS,S/AS01 Eformulation (0.1 mL). This will facilitate 
deploy ment in Africa where the same dosage and formulation 
will be used across all age groups . Interim analysis from the 
MAL ARIA -092 CHMI study  showed that vaccine efficacy  
(VE) with the RTS,S/AS01 B(comparator group) or 
RTS,S/AS01 E were comparable [51% (95% CI : 19%, 70%; p -
value = 0.0010) and 60% (95% CI : 30%, 77%; p -value = 
0.0001), respectively ].Thus for this MAL ARIA-102 study , 
subjects will receive a booster dose with a Fx dose of a 
RTS,S/AS01 Evaccine.
This study  will be sponsored b y [COMPANY_004] Biologicals and funded 
by [CONTACT_117850].

Adequate contraception: Adequate contraception is defined as a contraceptive 
method with failure rate of less than 1% per y ear when 
used consistently  and correctl y and when applicable, in 
accordance with the product label for example:
Abstinence from penile -vaginal intercourse, when 
this is their preferred and usual lifesty le,
Combined estrogen and progesterone oral 
contraceptives,
Injectable progestogen,
Implants of etenogestrel or levonorgestrel,
Contraceptive vaginal ring,
Percutaneous contraceptive patches,
Intrauterine device or intrauterine system,
Male partner sterilization prior to the female 
subject’s entry  into the study , and this male is the 
sole partner for that subject,
The information on the male sterility  can come from 
the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medical 
records; or interview with the subject on her medical 
history .
Male condom combined with a vaginal spermicide 
(foam, gel, film, cream or suppository ),and/or 
progesterone alone oral contraceptive.
Adequate contraception does not apply  to subjects of 
child bearing pote ntial with same sex partners, or for 
subjects who are and will continue to be abstinent from 
penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term and persistent 
basis, when this is their preferred and usual lifest yle.
Adverse event (AE) : Any untoward medical occurre nce in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product .
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal lab oratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For 
marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e. ,lack of efficacy ), abuse or 
misuse.

Epoch: An epoch is a set o f consecutive timepoints or a single 
timepoint from a single protocol. Epochs are defined to 
support a main purpose which is either to draw 
conclusions on subject participation or to draw a 
complete conclusion to define or precise the targeted 
label of the product. Supporting means that data collected 
at the timepoints included in an epoch must be sufficient 
to fulfil the purpose of the epoch.

26-SEP-2018 291. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Background
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals in partnership with PATH is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) malaria vaccine for routine immunization of 
infants and children living in malaria-endemic areas with the objective of reducing the 
risk of malaria and severe malaria during the first y ears of life. [COMPANY_004] Biologicals, in
collaboration with PATH, continued to investigate way s to f urther improve vaccine 
efficacy levels. Higher vaccine efficacy  levels may  lead to improved malaria control and 
contribute to the malaria elimination goal set as a long
-term target by  [CONTACT_752069] h ealth 
community  [Malaria Vaccine Technology  Roadmap , 2013].
The sporozoite challenge model, in the RTS,S/AS candidate vaccine development 
program, has demonstrated a high relevance in its ability  to predict efficacy under 
conditions of natural exposure in malaria -endemic countries. A previous controlled 
human malaria infection ( CHMI )study  in malaria -naïve adults (MALAR IA-071) where a 
0, 1, 7- month schedule, with a fractional (Fx) dose delivered as the third immunization 
(Fx017M) was evaluated showed high efficacy  in the Fx017M group compared to 
standard doses given at 0, 1, 2 -months (012M group). MALARIA -[ADDRESS_1029738] superiorit y of the Fx017M group over the 012M group, but the study  did show 
some evidence of a difference in vaccine efficacy comparing the two groups (increase in 
proportion of protected subjects = 64.4% [95% CI: 
-7.9, 88.3], p = 0.0741, Fisher’s exact; 
difference in time to parasitemia p =0.0455, logrank). While all volunteers in the 
infectivity  control group developed parasitemia after CHMI, 26 of 30 subjects in the 
Fx017M group (VE = 86.7% [95% CI ; 66.8, 94.6]; p -value < 0.[ADDRESS_1029739]) and 10 of 16 subjects in the 012M group (VE = 62.5% [95% CI : 29.4, 80.1]; p -value 
= 0.0009) were protected. In the follow -up phase of the study , subjects who were 
protected in the initial challenge were randomized to receive a Fx fourth dose or no 
fourth dose, before being exposed to a second sporozoite challenge approximately  six 
months after the initial challenge. Amongst subjects initially  in the Fx017M group, three 
out of seven subjects who did not receive a fourth dose were pr otected in this second 
challenge, while nine out of tensubjects who were initially  protected and received a Fx
fourth dose were protected. The results from the study follow -up phase and the second 
challenge suggest that there is waning immunity  with the f ractional schedule too but that 
the protection can be extended with an additional Fxdose [ Regules , 2016].

designed to evaluate the efficacy , immunogenicity  and safet y of various dose schedules 
and formulations of [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ candidate malaria v accines. The study , conducted 
at the Walter Reed Arm y Institute of Research (WRAI R),aimed to evaluate: (a) the role 
of a Fxsecond and third dose, ( b) a two -dose schedule where the second dose is 
fractional , (c) the use of the pediatric formulation to vaccinate adults, when a pediatric 
dose is delivered to adults, ( d) the use of the ped iatric formulation to vaccinate adults, 
when what has been considered so far as an adult dose is delivered using the pediatric 
formulation (increasing the volume of administration) ,and ( e) the impact of vary ing 
dosing schedules on immune effectors and immune correlates of protection. Group 
AduFx receiving RTS,S/AS01 Bfull dose at Month 0 and Month 1 + RTS,S/AS01 B
fractional (Fx) dose (1/5 th dose) at Month 7.
The groups eval uated were:
Group 2PedFx receiving double dose of RTS,S/AS01 Eat Month 0 and Month 1 + 
double dose of RTS,S/AS01 EFx dose (1/5th dose) at Month 7.
Group PedFx receiving RTS,S/AS01 Efull dose at Month 0 and Month 1 + 
RTS,S/AS01 EFx dose (1/5th dose) at Month 7.
Group Adu2Fx receiving RTS,S/AS01 Bfull dose at Month 0 + RTS,S/AS01 BFx 
dose (1/5th dose) at Month 1 and Month 7.
Group Adu1Fx receiving RTS,S/AS01 Bfull dose at Month 0 + RTS,S/AS01 BFx

1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.2.1. Rationale for the study
This follow -up study  (MALARIA -102) to the MALARIA -092 study  will be conducted at 
WRAI Rand is designed to evaluate the waning efficacy  with the fractional schedule sand 
to confirm if protection can be extended with an additional Fxdose.
In this booster stud y, vaccinated subjects from the MAL ARIA -092 study  (previously
protected or
unprotected following CHMI ) will receive a booster and undergo a second 
CHMI three to four weeks after vaccination.

26-SEP-2018 311.2.2. Rationale for the study  design
The MALARIA -092 study  was designed to evaluate vary ing vaccination schedules, a Fx 
dose and the use of the pediatric formulation, RTS,S/AS01 E, in the adult CHMI  model. 
The current study  will assess if a Fx dose booster will maintain protection in those 
previously  protected and convert previously  unprotected individuals to protected status.
Given the positive efficacy  derived in MALAR IA-092 study  in the group that received 
RTS,S/AS0 1E(PedFx), a decision has been taken to boost subjects only  with a Fx dose 
from the RTS,S/AS01 Eformulation (0.1 mL ). This will facilitate deployment in Africa 
where the same dosage and formulation will be used across all age groups .Interim
analysis from the MALARI A-092 CHMI study  showed that vaccine efficacy  (VE) with 
the RTS,S/AS01 B(comparator group) or RTS,S/AS01 E were comparable [51% (95% CI: 
19%, 70%; p- value = 0.0010) and 60% (95% CI : 30%, 77%; p -value = 0.0001), 
respectivel y].Thus for this MAL ARIA-102 study , subjects will receive a booster dose 
with a Fx dose of a RTS,S/AS01 Evaccine.
This study  will be sponsored b y [COMPANY_004] Biologicals and funded b y PATH.
1.3. Benefit : Risk assessment
Please refer to the current I nvestigator ’sBrochure for the summary  of potential risks and 
benefits of RTS,S/AS01 .

Potential/Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Investigational vaccine : RTS,S/AS01
Important potential risk: 
MeningitisIn the large Phase III study,
MALARIA -055 PRI, an 
imbalance of meningitis cases 
of any etiology (i.e. , including 
cases with confirmed etiology 
and cases with no etiology
found), with no cluster in time-
to-onset, has been observed in
children [ADDRESS_1029744] and treat meningitis if 
it occurs.
Meningitis is an adverse event 
(AE) of specific interest (see 
Section 9.1.5 ). Clinical details 
of each case will be captured 
through the expedited AE 
report and in a specific eCRF 
screen.

Potential/Identified RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
Important potential risk: 
Hypersensitivity
(including anaphylaxis)As with other vaccines, 
hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis to o ne or several 
components of the vaccine can 
rarely occur.
One case of erythema multiform 
and two cases of 
bronchospasm within 30 days 
following RTS,S/AS01 
vaccination were reported as 
hypersensitivity reactions in 
past pediatric studies.
No case of anaphyl axis has 
been reported following 
RTS,S/AS01 vaccination to 
date.Subjects will be observed 
closely for at least [ADDRESS_1029747] -
vaccination and history of any 
reaction or hypersensitivity 
likely to be exacerbated by 
[CONTACT_752070] (see Section 5.3). 
Previous anaphylactic reaction 
to a vaccine is a 
contraindication to further 
experimental vaccination sin 
this study (see Section 7.5).
Important potential risk: 
potential immune -
mediated disease

Study Procedures
Pain when taking blood 
samplesWhen taking the blood samples, 
the subject may feel faint; or 
experience mild pain, bruising, 
irritation or redness.Subjects will be advised to 
inform or call the study doctor 
immediately if they have any 
side effects that they perceive 
as serious.
Risks associated with 
malaria challengeThe r isks associated with the 
sporozoite challenge include 
local inflammatory reactions or 
potential allergic reactions to 
mosquito bites as well as the 
development of malaria infection. 
Transient abnormalities, such as 
fever, headache, mild anemia, 
leukopenia, splenomegaly, 
hepatic tenderness and fatigue, 
are expected consequences of 
malaria. The complications of
malaria which can lead to kidney, 
liver or brain damage, and death, 
are seen during naturally 
acquired malaria whe n diagnosis 
and treatment are delayed and 
high levels of parasitemia
develop.Anti-malaria treatment will be
administered to malaria 
infected subjects. Under the 
carefully controlled conditions 
of this study, the chance of 
serious illness or death from 
malaria infection is very small.
1.3.2. Benefit assessment
No direct benefit is foreseen from stud y participation. Indirect benefits may  be possible 
since subjects will be screened for HIV, hepatitis B and C and will receive a medical 
check -up.
1.3.3. Overall benefit:risk conclusion
The potential risks in association with RTS,S/AS01 are considered acceptable and the 
potential risks associated with malaria chal lenges are minimized by  [CONTACT_752072] .

For the infectivity  control group, subjects will be recruited and screened in order to 
provide approximately  6 control subjects for each malaria challenge day  required for the 
trial (the number of which will depend on the fin al number of experimental subjects). Up 
to 24 subjects may  eventually  be enrolled (defined as undergoing malaria challenge) as
infectivity  controls.
To be deemed eligible to participate, control subjects must fulfill all inclusion criteria 
(and none of the exclusion criteria) for the stud y. For the infectivity  control group only , 
in the rare event that malaria -naïve volunteers cannot be recruited, subjects may  be 
enrolled if they  have not been diagnosed with malaria (clinical disease or parasitemia) 
within the last five y ears (inclusive).

6.2. Subject identification and randomisation
6.2.1. Subject identification
Subject identification numbers will be the same as the ones assigned in the primary  study  
MAL ARIA -[ADDRESS_1029786] of treatment numbers for the supplies is generated at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals, using 
MATerial EXcellence (MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Anal ysis 
System (SAS) (Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]) by  [CONTACT_43055].
Treatment allocation to the subject
The treatment numbers will be allocated b y dose.The allocation will be sequential in the 
order in which the subjects are vaccinated.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target is to enroll all subjects who were vaccinated and have undergone challenge in 
the MALARIA -092 study  and who are willing to take part in this MALARIA -102 
booster study . A minimum of 40 subjects (20/vaccine group) are expected to be enrolled
in this study . However there may be more or fewer subjects who consent to join the 
study .
Subjects from the MALARI A
-092 study  will not be randomized but the treatment 
allocation will be done via a randomization system on internet (SBIR) to allow 
monitoring of vaccine storage and expir y dates .
Subjects from the infectivity  control group will not be randomized and will not appear in 
SBIR; they  will simply  be registered in the eCRF database.

Manual (SPM) for specific instructions.
6.3. Method of blinding
This study  is open -label.
The labor atory  in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the treatment, and 
codes will be used to link the subject and stud y (without any link to the treatment 
attributed to the subject) to each sample.
6.4. General study  aspects
Supplementary  study  conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompany ing SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the 
safet y of the subjects.
6.4.1. Mosquito challenge
Subjects from the two vaccine groups (P -Fx and NP -Fx) completing their immunization 
course will be challenged with sporozoite -infected mosquitoes to determine whether the 
expected protective response has developed. Such challenges are man dated by  [CONTACT_752075] y laboratory tests that will unequivocally predict protection. The challenge 
is scheduled to occur approximately  three weeks after vaccination (Day  22[Visit 3]).
Unimmunized infectivity  control subjects will also be challenged to verify  the adequacy  
of the challenge.
Subjects undergoing malaria challenge will receive an emergency notification card that 
outlines their participation in the study with details on the exposure to malaria, as well as 
the appropriate investigator contact [CONTACT_752076]. Details of this information may  
vary, depending on the venue selected for the hotel phase of the stud y.
Contraindications to malaria challenge
The only  absolute contraindication to mosquito challenge is pregnancy . If this occurs 
after i mmunization but before undergoing challenge, the subject must not be challenged 
and she will be followed for the duration of the study or pregnancy whichever is longer.
A subject with a minor illness but who does not have fever during the pre -challenge 
assessment may  be challenged at the discretion of the investigator. If the subject is

stored at WRAI R. All blood products used for malaria and mosquito culturing will be 
commerciall y tested for HIV, HBsA g, HCV, and sy philis. The mosquitoes used will be 
laboratory -born and reared Anopheles stephensi .
Infection of human subjects
Mosquitoes infected approximately  2-[ADDRESS_1029793], five mosquitoes will be allowed to feed over five minutes, after which they will 
be dissected to confirm how many were infected, and the salivary glands scored. If 
required, additional mosquitoes will be allowed to feed until a total of five infected 
mosquitoes with a minimum 2+ salivary  glands score have fed [ Wirtz , 1987]. The 
mosquito feedings will be performed in a secure insectary  of the Department of 
entomology  at WRAI R. Subjects will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_1029794] been documented in the context of the WRAIR malaria 
challenge model. Routinely , transient local allergic reactions (itching, rash) ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_752061] s.
Determining parasitemia

blood films (smear) and PCR . Microscopy  will be performed on thick smears using a
validated Standard Operation Procedure .
All blood films (posit ive and negative) will be archived at the study centers for later re -

Protocol Final Version [ADDRESS_1029797] is 25 day s [Ballou , 1987]. An 
immunized individual who does not have complete protection may  have a prolongation of 
the parasite pre -patent period.
Beginning on the fifth day after their challenge (Day  27[Visit 4]), subjects will be seen
and evaluated dail y by a study investigator and blood will be drawn for blood smears and 
PCR to check for the presence of parasit es as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. If fever or 
symptoms develop at an y time, blood smears will be done more frequently (every 6 to 12 
hours), and a stud y investigator will evaluate the subject. A confirmed positive result will 
be relay ed immediatel y to the on -call investigator/study  perso nnel by  [CONTACT_284363][INVESTIGATOR_11437]. 
The infection will be treated earl y (i.e. ,as soon as parasites can be identified on thick 
smear) according to the treatment regimen outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. Additional PCR 
tests may  also be performed at investigator discretion, but may  not necessarily  be run in 
real time.
Beginning on the ninth day post-challenge (Day  3
1[Visit 8]), a group of hotel rooms in 
the local area of WRAIR will be reserved for malaria- challenged subjects. Subjects will 
be required to spend their nights there to allow for more rapid assessment of any  potential 
symptoms of malaria during the hours that the study  centers are closed. There will be 
an 
investigator present on -site and available for subject assessment. There will also be 
qualified study
 personnel on site 24 hours per day  during the hotel phase of the study .
During the hotel phase, all challenged subjects will be assessed on a daily  basis in an 
identical manner. An evaluation will be done ideally  each morning (headache, muscle 
aches, etc.) and blood will be drawn for smear and PCR . There may be the rare occasion 
where subject assessment is done later in the day  but every  effort must be 
made for the 
assessment to be done in the morning. All challenged subjects will be instructed to check 
in with clinical staff b y telephone call or texting or in- person each afternoon or evening 
during the hotel stay  until they  are positive for malaria. 
A member of the WRAI R staff 
will contact [CONTACT_12552]/her and if they are not available during the time of contact. A telephone 
script will be used to guide the site staff during these contacts. They will be asked if they  
feel an y differently since they were seen in t he morning. At any  time required, the on-
duty investigator will arrange for the timely  production of blood smears and PCR , along
with their examination and interpretation, in order to treat rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y those subjects in whom 
therap y for malaria is indicated. O nce a positive smear is identified, dail y blood films will 
continue to be obtained until three consecutive films are negative (separated by  [CONTACT_726] 
12 hours). A complete blood count and serum chemistry  tests will be done when parasites 
are initially  foun d in the blood (this could be done on the day  of parasitemia detection or 
the day  after).
The maximum hotel stay  for malaria- challenged subjects should be approximately  10 
nights ( between Day 31[Visit 8] to Day  40[Visit 17], inclusive ). A subject who develops 
malaria, is treated, and has three consecutive negative malaria smears (separated by  [CONTACT_26813] 12 hours), will not need to remain in the hotel. The investigators will be responsible 
for accounting for an y subjects who do not arrive in the hotel du ring the challenge phase. 
If required, the investigators will phy sicall y locate and treat an y malaria -infected subject 
who is unable to maintain the follow- up dictated by  [CONTACT_15365] .

chloroquine (a total of 1500 mg c hloroquine base: 600 mg base initially , followed by  300 
mg base given approximately  6, 24 and 48 hours later) under direct observation. This 
regimen has been 100% effective in previous WRAI R malaria vaccine studies using the 
same malaria strain as will be used in this challenge model. Such earl y treatment 
minimizes the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a complicated malaria infection. Alternatively , 
atovaquone/proguanil ( Malarone ) standard oral dosage of 1 g/400 mg (once a day for 
three consecutive day s) or artemether/lum efantrine ( Coartem ) standard oral dosage of 
80mg/480 mg (initial dose, additional dose 8 hours later, and then twice daily  for the 
following two day s) can be used to treat subjects.
The malaria strain used for challenge ( P. falciparum strain NF54/clone 3D 7) is sensitive 
to several currentl y available, licensed, anti
-malarial drugs that are safe, effective and 
have a low incidence of side effects. The investigators will have available approved 
antipy retics, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, for subjects experiencing fever and 
myalgias. In addition, other approved medications will be available to the investigators, 
which may  include, but are not limited to: ondansetron and loperamide ( Imodium ) to treat 
other signs/s ymptoms as necessary . Investigators will alway s assure that subjects do not 
have underl ying allergies to any  of these medications prior to their use. An alternative 
antipy retic will be provided if the subject is allergic to a prescribed drug.
It is anticipated that treatment of malaria will be cu rative, since relapses do not occur 
after adequate treatment of P. falciparum infections. No previous P. falciparum subject 
infected and treated b y WRAI Rhas had a malaria relapse. Subjects will be advised to 
contact [CONTACT_43038] y physician, or to advise their personal phy sician of their participation in 
this malaria study , if fever, headache, or other s ymptoms possibly  related to malaria 
develop at an y time within one year after completion of the study. In the unlikely  event 
that malaria recurs, the subject wi ll be retreated with chloroquine, atovaquone/proguanil 
(Malarone ) standard oral dosage of 1 g/400 mg (once a day  for three consecutive day s), 
or artemether/lumefantrine ( Coartem ) standard oral dosage of 80 mg/480 mg (initial

viral hepatitis transmission from mosquitoes to humans have occurred. The risk of 
accidentally  transmitting malaria to a person in the community  will be negligible 
because:
The infected mosquitoes will be raised in secure insectary  at WRAI R.
All malaria challenges occur in a secure insectary .
The infected mosquitoes never leave the secured insectary  area at any  time.
Malaria infections in subjects will be treated promptly  before gametocy tes can

response (anti -CS ELISA, anti -CS avidity , anti- HBs and serum repository ) at each 
pre-
defined timepoint. After centrifugation, serum samples should be kept at 
–20°C/ –4°F or below until shipment. Refer to the SPM for more details on sample 
storage conditions.
Blood sampling for PBMC and plasma repository
A volume of approximately  40 mL of whole blood should be drawn at each pre -
defined timepoint for the purpose of the PBMC and plasma repository . The blood 
should be stored at room temperature until it is transf erred to the designated 
laboratory  for further processing. The purified PBMC should be stored in liquid 
nitrogen and plasma at -
20°C or colder until further processing.
For all subjects:
Blood sampling for HIV, HCV and HBsAg
A volume of approximately  17 mL of whole blood should be drawn from all 
screened subjects to assess HIV, HCV and HBsAg status
.
Blood sampling for assessment of parasitemia (blood smear and PCR )
A volume of approximately  4 mL  should be drawn from all subjects at each pre -
defined timepoint for the assessment of parasitemia by  [CONTACT_752077] . For 
subjects who develop malaria (positive blood smear) , blood samples for smears and 
PCR may be discontinued once the subject has three consecutive negative smears
(separated b y more than 12 hours) following initial treatment.
Blood sampling for hematology  and biochemistry  anal ysis
A volume of approximately  7.5 mL of whole blood should be drawn from all 
subjects at each pre -defined timepoint for the assessment of safet y parameters (ALT,

Please refer to the SPM for details on biospecimen management (handling, storage and 
shipment). Samples will not be labelled with in formation that directly  identifies the 
subject but will be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related 
to the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory  tests 
described in this protocol. This may include the management of the quality  of these 
tests, the maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test 
methods, as well as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods 
and work reliably .
It is also possible that future findings may  make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study  for future research, not described in this protocol. Therefore, 
all subjects will be asked to give a spec ific consent to allow [COMPANY_004] or a contracted 
partner to use the samples for future research. Future research will be subject to the 
laws and regulations in the U nited States and will only  be performed once an 
independent Ethics Committee or Review Board has a pproved this research.
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from GS K 
Biologicals.
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject .
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform an y other biological assay s except those described in t he prot ocol or its 
amendment(s).
If additional testing is performed, the marker priority  ranking given in Section 6.7.4 may 
be changed.
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 y ears (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study  visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the s ubject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formall y to and discussed 
and agreed with [COMPANY_004] Biologicals.
6.7.1. Use of specified study materials
When materials are provided by  [CONTACT_43055], it is MANDATORY that all clinical 
samples 
(including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively  using those 
materials in the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the 
exclu sion of the subject from the Per-Protocol analy sis (See Section 11.5 for the 
definition of cohorts to be analyzed). The investigator must ensure that his/her personnel 
and the laboratory (ies) under his/her supervision comply  with this requi rement. However, 
when [COMPANY_004] Biologicals does not provide material for collecting and storing clinical 
samples, appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used. Refer to the 
Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM.

At each stud y visit, the investigator or delegate should question the subject about any  
medication s/product staken and vaccination sreceived by  [CONTACT_423].
7.6.1. Recording of concomitant medications/products and 
concomitant vaccination s
The following concomitant medication(s) /product (s)/vaccine (s)must be recorded in 
the eCRF:
All concomitant medications/products, except vitamins and dietary  supplements, 
administered during the period within seven days following Day 1 (Day  1to Day 8)

Any concomitant vaccination admi nistered in the period starting seven days before 
Day [ADDRESS_1029863] study  visit (Day  -7to Day  190 ).
Prophy lactic medication (i.e. , medication administered in the absence of ANY 
symptom and in anticipation of a reaction to the vaccination) (for P
-Fx and NP -Fx 
groups) .
E.g.,an anti -pyretic is considered to be prophy lactic when it is given in the absence 
of fever and an y other s ymptom, to prevent fever from occurring (fever is defined as 
temperature 37.5°C/99.5°F regardless the location of measu rement ). The preferred 
location for measuring temperature in thi s study  will be the oral cavit y.
Any concomitant medications/products/vaccines listed in Section 7.6.2

The investigator or site staff is/are responsible for the detection, documentation and 
reporting of events meeting the criteria and de finition of an AE or SAE as provided in 
this protocol.
Each subject will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_43054] y should they/the 
subject manifest an y signs or sy mptoms they  perceive as serious.
9.1. Safet y definitions
9.1.1. Definition of an adverse event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. ,lack of efficacy ), abuse or m isuse.
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study .
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre
-existing condition including either an 
increase i n frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccine administration even 
though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interact ion.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study
vaccine or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE/SAE).
Signs, sy mptoms temporally  associated with study vaccine administration.
Pre- or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e.,invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) are described in Section 9.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.

26-SEP-2018 71Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. ,endoscop y, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. ,social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study
 that do not worsen.
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the 
study  vaccination. These events will be recor ded in the medical history  section of the 
eCRF.
9.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event 
A SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence that:
a.Results in death,
b.Is life -threatening,
Note: The term ‘life- threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which h ypothetically  might have caused death, had it been more severe.
c.Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ,
Note: I n genera l, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42978]/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12262]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42979], the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ’ occurred or was necessary , the 
AE should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.
d.Results in disability /incapacity , OR
Note: The term d isability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea , influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. ,sprained ankle) 
which may  interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study  subject.

Meningitis
For the further evaluation of the safet y signal of meningitis in the investigational vaccine 
groups, all cases of meningitis occurring during the study will be reported as a SAE.
9.2. Events or outcomes not qualify ing as adverse events or 
serious adverse events
9.2.1. Pregnan cy
Female subjects who become pregnant after the vaccination will not receive the 
sporozoite challenge may continue the study  for safety  follow -up onl y, at the discretion 
of the investigator.
While pregnancy  itself is not considered an AE or SAE, any adver se pregnancy  outcome 
or complication or elective termination of a pregnancy  for medical reasons will be 
recorded and reported as an AE or a SAE.
Note: The pregnancy  itself should alway s be recorded on a nelectronic pregnancy  report.
The following should alway s be considered as SAE and will be reported as described in 
Sections 9.4.1 and 
9.4.3:
Spontaneous pregnancy  loss, including:
Spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy  loss before/at 22 weeks of 
gestation) ,
Ectopic and molar pregnancy ,
Stillbirth (intrauterine death o f fetus after 22 weeks of gestation).
Note: the 22 weeks cut -off in gestational age is based on WHO -ICD 10 noted in the 
EMA Guideline on pregnancy  exposure [ EMA , 2006]. It is recognized that national 
regulations might be different.
Any early neonatal death (i.e. ,death of a live born infant occurring wi thin the first 7 
days of life).
Any congenital anomal yor birth defect (as per [ CDC MACDP ] guidelines) 
identified in the offspring of a study subject (either during pregnancy, at birth or 
later) regardless of wheth er the fetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes 
anomalies identified b y prenatal ultrasound, amniocentesis or examination of the 
products of conception after elective or spontaneous abortion.
Furthermore, an y SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy AND considered 
by [CONTACT_43074] y related to the study vaccine will be reported to [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals as described in Section 9.4.3. While the investigator is not obligated to 
activel y seek this information from former stud y participants, he/she may learn of a 
pregnancy  through spontaneous reporting.

26-SEP-2018 81The intensity  should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE which is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which preve nts normal, every day activities. In adults, such 
an AE would, for example, prevent attendance at work/school and 
would necessitate the admini stration of corrective therap y.
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as desc ribed in Section 9.1.2.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y vaccine and the 
occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. I n case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify  
if the AE could be causally  related to a specific vaccine/product administered (i.e .,
investigational , control/placebo or co
-administered vaccine). When causal relationship to 
a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the investigator should indicate the 
AE to be related to all products.
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, 
concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
study  vaccine will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the 
Investigator’s Brochure to determine his/her asse ssment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. However, it is very  
important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals. The 
investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality a ssessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.

following question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_106365] ?
”
YES: There is a reasonable possibility  that the stud y vaccine contributed to the AE.
NO: There is no reasonable possibility  that the AE is causally  related to the 
administration of the study  vaccine. There are other, more likel y causes and 
administration of the study  vaccine is not suspected to have contributed to the 
AE.
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 9.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for eac h SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical history .
Other medication.
Protocol required procedure.
Other procedure not required by  [CONTACT_760].
Lack of efficacy  of the vaccine, if applicable.
Erroneous administration.

Protocol Final Version [ADDRESS_1029968] ELISA methodology using plate adsorbed recombinant R32L R 
antigen, as described b y. [Clement , 2012]. Anti -CS antibody  concentrations will be 
determined relative to a standard reference antibody  as a control according to standard 
operating procedures from the laborato ry. The cut- off for the assay  is 1.9EU/mL . Results 
will be reported i n EU/mL .
Anti -HBs antibody
Anti- HBs antibod y concentrations will be determined using commerciall y available 
CLIA kits ADVIA®Centaur anti -HBs2 manufactured by  [CONTACT_752091]. The cut -
off for the assay  is 6.2 mIU/mL . Results will be reported in mIU/m L.
Antibody titers and subclasses against full -length CS and the C -term of CS
Standardized procedures established in the Clinical I mmunology  Laboratory  at WRAIR
to measure IgG antibodies against the full -length recombinant CS protein and the 
recombinant C -term of CS protein will be performed according to Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs) from the laboratory . Results are expressed in endpoint titer and the 
cut-off is set at 100.
Antibody  IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 subclasses against the full -length recombinant CS 
protein and the recombinant C -
term of CS protein will be performed using a L uminex 
assay  according to SOPs from the laboratory . Results are expressed in Mean Fluorescent
Intensit y and the cut -off is set at 50.
Avidity assays against CS repeat region, CS full length and C- term antigens
The anti -CS repeat region avidity  assay  uses NH 4SCN to demonstrate the avidity  of the 
antibodies in the assay , according to Standard Operating Procedur es (SOPs) from the 
laboratory . Briefl y, one extra step is introduced in the classic anti -CS quantification 
assay . After addition and incubation of the serum sample an extra incubation with the 
chaotropic reagent (NH 4SCN at 1M) is inserted in order to introduce a detaching force to 
the antigen -antibody  complex. The remaining antibodies, demonstrating a higher binding 
force to the antigen, are further quantified and the avidity  index % (anti-CS repeat region 
concentration under chaotropic reagent/anti-C S repeat region concentration without 
chaotropic reagent) is calculated and reported.
The avidity  assay  against full length CS protein and C -term uses 4M urea as chaotropic 
reagent and the result is also reported as avidity  index % (anti -CSP full length 
concentration under chaotropic reagent/anti- CS protein full length concentration without 
chaotropic reagent and anti -C-term concentration under chaotropic reagent/anti-C- term 
titer without chaotropic reagent, respectivel y).

Products  
Test product:   Revanesse Ultra  +: a clear, colorless gel in 1.0 mL pre- filled syringes with 
25 mg/mL of stabilized hyaluronic acid  and lidocaine 0.3% w/w.   
Comparator product:   Revanesse Ultra: a clear, colorless gel in 1.0 mL pre -filled syringes 
with 25 mg/m L of stabilized hyaluronic a cid. 
The injection will be given intradermally and for best results should be injected in the 
mid-dermis.  
Statistical Methods:   
Sample Size Determination:   To detect the difference between the null hypothesis proportion 
of responders of 50% and the alternative proportion of responders of 70% via a two-sided 
exact binomial test with a 0.05 significance level, 80 modified intent- to-treat ( mITT ) subjects 
will supply a power of 94.1%.  For the alternative proportion of responders of 68%, 80 mITT 
subjects will supply a power of 87.8 %. A responder is defined as a subject who had a within-
subject difference (Revanesse Ultra minus Revanesse Ultra  +) in VAS pain score of at least 
[ADDRESS_961381]. 
 
Analysis Populations:   
Intent- to-treat (ITT) (safety) population:  All randomized subjects who received study product. 
Modified intent- to-treat (mITT):  All randomized subjects who met the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, were randomized, received both study products, and had VAS pain score immediately  
post injection from both sides of the face. 
Per-protocol (PP):  All randomized subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria; received 
both study products ; completed Visit 5/Week 24 within the specified window; had data on 
pain s core from both sides of the face i mmediately post injection and at 15, 30, 45, and 
[ADDRESS_961382] injection at Visit 1/Day1; had data on pain score at [ADDRESS_961383] injection

Confidential (prior to touch -up); and ha d no significant protocol violations that would affect the treatment 
evaluation.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and PP populations.  Safety analyses will be 
performed on the ITT population. 
Efficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of responders immediately after  injection, 
where a responder is defined as a subject who  had a within- subject difference (Revanesse 
Ultra minus Revanesse Ultra  +) in VAS pain  score  of at least [ADDRESS_961384] deviation ( SD), minimum, median, and maximum 
for VAS score for each treatment and f or the within -subject difference.  The proportion of 
responders will be summarized with frequency  and percentage with  a 95% confidence interval 
(CI) constructed using a one -sample binomial exact test.  If the lower  bound of this 95% CI is 
greater than 50%, the test product will be claimed to be superior to the comparator product. 
The primary endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_707508].  
The s econdary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of responders at 15, 30, 45, and 
[ADDRESS_961385] injection (prior to touch -up).  Upon the 
significance of the primary efficacy outcome, secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a hierarchical approach will be used.  If success is achieved at 15 minutes, 30 minutes will be evaluated; if s uccess is achieved at 30 minutes, 45 minutes will be evaluated; if success is 
achieved at 45 minutes, 60 minutes will be evaluated; and if success is achieved at [ADDRESS_961386] difference. 
All efficacy analyses will be performed for both the PP and mITT populations.  For the primary endpoint, the results from mITT  are considered definitive and those from PP 
supportive. 
Safety Analysis:   
Adverse events will be coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 15.1 or higher).  
Frequency and percent of subjects reporting treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) of 
injection site reaction s will be ta bulated for each treatment by [CONTACT_73972], and further by 
[CONTACT_926].  In summaries of severity, subjects reporting more than one event in a treatment arm 
that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once in that treatment arm 
under the strongest severity.  
For other AEs where an  association with either treatment  may not be clearly identified, 
including system ic TEAEs, frequency  and percent of subjects will be tabulated to treated 
subjects as one group by  [CONTACT_234830], and further by [CONTACT_707509].  In summaries of severity and relationship, subjects who reported more than one event that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once under the strongest severity and relationship .  
Adverse events will be summarized using the ITT population.

Confidential 6 INTRODUCTION 
6.1 Background 
Revanesse Ultra + (with lidocaine, hereafter referred to as R evanesse Ultra +) is a stabilized 
hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal filler with lidocaine 0.3% w/w and Revanesse Ultra is a stabilized 
HA dermal filler .  Both products are commercially available in Canada and several European 
countries.  The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of these two products. 
Details about specific benefits and risks for subjects participating in this study  may be found in 
the Appendix  (product labeling) and consent documents for this study.   
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good C linical Practice (GCP) , and 
all applicable regulatory requirements.  
6.2 Rationale for the Study and Study Design  
This study is a randomized, double-blind prospective, comparative study of the efficacy and 
safety of Revanesse Ultra  + versus Revanesse Ultra  in the cutaneous correction of nasolabial 
folds (NLFs) .  Randomization will follow a  1:[ADDRESS_961398] differences.  Subjects 
with signs of NLFs who  meet the  entry criteria will be enrolled.  All subjects will be followed for 
efficacy and safety for 6 months.  The study design is appropriate for the indication studied.  Validated methods of data collection, analysis, and evaluation will be used. 
7 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are t o compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Revanesse Ultra + 
to Revanesse Ultra  for subjects undergoing correction of NLFs . 
8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, split- face study  in subjects seeking NLF  
correction.  Subjects will be treated with Revanesse Ultra + (test product) in the NLF  on one side 
of the face and Revanesse Ultra (comparator product) in the NL F on the other side of the face.  
The side of the face for each product will be randomly assigned.  The investigator performing the 
evaluations and the subject will be blinded to the treatment ; injections of the study product will 
be performed by [CONTACT_707510]. 
Approximately 100 subjects will be randomized at approximately 5 study sites in the United 
States (US).   Where possible, subjects currently enrolled in the ongoing retreatment study 
SYM2014-02 entitled “A Multicenter, Double-Blind, Randomized, Split- Face Study to Evaluate 
the Safety and  Efficacy of Revanesse
® Ultra versus Restylane for the Correction of Nasolabial 
Folds” (G140120) will be invited to participate in this study.  Those subjects will receive a third 
treatment with Revanesse Ultra.

Revanesse® Ultra +  [ADDRESS_961399] eval uations of the treated areas will be performed and 
recorded.  Visits will occur at: 
Visit 1/Week 0  (Day 1) – baseline and treatment  
Visit 2/Week 2 (± 2 days) – interim visit, touch -up if the iGAI score = 3 or 4  
Visit 3/Week 4 (± 2 days) – interim visit  
Visit 4/Week 12 (± 4 days) – interim visit  
Visit 5/ Week 24 (± 7 days) – End of Study  
 
Evaluations include pain assessment by a visual analog scale (VAS)  , Wrinkle Severity Rating 
Scale (WSRS) , Patient Global Aesthetic Improvement (pGAI) , and Investigator Global Aesthetic 
Improvement (iGAI) .  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902] ( AEs) at all study 
visits.   Other evaluations include the Investigator Ease of Use A ssessment.  A diary card will be 
dispensed to each enrolled subject at Visit 1/Day 1.  The subject will be instructed to complete 
the diary card to record the occurrence and extent of symptoms experienced for the first [ADDRESS_961400] is considered to be enrolled in the study when he/she  has provided written informed 
consent and has been randomized to treatment . 
A subject is considered to have completed the study after he/she has  completed  Visit 5/Week  24.   
A subject is co nsidered to have withdra wn after he/she has withdrawn consent or has been 
withdrawn  under the conditions specified in Section 8.3.3. 
A subject is considered to have been lost to follow-up if he/she cannot be contact[CONTACT_24992].  The investigator will document efforts to attempt to reach the subject twice by 
[CONTACT_94598] a certified letter before considering the subject lost to follow-up.  The 
end of participation for a subject lost to follow-up is documented as the date of the certified letter.  
Each subject will be monitored for the occurrence of AEs, including serious adverse events (SAEs), starting immediately after the subject has signed the informed consent form (ICF).  Each

If a subject is withdrawn  from the study for any reason, the End of Study or Early T ermination

Randomization will be performed according to a computer-generated randomization scheme.  The randomization scheme will be generated and maintained by [CONTACT_356604].  A sealed copy of the

Revanesse® Ultra +  [ADDRESS_961407]  
Subjects are physically masked (blindfolded) just prior to and during all injection procedures to 
prevent observation of the syringes containing study product. 
Injections of the study product are performed by [CONTACT_707511].  The 
blinded evaluator is not allowed to retrieve study supplies or to be present during opening of the study supplies or during the injections.  The injecting investigator is not to have any discussion with the blinded evaluator or subjects regarding the treatments.  
Up to a maximum of 2.0 mL (2 pre- filled syringes)  will be used per treatment on each nasolabial 
fold similar to the comparator agent based on previous studies and common clinical practice.   
The injection will be given intradermally and for best results should be injected in the 
mid- dermis.   The treatment technique and the volume per treatment should be as similar as 
possible on both sides of the face. 
For many subjects with moderate NLFs, one syringe will be adequate per NLF .  Based on the 
iGAI score at that time, a touch- up treatm ent may be administered at Visit 2/Week 2.   
For this study, topi[INVESTIGATOR_707498].  Ice may be applied before the treatment  if the 
injecting investigator deems it necessary.   The same technique should be used on both sides of 
the face.  Usin g the nondominant hand to apply gentle downward traction to the inferiormost 
aspect of the fold to immobilize it, the dominant hand is used to inject filler.  Steadying the 
injecting hand on the mandible or the other hand, the linear threading technique is most easily used to deposit the filler beneath the fold and efface it. 
The peri -alar sulcus, a triangular shaped concavity at the upper end of the fold, may be more 
effectively filled with the fanning technique of implantation, where two or three threads are 
deposited in a fan-like array.  Wide portions of the fold may require several threads placed side by [CONTACT_10167], with gentle massage after each thread is placed.  
Treatment of this area is generally easy and straightforward.  Notice that the fold is partially  
formed by [CONTACT_707512], with the fold becoming more prominent as the cheek becomes more protuberant.  Therefore, injections should stay medial to the fold to fill it.  Injecting lateral to the fold, in the excessive cheek tissue, can actually tend to accentuate the fold. 
Bruising is the most common side effect in this area and usually resolves in 5 to 7 days.  The 
facial artery runs below the fold and necrosis is possible, al though rare.

Revanesse® Ultra +  [ADDRESS_961408] before withdrawing the needle from the skin 
to avoid leakage.  Several successive “threads” below, above, or beside previous injections may 
be required to fill larger folds. 
Enter the skin with a needle angle of 30°, 45°, or parallel to the skin.  It is recommended to keep 
the needle bevel up so the tip of the needle is seen and more precisely controlled where the skin is pi[INVESTIGATOR_263186].  Keep the tip of the needle at constant depth during implantation, depositing all filler material within the same plane to get even results.  The depth of needle placement (and thus filler implantation) should be mid-dermis for NLFs, where the needle’s contour should be visible through the subject’s skin, but the needle’s color is not visible. 
After injection, manually massage the area gently to smooth out any nodular or uneven areas, 
and ensure the implanted material conforms to the contour of surrounding tissues.  Using an ice pack or other cold compress can help to mini mize swelling and alleviate post injection 
discomfort.   
The subject  should be injected so that an optimal correction is achieved.  If overcorrected, 
massage firmly between fingers or against underlying bone to obtain optimal results.  
Approximately 20% overcorrection can be massaged out; more will lead to a persistent unwanted cosmetic result.

8.9 Assessment of Safety  
8.9.1 Safety Endpoints 
Safety of the study products will be compared by [CONTACT_258827], severity, and frequency 
of treatment -emergent adverse events (TE AEs).  All AEs that occur during the study will be 
recorded whether or not they are considered to be related to treatment.  A description of the AE 
will be recorded with the date of onset, date of resolution, severity of the AE, relationship to the study product, action taken, and the outcome. 
8.9.2 Definition s of Terms   
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated wi th the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug- related (21 Code of Federal Regulations [ CFR ] 
312.32 (a)).  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disea se temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
Expected adverse events are defined as th e events that  appeared at injection site subsequent to 
the first injection.  Expected adverse events may include but are not limited to bruising, swelling, 
erythema, edema, inflammation at injection site.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is  defined as any AE for which there is reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the AE (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).

Confidential [IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if it is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the labeling for the  study products. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any AE or SAR that, in the view of the investigator or sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes (21 CFR 312.32 (a)): 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE (Note: the term “life -threatening” as used here refers to an event that 
in the view of the investigator or sponsor places the subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not include an AE or SAE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death [21 CFR 312.32(a)]) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Any “other” important medical even t.  Important medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical interven tion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Planned Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110156] a therapeutic intervention and not the result of a new SAE and should be recorded as medical history.  If the planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187379], the record in the subject’s medical history is considered complete.  However, if the event/condition worsens during the study, it must be reported as an AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy 
Pregnancies occurring after the administration of study product require immediate reporting.  
They must be reported within [ADDRESS_961435] a follow-up Pregnancy Report with any relevant information to Symbio.

spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investi gator will 
report the event by [CONTACT_29658] a completed SAE report form to Symbio within [ADDRESS_961436] should immediately be withdrawn from the study.   [IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring 
8.9.[ADDRESS_961437] will be followed for safety monitoring until discharged from 
the study.  Follow-up procedures related to pregnancy or AEs or SAEs may continue beyond the 
end of the study. 
Subjects will be questioned and/or examined by [CONTACT_1720] a qualified designee for 
occurrence of AEs  throughout the study.  The presence or  absence of specific AEs should not be 
elicited from subjects.   In addition, subjects will be instructed to record AEs on the subject diary 
card during the [ADDRESS_961438]’s source documentation.   For all AEs that require the subject to be withdrawn from the study and SAEs, relevant clinical 
assessments and laboratory tests will be repe ated as clinically appropriate until final resolution or 
stabilization of the event(s).  
8.9.4 Assessment of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Severity 
Severity of AEs will be graded according to the following definitions: 
Mild :  AE that was easily tole rated  
Moderate : AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity  
Severe : AE that pre vented normal daily activities  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Causality 
A medically -qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE (including SAEs) to 
the use of the study product, as unlikely related, possibly related, or probably related, based on 
available information, using the following guidelines:   
Unlikely related:   no temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified, 
or the drug, biological, or device cannot be implicated based on available information 
Possibly related:   temporal association but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; 
however, involvement of the drug, biological, or device cannot be excluded based on 
available information

8.10 Criteria for Early Termination of the Study  
The trial  may be termin ated because of safety concerns. Where termination is deemed 
appropriate, there will be timely  communication with FDA in accordance with the regulation  
(21 CFR 812.150 (devices)). The  sponsor , Prollenium Medical Technologies, will initiate 
discussion as soon as possible about t he appropriate course of action  for the trial in question and 
for the investigational product. There will be immediate follow up by [CONTACT_707523].  
The clinical study may be stopped if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of emerging 
effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population as a whole is  
unacceptable.  In the event of an unanticipated serious adverse event or death, the sponsor, 
Prollenium Medical, will submit to the agency,  and to the reviewing IRB , a report as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the investigator / sponsor first learns of the effect.  Thereafter the sponsor shall submit such additional reports concerning the effect as 
FDA requests .  
The following conditions are considered as cause for termination of the study: 
Any death related to the study treatment  
Unanticipated treatment emergent related AEs  reported as severe in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_707500] > 7 of the subjects 
Unanticipated treatment emergent related AEs reported as moderate in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_707500] > 43 of the subjects  
 
Unanticipated t reatment emergent related AEs reported as mild in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_707501] 14 days in > 98 of the subjects 
 
Duration of AEs lasting more than 4 weeks 
Increased incidence of Phy sician diagnosed unexpected AEs 
Increased occurrence of extreme swelling of the face, hypersensitivity 
reactions/anaphylaxis  
Anticipated Adverse Effects:  Injection -related reactions might occur, such as transient erythema, 
swelling, pain, itching, discoloration, or tenderness at the injection s ite.  These reactions may last 
for [ADDRESS_961451] consisted of prolonged erythema,  swelling, and induration at the implant site.

Confidential Unanticipated adverse events related to the injection will be evaluated as they occur by [CONTACT_707524] (the
se may include injection site adverse events not listed above, such as 
hyperpig
mentation, pru
ritus, papule, burning, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and injection s ite scab). These 
events will be evaluated based on their severity and duration, and if deemed necessary, the study will be stopped. 
Any serious adverse ev
ent, and / or systemic response, or condition, that requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_707502], in particular those deemed related to the injection, will be evaluated based 
on their severity and duration, and if deemed necessary, the study will be stopped. All reported events will be reviewed on a weekly basis during the clinical study team meeting.  
In addition, further recruitment in the study or at (a) particular site(s) may be stopped due to 
insufficient compliance with the protocol, GCP, and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure-related problems, or the number of discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high.  
9 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Prior to the database lock, a detailed, finalized Statistical Analysis Plan will be completed and 
placed on file.  The Statistical Analysis Plan will contain a more comprehensive explanation  than 
that provided here of the methodology used in the stati stical analyses, as well as  the rules and 
data handling conventions used to perform the analyses and the procedure used to  account for 
missing data.  
9.1 Analysis Populations 
Three populations are defined for the analyses. 
• Intent- to-treat (ITT) (safety population):  All randomized subjects who received study 
product. 
• Modified intent- to-treat (mITT):  All randomized subjects who met the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were randomized, received both study products, and returned for at least [ADDRESS_961452] injection from both 
sides of the face.    
• Per-protocol (PP):  All randomized subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria; 
received both study products ; completed Visit 5/Week 24 within the specified window; 
had data on pain  score from both sides of the face  immediately post injection  and at 15, 
30, 45, and [ADDRESS_961453] injection at Visit 1/Day1; had data on pain score at [ADDRESS_961454] injection  (prior to touch-up); and had no significant protocol violations that would 
affect the treatment evaluation.  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the mITT and PP populations.  Safety analyses will be performed on the ITT population. 
9.2 General Considerations  
Two-sided hypothesis testing will be conducted for all tests.  Resulting p -values less than  0.05 
will be considered statistically significant unless noted otherwise.  No adjustments of p- values

Revanesse® Ultra +  08 July  2016 
 
Confidential for multiple comparisons will be made.  SAS software (version 9.1.3) will be used for all data 
analyses and tabulations. 
Missing efficacy data will be imputed via the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method in 
the mITT analysis. For the PP population, efficacy analysis will be performed using all the available data without imputation for the missing values.  
For demographic and baseline characteristics and the safety profile, each variable will be analyzed using the existing data. Subjects with missing data will be excluded only from the analyses for which data are not available.  
9.3 Comparability of Subjects at Baseline (or Demographics, Medical History, Baseline Characteristics, and Concomitant Medications) 
Baseline and demographic characteristic variables  (including date of birth, sex, race, ethnicity, 
and Fitzpatrick skin type) will be tabulated using descriptive statistics. For each continuous variable, the summary will include the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  For each categorical variable, the summary will include frequencies and perce ntages.  
9.[ADDRESS_961455] difference (Revanesse Ultra minus 
Revanesse Ultra  +) in VAS pain scor e of at least [ADDRESS_961456] 
deviation ( SD), minimum, median, and maximum.  The proportion of responders will be 
summarized with  frequency  and percentage.  A 95% CI for proportion of responders will be 
constructed using a one- sample binomial exact test.  If the lower  bound of this 95% CI is greater 
than 50%, the t est product will be claimed to be superior to the c omparator product.  The primary 
endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_707508].  
The s econdary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of responders at 15, 30, 45, and [ADDRESS_961457] injection (prior to touch-up).  Upon the significance of the primary efficacy outcome, secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a hierarchical approach will be used.  If success is achieved at 15 minutes, 30 minutes will be evaluated; if success is achieved at 30 minutes, 45 minutes will be evaluated; if success is achieved at 45 minutes, 60 minutes will be evaluated ; and if success is achieved at [ADDRESS_961458] difference . 
All efficacy analyses will be performed for both the PP and mITT populations.  For the primary endpoint, the results from mITT  are considered definitive and those from PP supportive. 
9.4.1 Handling of Missing Data  
There will not be missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint for the mITT and PP  based on 
the definitions of these analysis populations ( Section 9.1).

Revanesse® Ultra +  08 July  2016 
 
Confidential For the mITT analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints, missing VAS scores will be replaced 
using the multiple imputation (MI) method.  To evaluate the robustness of MI method, subjects 
with missing VAS scores will be considered in two different ways: (1) as non-responders to the test product (worse case scenario), and (2) as responders to the test product (best case scenario).  
Other efficacy endpoints will be tabulated using the observed data; no missing values will be replaced in the analyses.  
9.4.[ADDRESS_961459] completed Visit 3 or discontinued prior to 
Visit 3.  The purpose is to determine the safety and pain relief of Revanes se Ultra  + to support 
regulatory submissions outside the US that are currently under review for products containing lidocaine. The sponsor does not plan to change the protocol or stop the study based on the results of the interim analysis.  
To maintain the integrity of the study, there will be a separate Statistical Analysis Plan for the 
interim analysis.  The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_707525]- to-day trial activities.  Access to the interim analysis results will be strictly 
limited to people who are not directly involved in the study conduct. 
Because no change in the study conduct is planned based on the results of the interim analysis, 
the Haybittle -Peto method will be used to guard the overall Type 1 error rate, with a 0.001 level 
of significance for the interim analysis and a 0.05 level of significance for the final analysis.  
9.5 Safety Analyses 
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 15.1 or higher).  
TEAEs are defined as events that appear subsequent to the first injection or that were present  
prior to the first injection but worsened in intensity after the first injection.  TEAEs may include, 
but are not limited to, injection site bruising, injection site discoloration, injection site edema, injection site erythema, injection site inflammation, injection site pain, and injection site swelling.  
Frequency and percent of subjects reporting TEAEs of injection site reaction s will be tabulated 
for ea ch treatment by [CONTACT_73972], and further by [CONTACT_926].  In summaries of severity, subjects 
who reported more than one event in a treatment arm that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once in that treatment arm under the strongest severity.  
For other AEs where an  association with either treatment may not be clearly identified, including 
systemic TEAEs, frequency and percent of subjects will be tabulated to treated subjects as one 
group by [CONTACT_234830], an d further by [CONTACT_707526].  In summaries of severity and relationship, subjects who reported more than one 
event that are mapped to the same preferred term will be counted only once under the strongest severity and relationship.  
Adverse events will be summarized using the ITT population. SAEs will be discussed within the clinical study report.  Data collected pertaining to SAEs  will 
be presented in data listings.

STUDY AIM:  
To evaluate  the ability  of an intra-oral imaging  device  to assess  the level of gingival  inflammation  
present  and the process  of resolution  using a localized  experimentally  induced  gingivitis  model . 
 
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:  
This project is significant for public health because it aims to  validate a non -invasive imagining  
examination for determining gingival (gum) inflammation. Given that t he prevalence of gingivitis in the 
US population is greater than 50%, and that gingivitis can progress to periodontitis and tooth loss if left 
untreated, the proposed non -invasive imaging method can be an invaluable asset in clinicians' quivers 
for the ear ly prevention of this prevalent disease.   
  
STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a modification of classical experimental gingivitis model.  The study will prospectively enroll 
subjects and a maxillary sextant to an intervention, while the other sextant will serve as  control in a split -
mouth design of  localized experimental gingivitis, utilizing localized stent -induced biofilm overgrowth 
model (SIBO). The intervention will consist of cessation of oral hygiene versus an active control of oral 
hygiene with a fluoridated  toothpaste that will be provided by [CONTACT_473]. The intervention, i.e. oral 
hygiene cessation will manipulate the participants’ oral environment by [CONTACT_321517].  This is a well established protocol tha t was first introduced in 1965 
(Loe’s experimental gingivitis) and is safe, reliable and widely utilized in periodontal clinical trials. The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of oral hygiene cessation in the gingival tissues by [CONTACT_321518]-invasive microimaging technique, i.e. OCT . 
 
The study will include the following phases – 1) Hygiene phase of 2  weeks; 2)  Gingivitis induction phase  
with stent lasting up to 2 weeks; and 3) Resolution phase of 2 weeks. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_321508] 15  
generally healthy adults aged 18 -35 years that are self -referred or referred to the UW School of 
Dentistry. Recruitment will be completed in 3 waves. The study will include an oral health history review, 
probing  depths, plaque & gingival evaluati ons, biospecimens collection  and imaging of the  buccal 
gingiva of teeth #[ADDRESS_396803] at the UW School of De ntistry, or referred. All study 
participants will undergo informed consent process, prior to e nrollment in the study. Categorization of  
participants and sites will be based on the clinical assessments. Other than the study -related oral health  
history recorded, there is no intention to obtain information from the participants’ other dental or  medica l 
records. The first participant will be assigned a number, and all the following subjects will be  assigned 
consecutive numbers by [CONTACT_321519].

METHODS  
Induced Gingivitis Model  
In each participant, one maxillary quadrant will be assigned as test quadrant (experimental  gingivitis) 
and contralateral quadrant as control quadrant . Assignment of quadrants wi ll be random  using a 
computer program for randomization.  
 
At the initial visit all participants will  undergo the informed consent process, with thorough discussion of 
study participation details. Full clinical assessments , biospecimen collections  and imag ing will be 
performed and maxillary impression will be  taken for acrylic stent. Maxillary a crylic stents will be 
fabricated to cover teeth on test quadrant  extending at least [ADDRESS_396804] baseline measurements and bio specimen 
collections taken. These measurements  include an abbreviated health assessment with a periodontal 
probe to measure pocket depths, gingival and plaque ind ex and Imaging of the buccal gingival  on eight  
maxillary teeth (#’s 5 -12), and collect ion of  crevicular fluid and plaque samples37. 
 
At the baseline visit the acrylic stent will 
be given to participant with detailed 
instructions for use.  Participants will be 
given instructions not to brush teeth on 
test quadra nt (under the provided stent ) 
and not to use any other measure of oral 
hygiene (flossing, interdental aids , xylitol 
gum,  and mouth rinses) . Participants will 
be provided with Colgate Cavity 
Protection  Toothpaste and a  soft bristle 
toothbrush to use during their entire 
participation in this stu dy. In order to 
prevent  accidental brushing of the 
experimental sites, subjects will be 
asked to wear the maxillary stent  during 
regular brushing. Participants will be

  rechecked at Day 2, 4, 7 & 14  and a full assessment of their  plaque and gingival status will be carried 
out, specimens collected , and imaging performed  each time using the same  criteria as at the baseline 
examination . The course of the "no -brushing" part of the experiment  will last up to 14 days to allow all 
the participants to develop gingiv itis. Following clinical assessment and b iospecimen collections at day 
14, a thorough prophylaxis will be administered .  
 
Participants will be  given detailed instructions in oral hygiene methods using a  manual toothbrush  and 
Colgate Cavity protection tooth paste. Subjects will also use dental floss begi nning the same day and 
continuing  once in the  morning and once at night for the duration of the study.  Assessment of plaque 
and gingival  condition  along with imaging  will continue during the entire reversal pha se, Day 21 and Day 
28. At a point where the Gingival Index  and Plaque Index scores approach zero (approximately day 28 ), 
all measurements and  biospecimen samples will be taken , along with imaging  and that visit will be 
recorded as end -of-study.  
 
 
 
Medical imaging device  
The medical imaging device is a home -built multi -functional OCT system (MI -OCT), which is also 
illustrated in Figure1. The functionality of the system includes:  
 Anatomical structure imaging (OCT)  
 Functional angiography (OCTA)  
 Molecular imagi ng: Red and green autofluorescence imaging (MI)  
The components of the system include:  
 A laser light source (NIR, 1300nm peak, 100nm bandwidth, peak power 3.5mW)  
 Optical components that transmit OCT light beam into biological tissue, including: optical fibe r 
and optics table, galvanometer mirror scanners, and several other optics components (lenses, 
dichroic mirrors, prism, etc.)  
 CMOS camera for molecular imaging (MI)  
 An excitation light source in violet -near UVA wavelength (405±5 nm)  
 A computer and monitor for real -time imaging display, data processing, and data analysis.  
The home -built MI -OCT device include OCT module, which is similar to commercially FDA approved 
OCT devices, and was also approved by [CONTACT_3016] ‘Non -Significant’ risk for skin imaging (IRB No. 
[ZIP_CODE]) and for periodontal imaging (IRB No. 2827). The difference between MI -OCT and the 
aforementioned units are:  
 Violet -near UVA excitation light source (LED ring, 405±5 nm wavelength). CMOS 3 -channel 
red-green -blue camera with added optics (optical filter, lenses, etc.)  
 Wiring and cable harness, providing power to the LED ring and CMOS camera  
Although the wavelength is within the visible spectrum and the LED ring is operated at lower power level 
(25mW, radiating over a surface of 10×10cm2, which yiel ds 0.25 mW/cm2), participants will be given 
UVA-protective goggles to reduce the risk of exposure to possible residual UVA emissions from the 
LED. The length of exposure will also be limited to maximum 15 minutes in the MI mode (2 minutes for 
each scanning  sites, total 6 scan sites)

Imaging procedure  
Participants will be instructed to wear a dental retractor to expose the maxillary  incisors , canines, and 1st 
bicuspi[INVESTIGATOR_321509]. The scanning protocols for each scan -site (6 in total) are as followed:  
 Positioning: particip ants will be asked to rest their chins on the chin -rest of the stable frame. 
They will also be asked to bite on the bite bar (Figure 1c) during the whole scanning procedure. 
Operator will re -position the scanning probe for each scan -site. This step takes a pproximately 1 
to 3 minutes for each scan -site. 
 Real-time autofluorescence imaging and registration: participants will be exposed to 405nm 
excitation light source for approximately 2 minutes; autofluorescence images are captured and 
addition registration ( re-positioning of the probe) is performed when needed. This step takes 
approximately 2 -3 minutes  
 OCT scan: participants will be asked to stay particularly still in this step. The scan will be 
performed within a window of less than [ADDRESS_396805] health -related 
biomedical outcomes (i.e. gingival index and gingival crev icular fluid volume).  
 
Abbreviated periodontal health assessment  
Clinical data will be documented based on probing depth (PD), visible plaque index (VPI), gingival index 
(GI) and bleeding on probing (BOP) 38.  All clinical measurement will be  conducted us ing a manual 
periodontal probe. BOP will be recorded within [ADDRESS_396806] and c ontrol quadrant: first premolar – central incisor . For each tooth, all  
measurements and biospecimen collect ion will be taken on mesiobuccal and mesiopalatal surfaces.  
Staggering of sites (mesiobuccal & mesiodistal) will be performed for plaque collection.  
 
Visible Plaque Index  
The surfaces of the study teeth will be scored and given eithe r a “0” no plaque or “ 1” plaque 
assessment:  
0 = No plaque  
1 = Visible Plaque  
 
 
Protocol Number  CRO -2018 -06-EXG -JG 
Confidential  
  
 
 
  Loe and Silness Gingival Index (GI)  
The surfaces of the study teeth will be evaluated using light air and a peri odontal probe. A score is given 
based on the following scale:  
0 = Normal gingiva  
1 = Mi ld inflammation, slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding on probing  
2 = Moderate inflammation, moderate glazing, redness, bleeding on probing  
3 = Severe inflammation, marked redness and hypertrophy, ulce ration, tendency to spontaneous 
bleeding  
 
Gingival Crevicular Fluid (GCF) collection  
Prior to GCF collection the plaque index will be recorded. The sites to b e sampled will be isolated with 
cotton rolls and gently air -dried. GCF samples will be collected with sterile paper strips (Periopaper  
strips , Oraflow Inc.) that will be inserted into the gingival crevice until mild resistance is felt and left in  
place for 30 seconds.  
 
Amount of GCF samples collected will be quantified with a Periotron 6000 (Oraflow, Inc.) and will be  
expressed in microliter.39 GCF will be collected from the mesiobuccal and mesiopalatal surfaces of 
teeth  #’s 5 - 12. Paper strips visibly contaminated with saliva and blood will be excluded from the  study. 
All samples will be collected in micro centrifuge  tubes. They will be transpo rted on ice and stored  within 
24 hours at -80oC until processing.  
 
Plaque collection  
Sub-gingival plaque will be collected using sterile paper points inserted  in the gingival sulcus for 30s 
from the mesiobuccal and mesiodistal surfaces of teeth #’s5 - 12. Pl aque samples will be  placed in micro 
centrifuge  tubes then transported on ice to -80oC freezer in lab.  
 
Analysis of GCF chemokines  
GCF samples will undergo assay of [ADDRESS_396807] of chemoki ne will be analyzed: angiopoietin -1, vascular endothelial growth factor, and 
hypoxia -inducible factor [ADDRESS_396808] all been shown to 
contribute to angiogenesis and possibly homeostasis in gingival tissue.  Commercially av ailable ELISA 
kits will determine the concentration of Myeloperoxidase (MPO).  
 
Analysis of microbial composition  
Plaque samples will be stored in the Periodontics Repository for future studies. The samples will not be 
analyzed as part of this study.  
 
Imagi ng 
1) Autofluorescence imaging  
Autofluorescence images are captured and analyzed for two purposes:  
a. Plaque (biofilm) detection (red autofluorescence)  
b. Enamel absorption and anomalies (green autofluorescence)  
The images are registered in each subsequent visit. This registration step allows observation on the 
progression of a) plaque and b) tissues response over the whole study period.  
 
2) OCT and OCTA  
Data is captured for each visit and is analyzed off -line. The following features are extracted and 
monitored:  
a. The r ete-ridges structure (OCT) in free gingiva. During inflammation, the rete -ridges 
layer becomes thinner and is replaced by [CONTACT_321520].  
b. The depth of the free gingiva (OCT+OCTA), which is defined by a line joining: i) the

  surface of the gingiva, ii) p rojected perpendicular to the gingival sulcus line, and iii) passing 
through the point where connective blood vessels in free/attached gingiva disappear  
c. The vasculature (OCTA) in the free gingiva.  
d. Possible changes in other morphology (reserved for explora tory parameters).  
 
Recovery and Termination from the Study  
All subjects will be evaluated weekly during induction phase. In the case that participants develop GI 
score 3 in 25% or more of their experimental teeth, they will be immediately moved to the reso lution 
phase. Otherwise the participants  will finish the full  induction phase and then be moved into resolution 
phase. All subjects will be followed until gingivitis condition is completely resolved, beyond the two 
weeks period if necessary. If any partici pants have persistent gingivitis that does not resolve, they will be 
referred to the Graduate Periodontics Clinic at the University of Washington School of Dentistry.  
 
Tooth Stent  Construction  
 An alginate impression will be taken of one maxillary quadrant  of each subject for the 
construction of an individual toothshield stent for use during the tri al period.  The quadrant will be 
randomly selected . A working model cast will be  prepared immediately from the impression using dental 
stone and labeled with the  subject's ID.  After  curing for an hour, the cast will be  removed from the 
impression mold, trimmed to the desired shape and size, then dried at room temperature overnight.  
 The toothshield  stent s will be  constructed from [ADDRESS_396809] of the clinical crowns, following the contour of 
the gingivae; removed from the cast; and trimmed with scissors to ~2 mm above the gingival margin.  
The 1 -mm-thick spacer is placed on the mo del; coated with silicone spray; then the [ADDRESS_396810]'s ID and the date of preparation i s affixed to the buccal surface, and then  1-
mm-thick mouthguard material is vacuum -adapted over the toothshield and trimmed to the original 
contours.  The shields are prepared prior to the prophylaxis, chemically disinfected, and packed in 
individual plast ic bags with each subject's name.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Multiple sites within each subject will be evaluated using a Gingival Bleeding Index at baseline and 
subsequent timepoints  during clinical exams. The gingivitis bleeding scores will be averaged t o provide 
a mean score per subject for each exam period.   Product means and standard deviations will be 
calculated for each time period.  Analysis of Variance techniques (possibly including Analysis of 
Covariance using the baseline scores as the covariant)  will be used to compare the difference between 
the two test treatments using the 95% confidence level (p ≤ 0.05).   
 
Based upon our initial study the selection of [ADDRESS_396811] 
planned for 3 waves to reach the final sample size N=15.

  REPORT OF ADVERSE REACTIONS  
 
Subjects will be told of any possible adverse reactions or sid e effects from lack of  oral hygiene  and stent  
use, i.e. oral irritation.  At the all clinic visits/examinations each participant will be asked if they have 
experienced any discomfort or oral irritation.  In addition, all subjects will be examined for signs of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_112931] (sloughing) and discoloration of the teeth and/or tongue. The investigators will 
record any and all adverse reactions.  If the evidence indicates that the adverse reaction may be due to 
lack of oral hygiene , the subject will be instructed to resume oral hygiene  and ap propriate treatment will 
be provided.  If an adverse event occurs it is expected to be mild and abate (stop) when oral hygiene is 
resumed .  In the event of an adverse experience, emergency or other prob lems or questions regarding 
participation in this stud y subjects will be advised to  contact [CONTACT_321521](s):

Definitions  
Adverse Events (AEs) and Seriou s Adverse Events (SAEs) are defined by [CONTACT_321522] (ICH GCP) as follows:  
 
Adverse Event:   Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigations subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicin al product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
 
AEs include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status, after enrolled and 
signing an Informed Consent Form.  The AE may involve any organs or systems and  can be 
represented by [CONTACT_92941] a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physical 
sign, as well as by [CONTACT_321523].  Any medically 
relevant and untoward change from baseline,  including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating 
condition (e.g., migraine), occurring after the first administration of study medication is an adverse 
event.  All such occurrences must be recorded and reported accordingly, whether they appear cau sally 
related to the study medication, or not.  
 
Serious Adverse Event : Any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life threatening adverse event  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing hospit alization  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse experience when, based upon  appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Examples of such important medical events include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Protocol Number  CRO -2018 -06-EXG -JG 
Confidential  
  
 
 
   
IMPORTANT NOTES : The concepts of Adverse Event / Experience1 (AE) and Serious Adverse Event / 
Experience (SAE) represent regulatory  instruments used to evaluate and monitor the safety of clinical 
trial subjects.  Therefore, these terms only apply in light of their regulatory definition.  The term 
“serious”, in a r egulatory sense, does not necessarily mean “severe”.  All adverse events (serious and 
non-serious) reported during a study will be taken into account when analyzing the study data and 
establishing the safety profile of the investigation , and will be includ ed in the final study report.  The SAE 
concept is primarily used to identify, during the conduct of the trial, those adverse events that may 
require an expedited reporting procedure to regulatory authorities.  
 
Death : The outcome of death requires that the AE that resulted in death be reported as an SAE.  Death, 
in and of itself, is not an AE; it is only an outcome.  The cause  of death is the AE; therefore, the 
investigator should make every effort to obtain and document the cause of death for all subjects w ho die 
during the study.  If, despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], the cause of death remains unknown, the AE it should be 
documented as “unspecified fatal event”.  
 
Life-threatening Adverse Event :  Any adverse event that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred ( i.e., it does not include a 
reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:   It should be noted that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], in and of itsel f, does not represent an 
SAE.  It is the adverse event leading to the subject’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40541] “serious” 
when it requires inpatient care.  Consequently, SAE should not be reported in case of pre -
planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643] -existing condi tions that did not worsen during the study.  
 
Disability : A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
 
Documenting and Reporting Adverse Events  
 
General Procedures for All Adverse Events  
All clinical complaints, symptoms , or signs that meet the adverse event definition will be recorded on the 
Adverse Reaction Form using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. 
 Source documentation should be maintained that allows for clear identification  of each adverse event 
and the following parameters required for the form:  
 AE description  
 Date of onset  
 Date of resolution  
 Outcome  
 Severity  
 Seriousness  
 Relationship to study drug (causality)  
 Actions taken  
 
Adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_20616] r or designee for seve rity, relationship to the study 
intervention , possible etiologies, and whether the event meets the criteria as a serious adverse event 
and therefore requires immediate notification of the sponsor.  
 
For data collection purposes, the ou tcome of all adverse events recorded on the Adverse Reaction 
Form will be designated as of the completion of the final evaluation or examination.  However, the 
investigator is responsible for following all adverse events until resolution or until no longer  of clinical 
concern, and providing these data to the sponsor.  
                     
  
Protocol Number  CRO -[ADDRESS_396813] be re ported via telephone to the sponsor’s representative 
immediately (within 24 hours) so as to facilitate discussion and implementation of necessary follow -up 
measures, and to enable the sponsor to submit necessary reports to regulatory authorities and other 
investigators.  Following the initial telephone notification, the investigator must complete and submit a 
Serious Adverse Event Report Form to the sponsor within five calendar days.  Serious Adverse Event  
Report Forms will be provided to the investigator upon initiation of the study.  Once the sponsor reviews 
the Serious Adverse Event Report Form, additional information may be requested from the investigator 
to allow appropriate medical evaluation and determine the regulatory reporting requirements.  
The in vestigator is responsible for following all adverse events, especially those deemed  “serious”, until 
resolution or until the event is no longer of clinical concern, and for providing these data to the sponsor 
in an agreed -upon format.  The investigator is  also responsible for reporting all serious adverse events 
to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) overseeing the conduct of the study at the respective study 
center, according to the rules and procedures established by [CONTACT_1201].  
 
COMPENSATION  
Participant s in this study  will receive up to $ 500 in gift cards for their participation. A $[ADDRESS_396814] will be  
given at the end of  each  visit, and subjects who attended all study visits will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_396815] at the final visit (28 -day visit) . Payment will be prorated for visits attended only . No therapeutic 
or other benefit will be received by [CONTACT_6231].

  ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
 
Curriculum Vitae  
The investigator will complete the FDA form 1572 and provide the sponsor with copi[INVESTIGATOR_321512]/her 
curriculum vitae and those of all sub -investigators listed on the form, at sponsor’s request.  
 
Data colle ction in the case report form  
All study data will be recorded in the case report form supplied by [CONTACT_456].  All entries will be written 
clearly in black ink.  Only the principal investigator, sub -investigators, or study coordinators may make 
entries in  the case report forms.  If erroneous data are entered on the case report forms, corrections to 
the data must be made by [CONTACT_321529] a single line (such that the initial entry 
remains legible) and entering the correction.  All cor rections on a case report form will be initialed and 
dated by [CONTACT_093], sub -investigator, or study coordinator making the correction.  
 
Documentation of Consent and storage of study documents   
All informed consent forms will be documented in a log b y date and subject ID; the log will be kept as 
source documentation.  Informed consent forms will be stored in a secure locked room designated for 
research charts storage.  
 
Study Management   
Under the direct supervision of the Principal Investigator, certa in duties may be delegated during the 
course of the study. These responsibilities will be documented on the Transfer of Responsibilities form 
maintained in the Investigator’s clinical file for the study.  
 
Study monitoring  
Appropriate phone calls or visits will be made by [CONTACT_321530], as well as 
to discuss the obligations of both the sponsor and the investigator.  
 
The investigator will permit a representative of the sponsor or the sponsor's designate and the FDA, if 
requested, to inspect all case report forms and corresponding portions of the study subjects' original 
office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or clinic medical records at re gular intervals throughout the study. These inspections 
are for the purpose of assessing the progress of the study, verifying adherence to the protocol, 
determining the completeness and exactness of the data being entered on the case report  forms .  
During on-site visits, case report forms will be examined by [CONTACT_11200](s) and the data verified by 
[CONTACT_321531] (such as clinic, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3491]/or office records).  Due to the 
geographic distance of the clinical site from the sp onsor, phone conferences or teleconferences may be 
used to complete the monitoring requirement.  
 
Final Report  
Following the completion of the study, the Investigator shall prepare a final study report. The final report 
will include a general description of  the conduct of the study including protocol deviations, subject 
withdrawals, discussion of any adverse events, safety and efficacy data, laboratory data, and statistical 
analysis of the data if available. This report will be approved and signed by [CONTACT_321532].  
 
Record Retention  and Access to Source Data/Documents  
Source documents must be kept for at least  six (6)  years after terminating the study. The Investigator

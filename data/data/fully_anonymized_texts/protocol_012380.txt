2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
BOTOX was first approved for aesthetic treatment of glabellar lines in 2001, lateral canthal lines (crow's 
feet lines) in 2013, and forehead lines in 2017.  BOTOX is one of the most common nonsurgical 
procedures in aesthetic medicine1.
 the medical literature has described the use of BOTOX to improve the 
appearance of the lower face and neck2,3.  Numerous publications specifically report the use of BOTOX 
to improve the appearance of the lower face by [CONTACT_368856]. 
The platysma muscle complex is composed of [ADDRESS_461806] over both sides of the neck, crossing over the 
mandibular border and inserting into the overlying skin of the neck and lower face.  When relaxed, the 
platysma muscle smoothly drapes the jawline, neck, and clavicle to create a firm, fitted, and uniform 
appearance ( Figure 1).

Allergan sponsored a Phase 2 study (1936 -201-008) designed to evaluate BOTOX for the treatment of 
platysma prominence.  This was a 4 -month, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
dose -ranging study, comparing the efficacy and safety between a single treatment of BOTOX high dose 
 or BOTOX low dose versus placebo in 171 subjects with moderate to severe 
platysma prominence.
Subjects were adults ≥[ADDRESS_461807] using 
Allergan's platysma prominence scales.  Subjects were excluded from the study if they  
had increased medical risk with exposure to BOTOX.  Subjects received a single treatment at baseline 
(Day 1) and were followed fo r approximately 120 days.
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, ≥ 1-grade improvement from baseline in platysma 
prominence severity at Day 14, assessed independently by [CONTACT_368857]
(C-APPS) and Participant Allergan Platysma Prominence Scale (P-APPS), respectively, were achieved.  
Both high and low dose BOTOX results were statistically significant compared with placebo (p <0.0001).  
Similar results were observed with other study endpoints, which included patient repo rted outcome 
(PRO) measures  corroborating the C -APPS and P -APPS data.  
The safety profile observed was consistent with that reported in the medical literature and with the 
known pharmacological effects of BOTOX.  The most frequently reported AEs related to the study 
procedure were balanced across all treatment groups and included injection site hemorrhage (6/169, 
3.6%) and injection site bruising (11/169, 6.5%).   
 
 
 
While [COMPANY_013] does not consider coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) to be a safety concern for BOTOX 
due to its mechanism of action an d route of administration, the sponsor is monitoring COVID -19 events 
during the pandemic closely.  A recent review of COVID -19 events for the periodic safety update report 
(PSUR)  did not identify any new o r significant 
safety findings for the subjects receiving BOTOX treatment.  Overall, the clinical course and presentation 
of patients with COVID -19 infection coincident with BOTOX is consistent with what has been described 
for the general population.
Consid ering the COVID -19 pandemic, based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to 
study participants is anticipated with the use of BOTOX.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current 
BOTO X Investigator's Brochure.

3.1 Objectives, Hypotheses, and Estimands
The study objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of BOTOX with placebo for the treatment of 
platysma prominence in adult subjects with moderate to severe pla tysma prominence at maximum 
contraction.
The clinical hypothesis is that BOTOX is a safe and effective treatment for the temporary improvement 
in the appearance associated with moderate to severe platysma prominence in adults.
Estimands: Primary Endpoints
The attributes of the estimands corresponding to the primary efficacy endpoints are summarized in 
Table 1.

  Eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 in a 1:1 ratio to receive BOTOX or 
placebo.  
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized at up to 35 global study sites.  
 
  
Seven scheduled visits are planned: screening (Day -14 to Day -7), randomization/study drug (Day 1), 
follow -up visits (Days 14, 30, 60, 90), and study exit (Day 120).  On Day 1, the study drug will be 
administered in the platysma muscle.  Dosing will be determined based on the baseline C -APPS score on 
Day 1 (see Section 5.7).
The schematic of the study is shown in Figure 2.   
Figure 2. Study Schematic
4.2 Discussion of Study Design
Choice of Contr ol Group
Placebo was chosen as a control because there are no FDA -approved drugs for platysma prominence.
Appropriateness of Measurements
The primary efficacy measure used in this study (C -APPS) was developed and validated by [CONTACT_368858].  Allergan also developed 
and validated PROs for this program in accordance with global recommendations set forth by [CONTACT_368859] 18 of 73

Possible distant spread of toxin (PDSOT) is defined as a possible pharmacologic effect of botulin um toxin 
at sites noncontiguous and distant from the site of injection.  Utilizing a standardized methodology to 
assess for PDSOT, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities PTs that may be associated with 
botulinum toxin effects have been prospectively identified

Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1 ratio yielding approximately 
200 subjects in the BOTOX group and 200 subjects in th e placebo group in the treatment period.  
 
For the US FDA primary analysis, an estimated sample size of 360 subjects will give a power of greater 
than 99% to detect a difference in responder rat es between the BOTOX and placebo groups, assuming a 
10% dropout rate by [CONTACT_2006] 14. 
 
 
The primary analysis for EU regulatory agencies only will be performed on the mITT population,  
  
 a sample size of 180 will 
result in a power of greater than 99% to detect a difference between BOTOX and placebo in the 
proportion of subjects achieving at least a 2 -grade improvement from baseline according to both 
investigator's assessment using C -APPS and subje ct's self -assessment using P -APPS at maximum 
contraction at Day [ADDRESS_461826] of independent proportions, as implemented in the commercial software nQuery

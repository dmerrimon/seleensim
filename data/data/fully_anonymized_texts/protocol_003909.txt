biomarkers of exposure and harm in diverse smokers  
Co- Investigator(s): Nicole Nollen, PhD; Matthew Mayo, PhD  
I. Purpose, Background and Rationale
A.Aim and Hypotheses
1.E-cigarettes (ECs) are projected to exceed combustible cigarette use within two years.
Policy makers, health officials, and regulators are concerned that newer nicotine salt -
based E cs that use high concentrations of nicotine in their e -liquids are a major reason
for this rapid growth in use. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has regulatory
authority to set appropriate tobacco product standards to protect public health and has
shown interest in exploring a product standard limiting the level of nicotine in e -liquids.
While this regulatory consideration has merit, emerging research suggests it may be
misguided, leading to a product that is just as addictive but more harmful. Specifically,
among users of earlier, freebase nicotine E cs (i.e., cig -a-like, tank systems), use of low
nicotine e -liquids was associated with a [ADDRESS_519502] of low versus high nicotine concentration e -
liquids on a smokers’ ability to completely switch to E cs (versus become ‘dual users’ or
continue smoking) is currently unknown. African American (AA) smokers, who take larger
puffs, inhale more intensely, and extract more nicotine and harmful constituents per
cigarette smoked, may be particularly impacted by [CONTACT_412025] – i.e., greater compensatory puffing and more e -liquid and related toxicant
consumption at lower e -liquid concentrations. Unfortunately, the vast majority of
information on E cs and potential product standards come from white populations and
have largely ignored African American (AA) smokers who bear a disproportionate burden
of tobacco -related morbidity and mortality. As the FDA considers regulatory action to
limit the level of nicotine in e -liquids to protect public health, it is critical that research
considers vulnerable populations and does not widen disparities.
Our long -term goal is to inform a tobacco landscape that will minimize tobacco -related
harms and downstream health inequities. The overall objective of this application is to
understand the impact of e -liquid nicotine concentration on compensatory puffing, EC
and cigarette use patterns (exclusive EC, dual EC -cig, exclusive cig), and resultant
exposure to biomarkers of harm among AA and white smokers. Adult AA and white

 smokers will complete two study phases. In Phase 1, using a randomized crossover 
design, participants will complete two standardized, 10 -puff vapi[INVESTIGATOR_412001] 5 mins 
followed by a 60 -minute ad libitum vapi[INVESTIGATOR_143523], using two e -liquids that differ only by 
[CONTACT_80416] (5% vs. 1.8%) to examine the effect of nicotine concentration on 
in-lab compensatory puffing, nicotine exposure, and e -liquid consumption. In Phase 2, 
the same participants will be randomized to 5% or 1.8% nicotine e -liquid and instructed 
to switch completely for [ADDRESS_519503] of nicotine concentration on 
short-term, real -world EC use patterns and related biomarkers of exposure (e.g., exhaled 
carbon monoxide, NNAL (4 -(methylnitrosamino) -1-(3-pyridyl) -1-butanol), lung 
inflammatory markers). Our central hypothesis is that, compared to the high nicotine 
concentration, while vapi[INVESTIGATOR_412002], users will engage in 
compensatory puffing, resulting in greater e -liquid consumption (Phase 1). Moreover, 
rates of dual use and continued smoking will be higher for the low (versus high) nicotine 
concentration and will result in greater exposure to toxicants (Phase 2).  
 
2. Aim 1  (Human laboratory): To examine the effect of nicotine concentration on 
compensation measured via nicotine exposure, puffing behavior, and e -liquid 
consumption. H1a: Compared to the 5% nicotine concentration, while vapi[INVESTIGATOR_100025] 1.8% 
concentration, smokers will evidence greater total inhaled volume, and (H1b) greater 
consumption of e -liquid (by [CONTACT_412026]) (H1c) but achieve similar levels of nicotine 
exposure.  
Aim 2  (Randomized trial): To assess the comparative efficacy of 1.8% vs. 5% nicotine 
concentration on real -world EC use pattern (exclusive EC, dual EC -cig, exclusive cig). 
H2a: After a 6 -week trial of EC, rates of complete substitution (i.e., percent exclusive EC) 
will be significantly greater for participants randomized to 5% (compared to 1.8%) 
nicotine e -liquid. H2b: Rates of dual EC -cig and exclusive cigarette smoking will be 
greater for participants randomized to 1.8% (compared to 5%) e -liquid.  
Aim 3  (Randomized trial): To understand the comparative exposure to non -nicotine 
constituents as a function of nicotine concentration. H3a: The degree of changes in 
exposure will be directly associated with the degree of substitution with EC —greater 
levels of substitution will confer a larger decrease in exposure. H2b: Among those who 
completely substitute E cs, 5% users (vs. 1.8%) will have lower toxicant levels.  
B. Background and Significance  
1. Study Significance  and literature review :  
 
Our study will be the first to assess the impact of nicotine concentration on compensatory 
puffing (total inhaled volume), nicotine delivery, and switch patterns (percent exclusive 
EC, dual cig -EC, and cig only users) with an explicit focus on AA and White smokers. It 
will provide the first available evidence on potential differential change in these factors 
for AA and Whites and offer rich data to the FDA that will inform evidence -based 
regulation of a nicotine standard that maximizes public health benefit and limits potential 
harm among diverse smokers.  
 
Rise of e -cigarettes (E cs) and the impact on public health : Millions of white US 
adults and youth now use E cs27,28 that deliver fewer carcinogens, volatile organic 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/[ADDRESS_519504] again disrupted the tobacco landscape. NSBE e -liquids are 
available in high nicotine concentrations (up to 5%),[ADDRESS_519505] other EC e -
liquids on the market (0.3% -2.4%).37-39 These products use protonated nicotine36, which 
make the high nicotine e -liquids palatable and reduce irritation,40 likely facilitating user 
initiation.  
 
Tobacco and EC use among African Americans (AA) : AA smoke fewer days per 
month, fewer cigarettes per day (CPD)41 (1 to 10), and are less likely to be heavy 
smokers than whites.41 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_412003] (CPD)[ADDRESS_519506] 30% 
more nicotine and harmful constituents per cigarette compared to whites.[ADDRESS_519507] on AA smokers arise. 
Specifically, as more AA smokers switch to E cs, it is not known how they will use the 
products. One possibility is that AA smokers may engage in fewer vapi[INVESTIGATOR_412004] e -liquid (through increased topography), which is not harmless, compared to 
whites to reach comparable nicotine exposure. However, almost all the information on 
Ecs and potential product standards come from white populations. As the FDA considers 
regulatory action to limit the level of nicotine in e -liquids to protect public health, it is 
imperative  that research be inclusive of populations who bear a disproportionate burden 
of tobacco -related morbidity and mortality. Given the dearth of preliminary data, 
subanalyses  of race will be exploratory in nature.  
 
Nicotine and other EC constituents : Nicotine is the addictive component in tobacco 
products,[ADDRESS_519508] use,49 health concerns regarding nicotine primarily arise due to the type 
of delivery device and route of administration. In E cs, nicotine is delivered in a solution of 
propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin (VG), and flavorants.50 E-liquid solutions may 
also deliver other non -nicotine constituents and harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents including heavy metals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and low levels 
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).51 
 
Nicotine concentration and compensation in AA and white users:  Policy makers, 
researchers, and the public have expressed concern regarding the high levels of nicotine 
in NSBEs and have suggested product standards that would place a ceiling on allowable 
nicotine concentrations to reduce public health harms52, similar to the European Union 
Tobacco Products Direc tive that restricts nicotine strength to ≤ 20mg/mL53 (i.e., 2%) and 
recent state -level recommendations to implement a similar rule.54-[ADDRESS_519509] never been tested. In a 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/[ADDRESS_519510] that white users of 
older, low nicotine devices likely engage in compensatory puffing to achieve the same 
level of nicotine as high nicotine EC users,58-61 although objective measures of puff 
topography were not collected. Laboratory emissions testing research has shown that at 
low (vs. high) nicotine concentrations, a greater amount of e -liquid must be aerosolized 
to achieve cigarette -like levels of nicotine yield. Importantly, greater e -liquid 
aerosolization generated by [CONTACT_412027], including known respi[INVESTIGATOR_412005].62 If replicated in humans, EC users would likely be exposed to higher levels of 
PG, VG, flavorants, and other constituents. Given their differential puffing patterns 
(greater number of puffs45 and more intense puffing46), AA smokers may engage in even 
greater e -liquid consumption and, as a result, be exposed to greater levels of non -
nicotine constituents compared to whites. If users engage in compensatory puffing when 
using low levels of nicotine, they are being exposed to more e -liquid, and placing a 
ceiling on allowable levels of nicotine may inadvertently increase exposure to non -
nicotine constituents, particularly among AA smokers. Unlike very low nicotine 
concentration (VLNC) cigarettes,63-[ADDRESS_519511] not been shown to 
reduce their use in response to the reduced levels of nicotine.58-61 Human health effects 
of exposure to larger volumes of EC aerosols remain unknown and of concern.  
 
The role of nicotine concentration in EC use trajectory in smokers:  Ecs are a 
potential harm reduction tool, particularly if used exclusively by [CONTACT_412028]. E cs pose less short -term risk than 
cigarettes and, particularly when used exclusively, cause less harm than cigarettes.[ADDRESS_519512] of EC nicotine strengths on 
use trajectory. Existing studies indicate that when smokers were provided a cig -a-like 
with 7.5mg (~.75%) nicotine e -liquid, smokers achieved quit rates of only 11% at 12 
weeks.66 However, 16mg (~1.6%)67 and 18mg (~1.8%)68 e-liquids produced quit rates 
of 21.5% and 35%, respectively. [CONTACT_60170]’s (primary mentor) switching trial of AA and 
Latinx smokers is the only trial to examine rates of abstinence from E cs using a NSBE 
and showed that 28% of smokers were exclusive EC users at week 6.[ADDRESS_519513] 
standards in E cs.  
 
Relevance to tobacco regulatory science:  The FDA deemed that E cs are under their 
regulatory authority, thus allowing FDA to implement policy decisions regarding EC 
product standards, including nicotine.[ADDRESS_519514] 
standards are a top priority, and that data are needed to inform the implementation of 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/[ADDRESS_519515]. Leavens’ recently completed randomized crossover, human laboratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (N 
= 10) of nicotine exposure of three E cs (tank system, mod style, NSBE) and cigarettes 
showed that use of NSBEs led to shorter time to maximum plasma nicotine concentration 
than cigarettes. While the study provides initial evidence regarding nicotine delivery of 
NSBEs, participants were only provided 5% nicotine E cs and markers of harm were not 
measured.  
 
C. Rationale  
[CONTACT_412043]’ recently completed randomized crossover, human laboratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (N = 
10) of nicotine exposure of three E cs (tank system, mod style, NSBE) and cigarettes showed 
that use of NSBEs led to shorter time to maximum plasma nicotine concentration than 
cigarettes. While the study provides initial evidence regarding nicotine delivery of NSBEs, 
participants were only provided 5% nicotine E cs and markers of harm were not measured. 
[CONTACT_60170] has recently completed the first EC switching study with AA adult daily smokers.[ADDRESS_519516] in switching to EC among AA smokers, high utilization of 
NSBE, and significant reductions in cancer, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and cardiovascular markers among 
the EC group. Participants all received NSBE containing 5% nicotine. The health effect of 
1.8% versus 5% nicotine remains a critical gap that will be addressed through the proposed 
research plan. [CONTACT_84469] completed one of the first studies to show that use of low -
nicotine E cs was associated with greater e -liquid consumption compared to high -nicotine 
Ecs.[ADDRESS_519517] features 
that more closely mimic the experience of smoking a cigarette (e.g., nicotine boost)6,71,72; 
these features may impact the rate of compensation and, subsequently, the amount of e -
liquid consumed, and are gaps that will be addressed in the proposed research. The research 
will merge [CONTACT_412043]’ foundational knowledge of human laboratory studies of novel 
products with [CONTACT_60170]’s expertise in tobacco -related disparities among AA using 
randomized trial methods. Additionally, Drs. Wagener and Benowitz will supplement these 
core components by [CONTACT_412029]. All mentors will provide training in grantsmanship and 
professional development.  
 
 
II. Research Plan  and Design  
 
A. Study Objectives : This study will investigate the impact of EC e -liquid nicotine 
concentration (1.8% vs. 5%) on compensatory puffing and e -liquid consumption, use 
patterns, and resultant changes in biomarkers of exposure, among AA and white smokers 
using complementary human laboratory and randomized trial methods.  
B. Study T ype and Design :  
 
Adult AA (n = 24) and white (n = 24) smokers (stratified on CPD) will complete two study 
phases. Phase 1 (P1) : 2-visit human laboratory trial with double -blind, randomized crossover 
design. Phase 2 (P2) : 6-week, randomized substitution trial. Participants in P2 will be the 
same participants that completed P1. Both phases are necessary: Phase 1 will provide data 
on compensatory puffing and nicotine exposure, while Phase 2 will provide information on 
real-world use patterns and related short -term health effects. These two phases, combined, 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/[ADDRESS_519518] 48 
“completers” of phase 1, we will enroll about [ADDRESS_519519] completed phase 1. Only 48 participants will complete phases 1 and 2. 
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to the order in which they use the two nicotine 
concentrations. For the randomized trial, they will be randomized 1:1 by [CONTACT_412030] 1.8% or 5% nicotine e -liquid for [ADDRESS_519520] the sequential study ID number to determine the randomization 
assignment. This procedure will be conducted again at the beginning of phase 2 
(randomized trial).  
 
2. Both phases of the trial will be double blind . Randomization will be determined by 
[CONTACT_22123] -generated random numbers. Randomization assignments will be placed in 
sealed envelopes with sequential study ID numbers. After baseline data collection during 
phase [ADDRESS_519521] the sequential study ID 
number to determine the randomization assignment. This procedure will be conducted 
again at the beginning of phase 2 (randomized trial).  
 
 
3. The purpose of a K01 is to build a body of preliminary evidence and determine effect 
sizes for a fully powered R01 trial. With this in mind, the proposed K01 is fully powered 
to detect differences in change in puff volume between 1.8% and 5% nicotine 
concentration e -liquids for the sample overall (Aim 1). For this aim and all subsequent 
aims, we will conduct subset analyses by [CONTACT_545]. Phase 1 : The primary outcome for P1 is 
total inhaled volume. We have determined these anticipated effect sizes based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_412006]. Leavens’ study on puff topography among users of 5% NSBE e -liquid 
during a standard PK assessment and existing data regarding puff topography among 
users of moderate (3%) and low (1.8%) nicotine concentration e -liquid in earlier 
generation E cs (Hiler et al., 2017).[ADDRESS_519522] 
an anticipated mean difference in total inhaled volume between the 1.8% and 5.0% 
nicotine concentrations of 70 mL (12% increase) and 186 mL (27% increase). We are 
basing our sample on the smaller, clinically meaningful difference (12% increase) which 
results in an effect size of 0.74. Based on this information, 48 participants we will achieve 
>90% power to detect an increase of 70mL in total inhaled volume during the PK 
assessment using two -sided tests with 0.[ADDRESS_519523] separate analyses by [CONTACT_545] 
(AA = 24; White = 24). Based upon the previous assumptions, this results in the ability 
to detect an effect size of 1.[ADDRESS_519524] globally greater puff 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/[ADDRESS_519525] of 
race; however, a study of AA and white smokers stratified on baseline cigarettes per day 
has not been conducted. This study will be the first head -to-head, controlled, 
prospectively designed study to assess if there is the potential for a main effect of race. 
This sample estimate is based on our most variable outcome; therefore, we anticipate 
being overpowered to detect effects in the overall sample related to nicotine exposure 
(secondary outcome) which will show much less variability. Subsequently, after a 
standard 1 -week washout period, subjects will return to be randomized to 1.8% or 5% 
nicotine e -liquid and instructed to completely substitute the EC for cigarettes. Based 
upon prior retention, we expect to randomize at least [ADDRESS_519526]. Nollen’s past trials,25,[ADDRESS_519527] retention of >90% in multi -year trials 
examining AA and white smokers. Phase 2 : The primary outcome for P2 is the proportion 
of participants that achieve biochemically -verified complete substitution (i.e., exclusive 
EC use) at 6 -weeks for 1.8% and 5% nicotine e -liquid. Based on [CONTACT_60170]’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_412007] 5% nicotine salt e -liquid69 and 
similar studies of Whites using 5% nicotine salt e -liquid in the literature, 94 we anticipate 
that ~30% of the sample overall will completely switch at 6 -week follow -up in the 5% 
nicotine group and fewer in the 1.8% nicotine group. Twenty participants in each nicotine 
concentration group will allow us to estimate the rate of complete substitution (exclusive 
EC use) with a margin of error < 0.[ADDRESS_519528] C riteria (See Vulnerable Populations appendix, if applicable):

than 12 ppm or they report other nicotine use two times, they will be withdrawn from the 
study. Participants will complete a paper or online log of their practice. If they do not 
practice with each nicotine concentration prior to visit one, they will be sent home and 
again instructed to practice with each pod. After two failed practice periods, participants 
will be removed from the study.   
 
2. Participants will not be allowed to participate in another research study that aims to alter 
their tobacco use during this research study.  
 
E. Specific methods and techniques used throughout the study        
 
1. Laboratory tests :  
 
At two human laboratory visits, blood will be collected for nicotine analysis via a blood 
draw from the participant’s arm.  Participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in 
their arm for collection of blood (plasma nicoti ne). Blood sampling for changes in nicotine 
levels will occur at -5 (baseline), 5 (post 10 -puff bout), 7, 15 (beginning of ad lib 
session), 45, and 75 (post -session) minutes.  No more than 7 mL of blood will be drawn 
per draw. Blood will be processed and analyzed for nicotine and cotinine levels. If 
consent is provided for banking, samples will be banked for possible future analysis.  
  
Human Laboratory Assessments (see Table 1 for timing):

 Topography.  Puff topography will be used to objectively measure EC puffing patterns. 
Puff topography is a sensitive measure of substance self -administration.81,83 Puff 
topography will be measured throughout the EC session via a pressure flow sensor in the 
EC mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], whereby [CONTACT_12699] -induced pressure changes are amplified, digitized, 
and sampled. Software converts signals to airflow (ml/s) and produces measures of puff 
volume, total puff volume, puff number, and inter -puff-interval. The topography device to 
be used in this study has been successfully used by [CONTACT_6283]. Leavens and Wagener.1,4 During 
both phases of the study, the study e -cigarette will be equipped with an integrated puff 
topography device that allows for collection of topography data in the lab and in the 
participant’s natural environment. Participants will be provided the device and a phone 
with highly limited capabilities. Specifically, participants will only be able to change the 
brightness, connect to WIFI, and access the app for data transfer. Otherwise, the phone 
is fully locked down. Participants will be asked to open the topography app daily and 
“sync” to transfer daily topography data. The data will be utilized in an exploratory 
fashion. Only topography data and no identifiable data are transferred via the mobile 
application.  
Nicotine exposure.  At both initial lab -based visits, blood samples will be collected at -5 
(baseline), 5 (post 10 -puff bout), 7, 15 (beginning of ad lib session), 45, and 75 (post -
session) minutes. Seven mL of blood will be collected during each blood draw. Samples 
will be analyzed according to standardized methods84 by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Na Zhang at KUMC. Blood 
will be analyzed for nicotine content to assess nicotine exposure during the session.  
Biomarkers.  eCO levels will be measured at final screening and both visits. At final 
screening, eCO ≥ 6ppm will be used to verify smoking status. At study visits, eCO ≤ 12 
ppm will be used to verify tobacco abstinence.  
Other self -report assessments.  The EC -adapted Tiffany -Drobes Questionnaire on 
Smoking Urges (QSU -brief)85 and Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawa l Scale (MNWS)[ADDRESS_519532] Evaluation Scale86 (mPES) will assess satisfaction, subjective 
effects, and sensory experiences (e.g., taste) at the conclusion of each ad lib session.

 Randomized Trial Assessments (see Table 1 for timing):   
Nicotine exposure.  Prolonged nicotine exposure will be measured using urinary cotinine 
at wks 0 & 6. Cotinine captures nicotine from all nicotine products and will allow us to 
understand whether participants maintain, reduce, or increase their nicotine exposure 
over the c ourse of P2. Participants will bring their empty and partially used pods to each 
study visit to be weighed for measurement of e -liquid consumption.  
Health outcomes and biomarkers . eCO levels will be measured at wks 0 & 6. eCO ≤ 6 
ppm will be used to verify use trajectory at wks 0 & 6. NNAL, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], blood pressure, 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_412009] 0 & 6 to assess health outcomes and 
biomarkers between users of 1.8% vs. 5% nicotine e -liquid. Specimen samples will be 
banked for later analy sis of VOCs, PAHs, and other new and emerging biomarkers of 
interest , including acrolein and acrylonitrile .  
EC use trajectory  (Aim 2). The 7 -day Timeline Followback Interview (TLFB)87,88 will be 
used to assess the comparative effectiveness of nicotine concentration on participants EC 
use trajectory at the end of the 6 -week trial of EC. The primary outcome of P2 is the 
proportion of smokers who are exclusive EC users at wk 6 for 1.8% and 5% nicotine 
concentrations. Exclusive EC users are defined as those who reported any use of ECs, no 
use of cigarettes in the past [ADDRESS_519533] a CO < [ADDRESS_519534] a CO > [ADDRESS_519535] 7 days. A fourth group, no use of ECs 
or combustible cigarettes, may occur.  
Other self -report assessments.  The QSU -brief and MNWS will be collected at wks 0 & 
6. 
2. Study Procedures:  
i. Initial Screening : The initial screen will review inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those 
eligible will be scheduled to complete final screening within 14 days.  
ii. Final Screening and Enrollment : Participants will be instructed to smoke as 
they normally would before the final screening. Final eligibility screening will be 
conducted in -person and will consist of completing a pregnancy test on women of 
childbearing age, exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) measurement, and obtaining 
informed consent. Participants will complete baseline measures including 
demographics, medical, tobacco use, and substance use history and measurement 
of cotinine, NNAL (4 -(methylnitrosamino) -1-(3-pyridyl) -1- butanol), eCO, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], blood pressure, lung injury panel, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]. E-liquid 
Flavor Sampling and Device Practice.  At the final screening and enrollment visit, 
participants will be asked to sample two e -liquid flavors (Menthol and Tobacco; 
only commercially available flavors in pod -based NSBE) with 5% nicotine to 
determine flavor preference. Consistent with established methods, at the 
conclusion of the visit, participants will be provided with the Vuse EC device and 
two pods (one each of 1.8% and 5% nicotine) both in their preferred flavor to 
take home for [ADDRESS_519536] 
study visit. Participants will complete a paper or online log of their practice. If 
they do not practice with each nicotine concentration prior to visit one, they will 
be sent home and again instructed to practice with each pod. After two failed 
practice periods, participants will be removed from the study. We considered 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 11 of 25
  
 other nicotine concentrations but chose 5% because it is the most commonly used 
NSBE concentration in market leaders like JUUL. We chose 1.8% because it 
reflects the [LOCATION_006] nicotine standard and most likely potential regula tory decision.  
b. Phase 1 – Human Laboratory Procedures : Participants will remain abstinent from 
nicotine/tobacco and alcohol for 12 hours prior to each study visit. Abstinence will be 
verified upon arriving at the laboratory by [CONTACT_342532] (≤ 6 ppm). Pregnancy exclusion will be 
confirmed at each visit. Self -report will be used for EC abstinence, as there is currently 
no objective, reliable measure to verify non -use of these products within the time the 
participant will be present in the lab. Participants will have an  intravenous catheter 
placed in their arm for collection of blood (plasma nicotine). They will be provided the 
Vuse Alto device with one of the two e -liquid concentrations (1.8% or 5%) and will 
complete the 10 -puff standardized bout (pharmacokinetic assessment) followed by a [ADDRESS_519537] and ongoing studies.1,4 During the vapi[INVESTIGATOR_143523], blood sampling will 
occur at -5 (pre -session), 5 (post 10 -puff bout), 7, 15 (beginning of ad lib session), 45, 
and 75 (post -session) minutes. Following a minimum [ADDRESS_519538] washout 
period1,4,59,78,82 during which they will smoke as they typi[INVESTIGATOR_116820], participants will 
repeat this procedure with the other nicotine concentration.  
Phase 2 – Randomized Trial : Participants who complete P1 (~[ADDRESS_519539]. Nollen’s trials) will undergo a 1 -week washout period (week 3 in consent document) and be 
randomized (1:1) by [CONTACT_22123] -generated random numbers to 1.8% or 5% e -liquid. Randomization will 
be stratified within race on CPD. Substitution : Participants will be instructed to make a complete switch 
from cigarettes to ECs for 6 weeks. They will be provided with the Vuse EC and e -liquid and instructed 
to use it as they like but to refrain from use of other tobacco. Participants will complete in -person visits 
(wks 0 & 6) and will provide samples for biomarker assessment and complete self -report measures. 
Participants will bring all empty pods and those currently in use for weight measurement to quantify e -
liquid consumption. Phone calls will occur between in -person visits (wks 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5) to confirm 
appointments, collect data on tobacco use, and support substitution.69 Participants will be asked to use 
the topography -equipped e -cigarette and accompanying phone/mobile app lication  throughout phase 2 
(RCT). While participants will be instructed to completely switch to ECs during P2, research suggests 
some participants will have difficulty doing so. Therefore, we will collect information regarding use of 
other products.  
3. Due to COVID -19 and the need to keep patients and researchers safe, we may use 
Zoom, a HIPAA compliant, university approved video conferencing software, during the 
visit. This will allow the participant to smoke freely (unmasked) while the researcher can 
watch and communicate with the participant via video conferencing from outside the 
clinic room. We will utilize Zoom as much as possible and only enter the room when 
necessary.  
 
4. All procedures, tests, and visits are being performed solely for research purposes and are 
not billable to insurance.  
 
5. Samples will be labeled only with a unique study identification number and only members 
of [CONTACT_412043] and Zhang’s teams will have access to the samples. Samples will be 
disposed of one month after the final report is sent out to the Principal Investigator, 
unless participants agree to have their urine  and/or blood  stored for future testing.

6. Timeline: The proposed study is comfortably feasible in the K01 award period, allowing time for 
project start -up and dissemination (Table 1). Refinement of assessments, database creation, and IRB 
approval will take place in the first [ADDRESS_519540] to recruit 10 participants in the 
second 6 months of Year 1, 18 participants in Year 2, 14 in Year 3, and 6 in Year 4. No more than 5 
participants (≤15 visits) will be recruited during each quarter of recruitment. This rate of accrual is 
commensurate with my past studies and other similar laboratory -based studies. Our final participant 
session will be in the second quarter of Year 4. Data analysis and manuscript preparation will take 
place in the 3rd and 4th quarters of Year 4 and throughout Year 5.

F. Risk/benefit assessment:    
1. Physical risk : The potential risks for this study are minimal. There is a slight risk of 
discomfort, bruising and infection with blood draw. Blood will be drawn by [CONTACT_92519]. IVs will be placed and blood draws will be conducted by [CONTACT_412032]. 
Sterile instruments will be used for blood draws, the participants skin will be cleaned with 
an alcohol wipe at the site of the needle stick.  
2. Psychological risk : Risks for participants include those associated with the inconvenience 
of participation including answering surveys, providing blood samples, and completing 
multiple visits. To minimize the inconveniences associated with study participation we will 
review all data collection instruments and study procedures to minimize the number of 
items in our instruments and improve the accessibility and convenience of our study 
procedures.  We anticipate using several methods to enhance convenience to 
participants, including providing rideshare services to and from all study visits and 
offering study visits throughout the day. Another risk is feeling pressured to be in the 
study, which we will track in order to monitor and will report as an adverse event. 
Finally, although very unlikely, some questions may make participants uncomfortable; 
participants are not required to answer questions they do not wish to.   
3. Social risk : None  
4. Economic risk : None  
5. Potential benefit of participating in the study   
a. There are no direct benefits to participants for participating in this study   
b. If shown to be effective, our study could, in the future, minimize tobacco -related 
harms and downstream health inequities by [CONTACT_412033]. The data will inform 
FDA regulations that protect the public health, particularly that of smokers.  
c. The researchers hope that the information gathered from this research may be 
useful in informing regulatory decisions to benefit public health.

G. Location where study will be performed:  
All Phase 1 visits will be run at the Clinical and Translational Science Unit -Swope  (CTSU -
Swope ). The CTSU offers clinical space including two smoking rooms and is staffed by 
[CONTACT_412034]. Biospecimens including NNAL, urinary cotinine, 
plasma nicotine, and the lung injury panel will be processed and analyzed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Na Zhang  
and h er team. Blood will be collected for plasma nicotine measurement during both study 
visits during Phase 1.  All biospecimen samples are deidentified and stored in a -[ADDRESS_519541] of research (i.e., both HIPAA and CITI trainings). 
Identifying information will not be reported in any publication. No information will be stored 
locally on the laptop/tablet; all information will be stored securely in the secure data capture 
system. Research materials obtained from the participants include responses to 
questionnaires collected directly by [CONTACT_412035]. Data will be stored in a password protected database and on password protected 
network storage. Consent forms will be stored in a separate locked filing cabinet or 
electronically on the secure database. Physiological measures include, urine, blood samples, 
and exhaled breath carbon monoxide. Research data will be obtained specifically for research 
purposes. Every effort will be made to maintain subject confidentiality, in accordance with 
HIPAA .

L. Assessment of Subject Safety and Development of a Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan 
 
1. Elements of the plan include:  
The current study does not pose more than minimal risk; however, we are extremely 
sensitive to the history of cases of acute lung injury associated with e -cigarette products 
and the CDCs warnings. We continue to closely monitor the situation. To address this 
concern, we will obtain informed consent, closely monitor AEs and SAEs and promptly 
report any that occur. In addition, we will have firm stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_412011]. The Vuse Alto EC will be used for the proposed study. The Vuse 
Alto device is a commercially available pod -based device and is compatible with nicotine 
salt and freebase nicotine e -liquid. We will use commercially available nicotine salt e -
liquid in 5% and 1.8% nicotine concentrations.  
 
2. All adverse events (AEs) occurring during the study will be assessed (e.g., symptoms 
checklist, NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 5.0), documented, and reported 
to Drs. Leavens (Principal Investigator) and Nollen (Primary Mentor). The occurrence of 
AEs will be assessed each study visit throughout phase [ADDRESS_519542] weekly for all patients on the trial. 
The study investigators will follow all AEs to the point of a satisfactory resolution. All AEs 
will be assessed to determine if they meet criteria for an SAE. Serious adverse events 
(SAEs), as defined by [CONTACT_1622], will be systematically evaluated at each visit. Any SAE, 
whether or not related to study, will be reported to the KUMC IRB, DSMC, and the FDA. 
The initial SAE report will be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a completed SAE report to all 
three institutions .  
 
3. In the event that a participant discontinues study treatment due to an SAE, the 
participant will continue to have appropriate follow -up and assessment. Outcome of SAEs

A. Recruitment : 
1. African American and White current daily smokers will be recruited from the local 
community using standard media outlets , combination of flyers, referrals, social media, 
and radio/TV ads,  and in collaboration with Swope Health Center, which serves a large 
proportion of AAs and has been a recruitment site for all of [CONTACT_60170]’s previous trials.  
We will also use the Frontiers registry , SlicerDicer,  C3OD,  and HERON database s to 
identify adult smokers who have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_33632]. Consistent with 
past trials, we will send the patient a letter informing them of the study. We will then 
follow -up via phone the week after the letter was sent and offer screening. We will post 
the study to the KUMC Intranet list of current studies for KUMC employees. Additionally, 
participants are currently being screened for other research studies conducted by [CONTACT_67039]. Those who have completed studies or who are ineligible for other studies being 
conducted will be informed about the current study and offered the opportunity to be 
screened.   
2. Recruitment methods are described above. Recruitment will be conducted by [CONTACT_214200]. Recruitment will be overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leavens. Screening will be 
conducted over the phone and by [CONTACT_412036].  
3. Advertisements and flyers that will be used for recruitment will be submitted prior to 
study recruitment efforts begin. Advertisements and flyers will be handed out to potential 
participants by [CONTACT_412037]/T[LOCATION_006]HS and in the 
community.  
4. Letters will be mailed directly to patients to inform them of the study. Within one week of 
mailing letters, study staff will make follow -up calls to patients and offer initial screening. 
Letters will be submitted prior to study recruitment efforts begin.  
B. Screening Interview/questionnaire : The initial screen will review inclusion/exclusion 
criteria aside from exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) measurement. Participants who are 
deemed to be eligible at the initial screening will report to the lab for in -person final 
screening  within 14 days of the initial screening . During the final screening visit, participants 
will complete informed consent procedures, including HIPAA documentation. Only those 
participants who provide consent will complete the additional screening questionnaires. 
Additional screening measures include questionnaires, an expi[INVESTIGATOR_412012], and (if female) a urine pregnancy test. At the final screening and 
enrollment visit, participants will be asked to sample two Vuse EC flavors to determine flavor 
preference. Participants will complete baseline measures including demographics, medical, 
tobacco use, and substance use history and measurement of cotinine, NNAL, eCO, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], blood pressure, lung injury panel, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  
C. Informed consent process and timing of obtaining of consent  
1 Consent procedures will be conducted by [CONTACT_412038]. Prior to 
consent, participants will be provided a detailed and comprehensive overview of study 
procedures.  
2 Individuals interested in the proposed study and deemed to be initially eligible will meet 
the research assistant at the Clinical and Translational Science Unit (CTSU) at KUMC. 
Each individual will be given a copy of the consent form and as much time as they need 
to review its contents. After the consent form is read, both the individual and the 
research assistant will review the consent form together and the potential participant will

location.  
3 We do not anticipate recruitment of subjects with compromised cognitive abilities and/or 
decisional impairment. However, if questions regarding a participant’s ability to provide 
informed consent arise, [CONTACT_412043] will determine whether the subject is able to give 
informed consent.  
D. Alternatives to Participation : The alternative to participation is not participatin g, 
continuing to smoke cigarettes as usual, obtaining an EC on their own, attempting to quit 
using FDA -approved pharmacotherapy, attempting to quit cold turkey.   
E. Costs to Subject s: There are no costs to participants. All tests, procedures, and visits are 
being performed solely for research purposes and are not billable to insurance companies.  
F. How new information will be conveyed to the study subject and how it will be 
documented : We have plans to publish data from this study in aggregate but will not 
provide any individualized feedback to patients.  
G. Payment, including a prorated plan for payment : In Phase 1, p articipants will receive 
$60 for each of the human laboratory visits. If they complete both human laboratory visits, 
they will receive a $20 bonus. Therefore, participants who attend screening and both study 
visits will earn $ 140. In Phase 2, p articipants will receive $20 for attending each randomized 
trial study visit/phone call  which will be paid at the next in -person visit.  In addition, they will 
receive  $80 for providing samples and bringing their used and current e -cigarette pods for 
measurement. Participants who complete all Phase 2 procedures will earn $ 220. Participants 
who complete all study procedures can earn up to $360.  Participants  may also receive $20 
for each referral who is eligible and enrolls in the study. They may complete up to 3 different 
referrals for an additional total of $60.  
H. Payment for a research -related injury : N/A 
IV. Data Collection and Protection  
A. Data Management and Security :  
1. We will use the participant’s name [CONTACT_412042]/HIPPA 
documents and these will be kept in a locked file cabinet, to be kept in our study office. 
Protection against loss of confidentiality and privacy will be maintained by [CONTACT_412039], disguising identifying information, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_412013] a secure, password -protected database. All biospecimen samples are deidentified 
and stored in a freezer  at the CTSU . Names of participants will be kept separate from 
participant data. Only study research assistants and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_412014]. All electronic data will be numerically coded 
and stored in a password -protected database, on a password -protected computer in a 
secure research space. Participant information will be accessible only to research staff, 
who are pledged to confidentiality and complete training in the ethical conduct of 
research (i.e., both HIPAA and CITI trainings). Identifying information will not be 
reported in any publication. No information will be stored locally on the laptop/tablet; all 
information will be stored securely in the secure data capture system. Only summaries of 
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 17 of 25
  
 group data will be reported in any publications or presentations, with no identification of 
individuals.  Because identifiable information will be collected, participant privacy will be 
maintained throughout the duration of the study by [CONTACT_412040].  More specifically, identifiable information will not be released 
without written authorization of the participant.  Mobile devices will not be used for data 
collection or storage. Identifiable data will not be sent outside of KUMC.  
 
B. Sample / Specimen Collection: Blood will be collected for plasma nicotine measurement 
during both study visits during Phase 1. Six blood draws (one needle stick) per participant 
per visit will occur and be processed and analyzed. At both visits, blood samples will be 
collected at -5 (baseline), 5 (post 10 -puff bout), 7, 15 (beginning of ad lib session), 45, and 
75 (post -session) minutes. Seven mL of blood will be collected during each blood draw  (7 mL 
per draw x 6 draws per visit x 2 visits = 44 mL total during study ). Samples will be analyzed 
according to standardized methods84 by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Na Zhang at KUMC. Blood will be analyzed for 
nicotine content to assess nicotine exposure during the session.  All samples will be de -
identified and labeled with a study identification number. Blood samples will be aliquoted into 
two separate vials. One will be analyzed for the current study and one will be placed in a 
biospecimen repository if participant provides consent for biorepository. Samples will be 
stored at the Bioanalytical Labo ratory at the Clinical and Translational Science Unit (CTSU) at 
KUMC. Samples will be accessible only to members of the study team. Results from 
biomarker analyses will be de -identified and shared only with members of the research 
team. Any resulting publications will present the data in aggregate; individual participants 
will not be identified. Samples  (blood/plasma and urine)  will be disposed of one month after 
the final report is sent out to the Principal Investigator, unless participants agree to have 
their samples stored for future testing.  For participants who agree to future testing, urine 
and blood (i.e., plasma) samples will be stored indefinitely.   
C. Tissue Banking Considerations:   For participants who agree to future testing, samples will 
be stored indefinitely. New markers of nicotine, EC, and carcinogen exposure are being 
discovered and the stored biological samples would be used for analysis of these new 
markers.  All samples stored for future biomarker analyses will be de -identified and 
accessible only to members of the study team. Results from these analyses will be de -
identified and shared only with members of the research team. Any resulting publications will 
present the data in aggregate; individual participants will not be identified.    
D. Procedures to protect subject confidentiality : Confidentiality will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_19917] a study identification number and numerically coding all data.  All 
biological samples and survey data will be labeled with the study identification number and 
never with the participants name [CONTACT_113238].  The association of the 
ID-code and the participant’s name [CONTACT_60169] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leavens in a locked file cabinet and 
will only be accessible to members of the study team.   
E. Quality Assurance / Monitoring : All data will be directly entered into our electronic data 
capture system (i.e., RedCap or CRIS) that contains edit checks to control the quality and 
completeness of data entry. Completeness of data entry will be automatically verified before 
each assessment is completed. The electronic data capture system is behind the KUMC secure 
firewall with role -based access that is HIPAA and human subjects compliant. There are no plans 
for ongoing third -party monitoring.

V. Data Analysis and Reporting  
A. Statistical and Data Analysis: Data will be summarized using means and standard 
deviations, both overall and stratified (by [CONTACT_545]). To assess aim 1, we will conduct a 2x2 
crossover study and utilize linear mixed effects models to assess differences in total inhaled 
volume between 1.8% and 5% nicotine concentration globally and by [CONTACT_545]. This technique 
allows us to handle repeated measures that are inherently correlated. Similar analyses will 
be done on consumption of e -liquid, plasma nicotine levels, craving and withdrawal. Period 
and carryover effects will be considered in the models. If warranted, based upon results from 
aim 1, we will examine race and its interaction with nicotine concentration in the linear 
mixed effects models for all outcomes. However, we have limited power to detect an 
interaction and do not anticipate a differential change between AAs and whites, thus we 
must see a differential effect (e.g., one race responds to one dose and the other race 
responds to the other dose). If the interaction term is significant, the interaction will be 
probed. For aim 2, we will obtain the number of participants who have completely 
substituted ECs for combustible cigarettes for each group (1.8% vs. 5%) and by [CONTACT_545], 
calculate the corresponding proportion, assuming that if they fail to return, they did not have 
complete substitution, and calculate the 95% confidence interval for this proportion for each 
group independently. Given the small sample size, we do not expect to have the ability to 
obtain statistical difference, but we will have solid estimates on these proportions for each 
nicotine concentration group and will be able to calculate an effect size for future studies 
which can be designed to test a difference. Similarly, we will have estimates on proportion of 
dual cig -EC and cigarette only use. Finally, for aim 3, we will estimate the mean, standard 
deviation, and median for the change in e -liquid consumption and biomarkers for each 
nicotine concentration group. Given the sample size and distribution of the mean, we will 
either utilize the two -sample t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test to test if there are differences 
between nicotine concentration groups. Primarily, we will calculate the potential effect size 
on these variables globally and by [CONTACT_545]. We will examine the rate of adverse events globally 
(experience any adverse event) and by [CONTACT_412041]. Data will be transformed as appropriate. While we do not make any specific 
hypotheses regarding sex differences, we will consider sex as a covariate in all analyses. We 
expect to recruit equal numbers of males and females to explore sex as a moderator of our 
study outcomes in exploratory analyses. All analyses will be conducted at the 0.[ADDRESS_519545] for multiplicity; Bonferroni or other adjustments would be too 
restrictive in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
B. Outcome : The primary study endpoint is identifying the impact of e -liquid nicotine 
concentration on compensatory puffing, EC and cigarette use patterns, and resultant 
exposure to biomarkers of harm among AA and white smokers. Our central hypothesis is 
that, compared to the high nicotine concentration, while vapi[INVESTIGATOR_412015], users will engage in compensatory puffing, resulting in greater e -liquid 
consumption (Phase 1). Moreover, rates of dual use and continued smoking will be higher for 
the low (versus high) nicotine concentration and will result in greater exposure to toxicants 
(Phase 2).  
C. Study results to participants : Study results will not be shared with research participants.  
 
KUMC – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 19 of 25
  
 D. Publication Plan : We plan to publish results in appropriate tobacco and public health 
journals such as Addiction, Tobacco Control, Nicotine and Tobacco Research, etc. In addition, 
results will be presented at regional, national, and international conferences.

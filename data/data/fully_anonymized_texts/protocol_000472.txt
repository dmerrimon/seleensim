“Neuropsychological evaluations vary in content depending on their purpose, 
but they typi[INVESTIGATOR_773710]. 
Primary cognitive domains include : intellectual functions; academic skills (e.g., 
reading, writing, math); receptive and expressive language skills (e.g., verbal 
comprehension, fluency, confrontation naming); simple and complex attention; 
learning and memory (e.g., encoding, recall, recogn ition); visuospatial abilities; 
executive functions, problem -solving an d reasoning abilities; and sensorimotor 
skills. Ideally, assessments should also include measures designed to assess 
personality, social -emotional functioning, and adaptive behavior.”

2 BACKGROUND  & PURPOSE   
A portion of patient concern regarding epi[INVESTIGATOR_773711].  To address this concern, comprehensive neuropsychological testing is 
performed as part of the surgical epi[INVESTIGATOR_773712] -up. While neuropsychological and 
functional change after open resection is well described, change following Laser Interstitial Thermal 
Therapy  (LITT) is less well known. The goal of this study is to assess and describe differences in post -
surgical neuropsychological test  scores in a population of patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_773713].  This study will also assess a subset of patients with mesial temporal lobe epi[INVESTIGATOR_773714]. This study is being conducted as a sub -study within the LAANTERN r egistry; therefore, all 
enrolled patients in PENSAR must be consented to both protocols.  
 
3 INTERVENTION/TREATMENT  
• All subjects will undergo comprehensive neuropsychological assessment post -LITT per standard 
of care practice .  
• Visual field testing will be conducted in a subset of enrolled patients.  
 
4 STUDY  DESIGN  OVERVIEW  
This is a multicenter sub -study that will include comprehensive neuropsychological assessment data 
collection done at baseline (within 1 year prior to the index LITT procedure ) and at follow -up (at least 6 
months from the index LITT procedure) . Visual field testing will be conducted in a subset of enrolled 
patients.  Up to 250 subjects may be enrolled at up to 15 study sites.  
 
 
4.1 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
Primary outcome measure: Site -determined cognitive changes per domain  
[Time Frame: 6+ months]  
Neuropsychological test data will be collected for all study participants to describe 
cognitive domain specific changes  as a cohort. Change will be assessed from r aw test 
score s and demographically  corrected  standardized scores  (where available).  
 
Secondary outcome measure 1 : Change in raw test scores  from standard battery of 
preferred neuropsychological tests  
[Time Frame: 6+ months]  
Describe the observed change or stability of neuropsychological test scores in patients 
who underwent  laser ablation surgery . Change will be assessed from r aw test score s and 
demographically  corrected  standardized scores  (where available).  
 
Secondary outcome measure 2 : Incidence of visual field deficits in patients with MTLE.  
[Time Frame: 6+ months]  
Visual field testing using Humphry automated fields ( HVF [ADDRESS_1062541]) will be 
conducted for a subset of patients to identify visual field deficits resulting after the LITT 
procedure.

improper consenting ) and not completing follow -up neuropsychological testing . All deviations will be 
reported to Monteris Medical.  It is the site’s responsibility to report deviations in compliance with their 
Institutional Review Board  if required . 
 
[ADDRESS_1062547] results.  
Scores will be collected to assess domain specific changes for the Primary outcome measure using pre -
defined clinically meaningful cut scores ( based on previously described methods1,2):  
• Changes of 1.[ADDRESS_1062548] deviations will be considered improved (+) or worsened ( -). 
• Changes of 2.[ADDRESS_1062549] -operative improvements 
(+) or worsening ( -).  
• Any score change less than 1.[ADDRESS_1062550] deviation will be considered unchanged and the result 
of anticipated variability.  
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the results for Secondary Outcome measures:  
• Continuous variables: The total count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be 
provided.  
• Categorical variables: Total count and percentage will be provided.  
 
Ad hoc, exploratory analyses may be conducted if sufficient sample size allows for correlation or 
multivariate assessment of patient subsets (e.g., those with improvement or worsening).  
 
11 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT   
The study  will be performed in accordance with all requirements set forth in the U.S. regulations, 21 Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50 (Protection of Human Patients ), 56 (Institutional Review Board), 
and applicable requirements from the reviewing IRB for the study  at each site .  
 
The study  data will be hosted in  the same electric data capture ( EDC ) system  as the LAANTERN registry  
where it will continue to follow compliance  with the U.S. regulations, 21 CFR part 11, Electronic Records; 
Electronic Signatures.   
 
All required data for this study will be collected on standardized Case Report Forms (CRFs).  
Qualified study staff at each investigational site will perform primary data collection drawn from source 
document ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853]) review. All CRFs will be subject to review for omitted data, gross data 
inconsistencies, illegible data , and deviations. Any deficiencies or deviations will be reviewed,  and any 
necessary action determined ( e.g., data query, communication to the study center).  
De-identified source documents will be collected  for neuropsychological test ing results at baseline and 
follow -up. De -identified source for the  Single Field Analysis (HVF24 -2 printouts) from both eyes will be 
collected  as well as  summary data of normal/abnormal findings.

 2 Clinical Evaluation of a Universal  Adhesive in Non-Carious  Cervical Lesions  
 
Background/ Relevance : For decades,  resin  adhesives  have  been  used  to restore  non-carious  cervical 
lesions  for esthetics and/or  patient  comfort.  New “universal  adhesives”  claim  to simplify  the process  of 
bonding resin  composites  to tooth structure  while  maintaining or exceedin g the quality  of previous  adhesive 
systems. Since  dentin and enamel  substrates  are vastly different  with respect  to composition and therefore  
require different  bonding protocols,  some  have advocated a “selective etch”  procedure in which  the enamel  
and dentin are etched differently  but may still be bonded  using  a similar  bonding agent.  The purpose of this 
study  is to determine whether  or not a selective  etch protocol  used  with a universal  adhesive provides  
significantly  improved results  in comparison to a self-etch protocol  when  restoring non-carious  cervical 
lesions.   
Rationale:  In vitro studies  have  shown  statistically  significantly  superior  marginal  adaptation and color  
stability  with a selective  etch technique,  but there are currently  no prospective in vivo studies  greater  than 6 
months  comparing  the efficacy  of selective  vs. self- etch techniques in conjunction with a universal  
adhesive.   
Methods:  Thirty -three p atients  with at least  two non-carious  cervical lesions  (NCCLs)  will receive one 
restoration utilizing  the self-etch universal  adhesive (Adhese Universal,  Ivoclar  Vivadent)  with no separate  
enamel  etching and another  restoration utilizing  the universal  adhesive and a selective etch protocol  in 
which  enamel  is etched  with 37% phosphoric  acid.  The adhesive and Tetric  composite will be provided  by 
[CONTACT_121743]’s  instructions  will be followed  for placement  of the restorations.   
Alternate Hypothesis:  Selective-etch restorations  will show  superior  retention rates,  marginal  adaptation,  
and color  stability  after 2 years  compared to self-etch restorations.  
Relevance : With so many  different  types  of resin  adhesives  and numerous  proposed methods,  this study  
could provide evidence supporting one protocol  and eliminate some  of the confusion associated with resin  
bonding protocols.

 3 Clinical Evaluation of a Universal Adhesive in Non- Carious Cervical Lesions  
Background:  
Non-carious cervical lesions  (NCCLs) have been well documented in the dental 
literature for over a century1,2. Differing opi[INVESTIGATOR_121736], 
but many agree that the etiologies  differ and include abrasion, erosion, attrition, and 
abfraction, a term coined in [ZIP_CODE],4. Although a few patients may not experience 
adverse effects from the presence of NCCLS, many patients experience sensitivity 
ranging from mild to severe. The esthetics of the dentition may also be compromised by [CONTACT_121744].  For decades, resin adhesives have been used to restore non-carious cervical lesions for esthetics and/or patient comfort; restoration of these lesions with a bonded resin restoration has been shown to be more effective than no treatment or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8719] a desensitizing dentifrice
5. Since the advent of “fourth 
generation” (also referred to as “3- bottle”) resin bonding agents in the 1990s, the 
primary focus in the development of resin adhesives has been simplifying the components and thus the protocol for placing resin composite restorations. New 
“universal adhesives” claim to simplify the process of bonding resin composites to tooth structure while maintaining or exceeding the quality of previous adhesive systems. Since dentin and enamel substrates are vastly different with respect to their composition and therefore require different bonding protocols, some have advocated a “selective etch” procedure in which the enamel and dentin are etched differently but may still be 
bonded using the same bonding agent.  An in vitro study by [CONTACT_121745] (2012) 
indicated that use of a universal adhesive with selective etching of enamel with 
phosphoric acid provides better bonding efficacy than when the adhesive is used as a 
[CONTACT_121757]   
 4 self-etch alone6. An in vivo study performed by [CONTACT_121746]- Serrano et al (2012, 2013) has 
also shown similar results7,8, but since significant hydrolysis of the dentin- resin interface 
continues to occur after six months or even twelve months, a longer clinical trial is 
indicated which more accurately depi[INVESTIGATOR_121737]9. Conversely, a 3-
year study was previously conducted by [CONTACT_121747], et al (2013) to compare self -etch and 
selective -etch techniques, but with a two- step bonding system instead of a one- step 
system10. 
Purpose/Specific Aims:  
The purpose of this prospective clinical trial will be to evaluate the efficacy of a newly 
formulated “universal” dental adhesive formulation in adult noncarious cervical lesions 
using self -etch and selective etch approaches; the aim is to determine whether or not 
selective etching provides significantly  improved retention and/or  better  resistance to 
enamel  margin  discoloration in comparison to self -etching  over a 24 month period.  
Hypothesis:  
The alternate hypothesis is that the restorations placed utilizing a selective etch method 
will yield superior retention, marginal adaptation, and less marginal discoloration than restorations placed with the self -etch method.  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no significant differences with respect to retentio n, marginal adaptation, or marginal discoloration when comparing restorations 
placed with selective etch and self -etch methods.  
 Materials and Methods 1.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
A total of 33 patients ranging in age from 20 to 75 years of age will be recruited for this

 10 At the point in the  restorative procedure where the etching and restorative material 
placement occurs, the operator will follow procedures for each tooth as identified by [CONTACT_121750]:   
 
a. Self-etch placement  
The universal adhesive (Adhese Universal; Ivoclar Vivadent) will be applied utilizing the 
following instructions from  the manufacturer :   
Starting with enamel, thoroughly coat the tooth surfaces to be treated with Adhese Universal. The adhesive must be scrubbed into the tooth for at least [ADDRESS_136781] not be shortened. Disperse Adhese Universal with oil and moisture free compressed air until a glossy, immobile film layer results. Light -cure Adhese Universal for 10 seconds using a light intensity of > 
500mW/cm2 
If the lesion is greater than 2 mm in any dimension, incremental placement of Tetric EvoCeram composite (Ivoclar Vivadent) will occur with the first increment being placed 
against enamel.  Instructions are described below:  
Apply Tetric EvoCeram in increments of max 2mm and adapt with a suitable instrument. Sufficient exposure to light prevents incomplete polymerization. Remove excess material with suitable finishers or fine diamonds after polymerization. Use silicone polishers as well as polishing disks and strips to polish the restoration to a durable high gloss.  
  Each increment will be light -cured using the intensity and duration prescribed by [CONTACT_13989]; the curing light will be calibrated at the beginning of each clinic session. 
[CONTACT_121757]   
 11 Final restorations will be finished and polished with fluted composite finishing burs and 
flexible abrasive disks, respectively.  
 
b. Selective etching placement  
Total Etch (37% phosphoric acid; Ivoclar) will be placed on the enamel margin with no intentional placement on the dentin within the lesion.  The adhesive (Adhese Universal) will then be applied as instructed by [CONTACT_3455].  Tetric EvoCeram composite  will 
be placed, light -cured, finished, and polished in the same manner as for the self -etch 
group.

The subject’s medical history will be updated in Axium and the subject will answer questions to assure continued eligibility in the study.  Evaluation of sensitivity and modified USPHS criteria to include retention, marginal discoloration, and marginal adaptation will occur and recorded in the table (below).  In addition, an overall determination of clinically acceptable or not clinically acceptable will be made at each evaluation visit. Intraoral digital images and impressions will be made at each recall appointment. The subjects will be compensated with checks in the amounts of $25, $50, and $[ADDRESS_136783] to the patient.

 14 4.0 Statistical Considerations 
 The two techniques will be compared for differences in s ensitivity, retention, marginal  
discoloration, marginal adaptation, and clinical acceptability at each follow -up visit using 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel tests for stratified, ordered categorical outcomes. The study 
subjects are considered the ‘strata’ in this method so that the comparisons properly 
account for the use of both techniques in each subject. This method also easily extends 
to having multiple teeth receiving each technique for each patient.  
With a final sample size of [ADDRESS_136785] 80% power to detect a 35% difference between the two treatment methods, ass uming two -sided tests of paired 
proportions and a 5% significance level. To account for attrition the study will enroll 33 subjects.

Mometasone Study Rationale
The addition of budesonide 0.5 mg/2 ml respules to nasal irrigations has become 
common practice in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis
1-2.  The dose of budesonide 
0.5 mg/[ADDRESS_290754] been measured at 34% and <0.1% respectively
4.  If a drug enters systemic circulation through the nasal mucosa, the 
medication is subject to plasma protein binding.  When a medication is protein bound it is not bioactive and thus reduces the potential for systemic adverse effects.  Approximately 85-90% of budesonide is bound to plasma proteins after entering systemic circulation
5.  Alternatively, mometasone is 99% protein bound at clinically 
relevant concentrations6.  Therefore, budesonide is bioactive at 10-[ADDRESS_290755] pass hepatic metabolism which largely determines the amount of medication which reaches systemic circulation.  Approximately 90% of swallowed budesonide is metabolized by [CONTACT_239591]: 17121505-IRB02   Date IRB Approved: 8/23/[ADDRESS_290756] pass metabolism, 99% of the drug is eliminated leaving only 1% of the drug to enter the circulation
7.           
A desired pharmacokinetic property of intranasal steroids is high lipophilicity. 
 Higher lipophilicity leads to increased intranasal absorption as well as prolonged retention in the nasal tissue
3.  Longer retention of the steroid in nasal tissue results in 
increased exposure to the glucocorticoid receptor8.  The relative lipophilicity of 
budesonide and mometasone are 3,[ADDRESS_290757] undergone endoscopic sinus surgery, after performing a nasal irrigation with a 240 ml saline filled Neilmed bottle, the result is 1.2% to 5% of the solution remaining in the sinuses
10.  Therefore, the maximum  amount of fluid left in the sinuses after a 240 ml 
nasal irrigation is 5% of the total volume or 12 ml.  Applying this data one may estimate the maximum absorption of mometasone added to a 240 ml saline filled Neilmed bottle for irrigation.  
•Mometasone 1 mg capsule dissolved in 240 mg
o1 mg/ 240 ml = 0.[ZIP_CODE] mg/ml or 4.16 mcg/ml
Max volume that can be retained in sinuses is 12 ml
12 ml x 4.16 mcg/ml = 50 mcg
Medication dosed twice daily, therefore  total daily dose = 100 mcg
•Mometasone 2 mg capsule dissolved in 240 mg
o2 mg/ 240 ml = 0.[ZIP_CODE] mg/ml or 8.33 mcg/ml
Max volume that can be retained in sinuses is 12 ml
12 ml x 8.33 mcg/ml = 100 mcg
Medication dosed twice daily, therefore  total daily dose = 200 mcg
•Mometasone 4 mg capsule dissolved in 240 mg
o4 mg/ 240 ml = 0.0166 mg/ml or 16.6 mcg/ml
Max volume that can be retained in sinuses is 12 ml
12 ml x 16.6 mcg/ml = 200 mcg
Medication dosed twice daily, therefore  total daily dose = 400 mcg
Mometasone nasal spray is currently FDA approved at a dose of 2 sprays (100 
mcg) in each nostril twice daily for the treatment of nasal polyps.  Total daily dose is [ADDRESS_290758] of mometasone on the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal axis (HPA)
12.  Additionally, 
mometasone at high doses, did not cause atrophy to the nasal mucosa12.  Intranasal 
mometasone at a dose of 1600 mcg, which is 4 times the recommended dose administered daily to human volunteers for 29 days showed no incidence of adverse ORA: 17121505-IRB02   Date IRB Approved: 8/23/2018

 Oral mometasone was administered at doses of 2, 4, and 8 mg to 24 healthy male volunteers with no significant change in plasma or urinary cortisol from placebo

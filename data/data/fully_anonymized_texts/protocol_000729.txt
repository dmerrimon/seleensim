2. Objectives
Aim 1: Develop a prototype pandemic caregiver training and education course.  Through iterative Design Studio sessions with dementia family caregivers, program faculty, COVID-[ADDRESS_1152285] research; they are intended solely to gather input from a variety of perspectives, including from individuals similar to those with whom the eventual program will be tested, to assist in program design.
Aim 2: Conduct a waitlist-control design test of the prototype course.  We will identify a diverse 
set of dementia family caregivers (N=100; 1/4 African American) whom we will ask to enroll in the course to participate in formative and summative research related to it.  The test will gather information about the usability and salience of the course as well as its preliminary efficacy. The course faculty and research team’s observation of participants’ responses to the course and the

embedded interactive exercises and the results of semi-structured interviews with a subsample of 20 participants will enable us to further refine the course.
3. Background
Family caregivers, the backbone of care for the upwards of 7 million community-
dwelling individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease in the U.S., provide at least 85% of the care these individuals receive,
[ADDRESS_1152286] home care and safety measures and navigate an intricate, complex, and opaque system without the benefit of a compass or a translator – and largely without understanding their role in or having the skills for navigating the system.  A variety of interventions, including our own, have demonstrated benefit in enhancing caregivers’ caregiving capacities, with resulting positive outcomes for both caregivers and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
15-[ADDRESS_1152287] employed distance delivery means, thus enabling rural caregivers and others precluded by [CONTACT_830302]-person programs to take part in the intervention programs.

Early findings from the synchronous/asynchronous online three-arm randomized Tele-
Savvy trial provide encouraging support for this project. The online Tele-Savvy psychoeducational caregiving course we propose appears to work and caregivers do fully participate in its asynchronous component. We used multilevel mixed models to test for group, time, and group-by-time effects for each of the outcomes. Results from the first [ADDRESS_1152288] on CES-D-assessed caregiver depression (p<.001) with the active group showing significant decreases over time (p<.001).  We found a significant group-by-time effect on caregiver perceived strain (p<.001) with the active group demonstrating significant reductions over time (p<.001) and the waitlist control group demonstrating significant increases (p=.010). Likewise, there was a significant group-by-time effect (p=.001) on caregivers’ reactions to care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_830285] (RMBPC) with significant reductions over time among the active caregivers (p=.001). Caregiver competence likewise demonstrated a significant group-by-time effect (p-.009), with the active group demonstrating significant increases over time (p<.001). Findings regarding caregivers’ mastery were comparable: a significant group-by-time effect (p=.003) with the active group demonstrating significant increases over time 
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19

(p<.001).  Canvas-based analytics indicate that participants were highly adherent in viewing the 36 asynchronous 8-15 minute daily video lessons, spending, on average, more than 8 hours watching the videos over the course of the 43-day program.
Much of the “normal work” of caregiving involves guiding PLWD through days at home 
and in the community that are as calm, engaging, and event-free as possible, and that has been the mastery-development focus of much of MPI [INVESTIGATOR_48397]’s work.
21  The 
COVID-19 pandemic, however, brings into stark focus caregivers’ need to acquire the knowledge, skills, and competence to maintain care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ safety and ensure their safe navigation of the healthcare system. Functioning as a public health/infection control expert and healthcare system navigator requires skills and knowledge that family members do not possess as a matter of course.  
4. Study Endpoints The key study outcomes are measures of caregiver psychological well-being and 
confidence in their ability to provide effective care to the PLWD. The study ends after participants complete the online course and the follow-up interviews conducted to gather these study endpoints/outcomes .
5. Study Intervention / Design The proposed study is a two-group waitlist control design to study a psychoeducational 
intervention for dementia caregivers. The study has two phases: 1) course development and 2) testing.
Our overall approach to course development and testing is one that we have used 
successfully in MPI [INVESTIGATOR_48397]’s work to produce video instructional content for dementia family caregivers.  End-users are engaged throughout in both developi[INVESTIGATOR_830286], crafting the granular elements of the curriculum (e.g., text and video content for individual lessons), and providing formative feedback on the prototype product.  The approach to co-production of care that informs the sense of mastery to be developed is one that MPI [INVESTIGATOR_830287]’s Integrated Memory Care Clinic (IMCC),
22 Emory’s patient-centered 
medical home for PLWD.  
6. Procedures InvolvedAim 1 [Weeks 0-24].  Table [ADDRESS_1152289] team, other clinical and caregiver experts, and our educational design consultant.  The Design Studio’s process is deeply grounded in the early and frequent involvement of potential end users in product design and uses a variety of brainstorming techniques to challenge and refine an emerging product – like 
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19

this course.  This process it will play an important role in developi[INVESTIGATOR_830288] 1 prototype pandemic caregiving course.  This is a design, not a research, activity.
The Design Studio activities will be conducted in three stages using focus group 
methods. To facilitate group discussion by [CONTACT_55473], the sample size for each Design Studio session will be limited to 8-10 participants per group, an average of nine per group. Drs. Epps and Perkins (co-Investigators) will lead these discussions with one acting as moderator and the other as trained observer. The observer will assist with the process and record observations of participants’ nonverbal interactions and behaviors. Design Studio sessions will last approximately 60-[ADDRESS_1152290] Weeks

•Aim [ADDRESS_1152291] initial draft outline of the key sections and up to 36 
specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_830289].  The outline will serve as the basis for course design activities with our instructional designers and specialists, and these together – the topic outline and rough course design – will provide the material for our first Design Studio exercise. We emphasize the draft nature of this outline.  The Design Studio process emphasizes empathy with the end-user experience as the driver of end-product design.
23-27 We will use the empathize/define phases of 
design thinking to understand how generally to design the course and associated elements and use ideation/prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_830290]. Constructed as it has been from an “expert” perspective, the draft document likely omits significant elements of and perspectives on caregiver mastery development that will need to be incorporated into the eventual design of the proposed course.
In the first audio-recorded Design Studio exercise, to be held online if necessary, we will 
engage IMCC Advisors and a diverse group of other caregivers in an initial exploration of the overall objectives and the preliminary form and content of the course. After the first group, the team, led by [CONTACT_830303], will analyze the transcripts, using a thematic analysis approach,
28 an iterative process that will involve deconstructing text, 
identifying salient themes, conceptualizing relationships, and synthesizing results. Two primary coders (Epps and Perkins) will independently code the first transcript. A 
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19

secondary coder (Clevenger) will review the coding and reconcile any differences. Codes will be discussed among the entire project team to ensure concordance and reliability. This analysis will guide refinements of the course and course materials as well as development of draft text and video scripts for two topic segments.

These materials will serve as the stimuli for the next audio-recorded Design Studio 
convened with IMCC caregiver Advisors, other caregivers, and also clinicians and Roybal Center Advisors.  In this session, the revised outline will be subject to group scrutiny and suggestions. Again, team analysis of the results of the exercise will address key development questions: 
•What’s missing? 
•Where is emphasis needed? 
•What’s irrelevant? 
•What is/are key takeaway lesson(s)? 
•Do educational methods encourage involvement and promote the specific 
caregiving mastery at which we are aiming? 
Following analysis comparable to that employed after the first Design Studio session, we 
will produce a near-final course design, attending to issues of the “feel” and readability of the course, the exercises and opportunities for interactivity to be included, and the methods by [CONTACT_830304].  We will also develop penultimate versions of course text and video asset scripts and begin production of caregiver and instructor manuals and other course materials. 
These materials will provide the grist for the third Design Studio exercise, again an 
audio-recorded session convened primarily with caregiver participants but with some clinical and educational expert participation. We ask the same “What do you think?” questions about the content, structure, format, and mode of delivery of the course and 
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19
Page 8 of 21 Protocol Version: ADD VERSION NUMBER AND DATE
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
the proposed instructional videos (e.g., Is a lecture format acceptable?  Should there be a combination of graphics and voiceover? Would some kind of embedded enactment be useful? What exercises might prompt interaction and foster mastery?).  
Following an analysis comparable to those described above, the team will go into full 
production mode.  We will work with the School of Nursing instructional design team to finalize scripting for the possibly as many as 36 segments, finalize the look, feel, and flow of the course, embed it on Canvas, a cloud-based learning management platform used by [CONTACT_830305], and move to the production of an accompanying caregiver manual and other associated course materials. The team will shoot the video assets – likely small (4-8 minute) mini-talks provided by [CONTACT_830306] – that will introduce and reinforce the text and pi[INVESTIGATOR_830294].  Based on previous experience, video production should take no more than 3-5 days, then editing and integrating these materials into the final course should take no more than three weeks.
Aim 2 [Weeks 16-52].  Drawing on the recruitment resources identified above, we will 
recruit [ADDRESS_1152292] completed their baseline quantitative interviews, we will randomly assign half (25) to immediately enroll in and begin the course; we will inform the other half of the group (25) that the course will be open for their enrollment after a waiting period of approximately eight weeks, the time it will take the immediate participants to complete the course.  All participants will again be interviewed at that 8-week point, following the immediate group’s course completion and prior to the wait-list group’s enrollment. All will be interviewed again [ADDRESS_1152293] participants.

The Aim 2 baseline, midpoint, and final instrument-based interviews for all participants and audio-recorded semi-structured follow-up formative evaluation interviews with selected participants will be conducted by [CONTACT_830307]-Investigator Perkins; a protocol used in Hepburn’s Tele-Savvy study will be employed to identify and respond to indications of extreme caregiver stress.  Focus groups (Aim 1 ) will be conducted online, led by [CONTACT_830308].   
Three sources of information will enable us to move forward with the preparation of a revised 
course.  The interactive elements of the course (discussion board, exercises and reflections) and the course instructor’s observations will enable us to gauge caregivers’ understanding of, reactions to, and apparent benefit from individual segments of the course.  The Canvas platform allows us to monitor caregivers’ course behaviors (e.g., time spent on segments, repeated viewing of segments, extent of participation in interactive components). This information may point to the relative importance of segments as well as the usability of interactive components. The post-course qualitative interviews with caregivers will provide extensive information about topic matter and the usability and acceptability of course material and overall course design.  Data from these sources will begin to flow from the point of the gathering of baseline data from the first wave of participants (approximately week 22) and will continue through the qualitative interviews with course participants (approximately week 48).  MPI [INVESTIGATOR_830296]’s efforts to distill these data strands into practical course revision design activities with the instructional design consultant team to map the steps needed to produce a final course version by [CONTACT_495988]’s end.  
7. Data and Specimen BankingDe-identified interview-gathered questionnaire data regarding caregivers’ psychological well-
being and self-asessment of competency will be stored in REDCap for analysis. De-identified transcriptions of audio-recorded Aim 2 open-ended qualitative interviews will be stored on Emory’s instance of Box, accessible only to the study investigators. All study participants will be assigned ID numbers. The file linking identities to IDs will be stored separately on the PI’s encrypted work computer. De-identified transcriptions of audio-recorded Aim 1 design sessions will also be stored on Emory’s instance of Box, accessible only to the study investigators.
The final dataset will include standardized measures of caregiver well-being and competence 
and will be stored in PI [INVESTIGATOR_830297]’s office in the Emory University Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing in Atlanta, Georgia. Data from this study will be available to qualified researchers through a data sharing agreement that is fully consistent with NIH data sharing policies and applicable laws and regulations as well as official policies and practices established by [CONTACT_328605]. Although these data will be de-identified prior to release for sharing, there remains a possibility of deductive disclosure of participants with unusual characteristics. Therefore, this data sharing agreement will require: 1) a commitment only to use the data for research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; 2) a commitment to securing the data using appropriate computer technology; and 3) a commitment to destroy or return the data after analyses are completed.

8. Sharing of Results with Participants
Results of each Design Studio will be shared with participants as each iteration of the course is 
developed. At study’s end, we will prepare a lay report detailing the results of the study and distribute this report to study participants.
9. Study Timelines
For those caregivers engaged in the Aim [ADDRESS_1152294] Aim 1 recruitment and enrollment to occupy a span of approximately 5 months, and 
Aim 2 recruitment and enrollment – which will begin while we are still engaged in Aim 1 activities – is expected to span about [ADDRESS_1152295] month 4-9.
The study as a whole will take one year.  Aim 1 activities will be complete by [CONTACT_830309]; Aim [ADDRESS_1152296]’s end.
10. Subject PopulationWe will seek to enroll family members (or friends) who self-identify as a principal caregiver and 
the principal companion of a community-dwelling PLWD during healthcare encounters.  We will provide verbal and written instructions in how to access and use the course, provide a schedule for their completion of the course over the next 6-[ADDRESS_1152297] 10 caregivers to participate in semi-structured interviews (total n=20) based on varying caregiver characteristics and findings from baseline quantitative data (e.g., stress levels, gender, race/ethnicity). Interviews will last approximately 45 minutes and will ask questions about the overall contribution of the course to their own perceived sense of competence as caregivers and healthcare navigators during the pandemic. We will also seek their responses to the course (Acceptable? Usable? Relevant? Enough? Too much? What’s missing? How to improve?). We will provide $[ADDRESS_1152298] also be able to read and speak English and be able to access the online course materials. 
11. Vulnerable Populations
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19
Page 11 of 21 Protocol Version: ADD VERSION NUMBER AND DATE
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
The study does not include individuals who lack decision-making capacity or may be susceptible to undue influence or coercion.
12. Local Number of Participants
We plan to recruit 30 participants in phase 1 of the study, designing the course, and 100 
participants in phase 2, testing the course. All participants will be recruited from networks in Georgia. 
13. Recruitment Methods
Core pi[INVESTIGATOR_830298] a diverse group of caregiver to address Aims 1 and 2. MPI [INVESTIGATOR_830297]’s IMCC has patient panel of >[ADDRESS_1152299] that has been integrally involved in the development and vetting of all aspects of the IMCC. The statewide Georgia Memory Net serves >300 dementia families, many in rural Georgia (Hepburn). Emory’s NIA-supported Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (Hepburn, Co-I) maintains a large registry of caregivers willing to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Core team members’ ongoing work with African American church communities (Epps), MCI empowerment activities (Hepburn), and MPI [INVESTIGATOR_48397]’s near-completed Tele-Savvy project can further ensure successful recruitment from program completers (25% African American).
Direct care providers (physicians, nurse practitioners) will not  recruit participants.
Recruitment and Recruitment Materials for Aim [ADDRESS_1152300] members from the IMCC and MCI empowerment center, as well as community advisors to the Emory Roybal Center to take part in these design activities.  Invitations will be made through phone calls and emails directly to these individuals.
Recruitment and Recruitment Materials for the Aim 2 Randomized Control Trial.
We plan to draw on the contacts available to each of the study investigators and to the 
broader networks with which they are affiliated (e.g., the national Alzheimer’s Disease Centers and Roybal Centers) to provide information to potential participants.  Potential subjects will be contact[CONTACT_830310].  
We will advertise online, through Social media, such as Twitter, Facebook and 
Instagram, and through Emory Healthcare on-hold message services. We will ask 
organizations in our network to use their normal methods of communication (e.g., their 
newsletters) provide a link to the study announcement which will be posted on our 
Roybal Center website (emorycaregiving.org).  These announcements and scripts are 
attached to this application in the Recruitment Materials section.

Eligibility Determination
Screening will be conducted by [CONTACT_830311] (phone or videoconference) by [CONTACT_830312]. 
Is the potential subject providing care for a family member or friend? If so:
oDoes that person have a confirmed diagnosis of dementia?
oIs the person living in the community?
oIs the caregiver co-residing with the person?
oIs the caregiver the main caregiver for the person?
Does the caregiver have a computer with internet access?
Can the person read and understand English?
The screening calls or videoconferences will not be recorded. No identifying information 
about the screening calls, including the person’s IP address, will be recorded.
Payments to Participants.
We will provide $25.00 gift cards (e.g., Visa cards) to participants for each interview in 
which they take part.  All trial participants will be asked to take part in a baseline interview and then subsequent interviews 3 and 5 months later.  About 20% will be asked to take part in focus groups prior to their enrollment in the course, and about 20% will be asked to take part in semi-structured interviews following course completion.  Thus, the maximum payment for any participant would be $100.[ADDRESS_1152301], verbally or via course message or email, to withdraw 
from the study at any time. Likewise, the study team may also withdraw a participant if their caregiving situation changes (e.g., if the person for whom they are providing care is institutionalized or dies).
15. Risks to Participants
We believe that caregivers taking part in the trial of the Caregiving During Crisis program will be 
exposed to very low risks.  The two main risks are of transient emotional distress and breach of confidentiality.  These are described below.
Transient emotional distress.  As persons providing care to a person living with dementia and 
doing so under the strains of the threat and restrictions of a pandemic, subjects in this study 
are already very likely to be experiencing a higher than normal level of stress and distress.  The content of the course will draw their attention to their situation in ways that might make them more acutely aware of their distress or cause them to lower the defenses they might have 
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19
Page 13 of 21 Protocol Version: ADD VERSION NUMBER AND DATE
IRB Form SOCIOB [ADDRESS_1152302] matter raised and the questions posed in the research interviews, the focus groups, and semi-structured interviews may also call attention to distressing matters and situations.
 Based on our research experience with similar study subjects and the same questions and 
methods, we judge the occurrence of such distress to be relatively infrequent (perhaps in 25% of cases), of low magnitude (perhaps a [ADDRESS_1152303]), of very brief duration, and fully reversible.  The research interviewer will be trained to recognize such events  and to provide ways to back away from and calm them.  The participating investigators who would conduct the focus groups or semi-structured interviews are experienced in working with dementia caregivers and in managing such transient events in ways that permit the caregiver to work through them in a brief, respectful, and calming manner.
We can see no procedures in the study that might produce currently unforeseeable risks, and 
we can see no procedures that might put others at risk who are not in the study.
Threats to Confidentiality.
The Aim 2 study will gather personal information on all participants (name, email, address, 
etc.). This information will not be attached to any research study file.  A unique ID number will be assigned to each participant, and all research documents pertaining to that participant (the data stored in REDCap or the transcriptions of the focus groups and individual interviews) will only be stored using that ID number.  The file with baseline personal information and the file that links personal identifiers to ID numbers will be stored separately in the Emory encrypted computer in PI [INVESTIGATOR_830297]’s office.  Any later sharing of data from the study will be done according to an NIH-compliant data and resource sharing agreement, and those data will be completely de-identified.
16. Potential Benefits to ParticipantsAlthough we are careful not to assert this to potential study participants, we believe the 
program will provide them with knowledge and skills that will help them to better negotiate the additional dementia caregiving challenges they face during this time of Coronavirus pandemic – and in possible future crises. 
In terms of a knowledge contribution to the field: If this trial demonstrates positive preliminary 
efficacy in reducing caregiver distress and enhancing caregiver mastery, it will add to the evidence that a psychoeducational approach (developi[INVESTIGATOR_25110], knowledge, and competence through an active and interactive learning strategy) is effective with this important population. This study’s approach is aligned with other work by [CONTACT_830313][INVESTIGATOR_830299].  
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19
Page 14 of 21 Protocol Version: ADD VERSION NUMBER AND DATE
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
In terms of the caregiver knowledge that would be strengthened: the program aims to increase caregivers’ knowledge about ways to manage day-to-day life with a person living with dementia, knowledge about infection control practices to minimize risk of viral infection; and knowledge about navigating the healthcare system.
As noted in #13, above, participants will receive a $25.[ADDRESS_1152304] (e.g., Visa card) for each 
research interview, focus group, and/or semi-structured interview in which they take part. 
17. Data Analysis, Management and ConfidentialityQuantitative data will be entered at the time of each Aim [ADDRESS_1152305] tablet computer and saved on Emory’s secure REDCap platform.  All data entry screens are set up in REDCap and, where possible, include data delimiters (i.e., skip patterns, valid range limits) to ensure correctness and minimize missing data.  Data will be exported weekly and analyzed for data cleaning and verification. Upon completion of each cohort data-gathering point, all data will be merged for scale computation, aggregation, and analysis. We will use NVIVO [ADDRESS_1152306] for group, time, and group-by-time effects for each of the 
outcomes (caregiver anxiety, depression, burden, stress, and mastery). In preliminary analyses, descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be examined to identify outliers and ensure integrity of all data.  For all multi-item scales, internal consistency will be examined using Cronbach’s alpha and associated statistics (e.g., item-total correlations, alpha if item deleted).  Preliminary analyses will examine baseline differences among completers and non-completers and by [CONTACT_30157] (immediate/delayed) as a randomization check using 2-group comparison tests (t-tests and non-parametric equivalent tests for continuous variables (normally or non-normally distributed) and Chi-Square tests for categorical variables). The association of predisposing factors (demographics, Caregiving history, relationship and care recipi[INVESTIGATOR_537048]) with changes in outcomes over time will be examined to identify significant covariates.  Where significant associations with baseline measures are detected, these potential confounders will be controlled for in subsequent analyses using covariate model adjustments.
We will use repeated measures analysis to test 2 time by 2 group intervention (Immediate 
Participation in wave1 + immediate participation in wave 2) vs waitlist control (wave 1 + wave 2) change from baseline to post intervention at 8 weeks elapsed. Given final expected sample sizes of 45 subjects in each group (assuming 10% attrition), we will be powered at 80% with a 5% level of significance to detect moderate-to-large effect sizes for the group (f=0.297), time (f=0.300), and group-by-time (f=0.300) effects. To examine intervention effects over time for the combined intervention groups (Immediate wave 1 (week 16-24) + Immediate wave 2 (week 24-32) + waitlist wave 1 participants after course participation (week 24-32)), we will use repeated measures mainly focused on pre-to-post intervention effects for the [ADDRESS_1152307] that altered  their “baseline at 24 weeks” from the other 2 groups. Given the 
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19

sample sizes of 25 subjects in each of these 3 groups, we will be powered at 80% with a 5% level of significance to detect moderate-to-large effect sizes for the group (f=0.381), time (f=0.381), and group-by-time (f=0.381) effects.
To address Aim [ADDRESS_1152308]-intervention semi-structured 
interviews.  We hope to pursue three lines of inquiry in this analysis that will be crucial for the next steps in our work: (1) In what ways might the overall concept of caregiver as healthcare navigator be sharpened?  (2) In what ways might the delivery mechanism of the course be enhanced to improve caregiver learning (e.g., more interactivity)?  (3) In what ways might individual components of the course be enhanced to improve caregiver learning (e.g., different formats; additional videos)? We expect that these analyses will provide compelling evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the course.  
18. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants and Confidentiality of 
Participants’ identifiable data
Protection of Privacy Interests.
There are very few threats to participants’ privacy interests involved in the study, and 
below we describe how we will minimize and manage those threats:
Except in the focus groups in which we will ask 20% of subjects to take part, there is 
no direct contact [CONTACT_830314].  Participation in these focus groups is entirely voluntary; no identification is provided about participants to other participants, and participants can choose to take part without video.
The only personal information to be obtained will be gathered in baseline 
interviews; we have described above the measures we will take to remove identifiers from the data stored in REDCap
The research interviewer will be trained by [CONTACT_830315].  Training will involve simulated research interviews conducted with project investigators by [CONTACT_830316]. 
The focus groups and semi-structured interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_83671], all of whom are experienced in interacting with caregivers and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_830300].
The only member of the research team who will have access to sources of private 
information about the participants will be PI [INVESTIGATOR_830297]; no other team member will have or be granted access to that information.
As noted above in #15, all confidential data will be separated from REDCap files and 
transcripts, all of which will use ID numbers, and the confidential material will be stored 
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19
Page 16 of 21 Protocol Version: ADD VERSION NUMBER AND DATE
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
separately in PI [INVESTIGATOR_830297]’s Emory encrypted computer.  None of the data from the study will be entered into participant’s medical records.
We will follow NIH policies in retaining and destroying identified study information. 
Audio-recordings will be destroyed at study’s end.
19. Economic Burden to Participants
Participants are asked to contribute their time to the study but no cost to participants is be expected.
20. Consent Process
The consent process will occur through distance means, by [CONTACT_45933], 
in the following manner:
1.  Appointment-Making. A potential subject will contact, by [CONTACT_61529], one of the 
three study team members identified on the project recruitment document (Clevenger, 
Hepburn, and Reed).  If the contact [CONTACT_42133], a return email or phone call (if the person provides a number) will be made in order to set the time for a longer call.
2.  Consent Call.  This call initiates the consent process
In this call, following a brief description of the study, the study team member will 
establish the eligibility of the person for the study (see # 13, above)
If the person is eligible, the team member will more fully describe the study, study 
procedures (what is being asked), and study risks and protections; at each point, we will ask if the person has questions or if we can provide additional information
To ensure understanding, we will ask potential subjects to describe back what they 
understand the study to be about and what they will be expected to do
At the end of the call, we will determine if the person wishes to voluntarily consent 
to participation in the trial. If so, we will describe the next steps.
We anticipate these conversations will take approximately 30 minutes.3.  Consent Documentation.    
If the person indicates agreement to participate, we will inform him or her that we 
will be sending, by [CONTACT_65056] (at the person’s preference) the consent document (two copi[INVESTIGATOR_830301]) that will include all of the information discussed in the Consent Call.
When the person receives the consent document s/he will be asked to either sign 
the document and mail it back to us or to sign and scan the signature [CONTACT_830317].
We will make it clear both in the Consent Call and in our mailed or emailed 
transmission of the consent document, that we are available to answer any additional questions s/he might have before completing the consent process.
Protocol Title : Mastering the Challenges of Dementia Family Caregiving in a Time of COVID-19
Page 17 of 21 Protocol Version: ADD VERSION NUMBER AND DATE
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
We will also make clear, in the Consent Call and the consent documentation process 
that we are available throughout the study to address any questions or concerns the person might have about the study or participating in it.
The interval between the Consent Call and Consent Documentation process could be a 
matter of hours, if email is the vehicle of transmission, to days (if mail is used).  This interval should allow sufficient time for participant reflection about consent – as well as the generation of additional questions the person might have about participation.
There is nothing in the recruitment or consent process that could lend itself to pressure 
potential participants, either through coercion or undue influence, into participation, and the compensation offered for participation is modest, at best.  
21. Setting
As noted in #13, above, recruitment of participants will leverage the study investigator 
team’s networks of dementia care practices throughout the state of Georgia as well as national Alzheimer’s Disease Center and Roybal Center networks.  Recruitment will occur entirely online. The Recruitment document will be posted on the Emory Roybal Center’s website (see above).
The Caregiving During Crisis course will be entirely online, delivered via a secure Canvas 
platform.
Research interviews, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews will be conducted on 
Emory’s encrypted version of Zoom
The project will not have a community advisory board.
22. Resources AvailableThe research is being conducted as an administrative supplement to Emory’s Roybal 
Center for Caregiving Mastery; as such, it will have administrative support through the Center.  It is, as described above, also being conducted within the context of the study team members’ several involvements in local, state, and national engagements, all of which are directly related to issues of dementia care and the support and development of the capacity of family caregivers to provide effective care to community-dwelling persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders.
Recruitment of [ADDRESS_1152309] 1,000 eligible caregivers, and our extended reach, especially through the NIA-supported network of Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (with a number of which we have worked closely) there are many thousands more. 
The administrative supplement adds effort in the Roybal Center to both investigators 
Clevenger and Hepburn, and it provides time for investigator Epps.

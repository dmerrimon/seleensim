Protocol 
Summary; 
Section 3 
Objectives, Estimands and EndpointsUpdated the following secondary  
 endpoints:
•Achievement of an 
Investigator’s Static Global Assessment (ISGA) score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline at all time points;
•Achievement of an ISGA 
score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) at all time points;
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For binary and categorical endpoints, 
“proportion” is not an endpoint, it is summary for binary and categorical endpoints.
Protocol Summary, 1.2 Schema, 4.1 Overall Design; 9.2 Sample 
Size 
DeterminationUpdated sample size to 92 participants. The in-person assessment will be used for the 
primary analysis.  Because there is only one postbaseline assessment, completers will be used for the primary analysis (ie, observed cases data).  If a 10% dropout is assumed, 92 participants are required (total, 46 per arm).CCI

Estimands
Only  discontinuation of study  intervention will be considered as an intercurrent event.
The primary  estimand of this study is a while -on-treatment estimand , which estimates the 
treatment effect of crisaborole compared with vehicle at Week 6 or EOT.  It includes the 
following 5 attributes: 
Population: Participants ≥45years of age with SD without active skin ulceration;
Variable: non- longitudinal endpoints a t Week 6/EOT;
Treatment condition: crisaborole 2% BID or vehicle;
Intercurrent event: all data after an intercurrent event of discontinuation of study  
intervention will be excluded, data at W eek 6 /EOT will be included;
Population -level summary: difference in LSM for continuous endpoint sand 
difference in proportion of participants with response for binary endpoints at 
Week 6/EOT between crisaborole ointment, 2%, BID versus vehicle.
See Section 9.1.1 for additional information on estimands.
Overall Design:
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, vehicle- controlled, parallel -group, 
proof -of-concept study enrolling approximately  70 eligible participants randomized into the 
double -blind treatment period in a 1:1 ratio to receive BID crisaborole ointment 2% or 
vehicle for 43 days.

Page 282.INTRODUCTION
Stasis dermatitis (SD) affects a significant proportion of the older population. A slight female 
preponderance has been reported in SD most likely  due to pregnancy -related stress on the 
lower -extremity  venous sy stem, with many  women experiencing earlier and more severe 
derangement of lower -extremity  venous valvular function.  Studies have estimated an 
approximately  6-7% prevalence of the condition in patients older than 50 years, which 
translates into approximatel y 15-20million patients older than 50 years with stasis dermatitis 
in the [LOCATION_002].  This finding makes SD twice as prevalent as psoriasis and only  slightly  
less prevalent than seborrheic dermatitis.  The risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_475250]; when considering onl y adults older than 70 years, the prevalence of SD 
in developed countries may  exceed 20%.1,[ADDRESS_609460], 
morbid obesity , chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease (COPD), congestive heart failu re 
(CHF), chronic liver disease with ascites, chronic kidney  disease (CKD) with or without 
nephrotic s yndrome, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary embolism and inferior vena cava (IVC) 
filter placement, IVC thrombosis, iliac vein thrombosis, and proximal deep vei n thrombosis 
(DVT) of the lower extremities.  Tissue hy poxia in edematous skin of the lower extremities 
due to one or more of these conditions produces ery thematous/ discolored skin, skin scaling 
and dry ness, pruritus, and painful extremities.  As ly mphede ma and venous insufficiency  
(VI) and venous h ypertension (VHTN) progress, increasing hydrostatic pressures in vascular 
watershed (h ypoxic) areas in the region of the ankle are observed.  Venous reflux (or reversal 
of venous blood flow) promotes peripheral edema and the SD immunohistochemical changes 
become prominent particularly in the region of the medial malleolus.  Generally , edema and 
spongiosis originating from the feet and ankles progress proximally  toward the knees.  
Inadequately  treated inflammation associated with SD may  become secondarily  infected 
resulting in additional limitation of activities of daily  living and reduced quality  of life.
Histologicall y, SD is characterized by [CONTACT_475316][INVESTIGATOR_475251], spongiosis 
and proliferati on of small blood vessels in the papi[INVESTIGATOR_475252].  This morphologicall y altered 
skin is littered with extravasated ery throcy tes and serum macromolecules which act as

2.3.Benefit/Risk Assessment
Crisaborole ointment is approved for the treatment of AD in pediatric and adult patients.  I ts 
safet y profile is well -characterized and positive benefit/risk assessment has been established 
in the treatment of AD.  The potential benefits of crisaborole ointment, 2%, for treatment of 
SD have not been established.  I t is not known if SD may  improve, worsen, or remain 
unchanged during the treatment period.  
Because crisaborole impacts inflammatory  pathway s relevant to SD, it is anticipated that 
study  intervention may  ameliorate lower extremity  SD signs and sy mptoms.  Considering 
anticipated benefits and potential risks of the investigational product(s), as well as the low 
risk associated with protocol- specified stud y procedures, the potential benefits to study  
participat ion outweigh potential risks of short -term exposure to topi[INVESTIGATOR_475255]. 
Participants will likely  have one or more ongoing, chronic conditions which had predisposed 
to the development of SD.  Management of these conditions will be provided by  [CONTACT_78193] (HCP) alread y caring for the participant.  Principal I nvestigators and 
Sub-Investigators will be required to record any  interactions between the participant and 
non-study  HCP throughout the study  period in the electronic database and if any  adverse 
events (AEs) include assessments of relatedness, causality , and severity  (as appropriate) 
within the electronic database.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y 
expected adverse events of cri saborole ointment, 2% may  be found in the Investigator’s 
Brochure, which is the single reference safet y document (SRSD) for this study.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall DesignStudy C3291038 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group, 
proof-of-concept study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and local tolerability of 6 weeks of treatment with crisaborole in adult participants with SD without active skin ulceration.  Approximately 70 eligible participants will be randomized into the double-blind treatment period in a 1:1 ratio to receive crisaborole ointment, 2%, or vehicle twice daily for 6 weeks.
The study will recruit male and female participants aged ≥45 years with a clinical diagnosis 
of SD.  Participants who meet all inclusion but none of the exclusion criteria presented in Section 5will be eligible to participate in the study.  If a participant meets any of the 
exclusion criteria, the participant will be excluded.CCI

Page 32The total duration of participation in the study  will be up to 14 weeks, including up to 
4 weeks for screening, a 6- week double -blind treatment period, and a follow -up period of 
4weeks after treatment completion.  
Study  enrollment and management will be de -centralized, where participants do not visit an 
investigator or a clinic for clinical assessment.  The participants will participate in the study  
at home.  The sponsor (or designee) will provide home visits by  [CONTACT_475319] (HVP), remote contact b y telemedicine, and clinical database electronic c ase 
report forms (eCRFs), eDiary, and other electronic data entries from 3rd party  vendors for 
study  data collection . 
Participants who withdraw from further study  intervention treatment (but do not withdraw 
consent for further data gathering) should conti nue to complete all scheduled assessments at 
the EOT visit and complete the follow -up phase of the study .
4.2.Scientific Rationale for Study Design
SD prevalence is up to 2% in the 5th decade of life, 6 -7% in the 6th decade of life, and more 
than 20% bey ond ag e [ADDRESS_609464] one or more concurrent medical conditions which 
predispose20,21to lymphedema or VI and VHTN resulting in SD lesions: morbid obesity , 
COPD, coronary  artery  disease/CHF, DVT with or without I VC filter placement, diabetes 
mellitus, and varicose veins of the lower extremities.  
Extrapolating from AD clinical trial efficacy  data for BID crisaborole applications, efficacy  
by [CONTACT_10585] [ADDRESS_609465] been demonstrated to 
be safe, well tolerated, and efficacious in participants with mild to moderate AD in previous 
clinical trials (see the Investigator’s Brochure [IB]).  Crisaborole ointment, 2%, B ID is 
proposed as an appropriate dose strength and regimen based on the favorable benefit: risk 
profile established in mild to moderate AD for patients age 3 months and older.   The 2% dose 
strength is the maximum feasible for the ointment formulation.
4.4.End of Study Definition
A participant is considered to have completed the study  if he/she has completed all phases of 
the study  including the End of Study  (follow -up) visit.
The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study .

Study  intervention (also known as study  ointment) will be applied to the lower 
extremities only .
An even lay er of ointment, targeting 3 mg / cm2, should be applied to the lower 
extremities (knees to feet) twice a day  at approximately  the same times each day .  
One fingertip unit (FTU) is defined as the amount of topi[INVESTIGATOR_475271] a standard tube onto a fingertip (end of the finger to the first 
crease in the finger).  One FTU is sufficient to cover an area of skin the size of 2 
handprints (2% BSA) of the participant.  A han dprint refers to a flat hand with 
fingers in a closed position.  Approximately  5 FTUs would be required to treat the 
skin from knee to ankle and dorsum of foot of 1 leg.  
Further details are supplied in the investigational product (IP) manual. 
Study  intervention should be applied to the lower extremities (knees to feet) for 
the entire duration (6 weeks) of the stud y, even when SD lesions have resolved or

Blind Break (I RT) The I RTwill be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. I n 
case of an emergency , the investigator or sponsor has the sole 
responsibility  for determining if unblinding of a participant’s 
treatment assignment is warranted. Participant safety must alway s 
be the first consideration in making such a determination.  If the 
investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator 
should make every  effort to contact [CONTACT_1152] a 
participant’s treatment assignment unless this could dela y 
emergency  treatment of the participant.  If a participant’s treatment 
assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 
[ADDRESS_609470] of the study .  
Participants or study  sites will not be unblinded as a result of a 
meeting a futility threshold. 
6.4. Study Intervention Compliance
Participant compliance with study  intervention will be assessed by  [CONTACT_10670]

continue to complete all scheduled assessments at the EOT visit and complete the follow -up 
phase of the stud y.  
Note that discontinuation of study  intervention does not represent withdrawal from the stud y.
If a clinically  significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to, changes from 
baseline in QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s formula [QTcF] )after enrollment , the 
investigator or qualified designee will determine if the participant can continue in the study  
and if an y change in participant management is needed.   This review of the ECG printed at 
the time of collection must be documented. Any new clinicall y relevant finding should b e 
reported as an AE.Discontinuation of study  intervention for abnormal liver function should 
be considered b y the investigator when a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in 
Appendix 5or if the investigat or believes that it is in best interest of the participant.
If signs and s ymptoms of hy persensitivity  are attributable to the study  intervention, including 
contact [CONTACT_22815], it must be discontinued immediately , and appropriate therapy  initiated.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of Incidental Findings by [CONTACT_475340], which is discovered unexpectedly  in the course of a research study  
but is unrelated to the purpose and be yond the aims of the study .
The investigator (dermatologist) must perform medical review of all available lower 
extremity  static, digital images  for incidental findings (eg skin ulcer formation, skin cancer, 
cellulitis) via the central imaging repository .  .  If an unexpected observation is identified, 
and this finding could, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], have a significant health 
consequence, this finding may  be shared by  [CONTACT_475341].  All 
follow -up testing and final diagnosis will be left to the discretion of the medical professionals 
at the site or those with an existing phy sician- patient relationship.  The investigator will be 
responsible for identify ing and reporting an y AEs from incidental findings as described in the 
Adverse Event Reporting section.  
8.1.3. Standardized Static SD Lesion Images: Acquisition, Save and Transfer
At protocol -specified time points, the participant will acquire static digital images of the 
lower extremities using sponsor -provisioned digital im aging equipment.  Images will 
automatically  be saved and transferred to the central digital imaging repository .  Following 
QC checks, images will be available for review by  a Central Reader via a customized read 
portal.  A Central Reader will assess TSS, I SGA, and lesional %BSA according to the 
Central Reader’s Charter.

Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_609473]:
•Complete training for how to set up the digital imaging equipment and Photo Studio 
in the home;
•Successfully acquire, save, and transfer digital images for initial QC checks.  
If it is determined that digital images are not of sufficient quality to remotely assess TSS, 
ISGA, and lesional %BSA, then the HVP can return to the participant’s home to re-instruct the participant how to acquire requisite digital images.
8.1.4. Clinician Reported Outcomes
At all home visits, TSS, ISGA, and lesional %BSA assessments will be assessed in-person by 
[CONTACT_219947].  In addition, the TSS, ISGA, and lesional %BSA will be remotely assessed by [CONTACT_475342].  At unplanned safety assessments these TSS, ISGA, and lesional %BSA are performed only if relevant to the safety event.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Total Sign Score
The TSS is an assessment of the severity of SD skin lesions.  Each of the 4 clinical signs 
(erythema, papulation/elevation [excluding papulation due to lipodermatosclerosis or varicose veins], superficial erosion/denudation, and scaling) across all the treatable SD lesions will be rated using the 4-point severity scale (ranging from 0 to 3 points).  The four sub scores are summed to create the TSS, 13-point scale; ranging from 0 to 12 points, with a higher score representing a higher disease severity.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigator’s Static Global Assessment (ISGA)
The ISGA is a 5-point scale (range 0-4), with a higher score representing a higher disease 
severity.  ISGA is a global assessment of severity of all treatable SD lesions based on erythema, papulation/elevation, superficial erosion/denudation, and scaling.  The assessment will be a static evaluation without regard to the score at a previous visit.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Stasis Dermatitis Lesional % BSA
Assessment of lesional %BSA skin areas of all treatable SD lesions will be performed by [CONTACT_475343], where the full palmar hand of the participant (ie, the participant’s fully extended palm, fingers and thumb together) represents approximately 1% of BSA.  For example, if all lesions added up are equivalent to 4 handprints, then the SD lesional %BSA is 4%.

medical conditions that may  exclude the participant from the study .   
ECG may  be repeated at unplanned safety  assessment at the discretion of the 
investigator.
8.2.5. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
See Appendix 2for the list of clinical laboratory  tests to be performed and to the SoA
for the timing and frequency .
During the pre -randomization period, the investigator must review the results of 
planned laboratory  testing to confirm study  eligibility  and document this review (see 
Appendix 2).  If any unplanned laboratory  testing is performed after randomization, it 
should be completed at a local laboratory , then investigator must review the 
laboratory  report, document this review, and record any  clinicall y relevant changes 
occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the CRF.  The laboratory  reports must 
be filed with the source documents.  Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  
findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged 
by [CONTACT_475346]'s condition.
All laboratory  tests with values considered clinically  significantl y abnormal during 
participation in the study  or within [ADDRESS_609476] dose of study  intervention 
should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer

At the screening home visit, the Fitzpatrick skin- type is documented for each participant.  
Skin Ty pe I-VI will be determined by  [CONTACT_475308].
8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
AE will be reported b y the participant (or, when appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legall y authorized representative).
The investigator and an y qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue 
and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to ass ess whether it 
meets the criteria for classification as an SAE, or that caused the participant to discontinue 
the study  intervention/study  (see Section 7).
In addition, the investigator may  be requested by  [CONTACT_161699] r Safet y to obtain specific follow -up 
information in an expedited fashion. 
8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each participant begins from the time the participant provides informed consent, 
which is obtained before the participant’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing 
any study -related procedure and/or receiving study  intervention), through and including a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_609478] administration of the study intervention.
Crisaborole (PF -06930164)
C3291038
Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_609479] SAE Report Form.
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AE or SAE after the participant has concluded
study  participation . However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y 
time after a participa nt has completed the study , and he/she considers the event to be 
reasonabl y related to the study  intervention, the investigator must promptl y report the SAE to 
[COMPANY_007] using the CT SAE Report Form .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety 
All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the clinical trials (CT) SAE Report Form immediately  and under no circumstance 
should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3.  The investigator will submit any 
updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.
SAEs occurring in a participant after the active collection period has ended are reported to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  if the investigator becom es aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to study  
intervention must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
All nonserious AEs and SA Es occurring in a participant during the active collection period, 
which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_609480] on the CRF all directly  observed and all spontaneously  reported 
AEs and SAEs reported by  [CONTACT_2299].
8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality  of AE and SAE and the
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AEoccurrences.

Page 568.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the investiga tor must pursue and 
obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, 
or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3).
In general, follow -up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications 
and illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a participant death, a summary of available 
autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] Safety . 
Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3.
8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prompt notification by  [CONTACT_11012] a SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towa rds the safet y of participants and the 
safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation are met.
The sponsor has a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  authority  and 
other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a study  inter vention under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply  with country -specific regulatory  requirements 
relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory  authority , Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators.
Investigator safety  reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory  requirements and sponsor policy  and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary .
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify  the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.
8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the study  intervention under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are reportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.

Appendix 4.
Abnormal pregnancy  outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding in female participants and female partners of 
male participants must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report 
Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] drug specificall y 
approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) i s administered in accord with 
authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s 
administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure 
An occupational exposure occu rs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated 
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on an e CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.3.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest
Not Applicable
[IP_ADDRESS]. Lack of Efficacy
The term “lack of efficacy” is incongruous in the clinical trial setting with pre -appro val 
products or marketed products used in a non -approved indication, because the effectiveness 
of the product has not been demonstrated.  Lack of efficacy  for a pre -approval product or for 
a marketed product used in a non -approved indication is reportable only if associated with an 
SAE.

Estimand 2: The second estimand of this study is a composite estimand, which estimates the 
treatment effect of crisaborole compared with vehicle at each time point.  It includes the following 5 attributes: 
•Population: participants ≥45 years of age with SD without active skin ulceration;
•Variable: binary response endpoint per photography assessment, eg, response defined 
as a participant with an ISGA score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2-grade improvement from baseline at each time point; a participant after an intercurrent event of discontinuation of study intervention will be considered a non-responder for the visit of interest;
•Treatment condition: crisaborole 2% BID or vehicle;
•Intercurrent event: there will be no intercurrent event since the discontinuation of 
study intervention is part of the variable definition;
•Population-level summary: difference in proportion of participants with response at 
each time point between crisaborole ointment, 2%, BID and vehicle.
Estimand 2 will be used in analyzing all applicable longitudinal secondary binary 
endpoints.Estimand 3: The third estimand of this study is  a hypothetical estimand, which estimates the treatment effect of crisaborole compared with vehicle at each time point under the scenario of no discontinuation of study intervention.  It includes the following 5 attributes: 
•Population: participants ≥45 years of age with SD without active skin ulceration;
•Variable: percent change from baseline in TSS at each time point;
•Treatment condition: crisaborole 2% BID or vehicle;

[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses for Binary Endpoints
For binary endpoint at each time point, large sample approximation to the difference in 
binominal proportions will be used for testing (Normal Z-test) the superiority of crisaborole ointment, 2%, BID to vehicle and for forming 90% CI’s and calculating p-values (one-sided).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses for Continuous Endpoints
The non-longitudinal continuous data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_475347]. ANCOVA will be used if relevant baseline value and/or other factors are included as covariates. Comparison of crisaborole ointment, 2%, BID to vehicle (providing LSM of the treatments, LSM of the treatment difference, one-sided p-value and 90% CI) will be generated.
The longitudinal continuous data will be analyzed using MMRM with fixed effects of
treatment group, visit, and treatment-group by [CONTACT_23259], without imputation for missing values. If the endpoint is change from baseline, baseline will be included in the model as a covariate. A common unstructured variance-covariance matrix will be used, provided it converges . If this is a convergence issue, other type of covariance matrix such as 
first order autoregressive, compound symmetry will be used.   Comparison of crisaborole 
ointment, 2%, BID to vehicle (providing LSM of the treatments, LSM of the treatment difference, one-sided p-value and 90% CI) at each time point during the first 6 weeks will be generated using this model.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Analyses for Categorical Endpoints
The frequency and percentage for each category will be presented for category endpoints.
9.4.2. Primary Endpoint/Estimand Analyses
Percent change from baseline in TSS at Week 6/EOT based on HVP in person assessments

will be analyzed using an ANOVA model that includes treatment group as a factor (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) based on Estimand 1 using FAS.
Achievement of an ISGA success and ISGA clear/almost clear at Week 6/EOT based on in-
person assessment will be analyzed using the method described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] using 
Estimand 1 and FAS.
Percent change from baseline in TSS and %BSA based on Central Readers assessments will 
be analyzed using MMRM as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Missing data are assumed MAR. 
Under MAR assumption, MMRM will yield unbiased estimates and valid inferences for treatment effects assuming all participants maintain therapy.This analysis will be based on Estimand 3 using FAS.
Achievement of an ISGA success and ISGA clear/almost clear by [CONTACT_475348] [IP_ADDRESS]
Observations after the discontinuation of study intervention or missing values for any reason will be handled by [CONTACT_475349]. Note that this is a composite endpoint in the sense that a response requires the participant completes a visit of interest eg, Week 6, and achieves a response per the defined response criteria (otherwise it is considered a nonresponse).  This method of handling missing response is known as missing response as non-response (MR-NR). The analysis will be based on Estimand 2 using FAS.

study  is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_168069] . 
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical 
questions or problems, participants are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137].  The contact [CONTACT_95504], at a minimum, protocol and study  intervention identifiers, participant study  
numbers, contact [CONTACT_22850], and contact [CONTACT_4664] a contact [CONTACT_475350] a medical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the 
participant’s participation in the study .  The contact n umber can also be used by  [CONTACT_475351]; however, it should be used 
only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigator site 
and the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the 
established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study  team for 
advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y.  For sites other than 
a Pfize r Clinical Research Unit (CRU), the contact [CONTACT_8865] b y the 
participant directl y, and if a participant calls that number, he or she will be directed back to 
the investigator site.

Evaluating, Fol low-up, and Reporting
10.3.1. Definition of AE
AE Definition
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not
considered related to the study  intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of study  intervention.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) 
or other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, consider ed clinically  
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related 
to progression of underl ying disease).
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y intervention administration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
intervention or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent.  Such overdoses should be reported regardless of 
sequelae.
“Lack of efficacy ” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not 
be reported as an AE or SAE.  Such instances will be captured in the efficacy  
assessments.  However, the sig ns, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting 
from lack of efficacy  will be reported as AE or SAE if they  fulfil the definition of 
an AE or SAE.
Crisaborole (PF -06930164)
C3291038
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 1 9July 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 74Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Any clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  findings or other abnormal safet y 
assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by  [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.
The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study  that do not worsen.
10.3.2. Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study , death 
due to progression of disease).
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, that
hypothetically  might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22770], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an ove rnight stay ) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19950]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or 
outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a 
complication prolongs hosp italization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary , the AE 
should be considered serious.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre- existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.
d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability  to conduct 
normal life functions.
Crisaborole (PF -06930164)
C3291038
Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_609490] medical occurrence that, at any dose:
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may  interfere with or 
prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that 
may not be immediatel y life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_402880].  These events 
should usually  be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency  or drug a buse.
Suspected transmission via a [COMPANY_007] product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered serious.  The event may  be suspected from clinical 
symptoms or laboratory  findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a 
Pfize r product.  The terms “suspected transmission” and “transmission” are 
considered s ynon ymous.  These cases are considered unexpected and handled as 
serious expedited cases by [CONTACT_20020].  Such cases are also 
considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate.
10.3.3. Recording/Reportin gand Follow -Up of AE and/or SAE
AE and SAE Recording/Reporting
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording adverse events on the CRF
and for reporting serious adverse events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  These requirements are delineated for 3 ty pes of 
events: (1) SAEs; (2) non -serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the study  
intervention under stud y during pregnancy  or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure.  
It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not 
the same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, th e forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE 
Report Form for reporting of SAE information

When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laborato ry reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event.
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF.
It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s 
medical records to [COMPANY_007] Safety  in lieu of completion of the [COMPANY_007] Safet y/AE/SAE 
CRF page.
There may  be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_19952] b y [COMPANY_007] Safety . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the 
exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_19953] .
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for ea ch AE and SAE reported 
during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: 
Mild: An event that is easily  tolerated by  [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
Moderate: An event that causes suf ficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
every day activities.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 77Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category  utilized for 
rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
Assessment of Causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibility” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.
The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
Alternative causes, such as underl ying disease(s), concomitant therap y, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study  intervention 
administration will be considered and investiga ted.
The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to [COMPANY_007] Safety . However, it is 
very important that the investigator alway s make an assessment of causality for 
every  event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_007] Safet y.
The investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up 
information and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated causality
assessment.
The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements.
If the investigator does not know whether or not the study  intervention caused the 
event, then the event will be handled as “related to study  intervention” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor" and "In addition, if the investigator determines 
that an SAE is associated with study  procedures, the investigator must record this 
causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, an d report such an

The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measureme nts and/or evaluations as medically  indicated or as requested by  [CONTACT_475352]/or causality  of the AE or SAE as fully  as 
possible. This may  include additional laboratory  tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, o r consultation with other health care 
professionals.
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -
up period, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] Safety  with a cop y of an y 
post-mortem findings including histopatholo gy.
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally  completed CRF.
The investigator will submit any  updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours 
of receipt of the information.
10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs
SAE Reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety via an Electronic Data Collection Tool
The primary  mechanism for reporting an SAE to [COMPANY_007] Safety  will be the 
electronic data collection tool.
If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours.
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes 
available.
After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will 
be taken off -line to prevent t he entry  of new data or changes to existing data.
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study  participant or receives updated 
data on a previously  reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see 
next section) or to [COMPANY_007] Safety  by [CONTACT_756].
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the investigator site file.

Definitions:
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below).
If fertility  is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study  intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
1.Preme narchal
2.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documented h ysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
Documented bilateral oophorectom y
For individuals with permanent infertility  due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above, (eg, mulle rian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study  entry .
Note: Documentation for any  of the above conditions can come from the site 
personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examin ation, or 
medical history  interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the 
participant’s medical record for the stud y.
3.Postmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 or older or no menses for 12 months 
without an alternative medical cause.
A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may  be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using 
hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT).

Page 81Collection of Pregnancy  Information:
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the study  
intervention; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing 
and/or being exposed to the study  intervention;
An e xample of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct 
contact [CONTACT_4490] a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she 
is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatm ent or environmental exposure) to 
the study  intervention prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy . 
If a participant or participant’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
participant’s trea tment with the study  intervention, the investigator must report this 
information to [COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, 
regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information rega rding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
participant reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product b y 
inhalation or spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done
irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the 
exposure.  The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see 
below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possibl e, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -
procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly  and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly  related to 
exposure to the study  intervention.
Additional information regarding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further follow-
up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm 
infants to identify  developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator 
will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver

Page 8310.5. Appendix 5: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow -up Assessments
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some participants, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a 
more serious potential outcome.  These participants fail to adapt and therefore are 
"susceptible" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonl y referre d to as drug -induced 
liver injury  (DILI).  Participants who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the 
upper limit of normal (× ULN) should be monitored more frequentl y to determine if they  are 
an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.”
Liver function tests (LFTs) are not required as a routine safet y monitoring procedure in this 
study .  However, should an investigator deem it necessary  to assess LFTs because a 
participant presents with clinical signs/s ymptoms, such LFT results should be managed and 
followed as described below.
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 × ULN) b y several 
days or weeks.  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 × ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important me dical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury  
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the 
participant’s individual baseline values and underlying conditions.  Participants who present 
with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI 
(Hy’s law) cases to definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Participants with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the nor mal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For participants with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN , the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values A ND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller).

Page 84Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 × ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TB ili separated by  [CONTACT_726] a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The participant 
should return t o the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 
[ADDRESS_609494] and AL T and TBili for suspected cases of 
Hy’s Law, additional laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct 
and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time 
(PT)/international normalized ratio (I NR), total bile acids, and alkaline phosphatase. 
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the reco gnized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , 
recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family  history , sexual history , 
travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, s hould be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) and collection of serum sample for acetaminophen drug and/or protein 
adduct levels may  be warranted.
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be r eported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.   
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology .

severit y, causality, onset and outcome), review clinical trial data to ide ntify potential AEs 
and SAEs, and oversee input of electronic source documents for [COMPANY_007]’s ARGUS database 
for every  study  participant.  
Sponsor representatives (RTCs, HVPs, and CI G-based Investigators) will elicit and enter 
adverse event information moni tor adverse event data (including but not limited to severity , 
causality , onset and outcome) at each encounter with participants.  The principal investigator 
(PI) and sub- investigators (SubI ) and Sponsor will review clinical trial data to identify  
potentia l SAEs and oversee input of electronic source documents for [COMPANY_007]’s ARGUS 
database for every  study  participant.  
Prior to database lock, all external data will be transferred to the electronic data capture 
(EDC) -based clinical trial database.  
This study  will utilize various methods of electronic data capture to provide source 
documentation.  All electronic data will be integrated into an EDC-based clinical trial 
database.  Electronic data from the trial will be obtained from the following sources:
1. T hird- Party Vendor online portal.  The vendor will manage the online portal, which is 
accessible through an application on the participant’s smart device or through a 
web-based portal.  The following study  participants will use the portal to enter study  
data: PI, Sub -Is, HVPs, RTCs, and other designees. 
2.Central Lab Laboratory  vendor: participant blood samples will be sent to a central 
laboratory  for anal ysis.  Laboratory  data will be transferred electronically  to an

and GOLD Guidelines
NYHA Classification -Stage s of Heart Failure
Class I  -No sy mptoms and no limitation in ordinary  physical activit y, eg, shortness of breath 
when walking, climbing stairs etc. 
Class II -Mild sy mptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation 
during ordinary  activity . 
Class III -Marked limitation in activity  due to s ymptoms, even during less- than- ordinary  
activity , eg, walking short distances (20 -100 m).  Comfortable only  at rest. 
Class I V -Severe limitations. Experiences s ymptoms even while at rest. Mostl y bedbound 
patients. 
National Kidney Foundation CKD Guidelines 
The National Kidney  Foundation’s Kidney  Disease Outcomes Qualit y Initiative has 
published clinical practice guidelines for staging CKD.  These guidelines stage CKD using a 
classification s ystem (G1 to G5) based upon glomerular filtration rate (GFR):
GFR Category GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) Terms
G1 >90 Normal or high
G2 60-89 Mildly  decreased
G3a 45-59 Mildly  to moderatel y decreased
G3b 30-44 Moderatel y to severel y decreased
G4 15-29 Severel y decreased
G5 <15 Kidney  failure

Page 88Child -Pugh Classification
The Child-Pugh Classification was developed to assess the prognosis of chronic liver disease 
and cirrhosis.  There are 5 components of the Child- Pugh score: 
The 5 components are summed to y ield a Child -Pugh Classification -Class A (5- 6 points), 
Class B (7- 9 points), or Class C (10- 15 points).
GOLD Guidelines
The GOLD guideline uses a combined COPD assessment approach to group patients 
according to s ymptoms and previous history  of exacerbations. Sy mptoms are assessed using 
the Modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dy spnea scale or COPD assessment 
test (CAT) scale.

Final Protocol Amendment 2, [ADDRESS_609496] (CAT)
The CAT contains 8 unidimensional sub-scores assessing health status impairment in 
COPD.33  The summation of each sub -score (range, 0-5) provides a total score (range, 0- 40):
  
Individual participant risk group assignment (Group A to D) is determined using the mMRC 
and CAT:
Group A: low risk (0-1 exacerbation per year, not requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and 
fewer s ymptoms (mMRC 0 -1 or CAT <10). 
Group B: low risk (0-1 exacerbation per year, not requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and 
more sy mptoms (mMRC ≥ 2 or CAT≥10). 
Group C: high risk (≥2 ex acerbations per year, or one or more requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and fewer sy mptoms (mMRC 0 -1 or CAT <10). 
Group D: high risk (≥2 exacerbations per year, or one or more requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and more sy mptoms (mMRC ≥2 or CAT≥10).

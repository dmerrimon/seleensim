Background , Rationale  and Context  
Advances in the care of critically ill patients have led to increased survivorship. However, survivors of 
critical illness are faced with a variety of short - and long -term complications, the most notable of which 
is intensive care unit acquired neuromuscul ar weakness (ICUAW) .[ADDRESS_1244761] shown that exercise administered during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay 
(early rehabilitation) can attenuate the severity of ICUAW,4,[ADDRESS_1244762] timing of rehabilitation may be 
key— EARLY (within 1 -2 days) but not LATE (days 5 and beyond) initiation of ICU rehabilitation therapi[INVESTIGATOR_889016] d to improved functional outcomes.4,5,8-[ADDRESS_1244763] the 
hypothesis that EARLY application of a 
novel early rehabilitation therapy in 
critically ill patients will improve 
functional outcomes, and change the 
functional trajectory of this population.  
We will perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_889017] a cycle ergometer  
(MOTOm ed, see Figure 1) and translate 
into humans the pre -clinical 
mechanisms that may mediate the 
effects of early mobility .

Objective s 
1) To assess the feasibility of the 
application of a novel ICU 
early rehabil itation 
intervention .  
2) To obtain preliminary data to 
estimate the treatment effect 
size. This will allow power 
calculations for a larger, NIH -
funded clinical trial.  
3) To understand if the 
application of a novel early 
ICU rehabilitation intervention 
attenuates the loss of muscle 
mass over time through 
inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin 
ligase muscle ring finger 1 
protein.  
4)  To determine the effects of 
exercise on energy utilization, 
mitochondrial function, and 
CPT-1 activity.  
5) To determine the effects of 
the early ICU rehabilitation 
intervention on muscle mass.  
6) To determine the effect of the early ICU rehabilitation intervention on quality of life in critically ill 
older adults.  
 
Methods and Measures  
Design : 
Single -center randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] /phase II  trial of a novel  ICU early rehabilitation intervention.  
 
Setting : 
Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Intensive Care Unit  
 
Subject  selection criteria : 
Older adults with age ≥ 55 years old who are critically ill with acute hypoxic respi[INVESTIGATOR_889018] ≥3 days.  
 
• Inclusion Criteria  
 Age ≥ 55 years old  (Rationale: Older patients have a higher incidence of acquiring a critical illness, 
and muscle wasting in this population appears more sever e. Therefore, this intervention may be most 
effective in this population.)  
 Admission to  a Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Intensive Care Unit  
 Acute Hypoxic respi[INVESTIGATOR_889019]  (MV)  for < 48 hours  with a P:F ratio of

Possible Exclusion: If the patient is on spi[INVESTIGATOR_889021], a discussion with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_889022] w ill randomize [ADDRESS_1244764] s to the intervention group (novel ICU early rehabilitation)  and [ADDRESS_1244765] a difference between groups based on SPPB at ICU discharge.  
 
The primary analysis of the phase II part of the study is to compare SPPB at ICU discharge between the 
two groups using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusted for age, sex, and BMI. Under our 
assumptions of attrition (estimated at 15%) and mortality (SPPB=0 if patient has passed), with the 
current sample size (n=42), we will be able to detect an effect size of 0.98 or higher in the SPPB at ICU 
discharge with a power of 81% and a two -sided significance level of 0.05. This effect size is based on our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_889023] 0.[ADDRESS_1244766].   
 
The intervention group will receive in -bed cycle ergometry within 48 hours of randomization  if safety 
criteria (below) are met . In-bed cycle ergometry has been shown to be safe and feasible in the critically 
ill and is FDA -approved for use in this population.8,17-[ADDRESS_1244767] 5  days per week  to evaluate if  they meet pre -defined safety criteria based on other 
studies of early mobilization and cycling in the ICU  (see Table 1).4,5,8,17-20 Patients  who meet the safety 
criteria  will be positioned in the semi -recumbent position for cycling as per ICU guidelines. The cycler 
will provide 3 different possible modes of cycling —passive, active -assisted, and active. We will start with 
passive cycling and the patient may progress to active -assisted and active cycling. The goal duration of 
cycling will be [ADDRESS_1244768] 5  times per week  for the duration 
Version 4 
9/6/[ADDRESS_1244769] updated our safety criteria based on other completed and ongoing cycle trials in the critically ill  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].)  See table below.  
 
 
 
 
In addition to cycling, the intervention arm will receive early physical therapy. This physical therapy  (PT) 
will be performed according to a protocol of additional ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -administered rehabilitation 
strategies previously developed in the Wake Forest MICU.[ADDRESS_1244770] 
5 times per week  when they are conscious. If unconscious (as in Level 1 below), then they will only 
receive passive range of motion (PROM) for 10 repetitions per body part  daily . Once conscious, subjects 
will progress through the different levels of PT with an emphasis on ambulation.  
 
Therapy for the intervention arm patients will continue while on the floor. Outpatient therapy will be 
provided at the discretion of the patient’s treating physicians.

Version 4 
9/6/2019  8 The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is based on timed measures of standing balance, walking 
speed, and ability to rise from a chair. Each measure is assigned a score ranging from 0 to 4, with a total 
possible summary score of 12. The SPPB was dev eloped for functional evaluation of the geriatric 
population. Given the target population of this study, this is an ideal instrument to measure physical 
function in this cohort.  
 
Handgrip will be assessed with a Jamar hand -held dynamometer. Three trials with brief pauses will be 
performed for each hand. A recording of hand dominancy will also be made.  
 
Skeletal muscle strength will be measured in the lower extremities. An electronic strength dynamometer 
(MicroFET 2MT Dynamometer, Hoggan Health Industries, Salt Lake City, UT) will be used to collect 
strength measures of the ankle and knee, bilaterally. Th ree trials with brief pauses will be performed for 
each muscle group. The best performance of three trials will be selected for each side.  
 
Non -invasive continuous volumetric C02 (vC02) will be performed using either a NM3 device ( Phillips -
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_5770]) or ventilator capable of vC02 measurements.   Daily energy expenditure (divided into 12 
hour segments) will be calculated using the formula validated by [CONTACT_889033].   vC02 measurements will 
not be used for clinical decision making.   The use of NM3 device p oses minimal harm to enrolled 
patients.  
 
The activity monitors will be given to the patients when enrolled in the study to wear throughout their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Patients will be asked to wear the accelerometer  and return it  in with a pre -paid 
envelope .  
 
Health related quality of life will be assessed using the S hort Form-36.  The SF -[ADDRESS_1244773] dimensions of health.  
 
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment  (MoCA) and the MoCA - BLIND  will be used to measure cognitive 
status. The MoCA  and the MoCA -BLIND  are validated tool s of 22 -30 questions which assesses: short -
term memory recall, visuospatial abilities, executive function, attention, concentration, and working 
memory, language, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation to time and place. They are  highly 
sensitive and specific to detect mild cognitive impairment.  
 
The Mobility Assessment Tool short form (MAT -sf) is a video animated tool for assessing self -perception 
of mobility. Items consist of a video and a corresponding measurement item. The video depi[INVESTIGATOR_27039] a 
wooden mannequin performing a wide range of physical act ivities and the measurement item consists 
of a question about the participant’s ability to perform the task, measured on a discrete scale.  
 
Healthcare utilization and mortality will be determined through a variety of mechanisms including a 
review of the electronic medical record, phone calls to patients/ families/ contacts provided at the start 
of the study, and a query of the NC State Death I ndex.   
 
Analytical Plan  
Phase I pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]:  
Given that this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], all analyses other than the feasibility assessment and basic descriptive 
statistics will be performed solely to inform a larger trial. Power calculations will not be utilized for this 
study given it is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Version 4 
9/6/[ADDRESS_1244774] 5 years. In 2013 alone, we had >[ADDRESS_1244775] a large population of patients on which to draw from 
for enrolment in the study.  
 
Patient demographics will be evaluated with descriptive statistics. The objectives will be evaluated as 
described below.  
 
1) The feasibility of compliance to the application of the novel ICU early rehabilitation intervention will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_889034] 
(10) who are able to undergo  a [ADDRESS_1244776] 48 hours of randomization 
and meeting safety criteria.  
2) SPPB, handgrip strength /dynamometry, calorimetry , ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110011], healthcare 
utilization  (SPPB) , ventilator -free days, mortality, and SF -[ADDRESS_1244777] models.  
3) And 4)   Muscle ultrasound measures, skeletal muscle biopsy measures, and plasma analyses will 
also be analyzed with descriptive statistics, tests for trend  including with linear mixed effect models , 
and adjusted analyses.  
 
In sum, r esults will be analyzed initially using descriptive statistics.  Comparison between groups will be 
done using chi square tests for proportions, and t -tests or ANOVA procedures for continuous variables.  
Regression analysis will be performed to identify independent outcome predictors.  Other inferential 
statistical analysis will be conducted as appropriate.  
 
Phase II : The primary analysis is to compare SPPB at ICU discharge between the two groups using 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusted for age, gender, and BMI. Under our assumptions of attrition 
(estimated at 15%) and mortality (SPPB=0 if patient has passed), wi th the current sample size (n=42), we 
will be able to detect an effect size of 0.98 or higher in the SPPB at ICU discharge with a power of 81% 
and a two -sided significance level of 0.05. This effect size is based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_889028] 0.[ADDRESS_1244778] Recruitment Methods  
Our ICU research team will screen patients admitted to the ICU for inclusion/ exclusion criteria for entry 
into the study.  We will only access necessary information (using a minimal amount of PHI) for screening 
through the electronic medical record . PHI necessary will include name, geographic information, dates, 
telephone number, medical record, and access to this information will be sought under a limited HIPAA 
waiver . All information will remain confidential in a password protected file on a password protected 
Version 4 
9/6/2019  10 computer.  If deemed eligible, s ubjects (or their surrogates if unable to consent for themselves) will be 
approached for consent. If the patient/ surrogate does not consent for the study, the study team will 
maintain a record of those not enrolled which will be kept in a password protected file on a password 
protected computer. This record will be destroyed [ADDRESS_1244779]  or from a surrogate decision -maker. If a 
surrogate decision -maker is used for initial consent, then when the patient is mentally able to consent 
for him/herself, he/she will be re -approached by [CONTACT_889035] . All 
consents will take place in the ICU.  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_117689], 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could directly identify 
subjects, and maintaining  all study information in a secure manner .  To help ensure subject privacy and 
confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data collection form.  Any collected 
patient identifying information corresponding to the unique study identifier will be maintained on a 
linkage file, store d separately from the data .  The linkage file  will be kept secure, with access limited to 
designated study personnel.  We will input data into the RedCAP web based data entry system as it is 
highly secure and is regularly backed up. Following data collection subject identifying information will be 
destroyed  three years after publication of the study , consistent with data validation and study design , 
producing an anonymous analytical data set.  Data access will be limited to study staff.  Data and records 
will be kept locked and secure d, with any compu ter data password protected .  No reference to any 
individual participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the 
study.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring

Additionally, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be convened by [CONTACT_978]. This DSMB will monitor all 
serious/unexpected adverse events as well.  
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations  
Any unanticipated problems, serious and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol changes 
will be promptly reported  by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_161061] g overnment agency if appropriate.

Abstract.  Populations consuming high levels of soy, as in many Asian countries, 
have lower levels of ovarian hormones, lower rates of breast cancer, and reduced 
mammographic density than populations consuming typi[INVESTIGATOR_403128]. These 
observations may in part be explained by [CONTACT_403205] a diet that 
provided 15% energy from soymilk containing weakly estrogenic isoflavones. No 
adverse effects were observed. Further questions are whether isoflavones are the critical 
components influencing breast cancer risk and whether they do so by [CONTACT_403206], such as breast density. Women with dense 
breasts have a [ADDRESS_508197] density, we propose a 
randomized, double -blind study, with two arms, and 100 premenopausal women in each 
arm. Women will be recruited and randomly allocated to take soy isoflavone pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] 
(treatment) or placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_403129] (control) for [ADDRESS_508198] cancer prevention.  
 
Introduction: In two separate soy feeding studies, we have successfully lowered 
not only levels of estrogens (by 25 -40%) but also progesterone (by 40%) in all 16 
premenopausal women after only 1 month of soy feeding (1-5). In these p rior studies, 
only 400 kilocalories of the daily energy intakes (~15%) of each subject was replaced by 
[CONTACT_403207] 100 -200 mg (as aglycones) per day. Soy feeding 
also lowered estrone sulfate by 15% and androstenedione by 20% in 12 postmenopausal 
women after 4 months. In premenopausal woman, soymilk with or without isoflavones 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 2 was highly effective in lowering estrogens and progesterone. However, a soy diet with 
higher level of isoflavones decreased progesterone levels further  compared to a soy diet 
without isoflavones. The isoflavone -rich soy diet also increased urinary excretion of the 
“anticarcinogenic” 2 -hydroxyestrone without affecting the excretion of the 
“carcinogenic” 16 -hydroxyestrone. Results from statistical models suggest that the 
amount and the source of protein and isoflavones are main factors that modify ovarian 
hormone levels. In this proposal, we will determine the roles of isoflavones on breast 
cancer risk reduction by [CONTACT_403208]. No 
adverse reproductive effects (e.g. amenorrhea in premenopausal women or thickened 
endometrium and increased vaginal cornification in postmenopausal women) have been 
observed in our studies. The magnitude of changes in the ovarian steroids in our study 
was similar to the differences of these steroids found in populations with widely different 
risks for breast cancer.  Our results may explain why Asian women consuming soy have a 
lower risk for breast cancer than women consuming western diets. Our results, therefore, 
have physiologic significance and implications for breast cancer prevention.  
 
 Objective:  Further important questions are whether isoflavones  are the active 
component(s) and whether isoflavones can favorably influence other known and 
preventable risk factors, such as breast density. Breast tissue consists of radiologically 
dense fibroglandular tissue and radiologically translucent adipose tissue. Breast cancer 
originates in fibroglandular tissue. Women with higher breast density have a [ADDRESS_508199] cancer; moreover, greater breast density makes it harder 
to detect early breast cancer by [CONTACT_30050] (“masking effect”).  However, unlike 
many other reproductive risk factors for breast cancer, such as ages of menarche, 
menopause and first full term pregnancy, increased breast density is a risk factor that can 
be reversed. Breast density is, therefore, a potential measure of efficacy for preventive 
interventions. Moreover, breast density may reflect cumulative past exposure to 
endogenous ovarian steroids and, thus, be a better intermediate surrogate marker for 
breast cancer risk than, for example, short term monitoring of serum levels of ovarian 
steroids. We propose to test the hypothesis that continuous consumption of isoflavones  
beyond [ADDRESS_508200] of isoflavones on bone metabolism in premenopausal women cannot be 
easily predicted and should, therefore, be monitored and studied as proposed here.  
 
 Hypothesis/Aims : Isoflavones lower progesterone levels but have no immediate 
effects on circulating 17ß -estradiol. [Note: there could be a delay effect on 17ß -estradiol 
due to feedback regulation.] Because isoflavones bind to estrogen receptors (ERs), they 
can displace estrogens from ERs, thereby [CONTACT_403209]. If 
this occurs, the markers for studying such effects are breast density or bone density. The 
hypotheses to be tested are that chronic soy isoflavone consumption will decrease 
progesterone further and soy isoflavones will compete with 17ß -estradiol for binding to 
ERs, thereby [CONTACT_403210] (and bone) tissue, leading to a 
corresponding decrease in breast density (and possibly bone density). We will determine : 
 
Aim #1: effects of continuing exposure to soy isoflavone  beyond 1 month on the time -
dependence of the levels of ovarian steroid and other  hormones  
Aim #2: effects of chronic soy isoflavone  ingestion on breast and bone density  
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 3 Aim #3: the interactions of isoflavones  and other nutrients on breast density using 
statistical models  
Aim #4: the safety of chronic soy isoflavone ingestion  
 Experimental Design and Methods :  These aims will be achieved by a 
prospective, parallel 2 -arm, repeated measures, randomized, double blind, placebo 
controlled study. After a successful completion of a 2 -month baseline observation, 
qualified women will be randomly allocated to either placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (control) or 1 20 mg 
isoflavone pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (aglycones, treatment) 5 days per week for 2 years with blinding of 
subjects, research staff and investigators to the supplement assignments.  Both treatment 
and placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_403130] -vitamin and minerals.  The 
main outcomes are: 1) breast density by [CONTACT_403211], 2) bone density by [CONTACT_88190] x -ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and 3) serum, nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], and urinary levels of 
estrogens, progesterone, and other breast cancer risk markers, and changes from baseline 
to intervention. The explanatory variables are nutrient intakes, isoflavone intakes, urinary 
and plasma levels of isoflavones, demographic data (body weight, height), and 
reproductive history . Breast (and bone) density is chosen as a major outcome of interest 
because it is an index of cumulative exposure to ovarian hormones and is postulated to be 
intermediate biomarkers for breast cancer risk  (6). To monitor safety, blood chemistries 
including liver and thyroid function tests, lipid profiles, blood cell counts, menstrual 
cycle lengths, and cytology of nipple fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] (to determine presence or absence of 
hyperplastic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]), endometrial histology, vaginal smear cytology, unexpected 
vaginal bleeding, breast lumps, and bone density will be monitored once every three 
months during all outpatient visits . 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria :  Women must be 30 -40 years of age with regular 
cycles, FSH levels  10 mU/ml and mid -luteal phase progesterone > 8 ng/ml.  
Mammograms must be normal.  Exclusions include use of contraceptive agents, other 
exogenous hormones, medications known to affect mammographic density, any 
medically prescribed diet, current pregnancy or lactation, previous history of cancer, 
breast cancer in a first degree relative, breast augmentation , reduction , or lifting,  and peri - 
or postmenopausal status.  
All procedures (mammography, MRI) and samples (fasting blood, overnight 12 -
hr urine, and nipple fluid) will be obtained during the mid -luteal phase of the menstrual 
cycle ( between cycle  days 20  to 24 preferably day  22) when progesterone levels peak. 
Subjects will record cycle day 1 (onset of menstrual spotting) throughout the study and 
complete a dietary habit history questionnaire ( DAQ ) (8) and reproductive history and 
general health history questionnaires  (PHQF). 
During each GCRC outpatient visit, subjects will bring a 12 -hr overnight urine 
(stored in a urine jug containing sodium azide and glycerol), 24-hour food records.  
Menstrual cycle lengths and body weights will be recorded and fasting blood samples 
obtained for serum chemistries, liver and thyroid functions, lipid profiles, and steroid 
hormones.  Breast fluid secretors will provide nipple fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403131].    
Baseline observations (2 menstrual cycles):  There will be [ADDRESS_508201] 2 cycles.  Complete history, physical examination and a Pap 
smears will be obtained. Subjects who qualify will then be randomized, undergo 
mammography (a standard screening mammography and one extra view), bilateral breast 
MRI, and a bone density measurement by [CONTACT_112592] (L2 to L4 and hip).   
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 4 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_403132] (24 months):   Isoflavone or control pi[INVESTIGATOR_403133].  Every three months (~ seasonally) subjects will visit the GCRC on 
day 2 2 of a cycle. At these visits, subjects will be provided with the assigned supplement  
pre-packaged for daily dose and consumption .  Subjects will be randomly assigned to 
placebo or treatment in blocks of six to assure equal sizes of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403134] -
groups for blood sampling, using the PLAN procedure in SAS© (9).   
If more than 6% of subjects ( 12 subjects) develop amenorrhea, we will break the 
code for these women. A transvaginal probe ultrasonography and an endometrial biopsy 
will be performed if amenorrhea occurs. If amenorrhea is related to soy isoflavone 
treatment, the study will be terminated. If this occurs, a statistically significant change in 
breast density is then expected because the progesterone levels of these women will be <1 
ng/ml. The mammography, MRI and bone density measurements will be performed at 
yearly intervals and whenever subjects notify us of their intent to leave the study.  
Statistical Analysis . The primary outcome variables are measures of breast 
density (mammographic density and relative volumes of parenchymal and adipose tissues 
by [CONTACT_9268]).  The main analysis will assess changes in breast density (BD) parameters over 
the 2 -year follow -up period, measured at baseline, at one year and at two years.  The 
efficacy analysis for the measures of BD will be analyzed primarily through mixed 
models for continuous outcome measures. This class of linear models can accommodate 
missing data and allows inclusion of time -dependent covariates for outcomes that are 
approximately normally distributed.  Software is widely available (e.g., MIXED 
procedure in SAS®).  We will model the marginal responses of the breast density 
parameters for each intervention group.  The main effects of time, supplement  group, and 
the (time x supplement group) interaction will be assessed.  Time -dependent covariates 
(e.g., BMI) and time -independent variables (e.g., parity, age of menarche, race/ethnicity), 
including potential confounding variables, can be added to the models.  The analysis will 
proceed with an intent -to-treat principle in which any subject randomized to a treatment 
group (i.e., placebo or soy  isoflavones ) with at least one post -baseline BD measure will 
be included in the statistical analyses.  Some analyses will be conducted which will 
include only those patients with complete data up to a designated data collection time 
point (e.g., 12 months, 24 months, etc).  
  
 Power analysis and sample size justification . The main assessment of outcome 
is the change from baseline in percent dense tissue. The hypothesized mean change in 
area of dense tissue in the soy isoflavone group will be a decrease between 10 and 15 
percentage points on average, while the placebo group will remain about the same (6; 10 -
15). Using a two group t -test with a 0.[ADDRESS_508202] 80% power to detect changes in mean percent of 
dense tissue of –10% to –20%. If we experience a 20 to 30% dropout rate, the study can 
still detect changes of –10% if SD  20, and –15% or larger for SD  25. Our choice of 
[ADDRESS_508203] even greater power than we estimate since the proposed analyses 
(ANCOVA, mixed models) exhibit greater power characteristics than the t -tests upon 
which our power analysis is based. With an estimated attrition rate of 15% over the 
length of the study, [ADDRESS_508204] 1.5 years of 
supplement.  
      
 Results expected .  Increasing the duration of consum ption  of soy isoflavones is 
expected to decrease circulating (and nipple fluid) ovarian steroids, mammographic

 [ADDRESS_508205] density changes than 
mammography, which is a 2 -D assessment. Ability to use MRI (no radiation exposure) to 
measure breast density will allow us to assess in the future whether soy pi[INVESTIGATOR_403135], as data from animal studies 
have shown. The effect of isoflavones on bone is hard to predict and will be examined in 
this study.  
 
Significance.  Our results will have significant implications for breast cancer risk 
reduction, because reducing breast density can reduce breast cancer risk by [CONTACT_403212]: 1) by [CONTACT_403213], and 2) by [CONTACT_403214]. The study 
will provide needed pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], to clarify in the future, whether an intervention that 
reduces breast density is likely to lead to a corresponding reduction in breast cancer 
incidence.  A novel, non -invasive and economical approach to breast cancer prevention 
may be provided by [CONTACT_403215].

Methods: We have extensive experience measuring serum levels of ovarian 
steroids, serum proteins (SHBG, growth factors, prolactin, cytokines, estrogen receptor 
etc), and isoflavones in human studies . These measurements will be by [CONTACT_403216] - or enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays using commercial kits. An 
overnight urine will be collected for 12 hours in a one -liter urine jug which contains 
sodium azide and glycerol) by [CONTACT_403217]. The 
urine will be analyzed for isoflavones to assess other soy exposure and for steroid 
metabolites such as oxidative estrogen metabolites by [CONTACT_403218].  
 
Soy isoflavone pi[INVESTIGATOR_403136].  The make -up of the 
isoflavones is the same as that which exists naturally in soy. We believe studying the 
effect of the two soy isoflavones at their naturally occurring ratio is a pre -requisite to 
contemplating a study that addresses the effect of different ratio or the individual 
isoflavone. The total amount of isoflavones in each tablet will be maintained constant 
through formulation. The formulation consists of, for example, 125 mg Novasoy (50 mg 
of total isoflavones as aglycones) or equivalent weight of placebo material, 60 mg 
sorbitol, 3 mg magnesium stearate, 412 mg dicalcium phosphate with a total of 600 mg 
per tablet. [Note: Volunteers in this study will take 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (=1 20 mg isoflavones as 
aglycones) per day.] For placebo, 10 -DE maltodextrin (90% weight) and RT -175 caramel 
color (10% by [CONTACT_8497]) will be substituted for Novasoy [Note: Volunteers will take 2 
tablets per day.] The relative amount of genistein/genistin to daidzein/daidzin does vary 
between lots of soybeans and this variation is a natural phenomenon. This ratio for 
Novasoy has varied between 1.1 to 1.3 (mean ± SD: 1.2 ± 0.1) from lot -to-lot. However, 
we will use only one lot of Novasoy for the entire study. Therefore, the relative amount 
of the two isoflavones will be constant. All subjects (both treatment and placebo) will be 
given required daily intake of multi -vitamin and minerals.  Vitamin pi[INVESTIGATOR_403137].  
 
Breast density:  Breast density of subjects will be determined by [CONTACT_403219]. 
Both tests will be performed during the luteal phase, as confirmed by [CONTACT_19201] a blood 
sample on the days of the breast density tests for measuring progesterone.

 7 MRI is superior to mammography for measuring parenchymal pattern (dense 
tissue) of the breasts, because density measurement by [CONTACT_403220], and thus 
more accurate, than the subjective scoring in mammography . Moreover, MRI does not 
require breast compression and does not involve radiation exposure, which will make it 
easier to study density changes in younger women in the future. Hence from the scientific 
point of view, MRI as an outcome measure is preferable. However, for practical 
translation of our study results to large populations, mammography as an end point for 
measuring density changes in population -based interventions is more feasible than MRI. 
The cost of mammography is approximately one -eighth that of MRI, and is customarily 
covered by [CONTACT_22241]. Furthermore, most clinics are better equipped to perform 
mammography than breast MRI. Hence the efficacy of our pi[INVESTIGATOR_403138], one of which will maximize 
scientific value, and the other to allow our results to be more readily compared to other 
reports and be more readily translated to standard clinical care.  
 
Mammography:  This test will be performed with a digital mammographic unit , a 
Senographe 2000D, S30311AR, a new Full Field Digital Mammography System (GE 
Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin [ZIP_CODE]). A routine quality control program 
includes sensitometric evaluation, phantom imaging, and regular visit by a medical 
physicist ([CONTACT_94795]). The instrument setting and breast compression will be duplicated 
and maintained for each woman for baseline and intervention mammography. The 
operator for the mammography will have the pre -diet imaging parameters for each 
woman on hand as a reference for all mammography. Screening mammograms include [ADDRESS_508209] no knowledge of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403139] -RADSTM and rank the relative densities of images 
from baseline and intervention (categorical variable). The BI -RADS categories are: 1) 
entirely fatty (<25% dense area), 2) fatty with scattered fibroglandular tissue (25 -50% 
dense area), 3) heterogeneously dense (50 -75% dense area), and 4) extremely dense 
(>75% dense area).  
 
The digitized images of these mammograms will be used for measuring areas of 
dense and non -dense tissues using a free image analysis software ImageTool. This 
software uses a histogram segmentation  to assess dense tissue.  Briefly, the reader selects 
a grayscale threshold value differentiating the entire breast tissue and a second threshold 
delineating only the dense tissue. Binary masks are made from each threshold value (the 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.

Fig. 9: Nipple fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403140]), the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403141], 
and the percentage dense tissue calculated as a percentage. Readers (Drs. Brunder and Lu 
have both been trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Khamapi[INVESTIGATOR_403142].) will be blinded to 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403143]. These processes will be carried out 
on a PC.  This histogram segmentation algorithm provides quantification of the area 
representing dense tissue (pi[INVESTIGATOR_403144]) and the area of the 
total breast in the mammogram.  The number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403145] a percentage of the total pi[INVESTIGATOR_403146].  Statistical information for the dense and non -dense tissue 
also is available: mean and standard deviation of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_215431]. This process can be 
extended by [CONTACT_403221], fitting of normal distributions to the breast histograms and estimation of volume 
averaging on the results.  Breast area, dense breast area, and % -area with dense breast are 
parameters reflecting mammographic features to be used to measure the efficacy of the 
study’s pi[INVESTIGATOR_403147]. Percentage change in these mammographic features from 
baseline will be evaluated twice during pi[INVESTIGATOR_403147]. Agreement between scoring by 
[CONTACT_35978]-RADS and by [CONTACT_403222].  
 
MRI:  MRI will be performed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle to 
control for small but detectable cyclical variations in breast density. MRI examination 
will be performed using GE Signa 1.[ADDRESS_508210] tissues.  A threshold algorithm will be applied to each image of 
the breasts to segment (separate) dense tissue.  Using a [ADDRESS_508211] and the dense tissue.  In addition, a histogram function will be used to 
display the MR tissue signal distribution  (mean and standard deviation) of the tissue 
type.  Drs. Khamapi[INVESTIGATOR_403148].  The volume of the entire 
breast, the dense tissue volume, and % -volume with dense breast are main outcomes of 
interest for statistical analysis.  
 
Nipple fluid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]:  Because several studies showed that isoflavones may be 
stimulatory to breast tissues, nipple fluid 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403149]. A 
technique to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403150]-lactating women has been established in 
our laboratory. After compressing their breasts gently from all four quadrants, the 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 [ADDRESS_508212] cup (basically a plastic funnel, Fig. 9) that is 
connected to a [ADDRESS_508213] fluid can be recovered into a 200 l-capi[INVESTIGATOR_403151]. The volume is measured (1 mm in capi[INVESTIGATOR_149412] = 1 l). A 
portion of the nipple fluid is used for cytological evaluation for epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], and the 
remaining fluid transferred to phosphate buffer saline and stored at –80oC for later 
biochemical analysis. We will obtain fluids from secretors 4 times per year and make 
similar number of attempt to obtain fluid from non -secretors (8 times total during two 
year intervention). Repeated breast fluid samplings may increase fluid secretion. To 
understand the effect of samplings on breast fluid volume, nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403152] -secretors.  
 
BMD (bone mineral density) measurement:  The BMD (gm/cm2) in the lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L 2 to L 4) and hip will be measured using QDR® 4500A Fan Beam X -Ray Bone 
Densitometer  (Dual Energy X -ray Absorptiometry, QDR® 4500A Fan Beam X -Ray Bone 
Densitometer , Waltham, Mass. ). The densitometer is calibrated daily using a phantom. 
Daily spi[INVESTIGATOR_403153] 1% 
of the reference value. The coefficients of variation for the anatomic phantoms will be 
maintained <0.5%. This method was sensitive enough to detect BMD changes in pre - and 
post-menopausal women during tamoxifen treatment and in PEPI [INVESTIGATOR_403154] [ADDRESS_508214]® [ADDRESS_508215]® 4500A  dual femur application measures both femurs in one quick scan and 
calculates the mean BMD of both femurs. The average gives better precision for 
monitoring changes.  
 
Soy isoflavones have been shown to stimulate osteoblast cell activities in vitro. In 
ovariectomized animals, soy isoflavones increase bone mineral density.  Because the soy 
isoflavones, daidzein and genistein, are not pure anti -estrogens. Our study population is 
premenopausal women who generally have high levels of endogenous  estrogens. It is not 
clear what would be the net bone effects of soy isoflavones in premenopausal women. 
Moreover, soy isoflavones may have bone sparing effects independent of their 
estrogenicity. Therefore,  it is important to know if the extent of displacement of o varian 
hormone by [CONTACT_403223]. Second, women with high BMD 
were also found to be at higher risk for breast cancer. Information on BMD will allow us 
to assess if BMD may be a useful surrogate biomarker for estimating breast cancer risk in 
future breast cancer prevention studies.  
 
All scans will be performed in duplicate with the participants in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. The duplicate scan is performed after participant gets off and then returns to the 
densitometer. Identical anatomical regions of interest, total hip, femoral neck, Ward 
triangle, the trochantor, and the intertrochantor areas, will be scanned during repeat scans 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 10 using a software feature of the DEXA program. The mean of the two scans will be used 
for statistical comparison with results at other times in the study.  
 
Study Population: Subjects must be [ADDRESS_508216] mammographic density; are 
pregnant or lactating; or have a previous history of cancer, breast augmentation or 
reduction, abnormal mammograms, or are at high risk for breast cancer (first degree 
relative with breast cancer). Women who are on any medically prescribed diet, or are not 
willing to be randomized will be excluded. Women with pacemakers or other permanent 
metal implants such as IUD will be excluded from the study .  During initial screening, 
past history of allergic reactions to foods will be acquired. If subjects have prior histories 
of food allergies to soy food, they will be excluded. Subjects must have regular cycles 
and mid -luteal phase progesterone > 8 ng/ml. Perimenopausal women with > 100 pg/ml 
of serum estradiol on cycle day 2 and > 20 mU/ml FSH will be excluded. Enrollment will 
be available to all racial groups. Pregnancy will be excluded by [CONTACT_403224] 
(human chorionic gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]) by [CONTACT_403225].  
 
Recruitment:  The following methods will be used to recruit study subjects. 1) 
We have purchased 20,000 name [CONTACT_403244] a marketing company (KM Lists, Marlton, 
NJ). This initial list purchased contained only [ADDRESS_508217]. If we cannot recruit sufficient subjects, we will purchase name [CONTACT_403245] 35 and older than 30. The database includes age, race, 
address, date of birth, income, education etc. 2) Advertisement materials have been 
distributed thru email systems of UTMB, area women’s organizations, health networks, 
local charities, churches, and beauty saloons. In this procedure, we usually contact a 
person who maintains an email mailing list and ask this person to email our 
advertisement information to those in the list. 3) Study information and recruitment are 
also posted on websites or bulletin boards after securing permission from appropriate 
authorities. 4) The advertisement brochure is also included in the reminder letter sent to 
area women by [CONTACT_403226]. [PI [INVESTIGATOR_403155]: We have not used this method since most of the women in this 
list are outside the age range of our inclusion criteria.] 5) Advertisement brochure will be 
left in the waiting area of mammography clinics, in local churches, beauty saloons and 
health fairs. 6) We will also advertise study in radio, TV and newspaper, if needed. [PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_403155]: We have not advertised in newspaper, radio or TV because we found these methods 
not to be cost -effective in the past. We may not need to use these modes of advertisement 
since we are recruiting well with mass mailing. We do not do face -to-face recruitment of 
subjects in mammography waiting area of mammogram clinics.]  
 
KM Lists is a direct marketing company. KM Lists is the list broker (a major 
wholesaler of Axciom’s database) and Axciom is the list owner.  The Acxiom Infobase 
file is a compi[INVESTIGATOR_403156], voter registration, tax accessor 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 11 data, vehicle registration data, and many other sources. The Acxiom Corporation has a 
national database which includes approx. 116 million households.   We purchased name 
[CONTACT_403246]. According to KM Lists, the age information 
comes from household census, questionnaires, driver’s licenses, credit bureau records, 
birth, high school and college records, warranty registrations, and insurance records. The 
gender information comes from Acxiom's proprietary conversion software. Both Acxiom 
and KM Lists  rent the data out for many various direct mail/telemarketing campaigns and 
for research.  
 
A similar telephone conversation is conducted for the potential subjects who 
telephone us and whom our staff telephones. The staff provides the purpose of the study, 
highlights the procedures involved, and describes the inclusion/exclusion criteria as 
detailed as the subjects wish to know. From this phone conversation, the subjects 
determine whether they want to come to UTMB for an inform consent visit. In general, 
most of the potential subjects call to find out if they are eligible and how they can be 
qualified for the study and to know more about the study procedures. No potential 
subjects would commit to come in for an inform consent visit unless they have sufficient 
information to assess that they will qualify for the study and know for sure that they like 
the study. If they are interested, they are then invited to come to the General Clinical 
Research Center of UTMB for a detailed description of the entire study as it stated in the 
consent form. During this visit, the content of the consent form is verbally presented to 
the study subject. After this presentation and answering their questions and concerns, the 
subject is encouraged to take time to read the consent form. If they are interested in the 
study, they sign the consent form. We then collect and record eligibility information. 
During this visit, the study schedule and remuneration chart included in the consent form 
is carefully described to subjects such that subjects understand our expectation of them 
and they understand what we will do for them. The subjects are given a signed copy of 
the consent form to take home and are encouraged to discuss the study with family 
member or friends. The subjects are informed in the consent form and during the consent 
visit that they can withdraw from the study anytime.  
 
The subjects are given the Harvard DAQ , Personal Heath Questionnaire for 
Females (PHQF), and Menstrual Flow Chart and Supplement Intake Chart (MFC -DSC) 
to fill out. The PHQF is the standard of medical care forms to be filled out by [CONTACT_403227], respectively. PHQF is the form used by 
[CONTACT_403228]. The PHQF are reviewed by [CONTACT_403229] a part of history taking. Subjects can fill out 
these forms while at UTMB or they can take these forms home and fill out. For Spanish 
speaking only subjects, our Spanish speaking nurse from our GCRC or the Spanish 
speaking staff translate the questionnaires or forms and collect information by [CONTACT_30230]. 
The subjects also take urine jug, food records form home to fill out. The subjects are 
instructed on how to keep track of their cycle information. On the first day of their 
menstrual spotting (cycle day 1), they call our office to give us this date. From this date, 
we calculate when their luteal phase (post -ovulatory phase, the latter half of the menstrual 
cycle, usually cycle days 14 to 28) will be and days 20, [ADDRESS_508218]-intervention follow -up: The pi[INVESTIGATOR_403157] , including riboflavin and mineral s. Riboflavin produces a 
bright yellow color in urine after intake. The study participants were blinded to treatme nt 
assignment  per study protocol , but this would not prevent them from second guessing the 
study arm that they were assigned to . Our study participants probably  would have  notice d 
a change in their urine color whenever they ingest ed study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] , and this color change 
would indicate  to the study team (we analyzed their urine) their degree of adherence to  
taking the study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] . Additionally, subjects might second guess the study arm that they 
were assigned to. The study subjects knew that they were taking multi -vitamins but were 
never told of a possible urine color change , and none of the subjects  asked about this 
urine color change.  
The purpose of this post -diet follow -up is to find out what these guesses were . We 
will email study participants who have received a dietary assignment. We would like 
each subject to choose one of the se three answers  in the email : (i) I believe that I took the 
placebo (sugar) pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] , (ii) I believe that I took soy isoflavone pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] , or (iii) I don’t have an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_403158] I took . The frequency for each answer  by [CONTACT_403230].  We hypothesize that , due to the yellow coloring of their urine, a higher 
percentage of subjects would guess that they were in the active isoflavone treatment 
group , because m ost study participants prefer to be assigned to the active treatment 
group , if choice was allowed . This information will provide us with data about whether 
riboflavin can also be an effective masking agent for treatment group assignment  in 
future clinical trials , not just as a tracer of compliance of taking study pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. Masking of 
treatment assignment would have an added benefit of balancing the participation 
behavior among study groups , in addition to randomization.  We will send the questions 
initially by [CONTACT_54769] , if no response , by [CONTACT_403231]. We will request a dedicated 
email address from UTMB’s Information Service  for this specific purpose.  
The survey questionnaire is not expected to change risk of participation.  
 
 
Clinical Procedures:  
 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 13 The flow chart below outlines the study procedures and timeline in month (mo) for each 
subject:  
 
Recruitment (mo 0) → Screening (mo 1) → Obtain baseline data (mo 2 -3), give 
menstrual cycle calendar → Pregnancy test, followed by 1st mammography, DEXA bone 
density scan, and breast MRI → Randomization → Pi[INVESTIGATOR_403159] (mo 
4)→ Outpatient visits to the GCRC twice in an assigned month and repeat this outpatient 
visit once every three months ( 4 times per year) to obtain treatment data (mo 4 to 15) → 
End of 1 -year pi[INVESTIGATOR_403159] (mo 15), review menstrual cycle 
calendar→ Pregnancy test followed by 2nd mammography, DEXA bone density test, and 
breast MRI (mo 15) → Pi[INVESTIGATOR_403160] (mo 15) → Outpatient 
visits to the GCRC twice in an assigned month and repeat this outpatient visit once every 
three months ( 4 times per year) to obtain treatment data (mo 15 to 26), review menstrual 
cycle calendar → End of [ADDRESS_508219] MRI 
(mo 26)  
 
1. Recruit volunteer subjects at UTMB Radiology Clinic or through TV, radio and 
newspaper advertisement and by [CONTACT_403232].  
2. Invite potential subjects to UTMB GCRC for informed consent by [CONTACT_403233]. After obtaining written consent from the study subject, 
screening tests will be performed while as GCRC outpatient to determine 
eligibility.  
3. Screening visits/Baseline visits: If the potential subjects reported that they have 
regular cycles and cycle lengths are in general longer than [ADDRESS_508220]’s 
cycle length . Cycle day [ADDRESS_508221] menstrual 
spotting/bleeding as soon as possible and the staff will calculate when their cycle 
days 20, [ADDRESS_508222] day of their menstrual bleeding.  
 
For the older potential subjects (>39 years old) who have regular but short 
menstrual cycles e.g. ~20 days, they may be peri -menopausal women. For women 
suspected to be peri -menopausal, they are instructed to come to our GCRC for a 
blood draw (15 ml, 1 tablespoon) on the day after the first detection of menstrual 
spotting/bleeding. This blood will be analyzed for estradiol and FSH to determine 
if they are going through menopause and if they may qualify for the remaining 
study.  
 
After written consenting, the following information will be collected to determine 
their eligibility; some are collected soon after consent while others obtained after 
all baseline visits.  
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 [ADDRESS_508223] be:  
a) 30 to 40 years of age with normal mammograms, free of mammographic 
abnormalities,  
b) have regular cycles, FSH levels  10 mU/ml and mid -luteal phase and 
progesterone > 8 ng/ml (to be confirmed during baseline observation 
period),  
c) be able to return to Galveston for scheduled study visits, and  
d) be premenopausal.  
 
The subjects must not:  
a) use contraceptive agents, any exogenous hormones, or medications 
known to affect the mammographic density,  
b) be pregnant or lactating,  
c) have a previous history of breast augmentation , reduction  or lifting , 
abnormal mammograms, or at high risk for breast cancer (history of 
breast cancer, first degree relative with breast cancer),  
d) on medically prescribed diets, or be willing to be randomized,  
e) be peri -menopausal, e.g. estradiol >100 pg/ml on second day of their 
menstrual spotting and FSH >20 mU/ml (to be assessed by [CONTACT_206578]),  
f) have a pacemakers or other permanent metal implants,  
g) have a past history of allergic reaction to soy foods ,  
h) be postmenopausal, and  
i) have bra cup size greater than 38D D and no less than A [PI [INVESTIGATOR_403155]: We are 
using digital mammography and the detector plate of GE’s Senographe 
2000 is too small for bra cup size larger than 38D D].  
 
The other screening tests include a complete history (including a self -
administered PHQF), and a physical examination including gynecological 
examination, a breast examination, and a Pap smear, a three 24 hr -food 
records (record the 24 hr food intake before each scheduled GCRC visit, a 
total of three times), one blood sample (22 ml, 1.5 tablespoon) for blood 
chemistries, complete blood cell counts, liver and thyroid function tests, 
ferritin, and lipid levels and one blood sample (15 ml if suspected to be peri -
menopausal) for ovarian hormones and FSH measurement. Nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403161]. After the 
consent visit, enrolled subjects are given Harvard DAQ , PHQF, food record 
form with instruction, a urine jug with sodium azide and glycerol added and 
instruction on how to collect [ADDRESS_508224] these information to take home.  
 
During each GCRC visit (screening, baseline or pi[INVESTIGATOR_403162]), weight, 
height, waist, hip, blood pressure, and temperature are recorded. These 
measurements are part of the standard of medical care. During each GCRC 
visit, any major changes in dietary habits, medications, and medical

spotting (cycle day 1) and menstrual cycle lengths and visit GCRC on 2 cycle 
days of cycle days 20, 22, and 24 of two menstrual cycles. These dates of visits 
will be scheduled for the subjects by [CONTACT_403234]/phone 
calls by [CONTACT_403235]. Subjects will 
bring back a 12 -hr urine collected the night before each GCRC visit. Subjects will 
provide one fasting blood sample (30 ml for obtaining serum and 20 ml for 
isolating blood cells) during each of these visits. During every scheduled GCRC 
visit, the subjects will be queried if they have any major change in their dietary 
habit, medications, or medical conditions, and the changes, if any, will be 
recorded.  Subjects will also bring back a [ADDRESS_508226] (24 hr food intake 
for the day before each scheduled GCRC visit) three times for each menstrual 
cycle. The [ADDRESS_508227] regular 
cycles and if progesterone is > 8 ng/ml, they will continue the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403163]. The subjects will be notified only if they are disqualified to 
continue. PI [INVESTIGATOR_403164] -disqualified subjects and explain to them that their 
progesterone levels are lower than the cut -off to continue the study. We are 
expecting pi[INVESTIGATOR_403165]. If their progesterone is 
too low to begin with, it may be very difficult to decrease it further by 
[CONTACT_52886]. As to the clinical implication of a low progesterone level, the subject 
is advised by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_403166].  
5. Subjects who satisfactorily complete above tasks including the [ADDRESS_508228] s 
(L2 to L4 and hip) during one of these GCRC visits. The mammogram results will 
be interpreted immediately as for all clinical mammography tests by a licensed 
radiologist. Dr. T. Khamapi[INVESTIGATOR_403167] (certified to interpret mammograms and breast 
MRI), our co -investigator will interpret the mammograms and if there are 
abnormalities, the subjects will be informed the test results by [CONTACT_403236]. Specifically, the subjects will be advised to have 
additional diagnostic tests and be advised to consult their own physician for this 
follow -up. The cost of these follow -up diagnostic tests will not be the 
responsibility of this project. If the subjects have cancer lesions after further 
diagnostic tests, they will be excluded from the study. [CONTACT_403248][INVESTIGATOR_403168]. Nagamani and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_403169]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_403170]-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 [ADDRESS_508229] will be determined during screening and during pi[INVESTIGATOR_403171] 2 weeks or more, or within 48 hours prior to 
scheduled mammography and DEXA bone density tests.  
7. Subjects will be randomized to one of the two main supplement groups 
(isoflavone pi[INVESTIGATOR_403172] ) and one of the three blood draw subgroups 
within each main pi[INVESTIGATOR_403173]. There will be 1-day visits to GCRC for blood draw 
and other procedures on cycle day 22 of a specified cycle. Each of the subgroups 
within the main pi[INVESTIGATOR_403174] 1-day period of 
blood drawing at 1 -, 2- or 3-months, respectively, during initial randomization. 
For each GCRC visit (a total of 4 times per year) during the [ADDRESS_508230] overnight, provide fasting blood samples for the analyses of steroids and 
hormones, bring back MFC (with records of past day 1 of menstrual bleeding) and 
DSC (with records of supplement intake dates), bring back residual and unused 
supplement packets, provide nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], respond to queries regarding major 
dietary habit, medical and medication changes, and have blood pressure, weight, 
height, waist, hip and temperature measurements. Subjects will take home another 
[ADDRESS_508231] forms, urine jugs, MFC and 
DFC.  During this 1-day visit  once every 6 cycles , one blood sample will also be 
obtained for assessing blood cell counts, blood chemistries, liver and thyroid 
function, ferritin levels, and lipid profiles (monitor safety).  
8. Subjects will be asked to mail back a [ADDRESS_508232] a 12 -hr urine and 
mail a specimen back.  
9. The 1-day GCRC visit of an assigned menstrual cycle will be repeated once every 
three menstrual cycles (once every season).  
10. Subjects will be provided with containers  of the assigned pi[INVESTIGATOR_403175].  
11. Subjects will consume the assigned pi[INVESTIGATOR_403176] [ADDRESS_508233] book (Menstrual Flow Chart and Supplement Intake Chart) for 
recording study related information (day 1 of menstrual bleeding, GCRC visits, 
tests etc).  
12. The Research Dietitian will obtain food records from study subjects on randomly 
assigned dates by [CONTACT_648]. This will be done once every three months for each 
subject.  
13. After completing [ADDRESS_508234] DAQ (recall food intake frequency for the past 12 months of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403177]) and will be given a pregnancy test, followed by a mammography, a 
breast MRI, and a DEXA bone density test.  
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 [ADDRESS_508235] the 1 -day visit to 
GCRC for blood draw and other study procedures once every three months (e.g. 
repeat steps 6 to 14) for another [ADDRESS_508236] will be performed whenever cycle length increases by >30% of 
each subject’s usual length. Pregnancy test will also be performed no longer than 
[ADDRESS_508237]. M. Nagamani.  
 
Risk and Benefit Assessment:  
The soy isoflavone are currently available as pi[INVESTIGATOR_403178]-the-counter and are found 
in soy foods sold to the public. We will use isoflavone tablets provided by [CONTACT_403237]., which we have  used in the past several years for several preliminary 
studies.  These isoflavones are isolate d by [CONTACT_403238] (different processing). Alcohol is then removed by 
[CONTACT_403239].  In this way, the make -up of the 
isoflavones is the same as that which exists naturally in soy. These pi[INVESTIGATOR_403179]-the-counter to the public.  The placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_403180], a carbohydrate, and should have no biological effect at the dose, [ADDRESS_508238] was significantly 
less than that shown for the female estrogen, estradiol. In this xenograph mouse model, 
only one of the two isoflavones, genistein, is used and the free form (naturally occurring 
is conjugated form) is used which may not simulate human soy exposure experience. The 
breast cancer stimulatory effect of genistein shown in cell cultures and in xenograph mice 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 18 has not been found in humans yet.  
Isoflavones cause thickening of the uterine lining in some animal studies (mostly 
in rats) after the ovaries were removed but this has not been found in sub -human 
primates . Moreover, our preliminary studies showed that [ADDRESS_508239], the only available epi[INVESTIGATOR_403181] a lower rate of endometrial 
cancer with soy consumption.  
Lowering of female hormones due to prolonged soy  isoflavone  ingestion may 
lower bone density, which could increase the risk of eventually developi[INVESTIGATOR_403182] 
(thin bones) and bone fractures. But this is not a known risk. Soy isoflavones have been 
shown to improve bone mineral density in animals. Asian populations consuming high 
levels of soy have lower rates of hip fracture compared to western countries.  Because the 
current available information does not allow us to estimate the benefit and the risk of soy 
consumption on bone density, observations about bone is a part of this study. The risk of 
osteoporosis might also be increased if subject’s calcium intake is not sufficient during 
the study.  Subjects will be advised to adjust their c alcium intake if needed to maintain an 
adequate intake.    
Potential adverse effects such as lengthening of the menstrual cycle and nipple 
fluid cytology will be looked for closely during this study. If menstrual cycle lengths 
increase by [CONTACT_726] 2 weeks in 12% of the participants (e.g. 12 subjects) for more than 
3 cycles, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403183] -related. If this is associated with treatment, the ovarian hormones of these 
subjects will be immediately analyzed. The luteal progesterone levels in these women 
should be less than 1 ng/ml. If cycle length increase persists in these women for longer 
than [ADDRESS_508240] MRI 
(because this involves no radiation exposure) and is likely to show changes. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_403184], but will be continued in the remaining 
study subjects. If cycle lengths increase in more than 30% of participants and this 
increase is study related, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403185], bone density test by [CONTACT_112592], and breast MRI will be performed.  
If women develop amenorrhea, transvaginal probe ultrasonography and 
endometrial biopsies will be performed to ensure no adverse effects on the uterus.  
Manubai Nagamani, M.D. (a co -investigator) will prescribe and perform these tests. 
Study subject will be provided with a written pathological report for consultation with 
subject’s own primary physician. Reports will also be provided to the Medical Monitor.  
The total amount of blood drawn during each GCRC visit is 50 or 60 ml (3 .3 or 
4.0 tablespoons). Each subject will have a total of 12 GCRC visits for the collection of 
baseline and intervention data study.  The total amount of blood drawn will be 46 
tablespoons in 26 months . Blood chemistries, liver and thyroid function, lipid levels, and 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 19 serum ferritin levels of study subjects will be assessed once every 3 months during the 
study. If ferritin levels fall below 8 ng/ml, an iron supplement will be recommended. 
With blood drawing, there is a possibility of pain, bruising and infection. Blood draw will 
be performed by [CONTACT_112408].  
Other than discomfort, there is no other known risk associated with nipple 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. If subjects cannot tolerate nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_28526], this procedure may be 
omitted from these subjects. Nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403186].  
Mammography and DEXA are standard clinical tests. In these two tests, there is 
some radiation exposure. The amount of radiation exposure from mammography and 
bone density test will be equivalent to that of flying from [LOCATION_011] to Los Angeles.  
Radiation exposure may increase the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_50876].  Mammography and bone 
density test will be performed by [CONTACT_403240].  
Metal objects pose a serious risk for a MRI procedure because they can be 
affected by [CONTACT_403241]. Surgical clips and other metal implants can be pulled 
out of place and devices such as pacemakers will not work in the magnetic field. Prior to 
MRI, all metal objects including jewelry are removed. MRI will be performed by [CONTACT_403242].  
There is a possibility of crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], bleeding, infection, and uterine perforation 
with endometrial biopsies. Most women have a few cramps in the pelvis after 
endometrial biopsy procedure that may last off and on for a couple of days. It is also 
common to have a small amount of bleeding from the vagina. The most serious potential 
risk from this test is "perforation" of the uterus. This occurs if the biopsy Pi[INVESTIGATOR_403187], with too much force and it breaks through the wall of the uterus creating 
a hole. This is a problem because it can result in bleeding or infection, but this is not very 
common. One study found no infection and uterine perforation after [ADDRESS_508241]’s name. For additional precaution protecting against 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 20 loss of confidentiality, see the section “Disposition of Data”. All key research personnel 
involved in this research have completed the required Human Subject Training available 
at www.utmb.edu/him/him_roi/confiden.htm.  
There are no established benefits to the study.  
 Precaution, symptoms, and treatment of allergic reactions to soy: During initial 
screening, past history of allergic reactions to foods will be acquired. If subjects have 
prior histories of food allergies to soy  containing  food, they will be excluded. Symptoms 
associated with food allergies are diarrhea, fever and rashes. If subjects experience these 
allergy -like symptoms after pi[INVESTIGATOR_403162], they will be advised to stop the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403188]. If these symptoms recur upon resumption of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], the subjects will be discontinued from the remaining study. Subjects develop allergic 
reactions during the study will be treated as clinically indicated by a physician 
investigators ([CONTACT_32243] or Nagamani) in this project. Subjects are also encouraged to 
consult their own primary physicians.  
Cost of Participation.  
The cost of tests done as part of the research, such as screening mammography, 
breast MRI, bone density test, screening Pap Smears, and screening tests for blood 
chemistries, liver function, lipid profile and thyroid function will be provided to the 
subjects at no cost.  The costs of medical care and diagnostic tests (transvaginal probe 
ultrasound and endometrial biopsies) required for the evaluation of prolonged or absent 
menses and other adverse events possibly resulting from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403189]. The cost of follow -up diagnostic tests after an 
initial abnormal screening mammogram, such as spot compression and breast ultrasound, 
will be the subject’s responsibility. The cost of HPV test after an abnormal Pap test result 
during the screening period will also be given free. These follow -up diagnostic tests after 
an abnormal screening test generally can be paid for by [CONTACT_423]’s health insurance. 
The study pi[INVESTIGATOR_403190]. We will provide vitamin s, iron and 
calcium supplements to all subjects regardless of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403191].  
Remuneration .   
Subject will be reimbursed for study visits to the GCRC for parking and travel 
expenses, and for time and inconvenience resulting from participating in the study. 
Subject will be informed of the amount of reimbursement before the study starts. Subject 
will be reimbursed after the completion of the first 4 baseline blood draw visits ($ 200 for 
all 4 visits or $50 per visit), and thereafter after the completion of every blood draw visit 
($[ADDRESS_508242] year of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403192] $ 125 per visit every 3 
months for the second year of pi[INVESTIGATOR_403193]). If subject withdraw or become ineligible 
to continue prior to the completion of the study, subject will be reimbursed only up to the 
last completed blood draw visit.  Other than medical care that may be provided and any 
other payment specifically stated in this consent form, there is no other compensation 
available for participation. Subject may be removed from the study, if subject cannot 
comply with the study procedures described in this consent form (for example, if subject 
do not take the pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], miss scheduled GCRC visits, blood draws and radiologic tests, or do 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 21 not provide food records, urine collections,  menstrual records etc), if subject become 
pregnant, or if subject develop serious unexpected medical conditions.  
Reporting of Serious and Unexpected Adverse Events:  
 Adverse experiences that are both serious and unexpected will be immediately 
reported by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hr and in writing within 3 days to: 1) UTMB IRB, 2) 
UTMB GCRC, and 3) UTMB Research Subject Advocate.  
A UTMB IRB Adverse Event Report form will be used to report individual 
serious adverse event. For recurring adverse event, an aggregate report form will be 
generated to provide summary statistics for the study that will include resolution and 
potential protocol modification or study termination. The adverse event reports will 
include the name [CONTACT_4007] P.I. (Lee -Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.) and co -investigators (Tuenchit 
Khamapi[INVESTIGATOR_403167], M.D., Karl E. Anderson, M.D., and Manubai Nagamani, M.D.), name [CONTACT_403247] (Mammographic Density and Soy Isoflavones), UTMB IRB number ( 03-260) and 
UTMB GCRC protocol number ( #635 ), the number of subjects enrolled to date, the 
number and type of serious and unexpected adverse events previously reported. The 
report of the medical monitor ( [CONTACT_403249] H. Sandstead ) and a follow -up report 
describing the resolution of the adverse event will also be provided.  
The expected adverse events are lengthening of menstrual cycle by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_508243] lumps, abnormal endometrial histology/cytology, 
abnormal nipple aspi[INVESTIGATOR_403194], and abnormal blood chemistries. Unanticipated 
adverse events are breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, intercurrent illness and

Disposition of Data: All notebooks, Harvard DAQ , data collection forms, signed 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_403195], and PHQF relating to this study will be kept in the locked 
filing cabinets on the 3rd floor of Ewing Hall, Division of Human Nutrition, Department 
of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, [ADDRESS_508244]., Galveston, TX 
[ZIP_CODE] -1109 where PI’s office is located.  The electronic data will be stored on the UTMB 
PMCH server (pmch on utmbf4) and the Bioinformatics Core facility of GCRC until 
published, and then archived in CD ROMs at the end of the study. The records will be 
kept for at least five years after the completion of publications resulting from this 
support.  
During active data collection (e.g. screening, baseline and pi[INVESTIGATOR_403196]), the data collection forms have subjects’ names (to avoid making mistake), but 
these names will be wiped out from the forms and questionnaire and replaced with the 
assigned IDs as soon as the subjects complete the study. The PHQF is part of the 
subject’s medical records and will be filed as such as soon as the subjects complete the 
study.  
Each subject will be assigned a screening ID, BA001 to BA999 according to the 
Lee-Jane W. Lu, Ph.D.    
 22 order they sign the inform consent which is also the order they enroll in the study. There 
may be dropouts during screening/baseline period but the ID of the dropouts once 
assigned will not be replaced. The subjects who complete the baseline study and if 
qualify to continue the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403197] -assigned another ID as 
PL001 to PL999 according to the order they begin the pi[INVESTIGATOR_403198]. Randomization will be made using PL IDs. The IDs are assigned by [CONTACT_403243]. The Study Coordinators, PI, Dr. K.E. Anderson (co -investigator physician 
responsible for subjects’ well -being), and the Medical Monitor have access to this key 
during this period. After the completion of study, the key will be kept at the locked filing 
cabinet at the PI’s office and at this stage, the PI, [CONTACT_32243] and the Medical Monitor 
have access to the key.

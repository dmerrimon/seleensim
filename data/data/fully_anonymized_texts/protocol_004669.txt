Rationale for this Study  
 Triple negative  breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15 -20% of all breast cancers. Due to the lack of specific markers 
for effective targeted therapy, chemotherapy is the only therapeutic option for TNBC in the metastatic setting. 
Thus, novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_270243]. One of the potential 
therapeutic targets is the androgen receptor (AR). In TNBC, up to 30% of cancers may express AR. In mRNA -based 
sub-classification of TNBC, luminal AR subtype accounts for approximately 10% of TN BC. Efficacy of AR targeted 
therapy such as enzalutamide was observed in patients with AR + TNBC.  
As a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM), GTx -[ADDRESS_329436] responded to previous hormonal therapy and in women with AR +, triple negative breast 
cancer (AR+ TNBC).  
Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody of the IgG 4/kappa isotype that is believed to 
block the interaction be tween PD-2 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2. Pembrolizumab demonstrated sustained 
tumor regression with a response rate of approximately 24% in melanoma. Single agent pembrolizumab has a 
reported response rate in a cohort of 27 selected PD -L1+ TNBC patient s of 19% [46], with the 5 responses were 
seen in patients with 8, 6, 6, 3, 1 lines of prior therapy for metastatic disease.  ~47% had 3+ lines  in that study .  In a 
subsequent study presented after the initiation of this study,  a response rate of 5% was observed in 170 mTNBC 
patients , 44% with 3+ lines and no previously untreated patients . The 5% RR  was consistent between PD -L1 
positive and negative pat ients [67].   The combined RR for the two studies is approximately 7%, and the upper 
confidence interval  for the larger study is 9%, so we have modified the discouraging response rate to reflect the 
more recent and larger study and selected 9% for our updated discouraging response rate of the combination  (see 
statistical considerations).  
Immunotherapy and AR  targeted therapy representpromising therapeutic strategies for TNBC. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_270244], single agent AR targeted 
therapy is not adequate to induce durable clinical benefit . The complementary modes of action and low potential 
of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_270245]-PD-[ADDRESS_329437] the efficacy of com bining SARM GTx -024 
with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic  AR+ TNBC.

Study Design  
 
Following a successful lead -in, we originally proposed an  open-label Simon’s MiniMax two -stage Phase 2 study for 
metastatic  Androgen Receptor (AR) positive Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC). Eligible participants will receive 
pembrolizumab in combination with GTx -024.  This has been modified as noted in the statistical considerations 
due to the need to incorporate the more recent literature on the single agent P embrolizumab response rate.  
A [ADDRESS_329438] 6 participants to assess toxicity for the combination therapy with 
pembrolizumab and GTx -024. The starting dose will be Dose Level 1. If there are DLTs at Dose Level 1, attribute d to 
protocol therapy then Dose level -1 will be tested  as the starting dose . 
 Maximum cycles = 35 cycles  
 
Dose Levels  Pembrolizumab  
(IV infusion over 30 minutes;  
on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle)  GTx-024  
(Orally, once daily on Days 1 -21 of 
each 21-day cycle) 
 Dose Level -1 200 mg  9 mg  
Initial starting 
dose level Dose Level 1  200 mg  18 mg  
Subsequent participants enrolled on to the study will be treated at the tolerable dose defined during the safety 
lead-in. 
Participants will receive up to 35 cycles of treatment. If one agent is discontinued due to toxicity, then the 
participant may continue to receive single agent protocol therapy.

Statistical Considerat ions 
 
A Simon’s MiniMax two -stage Phase 2 design was the original design b ased on the initial reported response rate of 
19% with single agent pembrolizumab  [46]. However, this was based on only 27 patients.  Subsequently, a study of 
170 patients observed a response rate of only 5%.[67] While the original protocol design stated a 19% response 
rate (the single agent response rate in the first reported study) as the discouraging rate for the combination and 
required >2/[ADDRESS_329441] the data from the 
larger and more recent study  that showed a response rate of only 5% for single agent Pembrolizumab (with that 
same response rate applying to both PD -L1 positive and negative tumors) .  The later study had an upper  95% 
confidence limit of 9% RR, and the combined data from the two studies would result in a response rate of 
approximately 7%.  As a result, we have determined that 9% would be a more appropriate discouraging response 
rate given the more recent and larger report on single agent Pembrolizumab  and we consider a promising 
response rate a 20% increment, or a 29% response rate.   With the updated information, we will continue to accrue 
if at least 2/15 patients response ( representing a RR of at least 13.3%).  We will maintain the total sample -size at 
[ADDRESS_329442] 15 
patients with a response, and then adding an additional 14 patients to better estimate the response rate of the 
combination. With 2+/15 with a response  to continue , this is better than the upper 95% CI for the response rate 
reported in the larger and more recent study,  and satisfies the rule for continuing based on the SWOG planned 
versus attained design of Dahlberg ( Green SJ and Dahlberg S (1992). Planned Versus Attained Design in Phase II 
Clinical Trials.  Statistics in Medicine  11:853-862) for >1/15 responses based on a type I error of 5% and power of 
85% for distinguishing between a 9% and a 29% response rate.  With 29 total patients the SE of the response rate 
will be 9% or less.   
All eligible patients who start treatment will be considered in the calculation of the response rate . 
While both drugs are well -tolerated with non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], the initial [ADDRESS_329443] 6 patien ts we observe 2 or more 
patients with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first cycle, this will mandate a reduction in the starting dose for 
all subsequent patients. If dose level -[ADDRESS_329444] activity (AR by [CONTACT_270297]) and 
immune profiling. The correlative studies will be used to potentially refine patient selection for future studies, and 
understand the role of AR pathway activities and i mmune changes on the activity of the combination of 
pembrolizumab plus GTx -024. These correlative studies are considered exploratory in the context of this limited 
Phase II study; however, 12 samples provide 80% power to detect an effective size of 0.8 (80 % of the standard 
deviation), with a one -sided type I error of 5%.  
Safety/tolerability  
The safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and SARM GTx -024 will be evaluated via a safety 
lead-in. In addition, the CBR will be evaluated at 32 weeks (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1), the PFS will be evaluated, and the 
duration of response (time from documentation of tumor response to disease progression or death) will be 
evaluated.

2.0  BACKGROUND  
2.1  Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background information on MK -
3475 (pembrolizumab) and GTx -024. 
2.1.[ADDRESS_329460] cancer (TNBC)  
TNBC accounts for 15 –20% of all breast cancer and is characterized by a lack of expression of estrogen 
receptor ( ER), progesterone receptor ( PR), or HER2. TNBC occurs more frequently in younger patients (< 
50 years of age) and genera lly shows a more aggressive behavior [1]. Median surv ival for patients with 
advanced TNBC is [ADDRESS_329461] cancer with up to 95% of ER+ b reast 
cancers expressing AR. In TNBC, 12 -55% of cancers express AR depending on the study [2, 3]. Across al l 
subtypes of BC, AR expression is associated with a better overall survival and disease -free survival 
irrespective of co -expression of ERα in breast cancer [2, 4]. Emerging evidence has shown AR may serve 
as a therapeutic target for this subset of TNBC [4-6]. A recent phase II trial studying single agent 
enzalutamide in AR+ TNBC has demonstrated encouraging clinical benefit rate of 35% at 16 weeks follow 
up, with a median PFS of 14.7 weeks  [7].  A novel gene expression array may predict sensitivity to 
enzalutamide treatment [3]. 
2.1.3  Selective Androgen Receptor Modulator (SARM)  
 GTx-024 is an oral nonsteroidal selecti ve androgen receptor modulator (SARM) that is being developed 
for clinical use because of its selectivity for anabolic activity with minimal androgenic activity (i.e., tissue 
selectivity). GTx binds to the AR with similar affinity as testosterone. However,  GTx-[ADDRESS_329462] in different tissues, t hereby [CONTACT_225243] a 
different mix of genes being turned on and off and conferring more selective anabolic activities.

steroid biosynthetic enzymes (e.g.,  5 alpha(α) -reductase) between GTx -[ADDRESS_329463] the  efficacy of GTx -024 in AR+ advanced breast cancer (TNBC: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; 
ER+HER2-BC: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

2.1.4  Rationale of GTx -024 dosing selection  
GTx-024 has been evaluated in 21 completed and ongoing clinical studies enrolling over 1,500 total 
subjects. GTx -024 has been generally well -tolerated, including single doses up to 100 mg and multiple 
doses up to 30 mg once daily for up to 14 days. In longer studies, GTx -024 has also been generally well 
tolerated, including 1, 3, and 9 mg daily doses for up to 184 days (GTx  IB). Previous clinical studies 
demonstrated that daily doses up to 30 mg of GTx -024 were well tolerated in healthy male volunteers. 
Both 10 mg and 30 mg daily doses were for up to 14 days. Elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) (any 
elevation outside upper l imit of normal [ULN]) was the most common adverse event (AE) experienced. 
None of the subjects in the [ADDRESS_329464]. 
GTx-024 3 mg given daily was evaluated in two completed Phase 3 trials, in over 600 subjects, for the 
prevention and treatment of muscle wasting (cachexia) in subjects with advanced non -small cell lung 
cancer receiving chemotherapy. GTx -024 3 mg in creased lean body mass in both studies and was safe 
and well tolerated when dosed for up to 168 days. Subjects in the GTx -024 and placebo groups 
experienced similar AEs and these AEs were consistent with the background chemotherapy regimen.  
Although GTx -024 3 mg was chosen for its anabolic activity in muscle for the completed Phase 3 study, a 
dose of 9 mg once daily was selected for hormonal therapy in the ongoing Phase 2 trial in ER+ and AR+ 
metastatic breast cancer in order to achieve a higher exposure th at is both safe and more likely to be 
efficacious in women with advanced breast cancer. Seven out of twenty -two subjects with advanced, 
heavily pretreated (hormonal therapy, radiation, and chemotherapy) breast cancer demonstrated 
clinical benefit (CB) (sta ble disease [SD]) at [ADDRESS_329465] with SD (by [CONTACT_194398] [RECIST], Version 1.12), tumor regression of 27% was demonstrated. Consistent 
with the previous studies, GTx -024 remained safe and well tolerated.  
In TNBC, doses of 15 –[ADDRESS_329466]. In TNBC patients, the 18 mg dose is preferred over a lower dose due to the 
aggressive phenotype of the disease and poor prognosis. Based on preclinical data, the 18 mg dose is 
more likely to saturate the AR and may lead to better clinical outcomes than a lower dose without 
receptor satura tion or progesterone receptor inhibition. Based on the safety data collected to date in 
both preclinical and clinical settings, 18 mg dose will be safe and generally well tolerated. Currently, an 
ongoing Phase II study is evaluating the efficacy of GTx -024 at a dose of 18mg po daily in patients with 
AR+ TNBC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). However, in the event that a subject has a Grade 3 or greater toxicity, the 18 
mg dose may be reduced to 9 mg until the AE resolves or for the remainder of treatment based on the 
Investig ator’s discretion. The [ADDRESS_329467] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has 
been known for decades [8]. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TILs) in canc er tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies [9-20].  In particular, 
the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulator y T-cells seems to 
correlate with improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors [17, 21-26]. One of the 
major causes of immune tolerance is expression of inhibitory T cell co -receptors such as cytotoxic T - 
lymphocyte -associated protein 4 (CTLA -4) and programmed cell death1 (PD -1). Strategies reversing 
immune tolerance to promote anti -tumor immunity h ave been proven successful. These include anti -
Page 16 of 113 
CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], which improves overall survival in melanoma [27, 28]. An 
alternative strategy is blocking PD -1.  
The PD-[ADDRESS_329468] hijacked by [CONTACT_44857] 
[29]. The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the  cell surface of activated T -cells under healthy 
conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune 
reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 
which has been  shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands 
(PD-L1 and/or PD -L2).  The structures of murine PD -1 alone [30] and in complex with its ligands were 
first resolv ed [31, 32]and more recently the NMR -based structure of the human PD -1 extracellular 
region and analyses of its interactions with its ligands were also reported [33]. PD-1 and family members 
are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V-type) domain re sponsible for 
ligand binding, and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The 
cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based 
inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immun oreceptor tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM). Following T -cell 
stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its 
cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and  ZAP70 
which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [34]. The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_329469] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_270246] [35].   
PD-1 has been shown to be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -
cells, B-cells, T regs and  Natural Killer cells [36]. Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4 -CD8- (double negati ve) T-cells [37] as well as subsets of macrophages [38] and 
dendritic cells [39].  The ligands for PD -1 (PD-L1 and PD -L2) are co nstitutively expressed or can be 
induced in a variety of cell types [40], including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors. 
Both ligands a re type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC-like domains in the 
extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs. Binding of 
either PD-[ADDRESS_329470] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in 
lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammat ory environments [40].  PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell 
activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell functio n in 
peripheral tissues.  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor [41]. PD-1 has been suggested to  
regulate tumor -specific T-cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL) [42].  This suggests that the 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an 
attractive target for therapeutic intervention [43]. 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclon al antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and 
PD-L2[44]. Pembrolizumab demonstrated sustained tumor regression with a response rate of 
approximately 24% in melanoma, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxicities in patients regardless of previous 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_270247] [45]. Single agent activity of pembrolizumab is currently been studied for HER2 positive 
breast cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Single agent pembrolizumab has a reported response rate in a cohort of 
27 selected metastatic PD-L1+ TNBC patients of 19% (ref 46), with the 5 responses seen in patients with 
8, 6, 6, 3, 1 lines of prior therapy for metastatic disease.  ~47% had 3+ lines in that study.  In a 
subsequent study presented after the initiation of this protocol,  a response rate of  5% was observed in 
170 mTNBC patients , 44% with 3+ lines and no previously untreated patients. The 5% RR  was 
Page 17 of 113 
consistent between PD -L1 positive and negative patients (ref YYY).   The combined RR for the two 
studies is approximately 7%, and the upper conf idence interval for the larger study is 9%, so we have 
modified the discouraging response rate to reflect the more recent and larger study and selected 9% for 
our updated discouraging response rate of the combination (see statistical considerations).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for including subjects with PD -L1 negative tumors  
The KN 012 TNBC proof -of-concept data was obtained in subjects with PD -L1 positive tumors (PD -L1 
staining in ≥1% tumor cells or in stroma) [46]. No data was originally available on the performance of 
pembrolizumab in breast cancer patients with PD -L1 negative tumors (i.e., PD -L1 staining in <1% tumor 
cells and no stromal staining) , but KEYNOTE-86 Arm A  suggests a 5% response independent of PD -L1 
status in metastatic TNBC . Combined with the limited data using PD -L1 expression as a biomarker 
predicting response to pembrolizumab, and patients with PD -L1 negative tumors may benefit from 
pembrolizumab, PD -L1 expression will not be used for patient selection. Instead, analysis of PD -L1 
expression will be included as a correlative study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rationale for Dose Selection of Pembrolizumab  
The dose of pembrolizumab planned to be studied in this tri al is 200 mg Q3W. The dose recently 
approved in the [LOCATION_002] for treatment of melanoma subjects is 2 mg/kg Q3W. Although the dose 
of pembrolizumab studied in KN 012, which established efficacy and safety in mTNBC, was 10 mg/kg 
Q2W, recent studies in o ther tumor types have indicated that 10 mg/kg Q2W and [ADDRESS_329471] to efficacy and tolerability.  
An open-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity 
of single agent M K-3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 
3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors  [47].  
All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in 
human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size 
reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/ kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No MTD has been identified to date. 
10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, 
B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity. Recent data from other clinical  studies within 
the MK-3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule may be 
sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, limi ted 
volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) 
suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days). This early PK and pharmacodynamic 
data provides scientific rationale for testing a  Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from 
[ADDRESS_329472] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The 
differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight based 
regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposu re margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -
3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and 
safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher 
Page 18 of 113 
dose and exposure). The  population PK evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of 
tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma 
indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different ind ication 
settings. 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is based on 
simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that the fixed dose of 
200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures  that 1) are optimally consistent with those obtained with 
the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range 
established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individ ual 
patients exposure in the exposure range established in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.  
A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to 
reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing sch eme will also reduce complexity in the logistical 
chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  The pembrolizumab dose of 200mg Q3W has formed a 
foundation for ongoing combination therapeutic protocols.  
2.1.6  Rationale for studying immunotherapy in combinati on with AR targeted therapy in AR+ TNBC  
Immunotherapy and AR targeted therapy represent the most promising therapeutic strategies for TNBC. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_270248] 2 trials of AR targeted therapy such as enzalutamide, 
single agent A R targeted therapy is not adequate to induce durable clinical benefit. The complementary 
modes of action and low potential of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_270249] -PD-1 therapy pote ntially promising.  
2.2  Preclinical Studies  
2.2.1  Preclinical Data for Pembrolizumab  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed preclinical data.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  PD-[ADDRESS_329473] shown that administration of antibodies  blocking PD -1/PD-L1 
interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T cells and ultimately leads to tumor rejection, 
either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities [41, 48, 49]. Anti-mouse PD -
[ADDRESS_329474] demonstrated antitumor responses in models of squa mous cell 
carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal carcinoma  [49-53]. 
In such studies, tumor infiltration by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells a nd increased IFN -γ, granzyme B and perforin 
expression were observed, indicating that the mechanism underlying the antitumor activity of PD -1 
checkpoint inhibition involved local infiltration and activation of effector T cell function in vivo [51]. 
Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy of anti -mouse PD -1 antibody as a monoth erapy, as well 
as in combination with chemotherapy, in syngeneic mouse tumor models (see pembrolizumab IB).  
2.2.[ADDRESS_329475] cancer cells stably transfected with the AR were treated with 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), GTx -024, or the inactive R -isomer of GTx -[ADDRESS_329476] cancer cell growth. MDA -MB-231-AR cells were implante d 
subcutaneously in nude mice and were treated orally (PO) with vehicle or 30 mg/kg/day GTx -027, a 
close structural analog of GTx -024[54]. Tumor growth was reduced significantly, with greater than 75% 
tumor growth inhibition observed, compared with vehicle -treated tumors. The intratumoral expression 
of genes and pathways that promote breast cancer development through its actions on the AR were also 
suppressed. Similar tumor suppressive activity was observed in patient -derived xenograft models of 
TNBC (unpublished dat a). These data, coupled with the early clinical success of androgens in breast 
cancer, support the clinical evaluation of GTx -[ADDRESS_329477] cancer.  
2.3  Human Studies  
2.3.1  Clinical Data for Pembrolizumab  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed clinical data . 
Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and 
PD-L2. Pembrolizumab was recently approved in the US for the treatment of advanced, unresectable or 
metastatic malignant melanoma, and for use in melanoma subjects with disease progression after prior 
treatment with (a) ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90913] (b) a BRAF inhibitor, in th e case of BRAF V600 -mutant disease [55]. It is 
the first anti -PD-[ADDRESS_329478] 18.3% potentially lasting clinical activity [46], while a larger subsequent 
study showed a response rate of 5% in mTNBC, with the same response rate for PD -L1-positive and 
negative patients .[67] Currently there are no completed studies completed evaluating the efficacy of 
pembrolizumab in ER+ breast cancer.  Most common adverse reactions  (reported in ≥20% of patients) 
with:  melanoma included fatigue, pruritus , rash, constipation, diarrhea, n ausea, and decreased 
appetite; NSCLC included fatigue, decreased appetite, dyspnea and cough. In The P001 and P002 
melanoma and lung subjects, the most commonly reported drug related adverse event across the 
pembrolizumab d osing regimens are fatigue (27.9%), pruritus (19.0%), rash (14.0%), diarrhoea (12.3%), 
arthralgia (11.5%), and nausea (10.2%) (Pembrolizumab IB).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pembrolizumab Immune -Medicated Side Effects  
The most frequent potential immune -mediated adverse reactions rep orted in patients treated with 
pembrolizumab were hypo/hyperthyroidism, pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, and hypophysitis 
(Pembrolizumab IB).  Refer to Table 6 for dose modification for this immune -mediated side effects.  
Immune-Mediated Pneumonit is: Pneumonitis occurred in 32 (2.0%) of 1567 patients receiving 
KEYTRUDA in melanoma trials, including Grade 1 (0.8%), Grade 2 (0.8%), and Grade 3 (0.4%) 
pneumonitis. The median time to development of pneumonitis was 4.3 months (range: 2 days to 19.3 
months). The median duration was 2.6 months (range: 2 days to 15.1 months). Twelve (38%) of the 32 
patients received corticosteroids, with 9 of the 12 receiving high -dose systemic corticosteroids for a 
Page 20 of 113 
median duration of 8 days (range: 1 day to 1.1 months) fol lowed by a corticosteroid taper. Pneumonitis 
led to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 9 (0.6%) patients. Pneumonitis completely resolved in 21 
(66%) of the 32 patients.  
Immune-Mediated Colitis:  Colitis occurred in 31 (2.0%) of 1567 patients receiving pem brolizumab in 
melanoma trials, including Grade 2 (0.5%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 4 (0.1%) colitis. The median time 
to onset of colitis was 3.4 months (range: 10 days to 9.7 months). The median duration of colitis was 1.4 
months (range: 1 day to 7.2 month s). Twenty -one (68%) of the 31 patients received corticosteroids, all 
of whom required highdose systemic corticosteroids for a median duration of 6 days (range: 1 day to 5.3 
months) followed by a 5 corticosteroid taper. Colitis led to discontinuation of pe mbrolizumab in 14 
(0.9%) patients. Colitis resolved in 27 (87%) of the 31 patients. Colitis occurred in 4 (0.7%) of 550 
patients with NSCLC, including Grade 2 (0.2%) or Grade 3 (0.4%) colitis in pati ents receiving 
pembrolizumab.  
Immune-Mediated Hepatitis : Hepatitis occurred in 16 (1.0%) of 1567 patients with melanoma receiving 
pembrolizumab, including Grade 2 (0.1%), Grade 3 (0.7%), and Grade 4 (0.1%) hepatitis. The time to 
onset was 26 days (range: 8 days to 21.4 months). The median duration was 1.2 months  (range: 8 days 
to 4.7 months). Eleven (69%) of the 16 patients received corticosteroids, with 10 of the 11 receiving 
high-dose systemic corticosteroids for a median duration of 5 days (range: 1 to 14 days) followed by a 
corticosteroid taper. Hepatitis led  to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in 6 (0.4%) patients. Hepatitis 
resolved in 14 (88%) of the 16 patients.  
Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies : Hypophysitis occurred in 13 (0.8%) of 1567 patients with 
melanoma receiving pembrolizumab including Grade 2 (0.3 %), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 4 (0.1%) 
hypophysitis. The time to onset was 3.3 months (range: 1 day to 7.2 months). The median duration was 
2.7 months (range: 12 days to 12.7 months). Twelve (92%) of the 13 patients received corticosteroids, 
with 4 of the 12 patients receiving high -dose systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to 
discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 4 (0.3%) patients. Hypophysitis resolved in 7 (54%) of the 13 patients.  
Immune-Mediated Thyroid Disorders:  
o  Hyperthyroidism  occurred in 51 (3.3%) o f 1567 patients with melanoma receiving 
pembrolizumab, including Grade 2 (0.6%) and Grade 3 (0.1%) hyperthyroidism. The median time 
to onset was 1.4 months (range: 1 day to 21.9 months). The median duration was 1.7 months 
(range: 1 day to 12.8 months). Hyp erthyroidism resolved in 36 (71%) of the 51 patients.  
o  Hypothyroidism  occurred in 127 (8.1%) of 1567 patients with melanoma receiving 
pembrolizumab, including Grade 3 (0.1%) hypothyroidism. The median time to onset of 
hypothyroidism was 3.3 months (range: 5  days to 18.9 months). The median duration was 5.4 
months (range: 6 days to 24.3 months). Hypothyroidism resolved in 24 (19%) of the [ADDRESS_329479] commonly reported side  effects for GTx -024 in the previous 21 
clinical studies include: headache; back pain; diarrhea; pain in arm or leg; upset stomach; constipation; 
fatigue; dizziness; inc reases in liver enzymes; flu -like symptoms; anemia ; reduction in high density 
lipoproteins; visual disturbances. Dyspnea was observed more frequently in subjects that received 3 mg 
Page 21 of 113 
GTx-024 (~13%) as compared to placebo (~7%) in two Phase III trials in pat ients with stage III and IV 
NSCLC receiving chemotherapy consisting of a platinum doublet chemotherap y with a taxane or non -
taxane.  
GTx-024 treatment has been generally well -tolerated, inclu ding 1 mg, 3 mg and 9 mg daily doses. The 
important potential ris ks identified for GTx -024 are: 
o  Dose-dependent, transient, asymptomatic increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 
observed in some of the Phase [ADDRESS_329480] at doses up to 3 
mg/day. Most of the subjects studied to date h ad ALT levels that remained within normal limits. 
ALT levels returned to normal with continued exposure to GTx -[ADDRESS_329481] cases and, when 
dosing was not continued, levels returned to normal. In the Phase 3 clinical studies (N=651) in 
subjects with NSCLC r eceiving chemotherapy, 6 subjects receiving GTx -024 had an ALT lab values 
≥ [ADDRESS_329482] from the study. No significant  
increases in total bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase, or lactate 
dehydrogenase have been observed in patients with elevated ALT levels in the Phase 3 studies. 
There were no other consistent, clinically relevant, dose -related effects of GTx -024 on ECGs or  
vital sign measurements (blood pressure/heart rate).  
o  Dose-dependent reduction in high density lipoprotein (HDL) of 27 -31% were observed at a 3 mg 
dose in healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal females. This change is con sistent with the 
effects of other orally administered anabolic agents. The clinical significance of these changes is 
unknown. There were no other consistent, clinically relevant, dose -related effects of GTx -024 on 
ECGs or vital sign measurements (blood pre ssure/heart rate). No reductions in HDL were 
reported during the Phase 3 clinical studies in patients with NSCLC (N=326 receiving GTx -024 3 
mg/day for up to 147 days).  
o  Dyspnea was observed more frequently in subjects that received GTx -024 3 mg/day (42 subj ects, 
~13%, 54 events reported) as compared to placebo (23 subjects, ~7%, 33 events reported) in 
two Phase 3 trials in patients with Stage III and IV NSCLC receiving chemotherapy consisting of a 
platinum doublet chemotherapy with a taxane (N=321) or non -taxane (N=330). Twelve of these 
events were serious, and were equally distributed among subjects receiving placebo and GTx -
024 3 mg/day. There was only one other serious event of dyspnea for a subject administered 
GTx-[ADDRESS_329483] cancer 
study (GTx -024 9 mg/day), but none of these events were serious.  
In cancer trials, treatment -related AEs occurred at a similar frequency in each treatment group ( Table 
2.3.1).  The most commonly occurring treatment -related events were those associated with the 
gastrointestinal system (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea).  These events occurred in <3% of subjects 
(GTx-024 IB).

2.4  Overview of Proposed Study  
This is an open -label, Phase 2, single institutional trial of pembrolizumab in combination with GTx -024 
for patients with histologically proven diagnosis of metastatic AR+ TNBC who have measurable disease 
(per RECIST 1.1 Criteria). Pat ients will receive pembrolizumab at a dose of [ADDRESS_329484] 6 participants will 
enroll at a 3 at risk safety lead -in to ensure the safety/ tolerability of  the combination regimen.  
Patients may be therapy naïve or may have  failed any number of  prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_270250]. Paraffin -embedded tumor tissue must be available for assessment of biomarkers and patient 
must be able to provide tissue for  PD-L1 biomarker analysis from a newly obtained formalin fixed tissue 
or recent biopsy of a tumor lesion not previously irradiated. Patients may not have prior treatment with 
any other anti -programmed cell death protein -1 (anti-PD-1), or PD ligand -1 (PD-L1) or PD ligand -2 (PD-
L2) agent or an antibody targeting other immune -regulatory receptors or mechanisms. Patients may also 
not have previous treatment with AR targeted agents (including but not limited GTx -024, bicalutamide 
or enzalutamide).  
Since each age nt may have its own anti -cancer properties if one agent is discontinued due to toxicity, 
then the participant may continue to receive single agent protocol therapy.   
Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s) (A Es), 
concurrent illness that prevents further administration of study treatment, investigator’s decision to 
withdraw the subject from study treatment  or withdrawal.    
Page [ADDRESS_329485] dose of protocol therapy or until initiation of a new anti -cancer 
therapy (whichever occurs sooner) . 
Follow up r esponse assessment for participants who end treatment and yet to progress wi ll be every 3 
months until disease progression (verified by [CONTACT_270300])  or initiation of a new anti -cancer 
therapy. Participants who progress or initiated a new anticancer therapy will be followed biannually or 
as requested by [CONTACT_270301] (PI) .  
2.4.1  Correlatives and biomarker analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor tissue correlatives  
Previous research data suggested that CD8 T cell infiltration and PD -L1 expression within tumors may 
predict efficacy for pembrolizumab, but definitive biomarkers are not yet a vailable [56-60]. To identify 
biomarkers to predict and/or follow efficacy for pembrolizumab in combination with GTx -024 in patients 
with metastatic TNBC, we propos e the following correlative studies to analyze the immune and stromal 
cells within metastatic tumors, as well as immune cells in peripheral blood, before and after therapy:  
Biopsies of tumor tissue(s) prior to study initiation and at the end of study will  be obtained. Key 
questions we will address include:  
o  Immune and stromal cell characteristics before treatment that correlate with clinical response 
[56]. This includes PD-L1 expression levels.  
o  Changes in immune and stromal cells after therapy that correlate with clinical response [57].  
The following methods will be utilize d to address the above questions:  
o  12-color FACS  analysis to enumerate/phenotype immune cell subsets and functional readouts, 
including cytokine production and signaling (phosflow).  
o  TCR repertoire analysis via deep sequencing . Expansion of the T cell reper toire after therapy 
will be evidence for an immunological response and may indicate epi[INVESTIGATOR_270251].  
o  Immunohistology  using a novel quantitative, spatial image analysis system (Vectra, Perkin 
Elmer) that will enable us to analyze immune, stromal, and cancer  cells in metastatic tumors via 
8-color histology.  
o  Gene expression analysis of stromal cells via RNA -Seq or microarrays : Messenger RNA (mRNA) 
expression profiling in tumor specimens and peripheral blood will be completed to assess 
expression either by [CONTACT_270302], to define a gene set critical for clinical response to 
pembrolizumab. The hypothesis to be tested is that pembrolizumab induces responses in 
tumors that reflect an inflammatory/immune cell -rich phenotype based on gene expression. 
Expression of individual genes related to the immune system may also be evaluated, such as 
immune signatures and critical cytokines.  
o  Morphological / IHC TIL analysis of tumor biopsies : Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes have been 
shown to provide prognostic and pote ntially predictive value, particularly in TNBC and HER2 -
overexpressing breast cancer. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -stained breast tumor sections can 
be evaluated for TILs, according to a recently published standardized methodology [61]. We will 
evaluate: (1) pre -treatment TILS as a predictor of response to combination therapy; (2) specific 
Page 24 of 113 
TIL subsets (e.g. CD4, CD8, Treg distribution) and other immunological correlatives (e.g. TCR 
repertoire analysis) as  possible predictors of response; (3) change in TILs as a result of the 
combination therapy.  
Sequencing technologies, such as whole genome sequencing or single cell RNA sequencing, allow global 
assessment of DNA mutations and gene expression profiles, whic h can provide molecular phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_270252], including the ultimate outcome of disease. We will use 
single cell sequencing technology to characterize a given tumor for both its mutational profile and 
phenotypic st atus using fresh tumor tissue.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Peripheral blood immune biomarkers (Serial cytokine measurements)  
Blood samples will be obtained  to track the temporal dynamics of the host immune response.    
The 30 cytokine panel includes: epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF), eot axin, basic fibroblast growth factor 
(FGF-basic), granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony -stimulating 
factor (GM -CSF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interferon al pha (IFN-α); IFN-gamma (γ), interleukin -1 
beta (IL-1β), interleukin -[ADDRESS_329486] (IL -1RA), IL-2; interleukin -2 receptor (IL -2R), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, 
IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40/p70, IL -13, IL-15, IL-17, IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP -10), monocyte 
chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP-1), monokine induced by [CONTACT_20129] -γ (MIG), monocyte inflammatory protein -
1 alpha (MIP -1α), monocyte inflammatory protein -1 beta (MIP -1β), regulated upon activation, normal T 
cell expressed and secreted cytokine (RANTES), tumor necro sis factor (TNF) -α, and VEGF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Androgen Receptor Signaling  
Tumor specimen will be processed for mRNA extraction and AR signaling pathway will be analyzed. 
Association of AR signaling pathway and response to the combination therapy will be studied.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)  
Circulating DNA fragments carrying tumor -specific sequence alterations (ctDNA) are found in the cell -
free fraction of blood, representing a variable and generally small fraction of the total circulating DNA. 
Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the rapid identification of somatic genomic 
alterations in individual tumors, and these can be used to design personalized assays for the monitoring 
of ctDNA. Studies have shown the feasibility of using ctDNA to moni tor tumor dynamics in a limited 
number of patients with various solid cancers, but few cases of breast cancer have been analyzed [62]. 
We will acquire serial peripheral blood and will examine the peripheral  blood ctDNA and the effect of 
the combination of GTx -024 pembrolizumab on the ctDNA profiling.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor-derived exosomes  
Exosomes are small membrane -bound vesicles that present abundantly in peripheral blood. Tumor -
derived exosomes (TEX) are thought to carry  immunosuppressive molecules and factors which can 
interfere with immune cell functions  [63]. Through delivering suppressive cargos consisting of proteins 
similar to those in parent tumor cells  to immune cells, TEX may influence the antitumor activities of 
immune cells. Hence, TEX may potential to serve as noninvasive biomarkers of tumor progression. In this 
study, we will evaluate TEX’s and TEX -associated immune biomarkers in association with p atient’s 
response to AR targeted therapy and Pembrolizumab combination . 
2.5  Study Endpoints  
A primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Safety analysis 
will be carried out based on toxicities assessed by [CONTACT_270303] 4.0. Adverse events will be analyzed 
Page 25 of 113 
including but not limited to all AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and laboratory changes. Immune -related adverse 
events (irAEs) will also be collected.  
The other primary endpoint is to determine the response rate (CR or PR vi a RECIST 1.1) of the 
combination of pembrolizumab with GTx -024 in patients with AR positive advanced TNBC.  
Other secondary end points includes: clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 24 weeks; duration of response 
(DOR), PFS, EFS, TTF, OS to test the efficacy of t herapy of the novel drug combination assessed by [CONTACT_270304] 1.1. Any event (toxicity -related or progression) will be counted as “treatment failure”. Kaplan -
Meier estimates will be generated for PFS, failure -free survival and OS.  
Furthermore, secondary  endpoint include assessing efficacy using irRECIST, an adaptation of RECIST 
version 1.1 to account for the unique tumor response characteristics to treatment with new 
immunotherapeutic agents, including pembrolizumab.

5.0  TREATMENT PROGRAM  
5.1  Treatment Overview  
This is an open -label Simon’s MiniMax two -stage Phase 2 trial for advanced Androgen Receptor (AR) + 
TNBC. The first 6 patients will be monitored as part of a safety lead -in in a 3 at risk design  to determine 
safety and tolerability of the combination  regimen- pembrolizumab and GTx -024.  
Participants will be administered protocol therapy in the outpatient setting in each 21 -day cycle (see 
Section 5.3  and Section 5.4 ). Participants will receive up to 35 cycles of treatment . If one agent is 
discontinued due to toxicity, then the participant may continue  to receive  single agent protocol therapy . 
Participants who end protocol therapy ( Section 5.6) will undergo follow -up (Section 5.7 ).  Windows for 
all assessments and treatments are detailed in Section 10.0 . 
5.2  Treatment Cycle Definition  
Each cycle is defined as the administration of protocol therapy.  
In the absence of a delay of initiating a new cycle due to toxicity, each treatment cycle lasts 21 days, 
with a window of ± 3 days for participant convenience .  
Day 1 of each treatment cycle is defined by [CONTACT_270308]. If pembrolizumab is 
permanently discontinued and GTx -024 is being continued, then each cycle will be 21 ± [ADDRESS_329502] 6 participants 
to assess toxicity for the regimen.  Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are defined in Section 12.1  and will be 
evaluated during Cycle 1.   
Table 5.3 Dosing regimen a nd schedule  
 
Dose Level Pembrolizumab  
(IV infusion over 30 minutes;

each 21-day cycle) 
 Dose Level -1 200 mg  9 mg  
Initial starting 
dose level Dose Level 1  200 mg 18 mg 
5.3.2  Phase 2 Cohort 
Subsequent participants enrolled on to the study will be treated at the tolerable dose defined during the 
safety lead -in. Refer to Section 12. 0 for details.  
5.4  Agent Administration  
5.4.1  Pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab (200 mg) will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle.  
Every effort should be made to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, 
Page 33 of 113 
given the variability of infusion pumps, a window of  -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., 
infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  
The pembrolizumab dose is fixed at [ADDRESS_329503] . 
5.4.2  GTx-024 
GTx-024 should be taken daily (e.g. Days 1-21 of each 21 -day cycle). Participant may be provided 
sufficient supply to include the 3 day cycle duration window ( 21 ± 3 days) .  
On Day 1 of Cycle 1, GTx -024 should be taken after pembrolizumab.  
GTx-024 should be taken with water at approximately the same time each day with or without food.  
GTx-024 capsules should be swallowed whole.   
If a participant misses a dose and > [ADDRESS_329504] passed since the scheduled dose time, the missed 
dose will be skipped and will not be made up.  Doses that are vomited will not be made up.  
Participants will be given a patient diary to document each dose of GTX -024 that is taken or missed 
(Appendix C ). 
Management and dose modification asso ciated with GTx -024 adverse events are outlined in Section 6.2 .  
5.5  Assessments and Special Monitoring  
Refer to Section 10.0  summarizes the trial procedures to be performed. Note: Protocol therapy should 
be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all procedures/safety assessments have been completed.  
It may be necessary to perform study procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically 
necessary by [CONTACT_093] .  
5.5.1  Special Monitoring  
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent 
an immunologic etiology. These adverse events may occur shortly after the first dose or several months 
after the last dose of pembrolizu mab 
Diarrhea/colitis  
  Participants should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism  
  Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients for changes 
in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as 
indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clin ical signs and symptoms of thyroid 
disorders.  
Page 34 of 113 
Management of infusion reactions  
  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally 
resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
  Appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available in the room and a physician 
readily available during the period of drug administration . 
5.5.2  Bone metastases and disease evaluation  
Bone scans will also be utilized to assess osseous metastases for participants with a known histor y of 
bone metastases or if clinically indicated during screening (see Section 10.0 ).  
A bone scan at follow up is required only if the participant develop new or worsening symptoms or if the 
investigator believes the par ticipant has attained a Complete Response.   
Additionally, plain X -ray evaluation will be obtained for symptomatic sites with negative bone scan 
evaluations.  
5.5.3  Brain metastases and disease evaluation  
Brain imaging should be performed in patients with known brain metastases at baseline and during the 
study. Imaging should occur as stated in Section 10.0 .  
5.6   Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from  Protocol Therapy   
Participants will receive protocol therapy until on e of the below criteria are met:  
o  Confirmed disease progression  
  Note: Participants with confirmed radiographic progression per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_329505] criteria for progression will continue to receive protocol 
therapy following consultation of the Study PI .  
o  Completed 35 cycles of treatment (~24 months)  
o  Participant is deemed intolerant to protocol therapy because of toxicity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_58349]/ delay  
  Note: If one agent is discontinued due to toxicity, then the  participant may continue to 
receive single agent protocol therapy  
o  General or specific changes in the patient's condition which render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
o  Withdrawal of consent for further pro tocol therapy (See Section 16.5 ) 
Once participants meet criteria for removal from protocol therapy, the participant should then proceed 
to End of Protocol Therapy assessments.  
Documentation  of the reason for dis continuing protocol therapy and the date effective should be made 
in the source documentation  and appropriate CRF . The COH DCC should be promptly notified of the 
change in participant status.  
5.7  Follow Up  
Following completion of protocol therapy, all partici pants will enter follow -up after ending protocol 
treatment.  This is comprised of:  
Page [ADDRESS_329506] dose of protocol therapy through to (a) [ADDRESS_329507] 
dose of protocol therapy or (b) until initiation of a new anticancer therap y (whichever occurs 
sooner) 
  Exception:  If a participant received 4 cycles of GTx -024 monotherapy (~ 90 ± 7 days) beyond 
pembrolizumab discontinuation, then then the participant will only be followed for [ADDRESS_329508] dose of protocol therapy . 
  Note the period for safety follow -up will be extended until stabilization or resolution for all 
reportable AEs ( per the agreement of the Study PI ) and accompanying follow -up safety 
report. 
o  Follow-up for response  for those who have yet to have disease progression.  
o  Follow-up for survival  for those who progress ed or initiated a new anti -cancer therapy.  
  Follow-up for survival may be obtained by [CONTACT_167018], contact[CONTACT_270309].  
Assessment time points and windows are detailed in Section 10.0 . 
5.8  Duration of Study Participation  
The reason(s) for discontinuing study participation should be documented and may include:  
o  Completion of study activities (tre atment and follow -up) 
o  Withdrawal of consent (See Section 16.5 ) 
o  Participant is lost to follow -up. All attempts to contact [CONTACT_270310].  
o  At the discretion of the investigator for safety, beha vioral, study termination or administrative 
reasons 
The reason for study completion and associated date must be documented in the source documentation 
and the study -specific case report form (CRF). The participant’s status is to be modified in the COH 
clinical trial management system once the participant completes the study.  The COH DCC should be 
promptly notified of the change in participant status.  
5.[ADDRESS_329509] be instructed not to ta ke any additional medications (including over -the-counter 
products) during the trial without prior consultation with the investigator..  
5.9.1  Prohibited  concomitant medication  
The following are  prohibited  until from Day 1 of protocol therapy until end of protoco l therapy (last day 
of study agent or decision to end study agent(s) whichever occurs later) : 
o  Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
o  Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
o  Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
o  Other investi gational agents other than pembrolizumab and GTx -024 
o  Live vaccines  
o  Testosterone or testosterone -like agents (methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, oxymetholone, 
danazol, fluoxymesterone, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_2119], androstenedione) other androgenic 
compounds or an ti-androgens  
Page 36 of 113 
o  Hormone replacement therapy: estr ogens and/or megesterol acetate  
o  Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the PI . 
Participants  who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.   
5.9.2  Use with Caution 
The following medications (see Table 5.11 ) should be used with caution when co -administering GTx -024: 
o  Potent CYP3A4 inducers  may decrease the rate and extent of exposure of GTx -024 and its 
glucuronide metabolite  
o  UDP inhibitors may increase GTx -024 and glucuronide exposure  
o  Substrates of BCRP  may increase exposure of the BCRP substrate

5.9.3  Other Considerations  
Refer to Appendix B  for contraception related guidance.  
5.9.4  Supportive Care Guidelines  
With the exception of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_270259] 5.9.1 , participants should receive appropriate 
supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707] .   
Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic  
etiology are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous 
treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not 
improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note t hat several courses of steroid tapering may be 
necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts 
should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which 
might require additional supportive care.  
The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines the events to be 
related to pembrolizumab .  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event.

7.0  DATA & SAFETY MONITORING  PLAN, ADVERSE EVENT  AND 
UNANTICIPATED PROBLE M REPORTING  
7.1  COH Data and Safety Monitoring  
Definition of Risk Level  
This is a Risk Level 4 study as defined in the City of Hope Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan .  
This determination was made because the study involves a COH IND . 
Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring  
The Protocol Management Team (PMT) is responsible for monitoring the data and safety of this study.  
The PMT consists of the Principal Investigator (PI), Biostatistician, Research Protocol Nurse, and Clinical 
Research Coordinator . 
The PMT is required to submit periodic status reports (i.e., the PMT Report) according to the frequ ency 
prescribed in the City of Hope Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan .  Important decisions made 
during PMT meetings (i.e. , dose escalation, de -escalation, etc.) only need to be noted in the PMT Report 
submitted to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_270268], assessing the  severity (i.e., grade), 
expectedness, and attribution of all adverse events.  
Adverse Event (AE) - An adverse event is any untoward medical experience or change of an existing 
condition that occurs during or after  protocol specific intervention , whether or  not it is considered to be 
related to the protocol intervention.  
Reporting Non -serious Adverse Events  – Adverse events will be collected after the patient is given the 
study treatment or any study related procedures.  Adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_36925].  
Adverse events that do not meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems will be 
reported only in the PMT Report.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  [per 21 CFR 312.32 ] - defined as any expected or unexpected adverse 
events that result in any of the following outcomes:  
  Death 
  Is life-threatening experience (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred) 
  Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (equal to or greater than 24 hours) or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
  Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may j eopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscras ias of convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse).  
 
Page 50 of 113 
Reporting Serious Adverse Events  - begins after study treatment or any study related procedures.  All 
SAEs occurring during this stud y, whether observed by [CONTACT_099], nurse, or reported by [CONTACT_102], 
will be reported according to the approved City of Hope’s Inst itutional policy .  Serious Adverse Events 
that require expedited reporting will be submitted electronically using iRIS. 
Adverse Event Name [CONTACT_270345] [INVESTIGATOR_270269] (grade) by [CONTACT_270311] 4.0.   
Expected Adverse Event  - Any event that does not meet the criteria for an unexpected event, OR is an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research pa rticipant experiencing the adverse event.  
Unexpected  Adverse Event [21 CFR 312.32 (a) ] – An adverse event is unexpected if it is not listed in the 
investigator ’s brochure and/or package insert; is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; is not consistent with the risk information described in the protocol and/or consent; is not an 
expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, condition, or predisposed risk factor of 
the research participant experiencing the adverse event.  
Adverse Event Attribution  
The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study 
agent or study p rocedure. 
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent or study procedure and unrelated to 
any other cause.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the investigational agent or study procedure and unlikely 
related to other cause(s).  
Possible -The AE may be related to the investigational agent or study procedure and may be related 
to another cause(s).  
Unlikely -The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent or study procedure and likely 
related to another cause(s).  
Unrelated -The AE is clearly not related to the investigational agent or study procedure and is 
attributable to another cause(s).  
Expedited AE Reporting Guidelines  
Each AE will be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for expedited reporting. Adverse event 
reporting is to occur according to the site’s specific IRB guidelines, and as outlined in this Section.  
Expedited Adverse Event Reporting to Local IRB  
Sites are to report to their local IRB per their site’s specific institutional and IRB guidelines.  As soo n as

COH Held IND   
Serious Adverse Events meeting the requirements for expedited reporting to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 , will be reported as an IND safety report using the 
MedWatch Form FDA 3500A for Mandatory Reporting . 
The criteria that require reporting usin g the Medwatch 3500A are:  
  Any unexpected fatal or life threatening adverse experience associated with use of the drug 
must be reported to the FDA no later than 7 calendar days after initial receipt of the information 
[21 CFR 312.32(c)(2) ] 
  Any adverse experience associated with use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected 
must be submitted no later than 15 calendar days after initial receipt of the informa tion [21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1) ] 
  Any follow -up information to a study report shall be reported as soon as the relevant 
information becomes available. [ 21 CFR 312.32(d)(3) ]

[INVESTIGATOR_270272]’s Institutional policy . 
Deviations and Unanticipated Problems  
 
Deviation - A deviation is a divergence from a specific element of a protocol that occurred without prior 
IRB approval.  Investigators may deviate from the protocol to eliminate immediate hazard(s) for the 
protection, safety, and well -being of the study subj ects without prior IRB approval.  For any such 
deviation, the COH PI [INVESTIGATOR_270273] [ADDRESS_329544] Exception (SSE)  
An SSE is a planned deviation, meaning that it involves circumstances in which the specific pro cedures 
called for in a protocol are not in the best interests of a specific patient.  It is a deviation that is 
anticipated and receives prior approval by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_72616].  The SSE must be submitted as a “Single 
Subject Exception Amendment Request” via  iRIS in accordance with COH IRB guidelines and the Clinical 
Research Protocol Deviation policy .  An IRB approved SSE does not need to be submitted as a deviation 
to the DSMC . 
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  – Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all three  of the 
following criteria:  
1.  Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given t he following: a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol -related documents such as the IRB approved research 
protocol, informed consent document or Investigator Brochure (IB); and b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied; AND 
Page 53 of 113 
2.  Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcomes may have been caused by [CONTACT_177435], devices or procedures involved in the research); AND 
3.  Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than previously known or recognized.  
 
Any UP that occurs during study conduct will be reported to the COH DSMC and COH IRB in accordance 
with the City of Hope’s Institutional policy  using iRIS.  
COH Held IND  
The Office  of IND Development and Regulatory  Affairs (OIDRA) will assist the COH PI [INVESTIGATOR_270274] (FDA).  
7.[ADDRESS_329545] Requiring Expedited Reporting  
7.2.1  Definition of an Overdose  
For purposes of this trial, an o verdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or 
greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose 
of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinicall y indicated. In the 
event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  
If an AE(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a pembrolizum ab, the AE(s) is reported as 
a SAE, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
If a dose of pembrolizumab meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated 
clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is repo rted as “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.”  
7.2.2  Pregnancy and Lactation  
Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of 
investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactati on in a participant (spontaneously 
reported to them) that occurs during the trial; See Table 7.3. 
Efforts must be made by [CONTACT_270312].  
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted 
ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events 
(Important Medical Events).  
If the pregnancy continues to  term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported; weight and 
length of child, Apgar scores (with an explanation of score <10), and congenital abnormalities. If the 
new-born is healthy additional follow -up is not necessary.

by [CONTACT_24518] [ADDRESS_329565]. Synold ’s lab for processing. Samples must be processed 
within one hour of collection  to minimize the possibility of white blood cell lysis. For processing, 
centrifuge the samples at 820g for 10 min at room temperatu re and transfer 1 mL aliquots of the plasma 
to sterile 2 mL microtubes. Freeze plasma aliquots at -80 °C. Remove the Buffy coat layer into a separate 
pre-labeled tube and store at -800C. Record corresponding information such as collection time, freezing 
time, and aliquot number.  
Flow Cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing : Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be 
isolated from the blood of patients per manufacturer protocol. For flow cytometry, cells will be 
stained for immune subtype markers a nd sorted by [CONTACT_74064] -activated cell sorting (FACS) or 
CyTOF. For single cell sequencing, the cells will be loaded in Smarter ICELL8 single cell mRNA chip or 
the 10x, imaged via microscopy, and single cell libraries will be prepared per manufactures 
instructions.  Next generation sequencing will be performed.

11.0  ENDPOINT EVALUATION CRITERIA/ MEASUREMENT OF 
EFFECT 
11.1  Primary Endpoint s  
Safety lead -in: The safety and tolerability of the pembrolizumab plus GTx -024 combination. Safety 
analysis will be carried out based on toxicities assessed by [CONTACT_3989], version 4.0 criteria. AEs will be 
analyzed including but not limited to all AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, and laboratory changes. Immune -related 
adverse events (irAE) will be collected (also see Section 12.3). See Section 12.1  for DLT definitions.  
Phase 2: The primary endpoint is to assess the response rate (CR or PR via RECIST 1.1) of the 
combination of pembrolizumab with GTx -024 in patients with AR+  advanced TNBC  (see Appendix D ). 
11.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints for the study are stated in Table 11.2 . Since any event (toxicity -related 
or progr ession) will be counted as “progression”, the feasibility and efficacy endpoints will provide 
useful information for future trial designs. RECIST 1.1 will be used to assess response, EFS, TTF; Kaplan -
Meier estimates will be generated for overall survival ( OS). Analysis to assess response and clinical 
benefit will be carried out using irRECIST (see Appendix E ). 
Table 11.2 Secondary Efficacy En dpoints 
Endpoint Patients Definition 
Progression -free survival 
(PFS) All patients  Time to disease progression/ relapse or death as a result of any cause  
Clinical benefit rate (CBR)  All patients  Lack of progression at 24 weeks

Overall survival (OS)  All patient s Time to death as a result of any cause  
Time to treatment failure 
(TTF) All patients  Time to treatment termination for any reason (progression, toxicity, death, 
patient preference)  
Event-free survival (EFS)  All patients  Failure of treatment or death as a result of any cause  
11.3  Correlative Endpoints  
Proposed candidate biomarkers are listed in Table 11.3 . These endpoints will be assessed at baseline

12.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1  Dose-limiting toxicities  
Dose limiting toxicity (DLT)  is defined as any of the following that occur during the first cycle  that are 
attributed as possibly, probably, or definitely related to protocol therapy for the safety lead-in: 
o  Delay > 14 days in initiating Cycle 2  
o  Planned dose of GTx -024 is < 75% during Cycle 1  
o  Death not clearl y due to underlying disease or extraneous causes  
Hematologic  
o  Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding requiring transfusion  
o  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
o  Grade 4 neutropenia that persists more than 5 days  
o  Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia  
  Grade 3 febrile neutro penia: defined as ANC < 1000/ mm3 with a single temperature of > 38.3 
oC or a sustained temperature of  ≥ 38 oC  for > 1 hour  
Non-Hematologic  
o  Any  ≥ Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity with the following exceptions : 
  Grade 3 rash that resolves to ≤ Grade 1 with in 14 days with appropriate supportive therapy  
  Grade 3 myalgia, fatigue, or constipation that resolves to ≤ Grade 1 within 7 2 hours  
  Grade 3 electrolytes  abnormality  that lasts < 72 hours that is not clinically complicated, and 
resolves spontaneously or re sponds to conventional medical interven tions  
  Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that lasts < 72 hours with adequate antiemetic and 
other supportive care . 
  Grade 3 hypersensitivity and injection site reactions  
  For patients with liver metastases who bega n treatment with Grade ≤ 2 hepatic 
transaminase : transaminase level ≥ 10x ULN lasting ≤ 7 days. 
o  Hy’s law: concurrent ALT/AST > 3.[ADDRESS_329577] AND total bilirubin > 2.[ADDRESS_329578] 1 dose of study drug will be evaluable for response.  
In order for participants to be evaluable for DLT during the safety lead-in (See Section 5.3 ) during Cycle 
[ADDRESS_329579]:  
o  Receive ≥ 75% of the planned dose for GTx -024 and undergo all safety monitoring assessments 
for Cycle 1 OR 
o  Experience a DLT.  
Participants  who experience a Grade 3/[ADDRESS_329580] with evidence of metastatic AR+ TNBC 
who have measurable disease (per R ECIST 1.1 Criteria). Patients  must have confirmed AR+ TNBC. Eligible 
patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks in combination with GTx -024 at a dose of 
either 18 mg po or 9 mg po  daily as determined by [CONTACT_270318] -in (see Section 5.3 ). 
Study treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event(s) (AEs), 
concurrent illness that prevents further administration of study treatment, investigator’s decision to  
withdraw the subject  from study treatment, consent withdrawal, becoming lost -to-follow-up, death or 
for administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.  
After discontinuation of study treatment, each subject will be followed for [ADDRESS_329581] 
initiates new anticancer therapy  (whichever occurs earlier).  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression will have post -
treatment follow -up for disease status every 3 months until disease progression or initiation of a non -
study anticancer treatment.  
All subjects will be followed by [CONTACT_270319] (or as requested by [CONTACT_1016]) via medical record review, 
review of social sec urity registry, or telephone call for overall survival until consent withdrawal, 
becoming lost to follow -up, death or end of the study.  
12.4  Sample Size Accrual Rate  
Sample-size: 29 patients. The estimated accrual rate will be one patient per month for a total of 18 
months. 
12.5  Statistical Analysis Plan  
12.5.1  Primary Objective: Response Rate  
A Simon’s MiniMax two -stage Phase 2 design was the original design b ased on the initial reported 
response rate of 19% with single agent pembrolizumab . However, this was based on only 27 patients.  
Subsequently, a study of 170 patients observed a response rate of only 5%. [67] While the original 
protocol design stated a 19% response rate (the single agent response rate in the first reported study) as 
the discouraging rate for the combin ation and required >2/[ADDRESS_329582] the data from the larger and more recent study that showed a 
response rate of only 5% for single agent Pembrolizumab (with that same response rate app lying to both 
PD-L1 positive and negative tumors).  The later study had an upper 95% confidence limit of 9% RR, and 
the combined data from the two studies would result in a response rate of approximately 7%.   As a 
result, we have determined that 9% would be a more appropriate discouraging response rate given the 
more recent and larger report on single agent Pembrolizumab and we consider a promising response 
rate a 20% increment, or a 29% response rate.  With the updated information, we will continue to 
accrue if at least 2/15 patients response (13.3%).  We will maintain the total sample -size at [ADDRESS_329583] .   With 2+/15 with a response to

continue, this is better than the upper 95% CI for the response rate reported in the larger and more 
recent study,  and satisfies the rule for continuing based on the SWOG planned versus attained design of 
Dahlberg ( Green SJ and Dahlberg S (1992). Planned Versus Attained Design in Phase II Clinical 
Trials. Statistics in Medicine  11:853-862) for >1/15 responses based on a type I error of 5% and power of 
85% for distinguishing between a 9% and a 29% response rate.  With 29 total patients the SE of the 
response rate will be 9% or less.  
While both drugs are well -tolerated with non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685], the initial [ADDRESS_329584] 6 patients we 
observe 2 or more pat ients with dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)  (See Section 6.2 ) in the first cycle this will 
mandate a reduction in the starting dose for all subsequent patients. If dose level -[ADDRESS_329585] activity (AR by [CONTACT_270320]) and immune profiling. The correlative studies will be used to potentially refine patient 
selection for future studies, and understand the role of AR pathway activities and immune changes on 
the activity of the combination of pembrolizumab plus GTx -024. These correlative studies are 
considered exploratory in the context of this limited Phase 2 study; however, 12 samples provide 80% 
power to detect an effective size of 0.8 (80% of the standard deviation), with a one -sided type I error of 
5%.  
12.5.2  Safety/tolerability  
The safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and SARM GTx -024 will be evaluated 
via a safety lead -in. In addition, the CBR will be eva luated at 24 weeks (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1), the PFS will be 
evaluated, and the duration of response (time from documentation of tumor response to disease 
progression or death) will be evaluated.

APPENDIX B: CONTRACE PTION GUIDELINES 
Pembrolizumab and GTx-[ADDRESS_329617] azoospermia 
(whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).   
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they are either:  
(postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 mo nths with no menses without an alternative medical cause; in 
women < 45 years of age a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hor monal 
replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient.); OR  
 have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_108611]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks pr ior to screening; OR  
has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing.  
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a 
partner, respectively, while receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_329618] dose of study drug by [CONTACT_270333]:   
1.  Practice abstinence† from heterosexual activity; OR  
2.  Use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception during heterosexual activity.   
Single method (one of the follo wing is 
acceptable) : 
o  intrauterine device (IUD)  
o  vasectomy of a female subject’s 
male partner  
o  contraceptive rod implanted into the 
skin Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
o  diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in 
conjunction with cervical cap/spermicide)  
o  cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
o  contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
o  male condom or female condom (cannot be used 
together)  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole  method of contraception if it is consistently 
employed as the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_270334]/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, sympto -thermal, post -ovulation m ethods, etc.) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.   
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_427]/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an 
acceptable method of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region.  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn 
baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study subjects of childbearing 
potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described above) from the day of study medication 
initiation (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period 
up to [ADDRESS_329619] should not be entered into the 
study.

APPENDIX D: RECIST C RITERIA V1.[ADDRESS_329624] Criteria V1.1 [65]. 
Disease Parameters  
Measurable diseas e  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_329625] x -ray, as >[ADDRESS_329626] scan, or >[ADDRESS_329627] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions 
of centimeters).  
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered 
measurable.  If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions  under which such 
lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol.  
Malignant lymph nodes   
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_329628] scan (CT scan slice thickness rec ommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At 
baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable disease   
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short  axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -
measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], 
simple cysts. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the 
same patient, these are preferred for s election as target lesions.  
Target lesions   
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of 
all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on oc casion, the largest lesion does not 
lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal le sions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  
Page 94 of 113 
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further cha racterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions   
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target 
lesions should be identified as non-target lesion s and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline 
evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more 
than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified 
and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to 
evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being f ollowed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions   
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and 
palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g ., skin nodules).  In the case 
of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, 
is recommended.  
Chest x-ray   
Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defin ed and 
surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI   
This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice 
thickness is [ADDRESS_329629] slice thickness grea ter than 5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. 
for body scans).   
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resol ution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally.  
As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the techni cal specifications of the scanning sequences used should 
be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality 
used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be 
measured /assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to 
prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisiti on protocol should be followed as closely 
as possible to prior scans.  Bodyscans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if 
possible. 
Page [ADDRESS_329630] (with IV and 
oral contrast), then the CT portion of the P ET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, 
that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound   
Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review 
at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same 
technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next.  If new lesions are 
identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is 
concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.  However, such 
techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to 
determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an 
endpoint. 
Tumor markers  
Tumor markers alone cannot be used t o assess response.  If markers are initially above the upper 
normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific 
guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in re current 
prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 96:487 -488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461 -3467, 1999; J Clin 
Oncol 26:1148 -1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_329631] -line trials 
in ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534 -1535, 2000].  
Cytology, Histology   
These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and complete responses 
(CR) in rare cases (e.g., resi dual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual 
benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria  for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and 
progressive disease.  
Page [ADDRESS_329632] scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the 
following algorithm:  
o  Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based on a 
new lesion.  
o  No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -
up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], th is is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are 
needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will 
be the date of the init ial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the 
anatomic images, this is not PD.  
o  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner  similar to a biopsy in cases 
where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use 
of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and 
supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical liter ature for the indication.  However, it must be 
acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET 
and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an upt ake greater than twice 
that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of  the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of 
one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study

Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  
All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note:  If tumor markers are initiall y above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive  Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.     
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and the progression status should be confirmed at a 
later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest me asurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be accepted as disease 
progression.  
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requir ing discontinuation of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  
Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement 
criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as 
reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since 
the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria 
for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline meas urements.

APPENDIX  E: IMMUNE RELATED RES PONSE CRITERIA  
Immune related RECIST (irRECIST) is an adaptation of RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_329633] 1.1 may not provide 
an accurate assessmen t of response to immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab [66], and will 
therefore be used with the adaptations referred to  as irRECIST.  
Antitumor response based on total measurable tumor burden  
For the irRECIST, only index and measurable new lesions are taken into account (in contrast to 
conventional WHO criteria, which do not require the measurement of new lesions, nor do t hey include 
new lesion measurements in the characterization of evolving tumor burden). At the baseline tumor 
assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all index 
lesions (five lesions per organ, up to 10 viscera l lesions) is calculated. At each subsequent tumor 
assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable lesions (up to 5 new lesions per organ; 
10 visceral lesions) are added together to provide the total tumor burden: Tumor Burden = SPD index 
lesions + SPD new, measurable lesions.  
Table E 1: Comparison WHO and irRECIST criteria  
 
  WHO irRECIST  
New, measurable lesions  Always represent PD  Incorporated into tumor burden  
New, 
nonmeasurable lesions  Always represent PD  Do not define progression (b ut preclude irCR)  
Non-index lesions  Changes contribute to defining BOR of CR, PR, 
SD, and PD  Contribute to defining irCR (complete 
disappearance required)  
CR Disappearance of all lesions in two 
consecutive observations not less than 4 wk 
apart  Disappearance of all lesions in two consecutive 
observations not less than 4 wk apart  
PR ≥50% decrease in SPD of all index lesions 
compared with baseline in two observations 
at least 4 wk apart, in absence of new lesions 
or unequivocal progression of non -index 
lesions  ≥50% decrease in tumor burden compared with 
baseline in two observations at  least 4 wk apart  
SD 50% decrease in SPD compared with baseline 
cannot be established nor 25% increase 
compared with nadir, in absence of new 
lesions or unequivocal progression of non -
index lesions  50% decrease in tumor burden compared with 
baseline can not be established nor 25% increase 
compared with nadir  
PD At least 25% increase in SPD compared with 
nadir and/or unequivocal progression of non -
index lesions and/or appearance of new 
lesions (at any single time point)  At least 25% increase in tumor bu rden compared 
with nadir (at any single time point) in two 
consecutive observations at least [ADDRESS_329634]  
Percentage changes in tumor burden per assessment time point describe the size and growth kinetics of 
both conventional and new, measurable lesions as they appear. At each tumor assessment, the 
response in index and new, measurable lesions is defined based on the change in tumor burden (after 
ruling out irPD). Decreases in tumor burden must be assessed rela tive to baseline measurements (i.e., 
the SPD of all index lesions at screening). The irRECIST were derived from WHO criteria and, therefore, 
the thresholds of response remain the same. However, the irRECIST response categories have been 
modified from those  of WHO criteria as detailed in Table E1. 
Overall response using the irRECIST  
The sum of the products of diameters at tumor assessment using the immune -related response criteria 
(irRECIST) for progressive disease incorp orates the contribution of new measurable lesions. Each net 
Percentage Change in Tumor Burden per assessment using irRECIST criteria accounts for the size and 
growth kinetics of both old and new lesions as they appear.  
Definition of Index Lesions Response Using irRECIST  
irComplete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all index lesions. This category encompasses 
exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_270336].  
irPartial Response (irPR) : Decrease, relative to baseline, of 50% or greater in the sum of the 
products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index and all 
new measurable lesions (i.e. Percentage Change in Tumor Burden).  
Note: the appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the 
overall tumor burden, but does not aut omatically qualify as progressive 
disease until the SPD increases by ≥25% when compared to SPD at nadir  
irStable Disease (irSD) : Does not meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in the absence of progressive 
disease. 
irProgressive Disease (irPD)  At least 25% inc rease Percentage Change in Tumor Burden (i.e., taking 
sum of the products of all index lesions and any new lesions) when 
compared to SPD at nadir  
 
Definition of Non -Index Lesions Response Using irRECIST  
irComplete Response (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all non-index lesions. This category 
encompasses exactly the same subjects as “CR” by [CONTACT_270337] (irPR) or irStable Disease 
(irSD): Non-index lesion(s) are not considered in the definition of PR, 
these terms do not apply  
irProgressive Disease (irPD)  Increases in number or size of non -index lesion(s) does not 
constitute progressive disease unless/until the Percentage 
Change in Tumor Burden increases by 25% (i.e., the SPD at nadir 
of the index lesions increases by [CONTACT_270338] a mount) 
Page [ADDRESS_329635] will be based on these criteria ( Table E2): 
irComplete R esponse (irCR):  Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions (index and non -index together with 
no new measurable/unmeasurable lesions) for at least 4 weeks from the date of 
documentation of complete response  
irPartial Response (irPR):  The sum of the produ cts of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index 
lesions is measured and captured as the SPD baseline. At each subsequent tumor 
assessment, the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters 
of all index lesions and of new measur able lesions are added together to provide 
the Immune Response Sum of Product Diameters (irSPD). A decrease, relative to 
baseline of the irSPD compared to the previous SPD baseline, of 50% or greater is 
considered an immune Partial Response (irPR) . 
irStable Disease (irSD):  irSD is defined as the failure to meet criteria for immune complete response or 
immune partial response, in the absence of progressive disease  
irProgressive Disease (irPD)  It is recommended in difficult cases to confirm PD by [CONTACT_270339]. Any of the 
following will constitute progressive disease:  
  At least 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions over 
nadir SPD calculated for the index lesions.  
  At least a 25% increase in the sum of the products of all index lesions  
and new measurable lesions (irSPD) over the baseline SPD calculated for 
the index lesion.

*Decreases assessed relative to baseline (scan prior to start of any protocol therapy), including measurable lesions only  
†Assuming response (irCR) and progression (irPD) are confirmed by a second, consecutive assessment at least [ADDRESS_329636] (irBOR)  
irBOR is the best confirmed irRECIST overall response over the study as a whole, recorded between the 
date of first dose until the last tumor assessment before subsequent therapy (except for local pal liative 
radiotherapy for painful bone lesions) for the individual subject in the study. For the assessment of 
irBOR, all available assessments per subject are considered.  
irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR assessment must be confirmed by a second 
(confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response and performed no less than [ADDRESS_329637] met.

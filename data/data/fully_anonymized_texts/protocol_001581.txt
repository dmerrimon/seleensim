APPENDIX A: PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY CHECKLIST.................................................... [ADDRESS_1193426] for advanced cancer patients by 
[CONTACT_856918], virtual 
modalities , engage in shared-decision-making, and participate in educational activities .  
The secondary aims are to improve patients’ experience of their care including overall health and 
emotional and mental health status, improve patient satisfaction with care and decision-making and 
advance care planning. 
Hypothesis  
Compared to patients who receive usual advanced cancer care, patients who partner with lay 
health care coaches are hypothesized to experience lower rates of acute care utilization, lower 
numbers of emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_382669] 6-months post-enrollment. Secondarily, 
we will explore the effect of the intervention on satisfaction with care, overall health and emotional 
and mental health status, from time to enrollment to [ADDRESS_1193427]-enrollment and within 30 days prior 
to death among those who died during the 12-month follow-up period.  
 
  
2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Advanced cancer is an incurable condition , the second leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002], 
and incidence rates are expected to increase and costs are expected to double over the next 
seven years. Many patients and families currently describe a poor quality of life with difficult 
decisions, little understanding of the disease context, unnecessary pain and suffering, and treatment 
options that are often provided far from their residence. Care delivery is often fragmented with poor 
care coordination and lack of resource utilization closer to patient and family needs.  
Often quality of life, especially at the end of life, is improved when care is coordinated, components 
of proactive health and well-being are adopted and elements of patient-centered care help 
establish the Goals of Care Plan with appropriate documentation, and when special attention is 
provided to allowing care delivery to be received closer to patient’s neighborhood. We recognize 
that in any situation, goals of care may change with the delivery of care for patients with advanced 
cancer; however , establishing improved care coordination, care goals that provide guidance and 
reassurance and develop with the patient and his/her support network, and providing care in a 
patient-centered approach can result in significant improvements in patient experience and may 
ultimately help to contain health care spending. 
 
The key elements address three major challenges: 1) patients with cancer and their families face 
confusing choices and difficult decisions and 2) Patients at the end of life may suffer pain or 
uncontrolled symptoms along with poor care coordination associated with their cancer diagnoses.  
The proposed patient-centered care program addresses these three critical care elements by 
[CONTACT_856919] , engage in shared-decision-making, and participate in educational activities .  
Cancer related symptom management is addressed through the establishment of a nurse-supervised 
protocol-driven  proactive symptom relief for patients with cancer . The desired  outcomes include : 1) 
Identify and engage patients with advanced or newly  diagnosed cancer, and to include their family 
members and support network  in decisions about their health care plans ; 2) Ensure patients and 
families understand prognosis and document goals for life, and link patients to health  care coaches 
to make optimal life decisions 3) Implement  established protocols and operations to improve timely 
symptom control and  oncology care coordination. 
 
 
  
3.[ADDRESS_1193428] proper screening (see below section titled “Screening Procedures” for specific details), 
the staff will create a list of eligible patients and their primary oncology appointment times. At the 
patient’s oncology appointment, the oncologist will present the study and initiate the consent 
procedure (see below section titled “Consent Procedures” for specific consent details). 
Screening Procedures The Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_856903] 3.2 
- Diagnosis (ICD-9) codes 
- Provider Referrals (request for oncology consultation) 
- Pathology results (must be positive for malignancy) 
- Biopsy requests 
- Abnormal test results (mammograms, colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], imaging results) 
Screen failures will not be included in the study data. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_11247] a record of history and reasons 
for screen failures; however, any patient information gathered during this process will be destroyed. 
Consent Procedures 
The oncologist will refer eligible patients to the program. The program manager or the primary 
oncologist will introduce will obtain consent from eligible patients at the patient’s primary oncology 
appointment following advanced cancer diagnosis. The program manager or the oncologist will 
introduce the research project and provide a consent form document describing the project with 
sufficient information to potential participants.  Patients will be provided adequate time to make an 
informed decision regarding their participation. Participants must sign an IRB approved informed 
consent document prior to participation in any study specific procedure. The participant will receive 
a copy of the signed and dated consent form document. The original signed informed consent 
document will be retained in the research file. Patients who refuse participation or have no capacity 
for decision-making will not be included in the study. 
If a patient consents, patients will be provided a welcome letter with basic information and contact 
[CONTACT_33733]. 
For all patients assigned to the health care coach, the program manager will provide the coach with 
the patient’s phone number and the coach will contact [CONTACT_856920]: assisting patients with their goals of care, documenting goals of 
care, and assisting with symptom assessment. The intervention will be provided in addition to the 
usual care processes.

2. The patients must be [ADDRESS_1193429]’s identification number will be used on all subject-
specific documents and research-related forms. 
During registration, patients will be randomized to two arms (Arm A: Usual Care Arm B: Health Care 
Coach Intervention). Specifically, the patients will be randomized into two arms by [CONTACT_105975].  
All patients will be surveyed over the course of the study regarding patient experience with care, 
patient satisfaction and overall health status and emotional and mental health status (using the CG-
CAHPS: Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) , advanced 
care planning, and symptom assessments (using the ESAS: Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale) 
and healthcare use.  A member of the project team, excluding the Health Care Coach, will 
administer the assessments and conduct an electronic health record review of all health care use at 
baseline, 3, 6, [ADDRESS_1193430] 
review at external facilities by [CONTACT_2960] a health release authorization form at each of the outcome 
assessment time periods. The symptom assessments will be administered at baseline for each patient 
in the intervention and control. Participant information should be entered into the local databases 
within 7 calendar days. 
 Arm A: Usual Care (Control) / No Intervention 
Patients in this arm receive “usual” care from their care team. 
 
 Arm B: Health Care Coach Arm / Intervention Group 
The intervention will be comprised of a health care coach assignment with a baseline 
introduction (either telephonic or in-person) of the program followed by a visit (telephonic or 
in-person) with the health care coach within [ADDRESS_1193431] patient based on patients’ 
ongoing needs (i.e. weekly to monthly) and will conduct symptom assessments based on 
patients’ treatment plans and symptoms for 6-months post-enrollment. All symptoms that are 
scored 4 or above and/or change by [ADDRESS_1193432] meetings with patient’s family and caregivers at 
the same time intervals as needed and upon request. All health care coach interactions will 
be logged and will include date of the interaction, details of the interaction, and the duration 
of the interaction.  
Choosing the Health Coach: 
Possible health coaches are identified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Park, the site PI.  Candidate health coaches are 
educated fully about the project and the workflow. Health coaches who are interested in engaging 
in this study are appointed. Health coaches do not need to have a clinical background to engage in 
this study.   
Training the Health Coach: 
The oncology care team of a triage RN, APN/PA, or PI [INVESTIGATOR_856904]. The manuals include a highly detailed workflow of the project, from 
enrollment to completion. Coaches will learn about what to say during patient contact, advanced 
care planning conversations, the administration of various psychosocial questionnaires, the study 
calendar, data management, and key contact [CONTACT_3031].   
Supervising the Health Coach: 
The health care coach will be supervised by [CONTACT_856921]/PA who provides oncology 
treatment support and also training. The triage RN or APN/PA will ensure that the protocol is carried 
out correctly and address any issues that may arise in the health care coach’s workflow. The health 
care coach will participate in weekly meetings with the health coach in addition to daily supervision 
and will participate in monthly meetings with the rest of the project members (at both Stanford and 
St. Jude) to review study accrual and program goals. At these meetings, the health care coach will 
be responsible for providing a report on project progress and project issues.  
Psychometric Measures  1. The Consumer Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems 
(CG-CAHPS) will be used to assess patient satisfaction, overall health status, and overall emotional 
and mental health status. Information about the measure can be found here: 
https://cahps.ahrq.gov/Surveys-Guidance/CG/index.html 
2. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) will be used to measure the presence and 
degree of pain symptoms. The ESAS will be administered to the control group (at 0 months of 
diagnosis) and intervention group (every 2 weeks). The health care coach will embed the ESAS results 
for the control and intervention groups into Allscripts and alert the patient’s provider that the results 
are available and if an issue exists. 
[CONTACT_33749] has used both of these measures with success before with a similar project completed at the 
Palo Alto Veterans Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Palo Alto, CA).  Information about this measure can be found here: 
http://www.npcrc.org/files/news/edmonton_symptom_assessment_scale.pdf  
If patients feel discomfort while conducting their surveys they may choose to not complete them.  If 
there are any psychological events that occur during the study, these will be reported to the NPOD 
and MOD via the site PI. 
Site PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Park 
[CONTACT_77108] is responsible for site study supervision as well as the following: conducting biweekly meetings 
with all study members, troubleshooting recruitment and follow-up challenges, training the health 
care coaches, ensuring proper data collection, and general upkeep.  The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_856905], [CONTACT_33749]. As this is [CONTACT_33749]’s conception, and 
she pi[INVESTIGATOR_33725], she will be able to provide [CONTACT_77108] with specific advice and 
recommendations should challenges arise.  
Protocol Director: [CONTACT_856926]. Patel  is responsible for the overall study, submitting IRB and protocol amendments, corresponding 
with the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_856906]-up. [CONTACT_33749] is also 
responsible for overseeing data analysis and manuscript publication. 
5.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
Biostatistician: Manisha Desai PhD and Kris Kapphahn (Stanford University) 
5.1 Outcome Measurements 
None of the listed outcomes relate to safety: 
Primary Outcome Measure  
The specific key measurement used to measure the effect of the intervention corresponding to the 
primary outcome is acute care utilization. Utilization will be measured evaluating comparisons of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], emergency department visits, referrals to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33728], time to first 
contact [CONTACT_856922], duration of care coach contacts, frequency of care coach contacts, and 
symptom assessment changes throughout the study and time to intervention. Electronic health 
record review at the facility, review of health records at external facilities, and patient-report will be 
utilized to assess dates and utilization of all acute care use, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856907].  
Secondary Outcome Measures  The specific key measurements corresponding to the secondary objective are several patient-
reported outcome tools:  
Satisfaction with Care and decision making and overall health and emotional and mental health 
status: CAPHS-G will be used to assess satisfaction with care, overall health status, and overall 
emotional and mental health status among patients at each of the specified time periods after 
enrollment. A [ADDRESS_1193433] will provide oversight on analysis and data collection.  
5.2 Analysis Plan (see Detailed Statistical Analysis Plan Attached) 
All patients will be included in the analysis based on their randomization assignment at time of 
enrollment. The unit analysis will be completed at the participant-level. We will conduct descriptive 
statistics to evaluate balance between demographic (i.e., sex, age, race/ethnicity) and clinical 
variables (i.e., stage of cancer, diagnosis of cancer) between both the randomized and control 
groups. To assess our primary outcome of the effect of the intervention on acute care use within 6-
months post-enrollment we will assess % of patients with acute care use. We will create a (composite 
measure for acute care use that includes both ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. To compare risk of acute 
care use (composite measure) and individual ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856908] [ADDRESS_1193434]-enrollment, we 
will use Cox regression models.    We will also compare counts of total ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(composite measure of acute care use) within the first 6 months, using General Estimating Equation 
with Poisson family, log link, and independent correlation.  
For secondary outcomes of ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856908] 12 months, we will compare use using 
GEE models.  We will compare counts of total ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (composite measure of acute 
care use) within 12 months, using General Estimating Equation (Poisson) with an offset term for length 
of follow-up. To compare goals of care discussion and documentation, Advance Directive 
documentation, Physician Order for Life Sustaining Treatment documentation, Chemotherapy, 
Radiation, Surgery, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125], and palliative care within 12 months, we will use GEE models to compare 
odds of documentation or use across groups.  For end-of-life health care use, we, we will compare any 
ED use and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856909] (30 days prior) and proportion of participants with palliative care 
and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856910] 12-month 
study. 
For secondary outcomes, we will assess change in patient-reported outcome scores from 
baseline (at time of enrollment) to 6-months (post-enrollment). For satisfaction variables with responses 
“never”, “sometimes,” “usually,” or “always” we will report results as the proportion of participants who 
respond “always” at 6-months post-enrollment compared to all other responses. For satisfaction 
variables with responses, “strongly disagree,” “disagree,” “neither agree nor disagree,” “agree,” or 
“strongly agree, we will report results as the proportion of participants who respond, “strongly agree.” 
For overall health and overall mental and emotional health variables, responses are scores that range 
from 0 to 5, with lower scores indicating “very good” or “excellent” health and higher scores indicate 
poorer overall health. We will report results as the proportion of participants who respond, “very good” 
or “excellent.” Missing data will not be imputed in any case. We will utilize GEE to compare changes 
between groups overtime from baseline (time of enrollment) to 6-months post-enrollment using GEE 
models with a term for an interaction between the treatment group and time (month) and clustered 
within person.  
We will compare survival using Kaplan Meier methods and the risk of death for both groups after 
randomization using Cox proportional hazards regression models. All analyses will be adjusted for 
covariates that are found to be imbalanced between study groups, such as age, race/ethnicity, 
cancer stage and cancer diagnosis.   
Relevant subsets of the above metrics may be measured on patients by [CONTACT_856923]. 
Sample Size Considerations 
 The sample size of 128 participants (64 randomized to the intervention group and 64 randomized 
to the control group) provides greater than 90% power to detect a 55% or greater difference in acute 
care use risk at 6-months follow-up. The anticipated effect size was based on our prior studies [11, 13, 
18] and feedback by [CONTACT_856924]. Jude’s Crosson Cancer Institute.  Power calculations 
will not be generated for our secondary outcomes as these are considered exploratory. Statistical 
significance of secondary outcomes is for trends only and not represented in this sample size 
calculation. 
Interim analyses every [ADDRESS_1193435] a 55% difference in risk of acute care use among participants in the intervention 
group as compared to the control group. For this trial, we estimated that a sample size of [ADDRESS_1193436] 90% power with a 2-sided type I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_1193437] a 
55% difference in risk of acute care use in the intervention group compared with the control group 
based on effect sizes from our ongoing VA pi[INVESTIGATOR_856911]. For this trial, we expect to 
obtain point estimates with an understanding that we may not reach significance in this study.  
6.0 DATA MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
6.1 Data Management 
The Protocol Director and participating site investigators will maintain adequate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and other data pertinent to the study. Original source 
documents will be transcribed to data collection tools and used to communicate study data to the 
lead site.  
Participating site PI [INVESTIGATOR_856912]’ study charts, 
reporting adverse events, assuring that written, informed consent is obtained and documented, and 
reporting the status of the trial in continuing renewals submitted to their IRB and trial monitoring 
group(s) as per their facility protocol. 
6.[ADDRESS_1193438] PI [INVESTIGATOR_856913]. 
6.4 Protocol Review and Amendments 
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the 
study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_56642] (SRC).  Any changes made to 
the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_31482].  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all 
participating investigators.”

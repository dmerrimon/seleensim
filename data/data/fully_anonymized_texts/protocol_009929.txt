 Page 3 of 13  1.0 Objectives  
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_877827]  (IOP)  when a  PROSE (Prosthetic Replacement of the Ocular Surface 
Ecosystem)  scleral lens is on the eye.  
 
The PROSE device (PD) is a specialized scleral lens that is filled with preservative -free saline 
and then applied  to the eye in order to treat a variety of ocular conditions . The PROSE device 
vaults the cornea without touch and lands gently on the conjunctival tissue overlying the sclera . 
Because scleral lenses vault and therefore cover the cornea, measuring IOP during lens wear is 
challenging as  traditional techniques rely on corneal contact.  Measuring  IOP before insertion and 
after removal of the PROSE device likely does not correspond to the IOP when the  lens is 
actively on the eye.  
 
This is a prospective study of the precision and accuracy  of tonometry measurements with scleral 
lens wear. T hree non-traditional means of IOP measurements  will be used:  scleral TonoPen, 
scleral pneumatonometry, and transpalpebral Diaton tonometer. Data on precision and accuracy 
of these instruments in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_877828] a full study on the 
effects of scleral lenses on IOP . 
 
2.0 Background  
The PROSE device is a refractive treatment for indiv iduals with pathologies  that require a rigid 
lens to mask irregularities on the front refracting surface of their eye (the cornea) . PROSE is also 
used in cases of ocular surface disease to protect  and support  the ocular surface in an effort to 
reduce dryness , prevent ocular surface breakdown, ulceration , and perforation . The PROSE 
device is similar to a scleral lens in theory though it allows for unique  customization s that are 
unavailable in current ly marketed scleral lens  designs , including  fenestrati ons and channels (air 
and fluid ventilation, respectively) . 
 
Recent literature has suggested that intraocular pressure may rise during scleral lens wear , 
although  variability exists in  methods  and results  within the literature .1-[ADDRESS_1226562] (i.e. scleral 
pneumatonometry  and scleral TonoPen ) or contact [CONTACT_877832] 
(transpalpebral Diaton) . This study will use these three methods due to the fact that they  are the 
only options currently available to measure IOP without corneal contact, which is a requirement 
for  IOP measurement during scleral lens wear.  
 
An important consideration  when using these instruments i s that measurements taken over the 
extraocula r muscles may give inaccurate results. Literature suggests that superotemporal and 
inferotemporal measurements using the pneumatonometer  provide the most accurate and 
TITLE: Tonometry Precision and Accuracy in PROSE Scleral Lens Wear: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_877824]: BFS-KR-IOP-02 DATE: 04/14/[ADDRESS_1226563] corneal measurement  perhaps due to the avoidance of 
measur ement over the extraocular muscles . 4 Scleral pneumatonometry IOP measurements can 
potentially be used to estimate corneal IOP using a  published equation  posited by [CONTACT_877833] .5

expect to recruit approximately  33 subjects;  and the first [ADDRESS_1226567] cohort (scleral TonoPen) . The second 10 subjects  that are eligible to proceed and 
consented will be consecutively enrolled in the  second cohort (scleral pneumatonometry) . The 
third [ADDRESS_1226568] cohort (Diaton).  Sequential assignment allows for focus on one instrument and one 
techn ique at a time by [CONTACT_500916].  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1226569] of patients who are actively coming through the 
clinic. We anticipate that all our subjects will be from the current patient popula tion at 
[LOCATION_011]Sight.  Patients will be recruited via mailing and/or email and at office visits. If a patient is 
interested in participating in the study, they will be directed to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_877829] . If they are eligibl e 
based on the screening criteria , they will be invited fo r participation in the study. If the person 
calls to learn about the study , the investigator or coordinator will use the outline to dete rmine 
initial eligibility . Current patients of [LOCATION_011]Sight may also be recruited as a result of a search of 
the patient database. A partial HIPAA waiver is requested to permit the investigators to use the 
database to identify prospective patients.

measur ements as it is a standard of care method and process used every  day in clin ical 
practice by [CONTACT_877834] . This will be compared to the  IOP 
measurement obtained in the same subject with lenses in place . 
 
The primary endpoints in this st udy are as follows:

Instrument -Making Enterprise, www.diaton -tonometer.com) as: 
a. +/- 2mmHg error in range 5 -20mmHg  
b. +/- 10% error in range 20 -60mmHg  
 
Correc t calibration of each instrument  will be ensured prior to the study  per individual 
manufacturer’s standard s. The first measurement of every subject will not be included but 
will serve as one practice measurement to familiarize the subject with the measurement 
process.

13.0 Risks to Subjects  
TITLE: Tonometry Precision and Accuracy in PROSE Scleral Lens Wear: A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_877824]: BFS-KR-IOP-02 DATE: 04/14/[ADDRESS_1226574] lens wearers are at risk for 
devel opi[INVESTIGATOR_877831] (‘cut’ on the eye) during lens application or removal  as well as 
inflammatory and/or infectious complications during lens wear, but there is no added risk by 
[CONTACT_4907] . Measurement of IOP via conjunctival/scleral contact [CONTACT_877838] , irritation, redness, or discomfort.  
 
If a subject experiences an adverse event during the duration of the study, they will be instructed 
to call the study coordinator who will  communicate with the investigators to determine the best 
course of action. If the subject needs to be seen due to an adverse event, a study investigator will 
examine them and the customary procedure for management will be followed.  
 
If an adverse event s uch as an abrasion occurs during a study visit, the condition will be treated 
as it is customarily, and the fees associated with treatment will be covered by [CONTACT_1758]. 
Additionally the subjects are encouraged to call immediately if experiencing any pain o r other 
discomfort  after the exam , which may be an indicator of irritation following intraocular pressure 
measurements.  
 
In a review of current literature, no reported  adverse events  or serious adverse events were found 
ifor each specific manner of IOP measurement  with the instruments  to be used in this study 
(scleral TonoPen, scleral pneumatonometry, Diaton) . No documented adverse events  for these 
instruments were found in literature at the time of submission .  
 
If, in the unlikely event, during the study a patient experiences any serious adverse event, they 
will be removed from the study  and the IRB will be notified .  
 
14.[ADDRESS_1226575] that withdraws or is terminated from the study will not be included in the 
analysis.  
 
16.0 Costs/Payments to Subjects  
The only cost that the subjects may be responsible for in this study is the cost of tr ansportation to

All other exam findings will be recorded on the paper forms and stored in a binder. This binder 
will be kept locked in the principal investigator's office when not being used to add or  remove 
data collection worksheets.  
 
Only the investigators will have access to the paper and electro nic records kept in this study.  
 
All study data will be stored  for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1226579] the Pri vacy Interests of Subjects  
We will ensure that all data is maintained with confidentiality and will assure subjects of this 
when they begin the study. If subjects are not comfortable with disclosing any of the information 
that is asked in the study, they w ill not be pressured to disclose, but they may not be able to 
participate if the withholding prevents us from screening or determining eligibility in the study. 
All PHI (DOB, name, health information) will be stored in the locked office of the Princi pal 
Investigator .  
 
Subjects will only be asked questions that are relevant to the study and their ocular health.  The 
investigators, who are all optometrists that regularly see patients and communicate about 
potentially sensitive information, have been trained to develop proper rapport with patients and 
study subjects. All investigators will make every effort to avoid seeming intrusive when asking 
the subjects questions.

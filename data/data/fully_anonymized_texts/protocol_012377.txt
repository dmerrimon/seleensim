3.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_575370]  (RCC)  is the most  common  malignancy  of the kidney,  and is expected  
to account  for more  than 58,000  new diagnoses  of cancer  and over 13,000  cancer  deaths  in 
the United  States  during  2010  (Jemal,  Siegel  et al. 2010).  Annual  incidence  and mortality  
worldwide  are estimated  over 270,000  and 116,000,  respectively  (Ferlay,  Shin et al. 2010).  
Incidence  is rising,  and RCC  now make  up 3.8%  of new cancer  diagnoses  in the United  
States  (Jemal,  Siegel  et al. 2010).  It is more  common  in men than women  with an 
approximate  incidence  of 1.5:1.  Metastatic  RCC  occurs  in approximately  30% of the newly  
diagnosed  patients,  with 1.5 to 3.5%  having  a solitary  metastasis  (Flanigan,  Salmon  et al. 
2001).  
 
3.[ADDRESS_755288] (Bellini  duct)  with its variant  medullary  type carcinoma,  and unclassified  RCC  
(Kovacs,  Akhtar  et al. 1997).  The most  common  subtype  is clear  cell RCC  (60–80%),  often  
termed  conventional  RCC.  The remaining  subtypes  are often  grouped  as non-clear  cell RCC  
(NCRCC)  and differ  in their incidence  with the order  being  papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]  (7–14%),  chromophobe  
(6-11%),  unclassified  tumors  (3-5%), and collecting  duct RCC  (<1%)  (Kovacs,  Akhtar  et al. 
1997;  Reuter  and Presti  2000).  Sarcomatoid  features  can be seen  in all different  subtypes  of 
RCC  and typi[INVESTIGATOR_575371]  a more  aggressive  course  with adverse  outcome.  This is thought  
due to the de-differentiation  of the original  epi[INVESTIGATOR_575372]  (Bertoni,  Ferri et al. 1987;  
Mai, Landry  et al. 2001;  Kourda,  Zeddini  et al. 2006).  
 
The prognostic  significance  to histologic  subtype  has been  intensely  studied.  Several  
retrospective  studies  have suggested  that stratification  by [CONTACT_575418]  (Moch,  Gasser  et al. 2000;  Amin,  Tamboli  et al. 2002;  Cheville,  Lohse  et al. 
2003).Different  implications  have  been  reported  for localized  and metastatic  disease.  
Favorable  prognosis  after nephrectomy  for a localized  primary  tumor  has been  seen  in 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_575373] -cell type (Moch,  Gasser  et al. 
2000;  Amin,  Tamboli  et al. 2002;  Cheville,  Lohse  et al. 2003;  Beck,  Patel  et al. 2004).  In

Approval date: [ADDRESS_755289] or papi[INVESTIGATOR_575374]  (Motzer,  Bacik  et al. 2002).  This was not confirmed  by a more  recent  international  
multicenter  retrospective  analysis  of >4000  cases  (Patard,  Leray  et al. 2005),  which  noted  no 
significant  survival  difference  among  clear -cell, papi[INVESTIGATOR_575375]  (including  Stage  IV disease)  in multivariate  
analysis.  The only exception  was chromophobe  histology,  which  resulted  in better  outcome  
only in high grade  tumors  (nuclear  grade  3 and 4 tumors)  (Patard,  Leray  et al. 2005).  
3.3 Therapy  of metastatic  RCC  
 
RCC  is characterized  by a high degree  of resistance  to chemotherapy.  Interferon  alfa-2a 
(IFN)  and interleukin -[ADDRESS_755290]  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575376].  Both 
achieve  complete  plus partial  responses  in 10% to 20% of patients,  only a minority  of treated  
patients  experiences  a favorable  response,  and few achieve  long-term survival  (Fyfe,  Fisher  
et al. 1995;  Fossa  2000).  While  these  treatments  were  not prospectively  evaluated  in NRCC  
in dedicated  trials,  retrospective  data suggested  inferior  outcome  for patients  with NRCC  
compared  to conventional  RCC  (Motzer,  Bacik  et al. 2002).  
 
More  recently,  targeted  agents  blocking  the (Yang,  Haworth  et al. 2003)vascular  endothelial  
growth  factor  (VEGF)  pathway  or the mammalian  target  of rapamycin  (mTOR)  have emerged  
as powerful  tools in the management  of advanced  disease  and have  become  the standard  of 
care in conventional  RCC.  It is important  to note that the majority  of Phase  III clinical  trials 
have predominantly  enrolled  patients  with clear -cell histology.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_755291]  and RCC  
 
Angiogenesis,  or new blood  vessel  formation,  is critical  to tumor  growth,  invasion,  and 
metastasis  (Posada,  Gulley  et al.). Several  humoral  factors  stimulate  angiogenesis.  These  
factors  act either  by [CONTACT_575419].  Both components  
are critical  for successful  neovascularization,  and the inhibition  of either  arm has been  
hypothesized  as having  a potential  antitumor  or antimetastatic  effect  on malignant  cells.  
Vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)  is a 43- to 46-kd glycoprotein  that induces  the 
proliferation  and migration  of vascular  endothelial  cells (Rudloff,  Boulay  et al.). These  
activities  are mediated  via the two receptors  for VEGF,  flt-[ADDRESS_755292],  which  are found  
predominantly  on vascular  endothelial  cells (Rudloff,  Boulay  et al.). In preclinical  models,  
VEGF  is a potent  neovascularization  agent  for both normal  and malignant  microvasculature  
(Smeraglia).  
 
Many  malignant  cells produce  VEGF,  which  serves  as an autocrine  factor  for the induction  of 
neovascularization.  Several  studies  have demonstrated  a correlation  between  high levels  of 
VEGF  and increased  risk of metastatic  disease  and overall  poor prognosis  in a variety  of 
malignancies  including  non–small -cell lung cancer  and other  cancers.  In addition,  increased  
expression  of VEGF  by [CONTACT_575420] a more  invasive  phenotype

(Steinbild,  Baas  et al. ; Higuchi,  Fockler  et al. 193).  In preclinical  animal  models,  the inhibition  
of VEGF  was found  to be associated  with stabilization  of established  tumors  (Cheung,  Morley  
et al. 199).  The use of anti-VEGF  antibodies  has been  extensively  studied  in preclinical  in  
vivo models  and has demonstrated  an inhibition  of tumor  growth  in a dose-dependent   
manner  (Miller,  Burstein  et al.). 
 
Advances  in understanding  the biology  and genetics  of RCC  have led to major  therapeutic  
implications.  The discovery  of the von Hippel -Lindau  (VHL) gene  and its role in regulating  
pro-angiogenic  factors  including  VEGF,  platelet -derived  growth  factor  (PDGF ), and others  
provided  potential  targets  for novel  agents  (Choueiri,  Bukowski  et al. 2006).  In clear  cell 
RCC,  VEGF  targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  both receptor  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors  (TKI)  (sunitinib,  
sorafenib)  and VEGF -A ligand  antibodies  (bevacizumab),  were  shown  to have activity  in the 
metastatic  setting  (Awada,  Hendlisz  et al. 2005;  Motzer,  Michaelson  et al. 2006).  However,  
VHL inactivation  in RCC  is almost  exclusively  seen  in patients  with clear  cell histology  
(Gnarra,  Tory et al. 1994).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_281747], tumor  samples  from patients  with NCRCC  can 
demonstrate  high expression  of VEGF  (Jacobsen,  Grankvist  et al. 2006),  making  VEGF - 
targeted  therapy  an attractive  therapeutic  option.  The mTOR  pathway  has been  implicated  
as a major  contributor  through  an autocrine  loop involving  VEGF,  described  in further  detail  
below.  
3.3.2  VEGF  targeted  Tyrosine  Kinase  Inhibitors  (TKI)  in RCC  
 
The oral multi TKI Sunitinib  demonstrated  a progression -free survival  (PFS)  benefit  over 
interferon  alpha  in a phase  3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_149966], 11 months  (95%  CI 10-12) versus  5 months  (95%  
CI 4-6) (Motzer, Hutson  et al. 2007).  PFS benefit  was also demonstrated  in a phase  III trial 
comparing  sorafenib,  another  oral TKI, to placebo  (Escudier,  Eisen  et al. 2007).  These  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_575377].  Both drugs  
have been  approved  by [CONTACT_575421]  (FDA)  for the treatment  of 
metastatic  RCC.  The third approved  oral TKI in RCC  is pazopanib,  which  was tested  in a 
multicenter  randomized  placebo -controlled  phase  3 trial in both treatment  naïve  and cytokine  
pretreated  patients  (Sternberg,  Davis  et al. 2010).  ORR  was 30% for pazopanib  compared  
with 3% for placebo;  PFS was significantly  prolonged  in the overall  group  (median  PFS 9.2 
months)  as well as the treatment  naïve  population  (median  PFS 11.1 months).  
The role of VEGF  targeted  TKI is less clear  in NCRCC.  A retrospective  multicenter  review  
published  by [CONTACT_575422] 41 patients  with advanced  papi[INVESTIGATOR_575378]  (Choueiri,  Plantade  et al. 2008).  In papi[INVESTIGATOR_575379],  response  
rates  were  low (5%; two responders,  both received  sunitinib),  PFS appeared  longer  in 
patients  treated  with sunitinib  compared  to sorafenib  (11.9  vs 5.1 months,  p<0.001).  In 
chromophobe  RCC,  results  were  more  encouraging  with RR of 25% and median  PFS more  
promising  in sorafenib  than sunitinib  (27.5  vs 8.9 months,  respectively).  
Prospective  data for sunitinib  and sorafenib  in NCRCC  is limited.  French  investigators  
presented  preliminary  results  of a Phase  II study  of sunitinib  in advanced  type I and II 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_575380]  (Ravaud,  Oudard  et al. 2009).  In type II papi[INVESTIGATOR_575381] 23 patients  (4%) 
achieved  a Partial  Response  (PR),  four patients  (17%)  had Stable  Disease  (SD) for 12 
weeks  or more,  five (22%)  had progressed  at the time of initial  evaluation  on treatment.  Of

five patients  with type I papi[INVESTIGATOR_575382] a PR, three  (60%)  had SD; the remaining  
patients  had not been  evaluated  at the time of report.  
 
Similarly,  investigators  from M.D. Anderson  and Fox Chase  Cancer  Center  presented  their 
phase  II data for 23 patients  with advanced  papi[INVESTIGATOR_575383] 2010  
annual  ASCO  meeting  (Plimack,  Jonasch  et al. 2010).  There  were  no major  responses.  Eight  
pts had stable  disease  as best response.  The radiologically  assessed  6-month  PFS rate was 
0.34 (95%  CI, 0.18- 0.63);  median  PFS was 1.6 months  (95%  CI, 1.3-12), median  Overall  
Survival  (OS)  10.8 months  (95%  CI, 6.2-NE). Recent  data from our own institution  includes  a 
single -institution  phase  II study  of sunitinib  in patients  with metastatic  non-clear  cell RCC  
(Molina,  Feldman  et al. 2010).  Twenty  three  patients  were  enrolled.   All patients  received  
sunitinib  [ADDRESS_755293] (4/2).  
Overall,  there  was only one objective  response  (4%) in a patient  with unclassified  RCC:  
Sixteen  (70%)  had stable  disease  (SD) and six (26%)  progressive  disease  (PD) at their first 
assessment.  The median  PFS was 5.[ADDRESS_755294]  objective  responses  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_575384].  
3.3.3  VEGF  targeted  monoclonal  antibody  therapy  in RCC  - Bevacizumab  
 
Bevacizumab  (rhuMAb)  is a recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  IgG1 antibody  that 
selectively  binds  to and inhibits  the biologic  activity  of human  vascular  endothelial  growth  
factor  (VEGF)  in vitro and in vivo assay  systems.   Bevacizumab  binds  VEGF  and prevents  
the interaction  of VEGF  to its receptors  (Flt-[ADDRESS_755295])  on the surface  of endothelial  cells.  
The interaction  of VEGF  with its receptors  leads  to endothelial  cell proliferation  and new 
blood  vessel  formation  in in vitro models  of angiogenesis.  
The overall  safety  profile  of bevacizumab  is based  on several  phase  III trials treating  patients  
with various  malignancies  such  as colorectal  cancer,  non-small  cell lung, breast  cancer,  
ovarian  cancer,  and renal  cell cancer,  as well as patients  with various  other  advanced  
malignancies  in early phase  trials,  who received  bevacizumab  either  as a single  agent  or in 
combination  with chemotherapy  in clinical  trials.  Throughout  these  studies,  bevacizumab  has 
generally  been  found  to be well-tolerated,  with the primary  toxicities  being  hypertension  
(occurrence  of grade  3/4 hypertension  ranging  from 2 to 16% in various  studies)  and 
proteinuria  (1 to 2 % in colorectal  cancer  trials).  Less frequently,  it causes  albuminuria,  
occasionally  complicated  by [CONTACT_575423].  Bevacizumab  is also known  to increase  
the risk for venous  as well as arterial  thromboembolic  events,  bleeding  and disturbed  wound  
healing,  impairment  of cardiac  function,  as well as stroke  and myocardial  infarction.  In rare 
cases,  gastrointestinal  perforation,  anastomotic  dehiscence  and pulmonary  hemorrhage   
have been  reported.  
The phase  III multicenter  double -blind AVOREN  trial of bevacizumab  plus interferon  vs. 
interferon  alone  enrolled  649 patients  with untreated  advanced  RCC  and either  clear -cell 
only (87%  of patients)  or mixed  histologies  (>50%  clear  cell, 13% of patients)  (Escudier,  
Pluzanska  et al. 2007).  The trial demonstrated  superiority  to the bevacizumab  arm with 
significantly  longer  PFS of 10.2 months  vs 5.4 months  in the interferon  alone  arm and higher

ORR  (31%  and 13%,  respectively,  p=0.0001).  The primary  endpoint  for this study  was OS, 
and only a nonsignificant  trend  towards  improvement  was seen  in the final survival  analysis  
(median  OS 23.3 months  and 21.3 months,  respectively,  p=0.336)  (Escudier,  Bellmunt  et al. 
2010).  It was however  noted  that the majority  of patients  in both arms  received  at least one 
post protocol  antineoplastic  therapy,  likely  confounding  the OS analysis.  
649 patients  were  treated  in this study  in 18 countries.   Patients  receiving  bevacizumab  and 
interferon -alfa experienced  the following  Grade  3/4 adverse  events:   fatigue  12%,  asthenia  
10%,  proteinuria  7%, neutropenia  4%, and bleeding,  hypertension  influenza -like-syndrome,  
anorexia,  anemia  (all 3% each).

As mentioned  above,  AVOREN  included  13% patients  with mixed  histologies,  i.e. with non- 
clear  cell component  of <50%.  An unplanned  secondary  analysis  of the AVOREN  data 
evaluating  specifically  this subgroup  of patients  was presented  at the 2008  ASCO  meeting  
(Escudier,  Ravaud  et al. 2008),  and although  patients  with mixed  histologies  had poorer  PFS 
than those  with pure clear -cell RCC,  the combination  of bevacizumab  plus interferon  
produced  better  results  than interferon  alone  in the mixed -histology  group  (5.7 vs 2.9 
months;  HR, 0.53;  P<.007).  The authors  concluded  benefit  to bevacizumab,  irrespective  of 
tumor  histology.  
 
A second  Phase  III study  conducted  and analyzed  by [CONTACT_575424]  B 
(CALGB)  in advanced  clear  cell RCC  confirmed  superiority  of bevacizumab  in combination  
with interferon  over interferon  alone  (Pollack,  Perou  et al. 199).  The median  PFS was 8.5 
months  in patients  receiving  bevacizumab  plus IFN (95%  CI, 7.5 to 9.7 months)  versus  5.2 
months  (95%  CI, 3.1 to 5.6 months)  in patients  receiving  IFN monotherapy  (log-rank P < 
.0001).  The adjusted  hazard  ratio was 0.71 (95%  CI, 0.61 to 0.83;  P < .0001).  Bevacizumab  
plus IFN had a higher  ORR  as compared  with IFN (25.5%  [95%  CI, 20.9%  to 30.6%]  v 13.1%  
[95%  CI, 9.5%  to 17.3%];  P < .0001).  Overall  toxicity  was greater  for bevacizumab  plus IFN,

including  significantly  more  grade  3 hypertension  (9% v 0%), anorexia  (17%  v 8%), fatigue  
(35%  v 28%),  and proteinuria  (13%  v 0%). No new safety  signals  related  to interferon  and 
bevacizumab  were  observed  (Pollack,  Perou  et al. 199).

limiting  toxicity  observed  at doses  ranging  from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg  (Norden -Zfoni,  Manola  et  
al.). Treatment  did not induce  antibodies  to bevacizumab.  Terminal  elimination  half-life was 
approximately  21 days.  Free serum  VEGF  concentrations  were  found  to be reduced  and, at 
doses  of  0.3 mg/kg,  were  below  the detectable  limit of the assay  after the administration  of 
bevacizumab  and remained  undetectable  for the duration  of the study  (Norden -Zfoni,  Manola  
et al.). 
 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_755297]  and cancer  
The mammalian  target  of rapamycin  (mTOR)  is a key and a highly  conservative  serine - 
threonine  kinase,  which  is present  in all cells and is a central  regulator  of protein  synthesis  
and ultimately  cell growth,  cell proliferation,  angiogenesis  and cell survival  (Schwab,  
Christensen  et al. 1987).  mTOR  is downstream  the of PI3K/AKT  pathway,  a pathway  known  
to be dysregulated  in a wide spectrum  of human  cancers  (e.g. through  loss/mutation  of the 
PTEN  negative  regulator;  through  PI3K  mutation/amplification;  through  AKT/PKB  
overexpression  / overactivation;  through  modulation  of TSC1/TSC2  tumor  suppressors).  In 
addition,  activation  of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR  pathway  is frequently  a characteristic  of 
worsening  prognosis  through  increased  aggressiveness,  resistance  to treatment  and 
progression.  
The main  known  functions  of mTOR  include  the following  (Schwab,  Christensen  et al. 1987;  
Bjornsti  and Houghton  2004):  
 
• mTOR  functions  as a sensor  of mitogens,  growth  factors  and energy  and nutrient  
levels,  facilitating  cell-cycle  progression  from G1 to S phase  in appropriate  growth  
conditions.  
• The PI3K -mTOR  pathway  itself is frequently  activated  in many  human  cancers,  and 
oncogenic  transformation  may sensitize  tumor  cells to mTOR  inhibitors.  
• Through  inactivating  eukaryotic  initiation  factor  4E binding  proteins  (4E-BP1)  and 
activating  the 40S ribosomal  S6 kinases  (i.e., p70S6K1),  mTOR  regulates  translation  
of important  massages,  including  those  encoding  the HIF-1 proteins,  c-myc,  ornithine  
decarboxylase,  and cyclin  D1, as well as ribosomal  proteins  themselves.  
• The activation  of mTOR  pathway  leads  to the increased  production  of pro-angiogenic  
factors  (i.e., VEGF)  in tumors  and to tumor,  endothelial  and smooth  muscle  cell 
growth  and proliferation.  
• The regulation  of mTOR  signaling  is complex  and involves  positive  regulators,  such  
as AKT that phosphorylate  and inactivate  negative  regulators  such  as the Tuberous  
Sclerosis  Complex  (TSC1/TSC2).  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: [ADDRESS_755298]  multiprotein  signaling  
complexes,  mTORC1  (mTOR  complex  1, rapamycin  sensitive)  and mTORC2  (mTOR  
complex  2, rapamycin  insensitive)  (Wullschleger,  Loewith  et al. 2006).  
mTORC1  is mainly  activated  via the PI3 kinase  pathway  through  AKT (also  known  as PKB,  
protein  kinase  B) and the tuberous  sclerosis  complex  (TSC1/TSC2)  (Bjornsti  and Houghton  
2004).  Activated  AKT phosphorylates  TSC2,  which  lead to the dissociation  of TSC1/TSC2  
complex,  thus inhibiting  the ability  of TSC2  to act as a GTPase  activating  protein.  This allows  
Rheb,  a small  G-protein,  to remain  in a GTP bound  state  and to activate  mTORC1.  AKT can 
also activate  mTORC1  by [CONTACT_129554]40  phosphorylation,  thereby  [CONTACT_407163]40 -mediated  
inhibition  of mTORC1  (Manning  and Cantley  2007;  Wang,  Harris  et al. 2007).  
mTORC2  (mTOR  complex  2) is activated  through  a currently  unknown  mechanism,  possibly  
by [CONTACT_482904]  (RTK)  signaling  (Manning  and Cantley  2007).  It has been  
suggested  that mTORC2  phosphorylates  and activates  a different  pool of AKT,  which  is not 
upstream  of mTORC1.  PHLPP  phosphatase  plays  a role of a negative  regulator.  mTORC2  is 
rapamycin  insensitive  and is required  for the organization  of the actin cytoskeleton  
(Wullschleger,  Loewith  et al. 2006).  
mTORC1 -mediated  signaling  is subject  to modulation  by [CONTACT_575425],  such  as everolimus.  Once  these  agents  bind to the 12 kDa cytosolic  
FK506 -binding  protein  immunophilin  FKBP12,  the resulting  rapamycin -FKBP12  complexes  
bind to a specific  site near the catalytic  domain  of mTORC1  and inhibit  phosphorylation  of 
mTOR substrates.  As a consequence,  downstream  signaling  events  involved  in regulation  of 
the G1 to S-phase  transition  are inhibited.  This mechanism  is thought  to be responsible  for 
the immunosuppressive  effects  of rapamycin  as well as its putative  antineoplastic  activity  
(Witzig,  Geyer  et al. 2005).  As many  cancers  are characterized  by [CONTACT_407166] G1 transit  
(for example,  overexpression  of cyclin  or cyclin -dependent  kinases),  inhibition  of mTOR  
becomes  an intriguing  target  for inducing  cytostasis  (Bjornsti  and Houghton  2004).  
3.3.6  mTOR  targeted  therapy  in RCC  
Temsirolimus  
The mTOR  inhibitor  temsirolimus  was approved  for treatment  of advanced  RCC  in May of 
2007.  Its efficacy  and safety  were  demonstrated  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_575385]  3 ARCC  trial, a global,  
randomized,  open -label study  in 626 previously  untreated  patients  with advanced  RCC  who 
had 3 or more  of 6 poor prognostic  factors  (Hudes,  Carducci  et al. 2007).  Patients  were  
randomized  to temsirolimus,  interferon  or both.  Single -agent  temsirolimus  was associated  
with a statistically  significant  improvement  in overall  survival  (OS)  when  compared  to IFN 
(hazard  ratio 0.73 [95%  CI: 0.58,  0.92];  p= 0.0078).  The median  OS was 10.9 months  on the 
temsirolimus  arm and 7.3 months  on the IFN arm. Median  PFS was 5.5 months  on the 
temsirolimus  arm and 3.1 months  on the IFN arm [hazard  ratio 0.66 (95%  CI: 0.53,  0.81)]  in 
this poor risk population.  The combination  of 15 mg temsirolimus  and IFN did not result  in a 
significant  increase  in OS when  compared  with IFN alone  and was associated  with an 
increase  in multiple  adverse  reactions.

Unlike  all other  phase  3 trials of targeted  agents  in RCC,  this study  included  both patients  
with conventional  and non-clear  cell histologies.  Patients  with histologies  other  than clear  cell 
RCC  accounted  for 17% and 18% in the temsirolimus  and interferon  group,  respectively.  This 
included  patients  of non-clear  cell and indeterminate  histology.  Subgroup  analysis  for this 
patient  subset  suggests  superior  median  OS and PFS for temsirolimus  vs IFN with HR of 
0.49 (95%  CI = 0.29,0.85)  and 0.38 (95%  CI = 0.23,0.62),  respectively  (Dutcher,  de Souza  et 
al. 2009).  While  median  OS was shorter  in NCRCC  compared  to conventional  RCC,  efficacy  
of temsirolimus  appeared  more  pronounced  among  patients  with non-clear  or indeterminate  
primary  cell type than among  those  with clear  cell histology.  This might  be due to the fact that 
IFN has less efficacy  in the former  group  of patients  as mentioned  above  (Motzer, Bacik  et  
al. 2002).  
Everolimus  
 
Everolimus  is an oral derivative  of rapamycin.  It has been  in clinical  development  since  1996  
as an immunosuppressant  in solid organ  transplantation  and has obtained  marketing  
authorization  (Certican®) for prophylaxis  of rejection  in renal  and cardiac  transplantation  in a 
number  of countries,  including  the majority  of the European  Union.  It has been  in 
development  for patients  with various  malignancies  since  2002.  Everolimus  has been  
investigated  as an anticancer  agent  based  on its potential  to act: 
 
• Directly  on the tumor  cells by [CONTACT_482902]  
• Indirectly  by [CONTACT_575426]  (via potent  
inhibition  of tumor  cell HIF-1 activity,  VEGF  production   and  VEGF -induced  
proliferation  of endothelial  cells).  The role of angiogenesis  in the maintenance  of solid 
tumor  growth  is well established,  and the mTOR  pathway  has been  implicated  in the 
regulation  of tumor  production  of proangiogenic  factors  as well as modulation   of 
VEGFR  signaling  in endothelial  cells.  
Everolimus  has been  evaluated  as a single  agent  and in combination  with other  antitumor  
agents,  including  cytotoxic  chemotherapeutic  agents,  targeted  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  antibodies  and 
hormonal  agents.  Phase  I dose  escalating  studies,  exploratory  Phase  I/II studies  with 
everolimus  as single  agent  or in combination  with other  anti-cancer  agents,  Phase  II/III 
studies  of everolimus  in several  indications,  and Phase  III double -blind studies  are 
contributing  to the extensive  database.  
Everolimus  was recently  approved  under  the trade  name  [CONTACT_3617]®  for patients  with advanced  
RCC  after failure  of treatment  with Sutent®  (sunitinib)  or Nexavar®  (sorafenib)  in the US, EU 
and several  other  countries  and is undergoing  registration  in other  regions  worldwide.  FDA 
approval  was based  on a pi[INVESTIGATOR_575385]  3 trial, an international,  multicenter,  randomized , 
double -blind study  comparing  everolimus  to placebo  in 410 patients  pretreated  with sunitinib  
or sorafenib  (Motzer,  Escudier  et al. 2008).  Prior therapy  with bevacizumab,  interleukin -2, or 
interferon -α was also permitted.  Everolimus  showed  superior  PFS over placebo  (4.0 mo vs 
1.9 mo, HR 0.3, CI 0.22-0.40,  p<0.0001).  ORR  was 1% for everolimus,  none  for placebo,  
arguing  that PFS benefit  is likely  due to disease  stabilization.  This trial extended  the role of 
mTOR  inhibitors  beyond  first line therapy,  and everolimus  is now considered  the standard  of

asthenia,  diarrhea,  anorexia,  nausea,  mucosal  inflammation,  vomiting,  pneumonitis,  cough,  
peripheral  edema,  infections,  dry skin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940],  pruritus,  and dyspnea.  The most  common 
grade  3-4 adverse  reactions  (incidence  ≥2%)  were  infections,  stomatitis,  fatigue,  and 
pneumonitis.  Non-infectious  pneumonitis  is a class  effect  of rapamycin  derivatives,  including  
Everolimus  and some  of these  cases  have been  severe  and on rare occasions,  fatal 
outcomes  have been  observed.  Deaths  due to acute  respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078]  (0.7%),  infection  
(0.7%),  and acute  renal  failure  (0.4%)  were  observed  on the everolimus  arm. The rates  of 
treatment -emergent  adverse  reactions  resulting  in permanent  discontinuation  were  7% and 
0% for the everolimus  and placebo  treatment  groups,  respectively.  
The most  common  laboratory  abnormalities  (incidence  ≥50%)  were  anemia,  
hypercholesterolemia,  hypertriglyceridemia,  hyperglycemia,  lymphopenia,  and increased  
creatinine.  The most  common  grade  3/4 laboratory  abnormalities  (incidence  ≥3%)  were  
lymphopenia,  hyperglycemia,  anemia,  hypophosphatemia,  and hypercholesterolemia.  
Overall,  safety  data available  from completed,  controlled  and uncontrolled  studies  are 
consistent  with the aforementioned  findings  of the Phase  III trial. Everolimus  is generally  well 
tolerated  at weekly  and daily dose  schedules.  The safety  profile  is characterized  by 
[CONTACT_575427]  (AEs).  These  AEs are generally  reversible  and non-cumulative.  
Everolimus  has immunosuppressive  properties  and may predispose  patients  to bacterial,  
fungal,  viral or protozoan  infections,  including  infections  with opportunistic  pathogens.  
Localized  and systemic  infections,  including  pneumonia,  other  bacterial  infections,  invasive  
fungal  infections,  such  as aspergillosis  or candidiasis  and viral infections  including  
reactivation  of hepatitis  B virus,  have been  described  in patients  taking  everolimus.  Some  of 
these  infections  have been  severe  (e.g. leading  to respi[INVESTIGATOR_575386])  and 
occasionally  have  had a fatal outcome.  
 
3.3.7  Everolimus  Pharmacokinetics  / Pharmacodynamics  
Everolimus  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_407105] a median  tmax  of 1-2 hours.  The steady -state  AUC0 -τ is 
dose-proportional  over the dose  range  between  5 and 10 mg with daily administration,  
steady -state  was achieved  within  two weeks  with the daily dosing  regimen.  Cmax  is dose - 
proportional  between  5 and 10 mg daily administration.  In healthy  subjects,  high fat meals  
reduced  systemic  exposure  to everolimus  10 mg (as measured  by [CONTACT_12265])  by 22% and the 
peak plasma  concentration  Cmax  by 54%.  Light  fat meals  reduced  AUC by 32% and Cmax  
by 42%.  Food,  however,  had no apparent  effect  on the post absorption  phase  concentration - 
time profile.  
Following  oral administration,  everolimus  is the main  circulating  component  in human  blood  
and is considered  to contribute  the majority  of the overall  pharmacologic  activity.   No specific  
excretion  studies  have been  undertaken  in cancer  patients;  however,  data available  from the 
transplantation  setting  found  the drug to be mainly  eliminated  through  the feces.  The mean  
elimination  half-life of everolimus  is approximately  30 hours.

Everolimus  is a substrate  of CYP3A4  and a substrate  and moderate  inhibitor  of PgP.  Please  
refer to Section  9.5.1  for more  information  on the concomitant  use of CYP3A4  
inhibitors/inducers  and other  medications.  
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  modeling  based  on inhibition  of the biomarker  p70S6  
kinase  1 [S6K1]  in peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells [PBMC])  suggests  that 5-10 mg daily 
should  be an adequate  dose  to produce  a high-degree  of sustained  target  inhibition  (Kulke,  
Lenz et al. ; Maki,  Fletcher  et al.). 
 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_755300]  components  in RCC,  a study  of 
375 pts with resected  disease  (including  14% non clear -cell RCCs)  observed  adverse  
prognostic  impact  of pS6K,  PTEN  and Akt on disease -specific  survival,  independent  of stage  
(Pantuck,  Seligson  et al. 2007).  A second  smaller  study  further  suggested  that pS6K  and 
possibly  pAkt were  predictors  of response  to temsirolimus  for advanced  RCC  (Cho,  
Signoretti  et al. 2007).  
3.3.[ADDRESS_755301] required  dose  reductions  (e.g. 
sunitinib  with everolimus  (Kroog,  Feldman  et al. 2009)),  others  are not considered  safe to be 
given  together  (sunitinib  with temsirolimus  (Fischer,  Patel  et al. 2008)).  
 
In a phase  I trial of 26 patients  with conventional  RCC,  the combination  of sunitinib  with 
bevacizumab  yielded  ORR  of 52% with the maximum  tolerated  dose  (MTD)  determined  at 
full doses  for both agents,  but on further  follow -up there  was a high degree  of treatment - 
associated  hypertension,  vascular  and hematologic  toxicities  at these  dose  levels  (Feldman,  
Baum  et al. 2009).  
 
In NCRCC  mutations  in the VHL gene  are not commonly  seen,  yet elevations  in VEGF  and 
HIF levels  are thought  to occur  in response  to the hypoxic  tumor  environment.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_575387],  some  non-clear  cell RCC  have been  found  to exhibit  a highly  activated  
mTOR  pathway  (Pantuck,  Seligson  et al. 2007).  Importantly,  mTOR  downstream  effectors  
eIF-4E and phospho -S6 increase  levels  of both VEGF  and HIF-1α(Azim,  Azim  et al. 2010).  
HIF-1α induces  further  increase  in VEGF  levels.  VEGF,  in turn, through  its receptor,  activates  
the PI3-K/Akt/mTOR  axis(Agarwala  and Case  2010).  Inhibition  of several  steps  in this 
autocrine  loop (mTOR –HIF–VEGF -mTOR)  is thought  to be superior  to single  agents  used  in 
sequence(Heng  and Choueiri  2009),  and preclinical  models  have found  such  combinations  to 
be synergistic(Ikezoe,  Nishioka  et al. 2006;  Ikezoe,  Yang  et al. 2006).  Our group  previously  
conducted  a phase  I study  combining  VEGF  and mTOR -inhibition  by [CONTACT_575428] 20 treatment -naïve  patients  with advanced  RCC,  13 with clear  cell and 7 with

non-clear  cell histology(Kroog,  Feldman  et al. 2009).  5/20 patients  (25%)  achieved  a partial  
response  (PR),  ten patients  (50%)  had stable  disease.  Three  of the five patients  with PR had 
non-clear  cell histology,  accounting  for a RR of 43% within  this subgroup;  all three  remained  
on protocol  for more  than one year,  arguing  in favor  of combined  targeting  of VEGF  and 
mTOR  in these  patients.  Unfortunately,  the combination  was only tolerated  at attenuated  
doses,  and significant  toxicity  was observed.  Treatment  was associated  with diverse  grade  
3/4 toxicities,  and the combination  is not recommended  for further  study.  
3.3.10  Combination  of Everolimus  and Bevacizumab  
Preclinical  studies  of Everolimus  plus VEGF  Inhibition  
Everolimus  has been  studied  in combination  with a VEGFR  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  called  
PTK787/ZK222584  (vatalanib)  in tumor  models.    Comparisons  of the effects  of everolimus  
with those  of PTK787/ZK222584,  on angiogenic  processes  in vitro and in vivo, indicated  
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_575388].   Based  on this data,  there  is a potential  for synergy  
between  everolimus  and VEGF  inhibitors,  such  as PTK787/Zk222584  and bevacizumab.  
Clinical  experience  with Everolimus  plus Bevacizumab  
Phase  [ADDRESS_755302] investigated  the combination  of everolimus  and bevacizumab.  
Full dose  of bevacizumab  10 mg/kg,  i.v. every  2 weeks  and full dose  of everolimus  10 mg, 
p.o. daily given  together  has shown  to be tolerable.  
 
A Phase  1 dose -escalation  study  of bevacizumab,  everolimus,  and erlotinib  in patients  with 
advanced -stage  solid tumor  demonstrated  that the combination  of everolimus  and 
bevacizumab  was well tolerated,  allowing  full doses  of both agents  to be administered.   The 
study  included  four dose  levels:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bevacizumab  Everolimus  Erlotinib  
Dose  Level  1 10 mg/kg  every  2 wks 5 mg daily ---

Fifteen  patients  were  treated  in Dose  Level  2 (bevacizumab  10 mg/kg  every  2 weeks  and 
everolimus  10 mg daily),  and no dose -limiting  toxicities  were  seen  in this dose  level (Bendell,  
Gerorge  et al. 2007).  A total of [ADDRESS_755303]  
common  adverse  events  were  mild or moderate  mucositis,  fatigue,  rash,  and  
musculoskeletal  pain.  In the group  of patients  who received  everolimus  and bevacizumab  
(20), there  were  six Grade  3 events,  one of each  of the following:   proteinuria,  deep  vein

thrombosis,  cardiac  ischemia,  liver enzyme  elevation,  partial  bowel  obstruction,  and rash.  
There  were  three  Grade  4 events,  one of each  of the following:   proteinuria,  left ventricular  
thrombus,  and left ventricular  systolic  dysfunction  (Bendell,  Gerorge  et al. 2007).  
 
A recent  single  arm phase  II trial evaluated  the efficacy  of everolimus  in combination  with 
bevacizumab  in 80 subjects  with advanced  RCC,  including  both untreated  (Group  A, 50 pts) 
and pretreated  patients  (Group  B, 30 pts) (Hainsworth,  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_575389]. 2010).  Enrollment  
required  clear  cell RCC,  for mixed -histology  tumors,  the clear  cell component  had to 
comprise  more  than 75% of the biopsy  specimen.  Patients  received  bevacizumab  10mg/kg  
intravenously  every  2 weeks  and everolimus  10mg  orally  daily.  Patients  were  evaluated  for 
response  after 8 weeks  of treatment  and continued  treatment  until disease  progression  or 
unacceptable  toxicity.  Median  age was 63 (group  A) and 64 (group  B), the majority  of 
patients  had low or intermediate  MSKCC  risk scores.  Among  the 30 patients  in group  B, 16 
had previously  received  sunitinib  treatment,  12 sorafenib  treatment,  2 immunotherapy.  ORR  
was 30% and 23% in un- and pretreated  patients,  respectively.  The median  PFS and OS 
were  9.1 months  and 21.3 months  for group  A, 7.1 months  and 14.5 months  for group  B.

(Ravaud,  Oudard  et al. 2009;  Molina,  Feldman  et al. 2010;  Plimack,  Jonasch  et al. 2010).  As 
outlined  above,  unplanned  secondary  analyses  from two large  phase  III trials that have  
helped  establish  temsirolimus  and bevacizumab  in the treatment  of conventional  RCC  
suggest  efficacy  to both mTOR  and VEGF  pathway  inhibition  in NCRCC  (Escudier,  Ravaud  
et al. 2008;  Dutcher,  de Souza  et al. 2009),  however  the numbers  are too small  to draw  
definite  conclusions.  There  is a molecular  rationale  for combining  agents  targeting  both 
pathways  in NCRCC,  since  inhibition  of several  steps  in an autocrine  loop (mTOR –HIF– 
VEGF -mTOR)  is thought  to be superior  to single  agents  used  in sequence  (Heng  and 
Choueiri  2009).  We chose  everolimus  over temsirolimus  for two reasons:  for one, since  it is 
easily  self-administered  at home,  whereas  temsirolimus  requires  weekly  visits  for intravenous  
infusion  of drug;  secondly,  since  everolimus  has been  studied  and found  to be well tolerated  
in combination  with bevacizumab  in both the phase  I and II setting,  even with both drugs  
given  at full doses.  The purpose  of this single -arm, single -center  Phase  II study  is to 
determine  the efficacy  and safety  of everolimus  10 mg p.o. daily dose  in combination  with 
bevacizumab  10 mg/kg  administered  intravenously  every  two weeks  for treatment  of patients  
with advanced  non-clear  cell carcinoma  of the kidney,  who have not received  prior mTOR - or 
VEGF -targeted  treatments.

5.1 Everolimus  
Everolimus  is formulated  as tablets  of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg strength,  blistered   28 tablets  
per box..  Tablets  should  be kept in the blister  packs  until the time of administration  as the 
drug is both hygroscopic  and light-sensitive.  Everolimus  will be supplied  through  [COMPANY_001].  
5.2 Bevacizumab  
Bevacizumab  is a clear  to slightly  opalescent,  colorless  to pale brown,  sterile  pH6.2  solution  
for intravenous  infusion.   Chemical  and physical  in-use stability  has been  demonstrated  for 
48 hours  at 2°C to 30°C  in sodium  chloride  9 mg/ml  (0.9%)  solution  for injection.  From  a 
microbiological  point of view,  the product  should  be used  immediately.   If not used  
immediately,  in-use storage  times  and conditions  are the responsibility  of the user and would  
normally  not be longer  than 8 hours  in the refrigerator  at 36F to 46F (2C to 8C), unless  
dilution  has taken  place  in controlled  and validated  aseptic  conditions.   Bevacizumab  should  
not be frozen.  Keep  the vial in the outer  carton  in order  to protect  from light. 
Bevacizumab  does not contain  any antimicrobial  preservative;  therefore,  care must  be taken  
to ensure  the sterility  of the prepared  solution.  Bevacizumab  will be prepared  and 
administered  as per MSKC  guidelines.  
No incompatibilities  between  bevacizumab  and polyvinyl  chloride  or polyolefin  bags  or 
infusion  sets have been  observed.   Bevacizumab  infusions  should  not be administered  or 
mixed  with glucose  solutions.

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
Cycle  length  is defined  as 28 days.  Treatment  will include  everolimus  10mg,  self- 
administered  orally  once  daily on a continuous  schedule  (days  1-28), and bevacizumab  
10mg/kg,  administered  intravenously  on days [ADDRESS_755320] dose  of everolimus  at the center  on Cycle  1, Day 1. Thereafter,  
patients  will be instructed  to swallow  everolimus  orally  with a glass  of water  immediately  after 
a meal,  once  daily at the same  time each  day. Any dietary  habits  around  the time of 
everolimus  intake  should  be as consistent  as possible  throughout  the study.   The tablet(s)  
should  not be chewed  or crushed.  If vomiting  occurs,  no attempt  should  be made  to replace  
the vomited  dose  unless  the everolimus  tablet(s)  are clearly  visible.  If the tablet(s)  are clearly  
visible,  then the patient  should  replace  the everolimus  dose.  
 
If a dose  of everolimus  is missed,  patients  will not increase  the following  day‟s dose.  Instead,  
treatment  will continue  on the same  schedule  with no change  in dosage  or timing  of drug 
administration.  Missed  doses  should  be documented  by [CONTACT_575433][INVESTIGATOR_575393].

Patients  will continue  to take everolimus  until disease  progression,  major  toxicity,  or 
withdrawal  from the study  for any reason.  
The maximum  allowed  time of interruption  of everolimus  is 3 weeks  in general,  and up to 4 
weeks  in the setting  of Hepatitis  B reactivation.  
In the event  of permanent  discontinuation  of bevacizumab  for safety  reasons,  everolimus  
may continue  in the absence  of disease  progression.  Patients  continuing  on everolimus  only 
are only required  to come  for Day 1 visits  each  cycle.  Other  visits  are not required.  
9.3 Bevacizumab  Administration 
Patients  will receive  an intravenous  infusion  of bevacizumab  10 mg/kg  on Cycle  1, Day 1 and 
will return  to the center  every  two weeks  (14 days)  for subsequent  infusions  until disease  
progression,  major  toxicity,  or withdrawal  from the study  for any reason.

Patients  with decompensated  hepatic  function  or cirrhosis  at baseline  are not permitted  to 
enter  this study.  See also section  6.1 for enrollment  requirements  of serum  liver function  
tests.  
For dose  adjustments   in the setting  of hepatic   toxicity  on study  therapy,  refer to section  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Note that in the setting  of multiple  factors  indicating  hepatic  dysfunction,  even if mild 
/ low grade,  patients  with Child -Pugh  class  B hepatic  dysfunction  (see appendix)  should  be 
dose  reduced  to 5mg daily per everolimus  labeling  (see appendix).

No dose  modifications  are recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose  Modification  due to Toxicity  
If treatment  is interrupted  due to toxicity,  everolimus  should  not be resumed  until recovery  to 
 Grade  1, then reintroduce  everolimus  at the initial  dose  or lower  dose  level depending  on 
toxicity  type and Grade  (Table  9.2). Both drugs  (everolimus  and bevacizumab)  are to be held 
until the guidelines  outlined  below  deem  that both are safe to be restarted.  These  changes

[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modifications related to CYP3A4 / P-glycoprotein (PgP) 
Everolimus  is metabolized  primarily  by [CONTACT_508631],  in particular  CYP3A4.  It is also a 
moderate  inhibitor  of the multidrug  efflux  pump  PGP.   Drugs  or substances  known  to be 
inhibitors,  inducers  or substrates  of the isoenzyme  CYP3A4  or PgP should  be avoided   
unless  use of the drug is essential  and no substitute  is available.  See tables  9.3 and 9.4 for a 
listing  of relevant  medications  with effects  on everolimus  metabolism  through  CYP3A4  and/or  
PgP.  
 
▪ Inhibi tors of CYP3A4 and/or PgP 
Co-administration  with moderate  or strong  inhibitors  of CYP3A4  (e.g.,  ketoconazole,  
itraconazole,  ritonavir)  or P-glycoprotein  (PgP)  should  be avoided.  Patients,  who are taking  
such  medications  prior to enrollment,  should  be switched  to an alternate  agent  without  effect  
on CYP3A4  / PgP prior to or at the time of study  initiation,  if possible.  
If a patient  requires  co-administration  of moderate  / strong  CYP3A4  or PgP inhibitor  which  
cannot  be discontinued  or replaced,  the subject  will start everolimus  at the standard  dose  
(10mg  by [CONTACT_196998]).  In the event  that toxicity  occurs,  everolimus  interruptions  and dose  
modifications  should  be undertaken  as outlined in section  [IP_ADDRESS].  For such  patients,  who 
undergo  dose  reductions,  everolimus  can be re-escalated  to the previous  dose,  once  the 
CYP3A4/PgP  inhibitor  is discontinued  for whichever  reason.  
Seville  orange,  grapefruit  and their juices  affect  P450  and PgP activity.    Concomitant  use 
should  be avoided.  
▪ Inducers  of CYP3A4  and/or  PgP 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -226 A(22)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_755324]  on CYP3A4  / PgP prior to or at the time of study  initiation,  
if possible.  
If a patient  requires  co-administration  of moderate  / strong  CYP3A4  or PgP inhibitor  which  
cannot  be discontinued  or replaced,  then the subject  will start everolimus  at the standard  
dose  (10mg  by [CONTACT_196998])  with the aim to subsequently  increase  everolimus  by 50%.  
Enzyme  induction  usually  occurs  within  7-10 days;  therefore  everolimus  dose  should  not be 
escalated  during  this time.  Instead,  the dose  will be increased  to 15mg  daily after at least 14 
days of concomitant  therapy  has been  administered  without  safety  concerns  up to that point.  
No additional  dose -escalations  will be made.  In case  everolimus  has been  escalated  to 15mg  
daily and the patient  experiences  toxicity  that would  require  a dose  reduction  per table  9.2, 
everolimus  will be dose -reduced  to 10mg  daily.  Subsequent  dose  modifications  should  follow  
the guidelines  lined out in section  [IP_ADDRESS].  
If the strong  inducer  is discontinued  in a patient  previously  dose -increased  to everolimus  
15mg  daily,  the everolimus  dose  should  be de-escalated  to everolimus  10mg  daily.  
▪ HMG-CoA reductase inhibi tors and CYP3A4 
Studies  in healthy  subjects  indicate  that there  are no clinically  significant pharmacokinetic  
interactions  between  everolimus  and the HMG -CoA reductase  inhibitors  atorvastatin  (a 
CYP3A4  substrate)  and pravastatin  (a non-CYP3A4  substrate).  A population  
pharmacokinetic  analysis  also detected  no influence  of simvastatin  (a CYP3A4  substrate) on 
the clearance  of everolimus  (taken  from everolimus  package  insert,  see appendix)

9.3.2  Bevacizumab  Dose  Modifications  
 
There  are no recommended  dose  modifications  for the use of bevacizumab,  other  than dose  
adjustments  due to change(s)  in body weight  (patient ‟s body  weight  changes  by ± 10% from 
baseline).  Body  weight  at baseline  will be used  to calculate  the required  dose.  Once  an 
adjustment  has been  made,  the adjusted  dose  will become  the new reference  for potential  
further  dose  changes.  
If needed,  bevacizumab  should  be either  discontinued  or temporarily  suspended  as 
described  below.  Hold bevacizumab  whenever  adverse  events  require  temporary  suspension  
of everolimus.  Bevacizumab  can be restarted  at the original  dose,  once  the protocol  
requirements  for re-initiating  everolimus  are met. The maximum  allowed  time  of 
bevacizumab  interruption  is 8 weeks.  
Appropriate  diagnostic  and therapeutic  medical  treatment  including  accurate  hypertensive  
treatment  is mandatory  for patients  developi[INVESTIGATOR_575397]  (RPLS).   Bevacizumab  has to be discontinued  in these  
patients.   The safety  of re-initiating  bevacizumab  in patients  previously  experiencing  RPLS  is 
not known.  
Bevacizumab  should  be permanently  discontinued  for the following  toxicities:  
• gastrointestinal  perforation  
• arterial  thromboembolic  event  
• Grade  3/4 hemorrhagic  event  
• Wound  dehiscence  and wound  healing  complications  requiring  medical  intervention  
• symptomatic  Grade  4 thrombosis  
• Grade  4 hypertension  or hypertensive  encephalopathy  
• nephrotic  syndrome

who are considered  non-compliant  will be withdrawn  from study.  
 
Patients  who receive  less than 50% of the recommended  everolimus  dose  during  a treatment  
cycle  for reasons  other  than toxicity  will be documented  as protocol  deviations  and will be 
reviewed  by [CONTACT_46575] [INVESTIGATOR_575398].  
 
9.5 Concomitant  Medication(s)  
Patients  must  be instructed  not to take any additional  medications  (over -the-counter  or other  
products)  during  the study  without  prior consultation  with/approval  from the investigator.  All 
medications  taken  within  [ADDRESS_755327]  be reviewed  as per the 
recommendations  below.  
Patients  will be instructed  to notify  the study  center  about  any new medications  he/she  takes  
after the start of the study  treatment.  
 
Investigational  or commercial  anticancer  agents  other  than everolimus  plus bevacizumab  are 
not allowed  during  the study.   The initiation  of any non-protocol  specific  anti-tumor  treatment  
or surgery  is considered  an indication  of disease  progression  and should  be recorded  
appropriately.

not obtained  in the prior cycle).  
• Bone  scan,  if clinically  indicated  
• Assessment  of adverse  events  and tumor -related  signs  and symptoms  
• Assessment  of study  drug compliance/accountability.   Subjects  must  return  all used  
and unused  medication/containers.

• Assessment  of concomitant  medications  and treatments  
During  this period,  the outcome  of adverse  events  with a date of onset  during  the study

10.[ADDRESS_755338]  treatment  response/failure  to bevacizumab  plus everolimus.   Genomics  correlations  
and immunohistochemical  (IHC)  analyses  will be performed.  First,  to identify  any potential  
correlations  between  histologic  features  and treatment  response,  we will conduct  detailed  
histologic  review  of architectural  and cytologic  features  of the tumors.   In addition,  to 
specifically  elucidate  the molecular  basis  of treatment  response  and resistance,  standard   
IHC and scoring  will be performed  on archived  paraffin  tissue  blocks  to determine  the 
underlying  protein  expression  of key signaling  molecules  targeted  by [CONTACT_8235],  including  
mTOR  pathway  activation  markers  phospho -S6 (p-S6) and phospho -4E BP1 (p-4E BP1);   
HIF pathway  markers  hypoxia  inducible  factor -1α (HIF-1α) and carbonic  anhydra se IX (CA- 
IX); vascular  maker  CD31;  and other  key growth  factors  or regulators  of interacting  pathways  
such  as platelet -derived  growth  factor  receptor -β (PDGFR -β), phospho -AKT,  and PTEN.  
Given  the fact that the molecular  underpi[INVESTIGATOR_575399],  the proposed  IHC study  is mainly  limited  to the pathways  targeted  by [CONTACT_575435].  
 
To date (11/26/2013),  emerging  immunohistochemical  (IHC)  analysis  on archived  tumor  
samples  is encouraging  and thus far suggest  that markers  of mTOR  pathway  activation  such  
as phospho -4E BP1 (p-4E BP1)  are high in responders  and low in non-responders.  
Secondly,  DNA extracted  from tumors  and matched  normal  tissue  or blood  specimens  will be 
analyzed  by [CONTACT_575436],  a targeted -exome  capture  assay  with ultra-deep  sequencing  
coverage  (median  570x)  using  Illumina  HiSeq  2000.   This assay  will identify  genetic  
alterations  within  the genes  most  commonly  genetically  altered  in cancer,  which  should  shed  
considerable  light upon  why patients  respond  to the combined  therapy.  Genes  that are within  
all pathways  potentially  targeted  by [CONTACT_575437],  such  as MTOR,  TSC1,  
TSC2,  FLT1  (VEGFR1),  and KDR  (VEGFR2),  will be additionally  scrutinized  at the raw 
sequence  level,  since  we would  expect  to see alterations  of these  genes  in responders  given  
preliminary  data in other  responders  to rapalog  therapy.  
 
Lastly,  when  additional  tissues  are available,  additional  studies,  including  gene -expression  
profiling,  proteomics,  and metabolomics  will be performed.

The following  definitions  of Severity  in accordance  with Cancer  Therapy  Evaluation  Program,  
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE  Version  4.03,  Publish  Date:   June 
14th, 2010  (Gompertz  1825))  to describe  the maximum  intensity  of adverse  events.  If the 
event  is serious  (see section  17.2 for definition),  the CTC grade  reported  and entered  into the 
CRDB  must  be consistent  with the description  of CTC grade  included  in the narrative  section  
of the serious  adverse  event  report.  
 
Grade  refers  to the severity  of the AE. The CTCAE  displays  Grades  1 through  5 with unique  
clinical  descriptions  of severity  for each  AE based  on this general  guideline:  
 
GRADE  Clinical  Description  of Severity  
0 No Change  from Normal  or Reference  Range  (This  grade  is not included  
in the Version  4.0 document  but may be used  in certain  circumstances.)  
1 Mild; asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations  
only; intervention  not indicated.  
2 Moderate;  minimal,  local or noninvasive  intervention  indicated;  limiting  
age-appropriate  instrumental  ADL 
3 Severe  or medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening;  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3526];  disabling;  
limiting  self care ADL 
4 Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention  indicated.  
5 DEATH  RELATED  TO AE 
 
A Semi -colon  indicates  „or ‟ w ithin the description  of the grade.  A single  dash  (-) indicates  a grade  is not available.  
 
 
If required  on SAE reporting  forms,  the investigator  will use the adjectives  MILD,  
MODERATE,  or SEVERE  to describe  the maximum  intensity  of the adverse  event.   For 
purposes  of consistency,  these  intensity  grades  are defined  as follows:  
 
MILD  does not interfere  with patient ‟s usual  function  
MODERATE  interferes  to some  extent  with patient ‟s usual  function  
SEVERE  interferes  significantly  with patien t‟s usual  function  
Note the distinction  between  the severity  and the seriousness  of an adverse  event.   A severe  
event  is not necessarily  a serious  event.   For example,  a headache  may be severe  (interferes  
significantly  with subject's  usual  function)  but would  not be classified  as serious             
unless  it met one of the criteria  for serious  adverse  events,  listed  above.

occasionally  have  had a fatal outcome.  
Physicians  and patients  should  be aware  of the increased  risk of infection  with Everolimus  
Treat  pre-existing  infections  prior to starting  treatment  with Everolimus.  While  taking  
Everolimus,  be vigilant  for symptoms  and signs  of infection;  if a diagnosis  of infection  is 
made,  institute  appropriate  treatment  promptly  and consider  interruption  or discontinuation  of 
Everolimus.  
If a diagnosis  of invasive  systemic  fungal  infection  is made,  discontinue  Everolimus  and treat 
with appropriate  antifungal  therapy.

the following  suggested  supportive  measures  at the discretion  of the investigator:  oral 
minocycline,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_128223],  topi[INVESTIGATOR_575400],  topi[INVESTIGATOR_575401],  
diphenhydramine,  oral prednisolone  (short  course),  topi[INVESTIGATOR_80118],  or pi[INVESTIGATOR_031].  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_755341]  pain or angioedema  (e.g. swelling  of the airways  or tongue,  with or 
without  respi[INVESTIGATOR_575402])  have been  observed  with everolimus.  
 
11.2.4  Renal  failure  events  
 
Cases  of renal  failure  (including  acute  renal  failure),  some  with fatal outcome,  occurred  in 
patients  treated  with everolimus.  Renal  function  of patients  should  be monitored  particularly  
where  patients  have additional  risk factors  that may further  impair  renal  function.  
Elevations  of serum  creatinine,  usually  mild, and proteinuria  have  been  reported  in patients  
taking  everolimus.  Monitoring  of renal  function,  including  measurement  of blood  urea 
nitrogen  (BUN),  urinary  protein,  or serum  creatinine,  is recommended  prior to the start of 
everolimus  therapy  and periodically  thereafter.  
 
 
11.2.5  Management  of stomatitis/oral  mucositis/mouth  ulcers  
 
Stomatitis/oral  mucositis/mouth  ulcers  due to everolimus  should  be treated  using  local 
supportive  care.  They  should  be appropriately  graded  using  the functional  grading  given  on 
the NCI-CTC for adverse  events,  version  4.0 (Gompertz  1825)  (see section  11.1).  
1. For mild toxicity  (Grade  1), use conservative  measures  such as non-alcoholic  mouth  
wash  or salt water  (0.9%)  mouth  wash  several  times  a day until resolution.

menthol,  or phenol)  with or without  topi[INVESTIGATOR_80118],  such as triamcinolone  oral 
paste  0.1%  (Kenalog  in Orabase®). 
3. For Grade  3 toxicity  in which  case  patients  cannot  maintain  adequate  oral alimentation),  
Everolimus  should  be dose  reduced.   Everolimus  should  be discontinued  if toxicity  is a 
Grade  4. 
4. Agents  containing  hydrogen  peroxide,  iodine,  and thyme  derivatives  may tend to worsen  
mouth  ulcers.  It is preferable  to avoid  these  agents.  
5. Antifungal  agents  must  be avoided  unless  a fungal  infection  is diagnosed.  In particular,  
systemic  imidazole  antifungal  agents  (ketoconazole,  fluconazole,  itraconazole,  etc.) 
should  be avoided  in all patients  due to their strong  inhibition  of everolimus  metabolism,  
thereby  [CONTACT_575438].  Therefore,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_575404].  Similarly,  antiviral  agents  such  as acyclovir  should  
be avoided  unless  a viral infection  is diagnosed.

hypertriglyceridemia  (>2.[ADDRESS_755344])  do not require  dose  modifications  or interruption  of 
treatment  with everolimus,  but should  instead  be treated  with a 3-hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl  
(HMG) -CoA reductase  inhibitor  (e.g.,  atorvastatin,  pravastatin)  or appropriate  lipid-lowering  
medication,  in addition  to diet. As per section  6.1, these  interventions  are also indicated  for 
patients  with grade  2 or 3 cholesterol  / triglyceride  levels  at the time of pre-treatment  
screening.  Lipid lowering  treatment  tor these  patients  must  be initiated  prior to beginning

Hyperglycemia  has been  reported  in clinical  trials.  Fasting  serum  glucose  will be assessed  
prior to the start of everolimus  therapy  and will be monitored  while  on treatment  with fasting  
blood  glucose  checked  every  2 cycles.  Optimal  glycemic  control  should  be achieved  before  
starting  trial therapy  and while  on treatment  using  anti-hyperglycemic  agents  at the discretion  
of the individual  investigator  following  the patient.  See table 9.2 for everolimus  dose

Approval date: [ADDRESS_755360]  a dipstick  urinalysis  performed  at the beginning  of every  
other  cycle,  i.e. prior to every  fourth  bevacizumab  dose.   For ≥2+ proteinuria  on dipstick,  
reflective  quantification  of proteinuria  will be performed  by [CONTACT_575439] - 
creatinine  ratio (UPCR).  The UPCR  has been  found  to correlate  directly  with the amount  of 
protein  excreted  in a 24 hour urine  collection  (Ginsberg,  Chang  et al. 1983;  Schwab,  
Christensen  et al. 1987;  Rodby,  Rohde  et al. 1995).  Specifically,  a UPCR  of 1.[ADDRESS_755361] 4 ml of a 
random  urine  sample  will be collected  in a sterile  container  (this does not have to be a 24- 
hour urine).  Samples  will be analyzed  for random  urine  protein  and creatinine  levels  
[separate  requests].  The lab will measure  protein  concentration  (mg/dL)  and creatinine  
concentration  (mg/dL).  The UPCR  is derived  as follows:  protein  concentration  
(mg/dL)/creatinine  (mg/dL).  
Management  in regards  to further  administration  of bevacizumab  will be determined  as 
follows:  
• < 2+ proteinuria  (dipstick):  administer  bevacizumab  as planned.  
• ≥ 2+ proteinuria  (dipstick):  determination  of urine  protein -creatinine  ratio (UPCR)  
• UPC ratio < 2.0 Continue  bevacizumab.  
• UPC ratio ≥ 2.0 Hold bevacizumab  until UPC ratio recovers  to < 2.0 (recheck  every  
other  week).  
• If therapy  is held for > 2 months  due to proteinuria,  discontinue  bevacizumab.  
• nephrotic  syndrome:  Discontinue  bevacizumab

of bevacizumab  are uncommon  (<3%)  and severe  reactions  have been  reported  in 0.2%  of 
patients.  
If a severe  infusion  reaction  occurs,  infusion  should  be stopped  and appropriate  medical  
therapy  should  be administered.  Treatment  can be continued  with premedication  for 
subsequent  cycles  at the investigato r‟s discretion.  
 
11.8 Laboratory  Safety  Assessments  
 
Blood:  
 
• Hematology,  Coagulation,  and Blood  Chemistry  samples  will be drawn  at the time 
points  described  in Sections  8.0 and 10.0.   Additional  blood  tests  may be performed  
for the purposes  of planning  treatment  administration,  dose  modification,  or following  
adverse  events.  
 
• Fasting  blood  glucose.  The patient  must  be in a fasting  state  (at least 6 hours)  at the 
time of blood  sampling  for this evaluation.  
 
• Serum  pregnancy  test for women  of childbearing  potential  will be performed  prior to 
administration  of the first dose  of study  treatment  (results  must  be available  for 
eligibility  determination).  
 
• Lipid panel:  A serum  lipid profile  includes:  total cholesterol,  triglycerides,  LDL, and 
HDL.  The patient  must  be in a fasting  state  (at least 6 hours)  at the time of blood  
sampling  for this evaluation.

• Urinalysis  will be performed  periodically  for detection  of elevated  urine  protein  
excretion.  Should  such  elevation  be seen,  24 hour urine  collection  or urine  collection  
for UPCR  will be necessary,  as outlined  in sections  6.2 and 11.2.10,  respectively.  
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
The determination  of antitumor  efficacy  will be based  on objective  tumor  assessments  made  
according  to the RECIST1.1(Eisenhauer,  Therasse  et al. 2009)  system  of unidimensional  
evaluation  and treatment  decisions  by [CONTACT_575440].  
A minor  modification  will be adopted  to accommodate  standard  practic  e in use of spi[INVESTIGATOR_575406]  (i.e., reconstruction  interval  up to 8 mm).   In the event  spi[INVESTIGATOR_575407],  minimum  lesion  size qualifying  as measurable  should  be twice  the reconstruction  
interval  used  and at least  [ADDRESS_755365] or MRI should  be performed  should  also be based   
on tumor  type, anatomic  location  of the disease  and should  be optimized  to allow  for 
comparison  to prior studies  if possible.  
 
Whenever  possible,  clinical  evaluation  of superficial  lesions  should  not be used  as the sole 
form of measurement.   However,  when  necessary,  color  photograph  with metric  caliber  is 
acceptable.   Tumor  evaluation  by [CONTACT_575441]  (PET)  scan or by [CONTACT_575442].  
 
Radiologic  tumor  assessments  will be performed  at screening,  at the end of the dosing  
period  of cycles  as outlined  in Section  10 and whenever  disease  progression  is suspected.  
After the patient  is withdrawn  from study  treatment,  another  tumor  assessment  will be 
performed  if an assessment  has not been  performed  within  the prior 6 weeks.   12.1 
Calculated  Endpoint  Definitions  
 
12.1.1  Progression  free survival  (PFS)  
 
PFS will be defined  as the duration  of time from enrollment  until death  or progression  of 
disease.  Patients  still progression  free at the time of analysis  will be considered  censored.  
 
12.1.2  Objective  response  rate (ORR)  
 
• Overall  confirmed  objective  response  rate (ORR),  defined  as the proportion  of 
patients  with confirmed  complete  response  (CR) or confirmed  partial  response  (PR)

according  to the RECIST1.1  criteria  (Eisenhauer,  Therasse  et al. 2009),  relative  to the 
total population  of patients  who receive  at least  one dose  of study  drug.   Confirmed  
responses  are those  that persist  on repeat  imaging  study   [ADDRESS_755366] to be interrupted  for more  than 21 days (>4 weeks  for hepatitis  B 
reactivation),  the patient  will be discontinued  from the study.  
The patient  may discontinue  study  treatment  for any of the following  reasons:  
• Adverse  event(s)  as specified  in sections  9.3 and 11.2 
• Subject  withdrew  consent  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Administrative  problems  
• Disease  progression  
• Protocol  deviation  
• Discretion  of the Investigator  
If a patient  has discontinued  the study  treatment  due to an unacceptable  adverse  drug 
reaction  or an abnormal  laboratory  value,  he/she  should  not have withdrawal  of consent  
recorded  as the reason  for discontinuation.  Instead,  the reason  for discontinuation  must  be 
recorded  as due to adverse  drug reaction  or an abnormal  laboratory  value.  
 
14.1 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
14.2 Study  design  / Primary endpoint  
 
The purpose  of this study  is to assess  the efficacy  of everolimus  plus bevacizumab  in 
patients  with metastatic  non-clear  cell RCC.  The primary  endpoint  is the percent  of patients  
alive and progression -free after [ADDRESS_755367] day of treatment,  this 
regimen  will be considered  feasible  and will merit  further  clinical  study.   With 34 patients,  this 
design  discriminates  between  true response  rates  of ≤ 50% and ≥ 70% at a Type  I error of 
6% and a Type  II error of 19%.   Our null hypothesis  of 50% was chosen  based  on phase  II 
data in non-clear  cell RCC  from our center  showing  a PFS of 50% at [ADDRESS_755368]-line setting(Molina,  Feldman  et al. 2010).  While  sunitinib  is not part 
of this regimen,  this is the only prospective  data for targeted  therapy  in this group  of kidney  
cancer  subtypes  available  for comparison.  
 
Patients  that come  off study  before  6 months  before  documented  progression/death  will be 
treated  as events  for the 6 month  PFS endpoint.   In addition  to counting  the number  of 
patients  alive and progression -free at 6 months,  a Kaplan -Meier  curve  will be calculated  for

progression -free survival.   All patients  will be used  in the analysis.   Patients  still progression  
free at the time of analysis  will be considered  censored.   Median  progression -free survival  
(and 95% confidence  interval)  will be determined  from that curve.   In addition  to counting  the 
number  of patients  alive and progression -free at 6 months,  a Kaplan -Meier  curve  will be 
calculated  for progression -free survival.   Patients  still progression  free at the time of analysis  
will be considered  censored.   Median  progression -free survival  (and 95% confidence  interval)  
will be determined  from that curve.  
 
To date (11/26/2013),  the study  has enrolled  32 patients  (5 chromophobe,  2 medullary,  7 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396],  11 unclassified  and 7 unclassified  with papi[INVESTIGATOR_575369]).   Preliminarily,  5/6 
patients  with papi[INVESTIGATOR_575408] 3/6 patients  with unclassified  (papi[INVESTIGATOR_575369])  have met the 
study ‟s primary endpoint  of progression -free after 6 months  of therapy.    Three  out of six 
patients  with papi[INVESTIGATOR_575409]  a partial  response  (PR) as best response.   Two out of 
six patients  with unclassified  with papi[INVESTIGATOR_575410]  a PR as best response  (1 is 
unconfirmed).   Additionally,  4 patients  (2 papi[INVESTIGATOR_575408] 2 unclassified  with papi[INVESTIGATOR_575369])  
have stable  disease  beyond  [ADDRESS_755369]  of analysis  of the study ‟s main  objective.  
14.3 Sample Size / Accrual Rate 
 
The total planned  sample  size is 54 patients.  An estimated  10 patients  with non-clear  cell 
RCC  with papi[INVESTIGATOR_575411].  Considering  this, estimated  time to 
accrue  an additional  20 patients  is two years.  Following  completion  of accrual,  an additional  6 
months  is estimated  for follow -up. 
14.4 Analysis of secondary endpoints 
 
Secondary  endpoints  include  objective  response  rate, the safety  of the drug combination  in 
this population  and the assessment  of expression  of correlative  biomarkers.  
14.4.1  Objective  response  rate (ORR)  
 
Response  will be evaluated  by [CONTACT_575443]  (RECIST  1.1) (Eisenhauer,  Therasse  et al. 
2009) . All responses  will be confirmed  ≥ 4 weeks  after initial  documentation  of response.  
Response  rates  and 95% confidence  interval  will be estimated  using  exact  binomial  
methods.  
 
14.4.2  Safety  of the study  drug  combination  in the study  population

Toxicity  will be assessed  using  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  
v4.0 (Gompertz  1825),  as outlined  in section  11.5.  Toxicities  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_575444].  
14.4.3  Correlative  biomarkers  
 
Expression  levels  of phospho -Akt, phospho -S6, HIF-1α, and PTEN  in pretreatment  patient  
tumor  samples  will be assessed  with aim of correlating  levels  to treatment  benefit.  In 
evaluating  the correlative  endpoints  to this study,  Fishe r‟s exact  test will be employed  to 
determine,  whether  the biomarkers  are predictive  for treatment  response  in the studied  drug 
combination.   Logistic  regression  will be used  to relate  2 or 3 biomarkers  to response  
simultaneously.  
 
In evaluating  the correlative  markers  for the combined  everolimus  and bevacizumab  
treatment,  two-sided  Fishe r‟s exact  test will be employed  to determine  whether  the 
biomarkers  are predictive  for treatment  response  in the studied  drug combination.  A Kaplan - 
Meier  curve  will be calculated  for progression -free survival  related  to specific  biomarkers  or 
combinations  of biomarkers.  
 
Multivariate  analyses  with age, gender,  tumor  size, histological  subtype,  and grade  will be 
performed.   Pearson  correlation,  Chi-square  tests,  Student ‟s t test, univariable  and 
multivariable  Cox regression  analysis,  hazard  ratios,  Kaplan -Meier  curves,  and log-rank test 
will all be used  to calculate  significant  association  of biomarkers  with clinical  results  and 
determine  if the biomarkers  are indeed  predictive.

16.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.   The responsibilities  of the 
RSA include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  
regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  the activities  of 
the protocol  study  team.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database.   Source  documents  
will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  
of registration  data.   Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  m issing  data 
and inconsistencies.   Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will 
be monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  
to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
Random  sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_209870].  
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM) Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  
were  approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the 
new policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy of the National  Cancer  
Institute  for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html .  The DMS Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].   The MSKCC  Data and 
Safety  Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  
and quality.   There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g. protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff  
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus  
there  are two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.   The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III 
clinic al trials,  report  to the Cente r‟s Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g. NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
The risks,  benefits  and objectives  of the study  will be reviewed  with each  participant  prior to 
enrollment.  Patients  will be made  aware  of the voluntary  nature  of this trial, potential  adverse

with treatment  on this trial. Written  informed  consent  will then be obtained  prior to enrollment.  
Privacy  and confidentiality  will be maintained  for all participants,  and the study  is designed  
with careful  monitoring  of toxicity  through  physician  visits  and laboratory  assessment  to 
assure  patient  safety.  
 
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC ‟s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected  health  information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  
Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by [CONTACT_11097]  [INVESTIGATOR_40092]  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigational  treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events ‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
 
Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to [EMAIL_440] .  All other

17.2.[ADDRESS_755370] dose/treatment  with the investigational  agent/product  must  be reported  to [COMPANY_001].  
Any SAEs  experienced  after this period  should  only be reported  to [COMPANY_001]  only  if the 
investigator  suspects  a causal  relationship  to the study  treatment.  The completed,  signed  
form will be faxed  ([PHONE_002])  within  [ADDRESS_755371]  be reported  as  follow -up to the original  epi[INVESTIGATOR_199156]  5 business  days of the 
investigator  receiving  the follow -up information.  An SAE occurring  at a different  time interval  
or otherwise  considered  completely  unrelated  to a previously  reported  event  should   be 
reported  separately  as a new event.  
 
17.3 Pregnancy  and assessments  of fertility  
Pregnancy  testing  is required  at screening  and recommended  monthly  until the end of the 
trial. Serum  pregnancy  testing  should  be performed  at screening  and at the end of the study.

everolimus  and/or  its metabolites  readily  passed  into the milk of lactating  rats. Women  taking  
everolimus  should  therefore  not breast -feed.  
 
 
17.3.[ADDRESS_755373]  use highly  effective  contraception  during  the study  and for 8 weeks  after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_252364].  Highly  effective  contraception  is defined  as either:  
• Total  abstinence:  When  this is in line with the preferred  and usual  lifestyle  of the subject.  
[Periodic  abstinence  (e.g.,  calendar,  ovulation,  symptothermal,  post-ovulation  methods)  
and withdrawal  are not acceptable  methods  of contraception]  
• Sterilization:  have  had surgical  bilateral  oophorectomy  (with or without  hysterectomy)  or 
tubal ligation  at least six weeks  before  taking  study treatment.  In case  of oophorectomy  
alone,  only when  the reproductive  status  of the woman  has been  confirmed  by [CONTACT_334970]  
• Male partner  sterilization  (with the appropriate  post-vasectomy  documentation  of the 
absence  of sperm  in the ejaculate).  [For female  subjects  on the study,  the vasectomised  
male  partner  should  be the sole partner  for that subject].  
• Use of a combination  of any two of the following  (a+b or a+c or b+c):  
a. Use of oral, injected,  implanted  or other  hormonal  methods  of contraception  
b. Placement  of an intrauterine  device  (IUD)  or intrauterine  system  (IUS)  
c. Barrier  methods  of contraception:  Condom  or Occlusive  cap (diaphragm  or 
cervical/vault  caps)  with spermicidal  foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal  suppository  
• In case  of use of oral contraception,  women  should  have been  stable  on the oral agent  
before  taking  study  treatment.  
 
17.3.[ADDRESS_755374]  also be advised  to use one of the following  
contraception  methods:  Use of (1) oral, injected,  implanted  or other  hormonal  methods  of 
contraception,  or (2) intrauterine  device  (IUD)  or intrauterine  system  (IUS),  or (3) prior 
male/female  sterilization.

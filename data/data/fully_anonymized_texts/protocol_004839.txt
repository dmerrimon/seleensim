Title  An Open -label, Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Tolerability of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  (TreT)  in Subjects 
with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Currently Using Tyvaso  
Study Phase  1b 
Indication  Pulmonary arterial hypertension  (WHO Group 1)  
Primary Objective  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Treprostinil Inhalation 
Powder  (TreT ) in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH) currently treated with Tyvaso® 
Secondary Objective(s)  1. To evaluate systemic exposure and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
treprostinil in subjects with PAH when delivered as Tyvaso 
and TreT  
2. To evaluate 6 -Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) at study entry 
and after [ADDRESS_3389] satisfaction with and preference for 
inhaled treprostinil devices  with the Preference 
Questionnaire for Inhaled Treprostinil Devices  (PQ-ITD). 
5. To evaluate patie nt-reported PAH symptoms and impact with 
the PAH -Symptoms and Impact  (PAH -SYMPACT ) 
Questionnaire . 
Study Design  This is a Phase 1b safety and tolerability single -sequence study in 
which subjects on a stable regimen of Tyvaso will switch to a 
corresponding dose of TreT.  At Baseline, subjects currently taking 
stable doses of Tyvaso (6 to 12 breaths 4 times daily [QID] ) will 
take a dos e of Tyvaso in the clinic and undergo  PK assessments , 
safety assessments , and a 6-Minute Walk Test ( 6MW T).  Following 
the in -clinic assessments, subjects will switch from Tyvaso to the 
corresponding dose of TreT and take their first dose of TreT in the 
clinic.  Following  [ADDRESS_3390] to enter the Optional Extension Phase will remain on TreT 
and attend follow -up study visits that will occur every 8 weeks until

Inhalation System.  
Procedures  Screening Phase : Prospective subjects will be assessed during the 
Screening Phase to determine eligibility for the study.  The 
Screening Visit must occur within 14  days prior to Baseline .  During 
this Screening Phase, eligible subjects will sign the Informed 
Consent form and undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who 
satisfy all eligibility  criteria during the Screening Phase  may return 
to the clinic at Baseline for enrollment.  If subjects are able to satisfy 
all eligibility criteria on the same day, a combined 
Screeni ng/Baseline Visit may be conducted.   
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Dat e 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 Treatment Phase : The Treatment Phase consists of 2 study visits to 
the clinic separated by 3 weeks of treatment with TreT .  At Baseline, 
subjects will receive 1 dose of Tyvaso in clinic and undergo PK 
assessments  (at th e following timepoints: 15  minutes before dose 
and 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after dose), 
safety assessments, and a 6MWT .  No additional dose of Tyvaso 
will be administered, nor will TreT be started, until after the PK 
sampl ing assessment is complete .  Following these assessments, 
subjects will be assigned a corresponding dose of TreT  based upon 
their current stable Tyvaso dose  and will receive the first dose of 
TreT in the clinic .  Each subject will receive TreT  QID by [CONTACT_3771] [ADDRESS_3402] will also be administered .  At each study visit  
during the Treatment Phase , adverse events (AEs) will be assessed, 
vital signs will be recorded, an d a physical examination  will be 
performed.  Following the Week [ADDRESS_3403] to participate in the Optional Extension Phase 
of the study, he/she  must discontinue TreT, may resume Tyvaso, and 
must return to the clinic 2 weeks after TreT discontinuation for an 
End of Study Visit.    
Optional Extension Phase : The Optional Extension Phase will 
occur following completion of the Treatment Phase and continue 
with clinic visits every 8 weeks until the study is terminated for any 
reason or the drug/device becomes commercially available.  To be 
eligible for the Optional Extension Phase, subjects must complete 
the Treatment Phase, elect to continue TreT , and agree  to attend 
follow -up visits in the clinic.   Dosing titration  will be encouraged  
during the Optional Extension Phase; the dose of TreT  should be 
titrated  upward , as clinically tolerated , to identify a maximum stable 
dose in each subject .  Subjects who discontinue TreT  must complete 
an Early Termination Visit as soon as possible . 
Statistical 
Considerations  Plasma concentrations of treprostinil above the lower limit of 
quantitation will be used to calculate area under the curve from time 
0 to 300 minutes  (AUC 0-300) and maximal drug concentration ( Cmax) 
for each treatment.  PK and safety parameters will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics.  The 6MW T results will also be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.  The number and percent of 
subjects with AEs will be tabulated for treatment phases by [CONTACT_3772]  (MedDRA) System Organ 
Class and P referred Term by [CONTACT_3773] p to treatment and severity.

1.1 DEFINITION OF CLINIC AL PROBLEM  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure 
and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality associated with  a 
variety of diseases and syndromes.  Elevation in pulmonary arterial press ure causes an increase 
in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function , and ultimately leading to heart 
failure and death  (Rubin 1997) . 
There are 3 major factors thought to contribute to the increased pulmonary vascular resistance 
seen in this disease: vasoconstriction, remodeling of the vessel wall, and thrombosis.  There are 
several metabolic pathways which  contribute to these changes that involve  vasoactive mediators 
such as the vasodilators , nitric oxide and prostacyclin  (PGI 2), and  the vasoconstrictor , 
endothelin -1.  These substances affect both vascular tone and remodeling , leading to the ir use as 
pharmacologic targets  (Farber  2004 ). 
Approved pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_3745] (IV) PGI 2 (epoprostenol  
sodium or Flolan , Veletri®); the PGI 2 analogues , subcutaneous, IV, and inhaled treprostinil 
(Remodulin®, Tyvaso®), oral treprostinil diethanolamine (also referred to as treprostinil 
diolamine; Orenitram®), oral selexipag (Uptravi®), and inhaled iloprost (Ventavis®); the 
phosphodiesterase  type 5 inhibitors  (PDE5 -Is), tadalafil (Adcirca®) and sildenafil (Revatio®); the 
oral endothelin receptor antagonists  (ERA s), bosentan (Tracleer®), ambrisentan (Letairis®, 
Volibris®), and macitentan (Opsumit®); and a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, 
riociguat (Adempas®). 
1.2 INHALED TREPROSTINIL  BACKGROUND  
1.2.1 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  
United Therapeutics Corporation (UTC) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a combination drug -device product which 
is comprised of a dry powder  formulation of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT) and a small, 
portable, dry powder inhaler.   The dry powder contains  treprostinil and an inhalation excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] , 
fumaryl diketopi[INVESTIGATOR_3746] (FDKP), which is an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_3747]®, an Food and Drug  
Administration ( FDA )-approved drug product that is listed in the FDA Inactive Ingredient 
Database.    
United Therapeutics Corp.  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2  
 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Dat e 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 [IP_ADDRESS]  Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient: Treprostinil  
Treprostinil, [[(1R,2R,3aS,9aS) 2,3,3a,4,9,9a hexahydro 2 hydroxy 1 [(3S) 3 hydroxyoctyl] 1H 
benz [f]inden 5 yl]oxy]acetic acid, is a chemically stable tricyclic analogue of PGI 2.  The 
pharmacology of treprostinil has been extensively characterized in well -established models, all 
confirming the suitability of the drug for the treatment of PAH following either t he 
subcutaneous, IV, inhaled (as treprostinil sodium) , or oral (as treprostinil diethanolamine) routes 
of administration.  
The major pharmacological actions of treprostinil are direct vasodilation of pulmonary and 
systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibit ion of platelet aggregation.  In vitro , treprostinil 
induced concentration -dependent relaxation of rabbit isolated , precontracted , mesenteric arteries 
and inhibition of adenosine diphosphate -induced platelet aggregation in human and rat platelet -
rich plasm a.  In animals, the vasodilatory effects of treprostinil reduce right and left ventricular 
afterload, thereby [CONTACT_3774].  Prostacyclins lower pulmonary 
artery pressure, increase cardiac output without affecting the heart r ate (HR), and improve 
systemic oxygen transport as well as possibly reversing pulmonary artery remodeling.  There is 
also increasing evidence that the ability to block the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth 
muscle cells may contribute, along with vas odilation, to the therapeutic effects of PGI 2 in the 
treatment of PAH.  The mechanism of action is therefore likely to be multifactorial.  
1.2.2 General Toxicology  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient: Treprostinil  
A well -defined clinical safety profile exists for tr eprostinil sodium; acute toxicity studies, repeat -
dose toxicity studies, reproductive toxicity studies, and genotoxicity studies have been performed 
in both rats and dogs and support the chronic administration to patients (Remodulin Package 
Insert 201 8, Tyvaso Package Insert 2017 ).   
The toxicokinetic profile of treprostinil was also evaluated in acute and repeat -dose toxicity 
studies of up to 13 weeks in duration in rodents and dogs, which supported the chronic 
administration of inhaled treprostinil to p atients.  In addition, a 2 -year rat carcinogenicity study 
was performed with treprostinil for inhalation at target doses up to 5.25, 10.6, and 
34.1 µg/kg/day, which found no evidence for carcinogenic potential associated with inhaled

1.2.3 Clinical Experience  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Inhaled Treprostinil (Tyvaso)  
A series of acute and chronic investigator -initiated clinical studies were conducted with inhaled 
treprostinil to optimize the formulation for inhalation ; determine dose response, tolerability, and 
safety ; and also to evaluate safety and tolerability when combined with other PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
(Channick 2006, Voswinckel 2006).  In the acute dosing studies, a dministration of inhaled 
treprostinil resulted in pulmonary vasodilation at relatively low doses.  In the chronic studies, 
administration of inhaled treprostinil resulted in sustained improvement of exercise capacity.   
A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, Phase 3 study (TRIUMPH -I) was conducted to 
assess the safety and efficacy of inhaled treprostinil in combination with approved PAH 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Two hundred thirty -five subjects who were clinically stable on an approved 
background oral PAH therap y (bosentan or sildenafil) were randomly allocated to receive either 
placebo or inhaled treprostinil for 12 weeks.  The primary efficacy endpoint was change in 
exercise capacity at Week 12 as measured by 6 -Minute Walk Distance (6MWD).  At Week  12, 
subjects  receiving inhaled treprostinil had a median improvement of +21.6  m in 6MWD , and 
subjects in the placebo group had a median improvement of +3.0  m.  The Hodges -Lehmann 
placebo -corrected median change from baseline in peak 6MWD was +20.0  m (p=0.[ZIP_CODE]).  The 
durability of this result was supported by [CONTACT_3775] 6MWD, 
which was measured at least [ADDRESS_3412] of 13.7  m (p=0.0066).  The 
most commonly reported adverse events (AEs) in the inhaled treprostinil group were cough 
(54%), headache (41%), and nausea (19%).  There were no remarkable treatment -related changes 
in chest x -rays, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), or cli nical laboratory parameters 
(McLaughlin  2010).  
An open -label, extension study of the TRIUMPH -I study to evaluate the use of long -term inhaled 
treprostinil therapy was also conducted (TRIUMPH -OL).  Subjects received 1 to 12  breaths (6 to 
72 µg) 4 times dail y (QID) to achieve daily doses of [ADDRESS_3413] duration of

headache (31%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (22%), and nausea (22%).  There were no 
clinically significant changes in clinical chemistry or hematology parameters.  Unique findings 
that related to the inhaled route of administration, in addition to cough, were throat pain and 
throat irritation, occurring in 12% and 10% of subjects, respectively.  These events were usually 
of mild or moderate severity and transient in duration.  In a few subjects, th ese specific AEs were 
more pronounced as 6  subjects ( 3%) discontinued inhaled treprostinil due to cough, including 
[ADDRESS_3415] (<1%) with dry throat . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treprostinil Inhalation Powder  
An open -label, single ascending dose (SAD) study in healthy normal volunteers, MKC -475-001, 
was conducted to assess the safety and tolerability of TreT.  A total of 36  healthy volunteers 
were sequentially assigned to 6  cohorts (6 subjects per cohort) of ascending dose levels of TreT 
(30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180  µg).  Ea ch subject received 1  dose of TreT by [CONTACT_3776].  The incidence and severity of AEs were assessed and 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) parameters were measured by [CONTACT_3777].  Bioanalysis data conf irmed  treprostinil  plasma concentrations and exposure at 
clinically relevant concentrations when TreT is administered as a dry powder via oral inhalation.  
Treprostinil exposure, as measured by [CONTACT_3778] ( Cmax) and area under the 
curve ( AUC), increased in a linear manner with increasing dose up to 180  µg tested , which 
would correspond to a 30 -breath dose of Tyvaso.

The most frequently reported AEs overall were cough (3 1%) and headache (22%).  There were 
no severe AEs, serious AE (SAEs), or deaths during this study.  No AEs led to a subject’s early 
termination.  No clinically significant abnormalities on oropharyngeal examinations, clinical 
laboratory evaluations, electro cardiograms ( ECGs ), or PFTs  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) were observed.

3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase 1b safety and tolerability single -sequence study in which subjects on a stable 
regimen of Tyvaso will switch to a corresponding dose of TreT.  At Baseline, subjects currently 
taking stable doses of Tyvaso (6 to 12 breaths QID) will take a dose of Tyvaso in the clinic and 
undergo PK assessments , safety assessments , and  a 6MW T.  Following the in -clinic assessments, 
subjects will switch from Tyvaso to the corresponding dose of TreT and take their first dose of 
TreT in the clinic.  Following 3 weeks of treatment with TreT, subjects will return to the clinic 
and receive 1 dose of TreT and undergo PK assessments, safety assessments, and a 6MWT as 
performed at the Baseline Visit.

Version Dat e [ADDRESS_3417] to enter the Optional Extension Phase will remain on T reT and attend study visits every 
8 weeks until the study is terminate d or the drug/device becomes commercially available.  If the 
subject discontinues TreT  prematurely  during the Optional Extension Phase, he/she must return 
to the clinic as soon as possible for an Early Termination Visit .   
Screening Phase : Prospective subjects will be assessed during the Screening Phase to determine 
eligibility for the study.  The Screening Visit must occur within 14 days prior to Baseline.  
During this Screening Ph ase, eligible subjects will sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and 
undergo screening assessments.  Subjects who satisfy all eligibility criteria during the Screening 
Phase may return to the clinic at Baseline for enrollment.   If subjects are able to sati sfy all 
eligibility criteria on the same day, a combined Screening/Baseline Visit may be conducted.  
Treatment Phase : The Treatment Phase consists of 2 study visits to the clinic separated by 
3 weeks of treatment with TreT .  At Baseline, s ubjects will recei ve 1 dose of Tyvaso in the clinic 
and undergo PK assessments  (at the following timepoints: 15 minutes before dose and 5, 10, 15, 
30, 45, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after dose), safety assessments, and a 6-Minute Walk 
Test ( 6MWT ).  No additional dos e of Tyvaso will be administered, nor will TreT be started, until 
after the PK sampl ing assessment is complete.   Following these assessments, subjects will be 
assigned a corresponding dose of TreT  based upon their current stable Tyvaso dose  and will 
receive the first dose of TreT in the clinic .  Each subject will receive TreT  QID by [CONTACT_3780] [ADDRESS_3418]  will also be administered.  
At each study visit, AEs will be  assessed, vital signs will be recorded, and a physical 
examination ( PE), including oropharyngeal examination, will be performed.  Following the

biomarkers (specific targets to be determined) will be collected at the Baseline Visit and Week 3 
Visit.  An additional blood sample for an optional evaluation of whole genome sequence will be 
collected at the Baseline Visit.  
Option al Extension Phase : The Optional Extension Phase will occur following completion of 
the Treatment Phase and continue with clinic visits every 8 weeks until the study is terminated 
for any reason or the drug/device becomes commercially available.  To be eligible for the 
Optional Extension Phase, subjects must complete the Treatment Phase, elect to continue TreT , 
and agree to attend follow -up visits in th e clinic.   Dosing titrat ion will be encouraged during the 
Optional Extension Phase; the dose of TreT should be titrated upward , as clinically tolerated , to 
identify a maximum stable dose in each subject .  Subjects who discontinue TreT  must complete 
an Early Termination Visit as soon as possible .  A blood sample for an optional evaluation of 
change in biomarkers will be collected at the Week 51 Visit .

A single -use cartridge is manually inserted into the dry powder inhaler,  which is a proprietary, 
breath -activated, reusable , dry powder inhaler  that will deliver TreT to the lungs.  Powder is 
discharged from the inhaler when the subject  inhales.  Each subject will be trained on inhalation 
technique prior to the first dose of TreT in clinic.  Additionally, subjects must be able to perform 
inhalation maneuvers  using the BluHale technol ogy that meets inspi[INVESTIGATOR_3751] .  
Subjects who are not able to demonstrate proper technique will be considered screen failures.  
At the end of the Treatment Phase, subjects will be offered the opportunity to continue therapy 
with TreT or resum e Tyvaso therapy .  If the subject continues therapy with TreT during the 
Optional Extension Phase, the dose of TreT should be  titrat ed upward,  as clinically tolerated , to

cessation date and times,  intensity, seriousness, relationship to study drug, and outcome , is also 
to be documented in the eCRF (see Section 9 and Appendix 15.2 for definitions).  Where 
possible, AEs should be recorded using standard medical terminology.  If several signs or 
symptoms are clearly related to a medically defined diagnosis or syndrome, t he diagnosis or 
syndrome should be recorded on the eCRF page, not the individual signs and symptoms.  
All AEs should be followed until either resolution (or return to normal or baseline values), until 
they are judged by [CONTACT_3796], or for at least [ADDRESS_3481] etion of the final visit.  Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations may 
be necessary to investigate fully the nature and/or causality of an AE or SAE.  This may include 
additional laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, or consultation with other heal thcare 
professionals.  The eCRF pages should be updated with any new or additional information as 
appropriate.  
The inhaler  to be used in this clinical study is identical in all aspects , including function,  to the 
inhaler of the  FDA -approved Afrezza drug-device combination  product  except for minor

Instructions to the Subject  
Subjects will be instructed that the preceding meal should be light.  Subjects should be told to 
wear comfortable clothing and sneakers or comfortable walking shoes.  The person 
administering the test will use the following exact  dialogue with the subject:  
“The purpose of this test is to find out how far you can walk in [ADDRESS_3498] to the marker (eg, chair) at the end, turn around and 
walk back.  When you arrive back at the starting point you will go back  and forth again.  
You will go back and forth as many times as you can in the [ADDRESS_3499] is that you cover as much ground as you 
possibly can during the 6 minutes.  I will tell you the time, and I will let you know when 
the 6 minutes are up.  When I say ‘STOP, ’ please stand right where you are.”

The person administering the test will then start the test by [CONTACT_3810]:  
“Are you ready?”  
“Start when I say ‘GO.’” 
The person administering the test wil l tell the subject the time at each minute  by [CONTACT_3041]:  
“You have 5 minutes to go .” 
“You have 4 minutes to go .” 
“You have 3 minutes to go .” 
“You have 2 minutes to go .” 
“You have 1 minute to go .”

The Investigator  or a designated member of his/her staff will probe each subject for any AEs that 
may have occurred.  The Investigator  should always ask the same question when conducting the 
verbal probe in order to ensure uniformity between subjects.  The Investigator  should ask:  
“How are you doing (feeling)?”  
Based on the subject’s response to this question, the Investigator  should ask additional questions 
relevant to the specific complaint such as:  
“How severe is/was the symptom?”  
“How often did the symptom occur?”  
“How  long did the symptom last?”  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all diagnostic and laboratory tests as 
they become available and ascertain if there is a clinically significant change from baseline.  If 
the results are determin ed to be a clinically significant change from baseline, this should be 
reported as an AE.  The Investigator may repeat the diagnostic procedure or laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original tests.  When possible, a di agnosis 
associated with the abnormality should be used as the reported AE.  
Using provided definitions, the Investigator  will then:  
(1) rate the intensity and seriousness of the AE, (2) estimate the causality of the AE to study 
drug, and (3)  note actions ta ken to counteract the AE.  
Definitions of Intensity, Seriousness, Causality, Action Taken, and Outcome  
INTENSITY  
An assessment of the relative intensity (severity) of an AE is based on the Investigator ’s clinical 
judgment.  The maximum intensity encountered  during the evaluation period should be checked.  
The assessment of intensity should be independent of the assessment of the seriousness of the 
AE.

limited to, an event that is fatal, life -threatening, permanently or severely disabling, requires or 
prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is a congenital abnormality (offspring of subject) , or is 
medically significant (important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening,

Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3768]:  
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the study indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a routine right heart cathe terization ). 
 Treatment which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing condition not associated 
with any deterioration in condition (eg, pre -planned operation which does not lead to

CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
An estimate of causality between a specified AE and the study drug is made by [CONTACT_737] .  
Several factors sh ould be considered when determining causality.  These factors include 
temporal relationship and response to withdrawal or reintroduction of the study drug.  
Definitions of the causality  categories are as follow s: 
 NOT RELATED – There is not a temporal relat ionship to study drug administration (too 
early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship 
between another drug, or  concurrent disease and the SAE, or any of the following:  
 An event that precedes the first administration of study drug  
 An event for which the cause is clearly related to an external event  
 Temporal relationship to study drug is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  
 Is readily explained by [CONTACT_3812], 
duration, and resolutio n 
 An alternative explanation (concomitant drug, intercurrent illness) is likely  
 POSSIBLE  – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear, study drug administration was not 
modif ied in response to the SAE, or any of the following:

 Treprostinil Inhalation Powder (TreT)  
Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61  Has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug  
 The event has a plausible biological link to the activity of the study drug  
 Is unlikely to be related to an intercurrent illness or has an unexpected degree of 
severity, duration , or complication  
 PROBABLE  – There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  The event responds to dechallenge —the event resolves or improves with 
modification of study drug administration .  Rechal lenge (the original study drug was 
restarted) is not required, or any of the following:  
 Has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug  
 The event has a plausible biologic link to the activity of the study drug  
 Not readily explained by [CONTACT_3813]  
 Not readily explained by [CONTACT_3814]  
 Improves on discontinuation of study drug  
 If study drug has been discontinued, may recur or reintroduction of study drug  
ACTION TAKE N 
STUDY DRUG  DOSE MODIFICATION*  
 Dose Not Changed – The dose or regimen of th e study drug  was not changed.  
 Dose Increased – The dose or regimen of study drug was increased .  
 Dose Decreased – The dose or regimen of study drug was decreased . 
 Drug Interrupted – Administration of the study drug  was stopped temporarily . 
 Drug Withdrawn – Administration of the study drug  was stopped permanently and not 
restarted . 
 Unknown – Changes to the administration of the study drug  cannot be determined . 
 Not Applicable  
NOTE:  Only the last study drug action should be recorded in the eCRF.  For example, if the 
study drug is withdrawn and then the decision is made to restart, the dose modification of “Drug 
interrupted” should be reported on the SAE form.  
OUTCOME  
 Fatal – The study subject died . 
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved – The AE was ongoing  at the  time of death or at the time 
the subject was lost to follow up.  
 Recovered/Resolved – The AE resolved . 
 Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae – The AE is conside red resolved ; however , there is 
residual sequelae.   Some events do not return to baseline, such as me tastasis or 
progression of disease; however, once these events are determined by [CONTACT_3815].  TIP-PH-101 Protocol Amendment 2

Version Date 02 April 2020  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 be stable or chronic, the Investigator may consider the event to be resolved or resolved 
with sequelae.  
 Recovering/Resolving – The AE is improving but is n ot yet completely 
recovered/resolved . 
 Unknown – The outcome o f the AE cannot be determined.

Confidential  7  Trial Design:  
ELI-002-[ADDRESS_852111] s with KRAS /neuroblastoma ras viral oncogene homolog ( NRAS ) mutated PDAC and other 
solid tumors who are at high risk for relapse (ie, presence of isolated tumor cells as detected by 
[CONTACT_637598]’s body, in which the primary tumor has 
been removed and is currently without clinical signs of disease ). For this protocol, high relapse risk  is 
defined by [CONTACT_5640] a  ctDNA -positive result , or elevated serum tumor biomarker (such as  CA19 -9, CEA, 
or CA -125).  
This Phase 1 (dose escalation) trial comprise s an open -label, single arm, dose -escalation trial 
incorporating a 3+[ADDRESS_852112] s with mutant KRAS  (mKRAS) /muta nt NRAS  (mNRAS ) solid 
tumors (PDAC, CRC, non-small cell lung cancer [ NSCLC ], ovarian, cholangiocarcinoma  [CCA ] and 
gallbladder carcinoma).  
Approximately  [ADDRESS_852113] s are planned to  be enrolled in the dose escalation  to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability , and exploratory pharmacodynamic efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) ELI -002 using the 
adjuvant at 3 planned dose levels (Amph -CpG -7909 0.1  mg SC, 0.5  mg SC, 2.5  mg SC) in 
combination with a fixed dose of Amph -Peptides (700  μg each).  Additional cohorts may be added to 
explore  intermediate or higher dose levels  based on the cumulative  safety review and preliminary 
review of pharmacodynam ic responses . If additional cohorts are added, this will be documented in a 
study memo sent to all clinical sites and submitted to IRBs, per IRB guidance.  
During the dose escalation  study , ELI -[ADDRESS_852114] containing all 7 Amph -Peptides (G12D, 
G12R, G12V, G12A, G12C, G12S, G13D) admixed with Amph -CpG -7909 (ELI -002 7P)  in future 
clinical trials . 
Subject s in Phase 1 will receive the initial dose of ELI -002 2P and be monitored for 24 hours in 
order to assess for potential AEs such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). In addition , there will  also 
be a [ADDRESS_852115] s. In 
the absence of toxicity during the dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment window, the ELI-002 2P 
dose will be escalated. Planned cohort dose levels are listed below:  
• Cohort 1 : Dose Level 1: Amph -CpG -7909 0.1 mg with Amph -Peptides  
• Cohort 2 : Dose Level 2: Amph -CpG -7909 0.5 mg with Amph -Peptides  
• Cohort 3 : Dose Level 3: Amph -CpG -[ADDRESS_852116] s (the number will depend on whether DLTs are observed). In 
order to ensure an adequate number of evaluable subject s, up to [ADDRESS_852117] s at this dose level.  
Dose escalation from one cohort to the next will be determined by [CONTACT_28749] 
(SMC), and will be based on treatment -emergent AEs, clinical laboratory data, physical examination  
(PE) findings including vital signs, after all subject s within a cohort have completed [ADDRESS_852118]  in each cohort. The SMC 
will review all available long -term safety information from prior cohorts (if any), so that the SMC 
will consi der the totality of the safety information in their recommendation.  
In any cohort, if none of the subject s experience a DLT during the first [ADDRESS_852119] s in a cohort experiences a DLT, then 
3 (or 2, if 4 were originally enrolled) additional subject s will be enrolled at the same dose level.  If 
[ADDRESS_852120] 28 days, then this dose will be considered the toxic dose. The trial may proceed 
at a lower dose, at a less frequent schedule, or omitting the Amph -CpG -7909 adjuvant while 
continuing to administer the Amph -Peptides, based on emerging toxicity or pharmacodynamic data 
until the MTD is determined.  
A trial memo will be sent to all sites following each SMC cohort review meeting  summarizing the 
decision ; if additional cohorts are to be enrolled, the dose level and schedule will be provided.  
The RP2D will be defined in consideration of the MTD (if any), safety data, and pharmacodynamic 
data.  The RP2D will be communicated to all sites in a trial memo following the last SMC cohort 
review.   
Subject  replacement : If a subject  discontinues for any reason other than toxicity prior to completing 
[ADDRESS_852121] s per 
cohort complete 28 days of ELI -002 therapy.  
DLT definition : A DLT will be defined as any event at least possibly related to ELI -002 as follows:  
a. Any Grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic toxicity except asymptomatic laboratory abnormalities 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
b. Any Grade ≥ 3 toxicity involving major organ systems for greater than 72 hours and 
occurring within 28 days of subcutaneous administration  
c. Grade 3 CRS that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days  
d. Any Grade 4 CRS that does not improve to < Grade 2 within 72 hours  
e. Any Grade ≥ 3 autoimmune disorder  
f. Any Grade ≥ 3 rash that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 7 days with appropriate 
treatment  
The DLT observation period will be 28 days . 
MTD definition : The MTD is defined as the highest dose level with a DLT incidence <33% of cohort 
subject s. 
The trial will consist of a Screening Period, an Immunization Period, a No Dosing [ADDRESS_852122] dose  and at additional timepoints until radiographic relapse is 
observed.  
The central laboratory  will confirm ≥1 of 2 mutant KRAS /NRAS  alleles targeted by [CONTACT_637599] -002 Amph -
Peptides 2P  (G12D, and G12 R,) is present and central lab oratory  ctDNA must be positive  or there 
must be serum tumor biomarker (such as  CA19 -9, CEA, and CA -125) elevation  at ≥[ADDRESS_852123] administration of adjuvant therapy (whichever comes last in the specific 
subject treatment plan ). These data are required for determination of eligibility and inclusion into the 
trial.  
Immunologic biomarkers of response may include HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], serum cytokines, ICS, Fluorospot , 
dextramer+ T cells for subjects with appropriate HLA alleles will be determined when matching 
dextramer/s is/are available.  
Local laboratories  will be utilized for serum cytokine testing , tumor biomarkers 
CA19 -9/CEA /CA-125 (as appropriate per tumor type) , tumor biopsy assays (such as biomarker 
sequencing and/or IHC assays) and all other safety laborator y tests .

Confidential  9  Central laboratories  will be utilized for  ctDNA analysis, HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell ( PBMC ) isolation and immunogenicity assessment (such as  Fluorospot , ICS, and/or T cell 
dextramer testing ) as detailed in the central laboratory manual . 
While HLA testing will be performed prior to first dose at Visit 3 , cohorts will be enrolled regardless 
of the HLA subtype.  
Discontinuation of Trial Treatment: Subject s with confirmed radiographic relapse (using iRECIST 
criteria; not judged as pseudoprogression) during treatment with ELI -002 will discontinue  trial 
treatment but should continue other trial -related procedures  in the follow -up period .  
The design of the Phase 1 trial is outlined in the following figure.

Duration of Treatment: The total duration of participation for each subject  is approximately  [ADDRESS_852134] s who remain in the trial until the end of the required  Follow -up Period may be eligible to 
enroll in an Extension Protocol . 
Reference Therapy, Dosage and Mode of Administration: None  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety: Adverse events will be recorded and categorized using CTCAE, Version 5. If observed, 
CRS/ICANS will be recorded and managed according to the  American Society for Transplantation 
and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT ) consensus criteria.  
Standard clinical chemistry and hematology assays, PEs, vital sign measurements, 
electrocardiograms, and ECOG performance status will be assessed/performed at specified times 
during the trial.   
A SMC comprised of the site investigators, sponsor medical monitor, drug safety and clinical 
operations, will meet for each dose escalation.  The SMC will have the authority to assess and 
ELI-[ADDRESS_852135] s in the trial.  
Efficacy: Median RFS and [ADDRESS_852136] criteria; 
subject s will be followed for OS. In addition, biomarker ( ctDNA  or serum tumor biomarker)  response 
rate will be based on the percentage of subject s achieving biomarker  reduction or clearance , as 
measured by [CONTACT_637600],  and the duration of biomarker reduction 
and/or  clearance  will be recorded.  
Immunogenicity:  Patients will have leukapheresis and blood samples drawn to evaluate the 
immunogenicity of ELI -002. T cell responses in PBMCs will be assessed by [CONTACT_637601] Fluorospot , ICS, and/or dextramers. Serum cytokine, CEA, CA-[ADDRESS_852137] of care tumor biopsies:  may be collected post -dose per iRECIST, and if there is sufficient 
tumor tissue collected, will be assayed at the local laboratory to examine tumor -infiltrating T cells and 
the tumor microenvironment. Potential assays could include in situ gene expression  and/or IHC.  
Statistical Methods:  Descriptive statistics will be generated to summarize demographic, medical 
history, and safety data.  
As a general approach, continuous variables will be summarized using mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum value, maximum value. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency 
counts and percentages. Time to event data will be summarized usin g the Kaplan -Meier method. 
Where appropriate, confidence intervals around point estimates will be presented, and estimates of the 
median and other quantiles, as well as individual time points (for time to event data) will be produced.  
All statistical hypothesis testing within (for change from baseline) and between dose cohorts will be 
conducted at the [ADDRESS_852138] dose.  No formal tests of hypotheses are 
planned for safe ty analyses .  
Immunogenicity analyses: A positive immune response for each KRAS /NRAS  peptide will be 
determined, for example, using a non -parametric distribution -free resampling method with the 
Fluorospot  assay.  T cell responses to ELI -[ADDRESS_852139] OF

ELI-[ADDRESS_852148] s, visual 
identification of sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is accomplished by [CONTACT_637604], targeting these compounds to draining lymph nodes. Amphiphiles 
were developed as an approach to improve the potency and s afety of vaccination by [CONTACT_637605] r a payload to lymph node 
antigen -presenting cells  (APCs)  [Liu et al ., 2014 ]. Initial studies showed that amphiphiles 
markedly increase lymph node accumulation and decrease systemic dissemination relative to 
their parent soluble compounds, leading to 30 -fold increases in T -cell priming and enhanced 
anti-tumor efficacy with reduce d systemic toxicity. Subsequently investigation of the mechanism 
of action of amphiphiles using Batf3 knockout mice determined that the pharmacology requires 
cross -presenting dendritic cells in lymph nodes, and that combinations of amphiphiles with 
tumor -antigen -targeting antibodies, cytokines, and checkpoint inhibition using PD1 antibodies 
were  able to destroy large established transplanted and genetically induced tumors in mice curing 
a majority of cancers in experimental settings previously considered in tractable [ Moynihan et al ., 
2016 ]. Most recently, amphiphile combinations with chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T cells 
demonstrated potent enhancement of their activity including modulation of their phenotype to 
increase the proportion of central memory T cells, to extend the longevity of these cells, and to 
confer the ability to induce antigen spreading, whic h together led to cures of the majority of 
tumors in the models studied [ Ma et al ., 2019 ; Singh and June, 2019 ].  
For the first clinical translation of the amphiphile technology, Elicio is developi[INVESTIGATOR_637542] -002, a

Confidential  25  Structurally, each amphiphile (Amph) component is a fusion comprised of 3 domains:  
• Two 18-carbon acyl lipid s that mediates association with albumin to facilitate 
trafficking to the lymph nodes and permits cell membrane insertion;  
• A flexible linker that improves pharmaceutical properties  in Amph -Peptides ; the 
flexible linker is omitted in Amph -CpG -7909 ;  
• A bioactive peptide or oligonucleotide.   
Results of in vivo preclinical pharmacology studies show ed that the greatest  T cell responses to 
mKRAS peptides  were achieved when the animals were administered Amph -Peptide(s) in 
combination with Amph -CpG adjuvant . The [ADDRESS_852149] been 
previously evaluated in humans (without amphiphile modification) and were observed to be safe 
and well tolerated after subcutaneous (SC) administra tion in studies sponsored by [CONTACT_637606]

ELI-[ADDRESS_852150]. Moynihan et 
al reported that the immunogenicity of peptide vaccines could be increased by [CONTACT_637607], where T -cell responses generated  using the amphiphile  approach  were 
increased compared to soluble controls [Moynihan et al, 2018 ] (see Section  4.6.2 ). 
This protocol , ELI -002-001, describes a First-in-Human trial to evaluate safety and tolerability  of 
ELI-[ADDRESS_852151] s with KRAS/NRAS mutated  solid tumors . Subject s will 
be treated and evaluated for safety and efficacy of ELI -002 compris ed of 1.4 mg Amph modified 
KRAS peptides  (0.7 mg per Amph -Peptide ) admixed  with escalating doses of the Amph 
modified CpG oligonucleotide adjuvant Amph -CpG -7909. The ELI -002 admixture is prepared

With an estimated number of 60,430 new cases in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) in [ADDRESS_852153] lethal cancers, as 
indicated by [CONTACT_637610] 48,220  (~80% ) [Siegel et al, 2020 ]. PDAC is the third leading 
cause of cancer death [ Siegel et al, 202 1], with 133,300 estimated deaths for 2018 in the US and 
Europe [Malvezzi  et al, 2018 ]. 
ELI-002  Protocol ELI -002-001

Confidential  26  Surgery (pancreatectomy) is the only curative option in PDAC. Even with surgery, prognosis 
remains poor due to the high propensity of the tumor for loco -regional and hepatic recurrence. In 
the National Cancer Database population, the [ADDRESS_852154] s undergoing 
pancreatectomy was only 23. 3% [Sener et al, 1999 ]. Therefore, surgery alone is clearly an 
inadequate approach to achieve long -term disease control in subject s with resectable PDAC. 
Historical  use of adjuvant  therapy with gemcitabine, or FOLFIRINOX combination 
chemotherapy  improved the disease -free survival (DFS)  and overall survival  (OS)  outcomes for 
subject s with resectable disease, but the majority of these subject s relapse d and die d from 
recurrent disease [ Conroy et al, 2018 ; Oettle et al, 2007 ]. Contemporary neoadjuvant therapy 
with FOLFIRINOX -based neoadjuvant therapy is a standard approach for locally advanced 
pancreatic cancer since it has been shown to improve the surgical resection rates and clinical 
outcomes in locally advanced PDAC [ Chawla and Ferrone, 201 9], and promising  phase 2 data 
with neoadjuvant gemcitabine/nab -paclitaxel  [Philip  et al,  2020 ] indicate that an alternative 
regimen has activity.  Fluoropyrimidine -based chemoradiatio n may be used as well [NCCN 
PDAC guidelines Version 1.202 2]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], there is a need for improved adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_637543] s who have undergone pancreatic resection surgery as survival rates for pancreatic 
cancer have mostly remained unchanged since the 1970s [ Ansari et al, 2016 ; Macdonald and 
Mair, 2016 ].  
PDAC is a disease that is almost entirely related to KRAS  mutations. The  KRAS  gene encodes the 
KRAS protein, which is a small (21 kDA) guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that functions as a 
simple binary ON –OFF molecular switch, cycling between active GTP -bound and inactive 
guanosine diphosphate (GDP) -bound states [ Vigil  et al, 2010 ]. Cancer -associated  RAS genes 
contain missense mutations that encode single amino acid substitutions  primarily (98%) at 1 of 3 
mutational hot spots: glycine -12 (G12), glycine -13 (G13), or glutamine -61 (Q61) [ Waters and 
Der, 2018 ]. These mutations render KRAS persistently GTP -bound and constitutively active, 
resulting in overstimulation of effector signaling pathways to drive cancer growth.  
The majority of  KRAS  mutations occur at codon 12. A conversion of the amino acid glycine (G) 
to aspartic acid (D) at this site (KRAS G12D) is the most frequent KRAS mutant in human 
gastrointestinal cancers and has been identified in approximately 33% to 52% of pancreatic 
cancers [ Biankin  et al 2012; Hendifar  et al 2020; Guo et al 2020 ] and 34% to 37% of CRCs 
[Gong  et al 2017; Prior et al, 2012 ; Price et al, 2020 ]. KRAS G12D plays a vital role in the 
control of tumor metabolism  [Vigil  et al, 2010 ].  
In addition to G12D, there are 5 other clinically relevant but less frequently identified mutants 
with amino acid substitutions at the same site (G12V, G12R, G12A, G12S, and G12C) an d 1 
peptide with a mutation at codon 13 (G13D). After G12D, G12V mutation is the next most 
frequent mutation in PDAC, identified in about 3 6% of these tumors, followed by G12R (about 
12% of mutations)  [Biankin  et al, 2012 ]. The remaining codon 12 mutations (G12A, G12C , and 
G12S) each account for about 3 % to 4% of PDAC -associated codon 12 KRAS mutations [ Prior 
et al, 2012 ]. G13D is the most frequent codon 13 mutation but is only identified in <1% of 
PDAC  tumors . 
Administration of a combination of these peptides provides coverage for multiple potential 
mutations that might be present.

Confidential  27  Circulating tumor  deoxyribonucleic acid  DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker in the 
management of many cancers, including breast, colorectal  [Bettegowda et al, 2014 ; Reinert et al, 
2019 ; Tie et al, 2016 ; Tie et al, 2019 ], non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  [Abbosh et al, 2017 ], 
bile duct [ Jense n et al, 2020 ], and pancreatic cancers [Diaz and Bardelli, 2014 ; Lee, Lipton,  et al, 
2019 ]. 
In the metastatic setting, PDAC subject s with positive MRD, as measured by [CONTACT_637611] [Perets et al, 2018 ]. Presence of MRD pre -surgery predicted for poor 
outcomes . Similarly, measurement of mKRAS ctDNA identifies PDAC subjects who have 
undergone pancreatectomy but are at high risk of recurrence . For example , persistence of ctDNA  
immediately following the postoperative period was associated with a high rate of recurrence and  
shorter  median recurrence -free survival (5 months)  than those without detectable postoperative 
ctDNA (15 m onths) [ Groot et al, 2019 ]. Similar data were obtained by [CONTACT_227976] a prospective 
cohort in Australasia who underwent surgery and adjuvant gemcitabine -based chemotherapy; 
ctDNA [ADDRESS_852155] -surgery was assessed [Lee, Lipton,  et al., 2019 ]. In this study, ctDNA 
detection post -surgery had 100% positive predictive value at a median follow -up of 38.4 months; 
ctDNA predicted relapse free ( hazard ratio [ HR]: 5.4; 95%  confidence interval  [CI]: 1.9-15.2; 
p<0.0001) . Likewise, high pre -operative ctDNA levels associated with shorter overall survival 
(HR: 2.8, 95% CI: 1.8 -4.6, p  = 0.001) and were an independent prognostic factor compared to 
pathologic features of pancreatic cancer in multivariate analysis of an operable pancreatic cancer 
patient cohort [Singh et al., 2015 ]. Subjects  who remain ctDNA positive  despi[INVESTIGATOR_637544]  a high-risk population.  
Likewise, multiple studies have shown the prognostic value of postsurgical serum carbohydrate 
antigen 19 -9 (CA19 -9), with failure to normalize correlating with early recurrence. Most patients 
are assessable for CA19 -9, with the exception of 5 -10% of the po pulation who lack Lewis blood 
antigen expression and cannot synthesize the sialylated carbohydrate. For example, in a 
retrospective analysis of 525 patients, postsurgical elevations in CA19 -9 predicted subsequent 
radiographic relapse [ Rieser et al., 2018 ]. In a Japanese cohort of 119 patients who completed 
adjuvant chemotherapy, median relapse -free survival ( RFS) was significantly shorter in patients 
with CA19 -9 above the upper limit of normal (ULN) versus those with lower levels (10.4 vs 
29.6 months, p<0.001), median overall survival was also shorter (24.7 vs 92.1 months; p<0.001), 
and CA19 -9 was an independent prognostic factor ( HR: 2.72) associated with short RFS [ Imaoka 
et al., 2016 ]. Prospective studies have also found that postoperative CA19 -9 predicts overall 
survival: among 385 RTOG9704 patients, those with a CA19 -9 ≥90 U/mL had a 3 -year survival 
of 2%, whereas those with CA19 -9 <90 U/mL had a 3 -year survival of 32% [ Berger et al., 2008 ]. 
In Protocol ELI -002-201, subjects in the Phase 1 cohort will be enrolled based on high risk 
ctDNA or serum tumor biomarkers.  
Activating KRAS mutations turn on canonical cancer -related pathways but also contribute to 
extensive metabolic reprogramming of pancreatic cancer cells. KRAS is mutated in >90% of 
PDACs and is a well -validated driver of not only initiation but also PDAC gr owth and 
maintenance [ Eser et al, 2014 ]. Recently , FDA approval of  small molecule s targeting KRASG12C 
such as Sotorasib  [Hong et al ., 2020 ] suggest it may be possible to target cysteine containing 
KRAS alleles, however G12D and G12V are predominate in pancreatic cancer, and non G12C 
alleles are also common in colorectal and NSCLC, making it clear that additional 
immunotherapy strategies are urgently needed.   
ELI-[ADDRESS_852156], Palmer  et al utilized a vaccine containing the same mKRAS 
peptides present in ELI -002. P rolonged survival was observed in one quarter (8 of 32) of the 
pancreatic cancer subject s that underwent resection surgery and were immunized; this trial also 
provided evidence that humans can mount T -cell response s against KRAS peptides  and 
established a dosing schedule that was the basis for the design of the ELI -002-001 trial [Palmer 
et al,  2020 ]. Thus, KRAS directed vaccines represent a promising strategy  to target this lethal 
cancer .  
ELI-002 is well suited to pancreatic cancer since it covers common mutations in KRAS that are 
present in the majority of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases. A large comprehensive trial of 
3,594  pancreatic tumor samples submitted for analysis at Foundation Medicine (Cambridge, 
MA) has recently been published [ Singhi et al, 2019 ]. In this analysis 3,150 of the 3,594 (88%) 
tumors harbored an mKRAS allele. Similar high prevalence of mKRAS was evident in the 
international consortium trial of US, Australian, and Canadian pancreatic tumors where 93% of 
142 tumors had exon  2 mutations  (Table  4); 46% were G12D, 36% were G12V, and 1 2% were 
G12R [ Biankin et al, 2012 ]. The proportion and specific mKRAS alleles identified are consistent 
across studies, as confirmed by [CONTACT_637612] , where 93% (140 of 150) 
tumors harbored mKRAS including 44% that were G12D, 29% that were G12V, and 20% that 
were G12R [ Cancer Genome Atlas Network et al, 2017 ]. Likewise , the Johns Hopkin’s cohort 
identified KRAS mutations in 96% (49 of 51 pancreatic tumors), with 42% G12D, 27% G12V, 
21% G12R, 6% G13D and 2% G12C [Sausen et al., 2015 ] and a German trial identified KRAS 
mutations in 79% (141 of 179 pancreatic tumors); 49% were G12D, 34% G12V, 14%  G12R and 
2% G12C [ Haas et al, 2017 ].  
Therefore, the majority of pancreatic cancer subjects are anticipated to have a KRAS mutation 
appropriate for ELI -002-[ADDRESS_852157] undergone 
pancreatic resection surgery.

Confidential  29  4.1.2.  Colorectal Cancer  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Introduction  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading 
cause of cancer death in the US. In 2018, 97,[ADDRESS_852158] been diagnosed. During the same year, an estimated 50,630 
people died of colon and rectal cancers combined [Miller et al; 2019 ; Siegel et al, 2020 ]. 
Non metastatic colon cancer is generally treated with curative intent by [CONTACT_637613], in many 
cases, adjuvant chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with CRC depends on the stage at 
diagnosis: the 5 -year survival rate is up to 90% for stage I, but only <15% for advanced stages. 
Over half of the cases are diagnosed at a higher stage of disease (III and IV). Treatment usually 
involves the complete primary tumor resection and appropriate chemotherapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adjuvant Therapy in the Case of Localized CRC Disease  
Adjuvant therapy confers a survival advantage in patients with stage III or high -risk stage II 
resected colon cancer. High risk stage II colon cancer are defined as stage T4 tumor, poor 
differentiation, cancer embolus, lymph node harvested number less than 12 and obstruction or 
perforation,  baseline carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) >5 ng/L , large vessel invasion, perineural 
invasion, and extramural vascular invasion [Amri et al, 201 6]. 
For patients with high -risk stage II or stage III colon cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy with  
fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin reduces the risk of recurrence and death by [CONTACT_3450] 30%. 
Oxaliplatin is associated with peripheral neurotoxicity. Consideration of disease stage and 
pathologic features, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, toxicity profiles, and patient age, 
comorbidities, aid in decision -making regarding the use of adjuvan t therapy.  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guidelines are based on the IDEA study, 
published in 2018, an academic collaboration of clinicians and statisticians who were involved in 
6 randomized, Phase 3 clinical trials enrolling in 12,834 patients with stage III colon cancer in 
12 countries . The 3-year rates of DFS were 74.6% in the 3 -month adjuvant therapy group as 
compared with 75.5% in the 6 -month therapy group. The 3 -year rates of DFS were 64.4% in 
high-risk patients: T4 (61.8%), or N2 (61.4%) [Grothey et al, 2018 ].  
Tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage were grouped together to make a pragmatic choice between 
low-risk (T1 –T3,N1) and high -risk (T4 and/or N2). A difference of approximately 20% at 
3 years was shown between these cancers.  
According to the NCCN Guidelines for patients with low -risk stage III disease (T1 –3,N1), the 
preferred regimen is CAPEOX for 3 months or FOLFOX for 3 to 6 months. For patients with 
high-risk stage III disease (T4,N1 –N2 or any T and N2), the preferred regim en is CAPEOX for 
3 to 6 months or FOLFOX for 6  months. Other options include capecitabine (6 months) and 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 6  months  [Grothey et al, 2018 ]. 
After adjuvant cytotoxic therapy, no  further treatment is recommended. Circulating tumor DNA 
is positive in 28.6%  defining a subgroup of  high-risk Stage II (T4N0) and a 39.4% subgroup of 
high-risk Stage III (T4, N1 or T Any, N2) patients [ Kasi et al, 2020 ].

Confidential  30  [IP_ADDRESS].  Rectal Cancer  
Patients with rectal cancer were specifically excluded from these  studies because of potential 
toxicity and the confounding impact of radiotherapy . 
Although conclusive data on the benefits of adjuvant therapy in patients with stage II/III rectal 
cancer are lacking, the NCCN panel recommends its use. Choice of regimen depends on initial 
clinical staging and predicted circumferential resection margin st atus during excision surgery 
(such as total mesorectal excision ). Pathologic evaluation of the resection margin on the excised 
rectum has been considered important for determining the risk of local recurrence.  A margin of 
≤1 mm is considered by [CONTACT_637614] a negative prognostic factor for local recurrence [Benson et 
al, 2018 ]. 
FOLFOX or CAPEOX are preferred  adjuvant regimens, with 5 -FU/leucovorin or capecitabine 
used in some circumstances, such as when strong neoadjuvant responses to [ADDRESS_852159] options for rectal cancer  [NCCN 
rectal cancer guidelines V 1.2022]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Colorectal Liver Metastases  
Aside from localized CRC , up to 25% of patients with CRC  present with simultaneous 
metastases and the liver is frequently the only metastatic site.  
Approximately 35%  to 55% of patients will develop hepatic metastases during the course of their 
disease. In some cases, colorectal liver metastases are resectable, ie , an R0 resection can be 
performed, leaving at least a 20 % to 25% of total liver volume as fu ture liver remn ant. Surgical 
resection represents the only chance of long -term survival [Akgu l et al, 2014 ]. 
Preoperative factors found to be independent predictors of poor survival are a primary tumor at 
stage T4, ≥[ADDRESS_852160] liver metastasis ≥5  cm in diameter, and a serum CEA 
level ≥5  ng/m L. According to these factors, resectable patients could be divided in high -risk 
patients (3 or more factors) and low -risk patients (less than 3 factors)  [Adam, et al, 2012 ]. 
The optimal sequencing of systemic therapy and resection in colorectal liver metastases  remain 
unclear. Most studies report on  perioperative (neoadjuvant plus postoperative) systemic therapy 
[Krell et al, 2019 ], with some series reporting on patients with resectable disease who undergo 
resection first, followed by [CONTACT_637615].  
A 2012 meta -analysis identified 3 randomized clinical trials comparing surgery alone to surgery 
plus systemic therapy. The analysis showed a benefit of chemotherapy in progression -free 
survival  and DFS but not in OS. Another meta -analysis combined data on 1 ,896 patients and also 
found that perioperative chemotherapy improved DFS but not OS [Ciliberto et al, 2012 ]. 
In high -risk patients, perioperative combination chemotherapy should be administered. Those 
who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a better median OS (38.9  months  versus  
28.4 months ) than those had not received it, and 5  years OS rate of 39% v ersus  33% ( p=0.028). 
In low -risk patients, no significant  difference in median survival (60.0  m versus  60.0 m) was 
observed.  
ELI-[ADDRESS_852161] 
of the treatment recommendations for metastatic colorectal liver dis ease also apply to the 
treatment of colorectal pulmonary metastases.  
Colon, rectal , and oligometastatic CRC  patients who show minimal residual DNA on ctDNA 
analysis with no radiographic evidence of disease following  prior surgery and 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, will be eligible to participate in this protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Frequency of KRAS and NRAS Mutations  in CRC  
KRAS genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_637545]  (WT)  or KRAS mutated.  
Since 2008, anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR ) therapy is restricte d to KRAS WT 
patients as it has been shown that KRAS mutated tumors do not respond [Boeckx et al, 2015 ; 
Modest et al, 2016 ]. 
KRAS mutations occur in approximately 40% of the cases, especially in exon 2, codons 12 
(70%-80%) and 13 (15 %-20%)  (Table  5) [Gong et al, 2017 ; Zhang et al, 2015 ; Prior et al, 2012 ; 
Price et al, 2020 ]. In exon 2, mutations are common in codons 12: G12D, G12V, G12C and 
G12A. Much less frequent KRAS mutations are mainly located in exon 3, codons 59 –61, and in 
exon 4, codons 117 and 146  [Afrasanie et al, 2019 ]. 
Since the amino acid sequence surrounding positions [ADDRESS_852162]  and are effective in targeting 
mNRAS at the same amino acids [Chatani and Yang , 2020 ]. NRAS mutations also occur in CRC  
in approximately 4% of cases, also in exon 2, codons 12 and 13 [ Douillard et al , 2013 ; Summers 
et al, 2017 ; Zhang et al, 2015 ]. Therefore, ELI -002 can  additionally  target NRAS mutations at 
positions 12 and 13 .

Confidential  32  The full analysis of the RAS gene exons 2, 3 , and 4 revealed that these mutations correlate with 
certain typi[INVESTIGATOR_637546], pathological and molecular features. The mutations of exon 2 and codon 
12 are associated with the well/ moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma subtype and the 
mucinous subtype [Dobre et al, 2015 ]. 
Limited data is available evaluating the possible prognostic role of mKRAS  at the initiation of 
the treatm ent. One study showed that patients with KRAS mutation who presented with stage IV 
had a higher mortality rate (34% versus 18.5%) and reduced OS (23.5 months versus 14 months) 
compared to patients without this mutation. Also, the presence of the KRAS m utation was found 
to be an independent risk factor for reduced survival [Heinemann et al, 2009 ].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Importance of ctDNA  and CEA  Assessment and Follow -up in CRC  
Different authors reported that the detection of ctDNA  in CRC patients with stage I, II, or III 
after treatment was associated with a shorter survival and disease recurrence. Patients with 
higher levels of mutant ctDNA and higher mutation loads for the detected mutations 
in KRAS  or BRAF  genes evinced shorter OS. Diehl et al observed that CRC patients with 
detectable ctDNA after surgery  generally relapsed within 1 year and considered ctDNA as a 
highly specific biomarker of tumor dynamics. This might indicate that ctDNA levels in plasma 
after surgery represent a  reliable marker of residual disease [Diehl et al, 2008 ]. Subsequent 
studies have now confirmed the utility of serial ctDNA sampling for  relapse prediction. Reinert 
et al observed a 2  to 15 (mean 10) months lead time on detection of metastatic recurrence 
compared to conventional follow -up [Reinert et al, 2016 ].  
These all support the further development of ctDNA as a biomarker for the detection of early 
diseases and MRD  following curative resection, relapse assessment, treatment response, and the 
development of chemoresistance  [Vymetalkova et al, 2018 ]. Fan et al systematically  review ed 
comprehensive data from published studies and showed that a ctDNA -positive status after 
treatment was associated with a worse prognosis [Fan et al, 201 7].  
In addition, ctDNA assessment using  a personalized ctDNA  method  for [ADDRESS_852164] confirmed the association with relapse and allow precise 
definition of the risk subgroups. High risk stage 2 (T4N0 with MRD rate 28.6%), high risk stage 
3 (T4N1 -2; TanyN2 with MRD rate 39.4%) and surgically resected oligometastatic patients 
(MRD rate 49%) have high rates  of ctDNA detection indicating their unmet need for effective 
therapy  [Kasi et al  2020 ]. In a prospective, multicohort study  [Tarazona et al, 2020 ] with [ADDRESS_852165]+ status after adjuvant chemotherapy was determined using a personalized 
ctDNA assay,  all MRD+ patients relapsed and the association was strongly statistically 
correlated (HR : 27.9; 95% CI : 9.2-85.1 months ; p<0.0001). Another study in a cohort of 230 
patients with Stage II colon cancer further confirmed that a plasma -based ctDNA  analysis 
predicts recurrence  [Tie et al, 2016 ]. Patients who were ctDNA positive postoperatively were at 
extremely high risk of radiologic recurrence (HR 18) and ctDNA positivity immediately after 
completion of chemotherapy was associated with poorer RFS (HR 11).  Postsurgical ctDNA 
analy sis using a plasma -based ctDNA assay  in [ADDRESS_852166] + status  was associated with inferior  RFS [Tie et al, 2019 ].  
Likewise, the association between elevations in serum CEA with relapse following surgery and 
adjuvant chemotherapy in colorectal cancer was examined in a large patient series. The

Netherlands, evaluated recurrence outcomes in patients followed with usual care versus patients 
with intensified follow -up, including CEA monitoring every 8 weeks, with mor e frequent 
monitoring if the CEA value was >2.5 ng/mL or if there was a 20% increase compared with the 
previous value. The results showed that with the intensified follow -up protocol a significantly 
higher proportion of radiographic relapse was detected co mpared with usual care (odds ratio: 1.8; 
95% CI: 1.33 -2.50; p=0.0004), indicating earlier detection [ Verberne et al., 2015 ; Verberne et 
al., 2017 ]. A Memorial Sloan Kettering review of 728 R0 resected patients showed that 
individual CEA measurements above a threshold of 15  ng/mL had a low (2%) false positive rate, 
and no elevations above 35 ng/mL were false positive [ Litvak et al., 2014 ].

[IP_ADDRESS].  Colorectal Cancer and Vaccines  
Approaches under investigation to  further improving therapy are vaccination s with peptides 
alone, peptide -expressing viruses, peptide -loaded APCs  or application of peptide -specific 
T cells.  
In the process of cancer development mutations resulting in neoantigens can emerge in every 
coding region of the DNA. Neoantigens caused by [CONTACT_637616]. Early approaches could prove that peptides derived from mKRAS can stimulate cytotoxic 
T-lymphocytes  in vitro  [Gedde -Dahl , 1994] as well as in CRC  [Shono et al, 2003 ]. A subsequent 
study  also investigated the cytotoxic activity of mKRAS peptide -induced cytotoxic 
T lymphocytes  [Khleif et al, 1999 ]. Only 2 of 10 CRC patients showed induction of 
peptide -specific CD8+ but in addition, these cytotoxic T cells were able to lyse HLA -A2-positive 
target cells incubated with the 10 -mer mutant peptide. Similar results were obtained in a 
xenograft study, where peptide -specific T cells were able to delay the growth of KRAS -mutant 
pancreatic tumors [Wang,  et al, 2016 ]. 
In vaccination trials with peptides derived from mKRAS, there were early indications of 
potential clinical benefits for patients. Two of 7 CRC patients had an immune response  to a 
mKRAS peptide vaccin e, and vaccination correlated to DFS [Toubaji et al, 2008 ]; the treatment 
was well tolerated with no serious systemic effects and Grade  1 to 2 reactogenicity . One of 4 GI 
tumor patients , an individual with CRC, exhibited induction of G12D -specific T cells in response 
to mRNA vaccine administration [ Cafri, et al., 2020 ]. In a case report, 1 CRC patient was treated 
with activated T cells recognizing G12D KRAS [Tran, et al, 2016 ]. After a single infusion, all 7 
lung metastases regressed until 1 metastatic lesion progressed  at 9 months. This patient 
underwent surgical resection for the single relapsed site and has now been in ongoing remission 
for >4 years [Chatani and Yang , 2020 ]. 
To further enhance the immunological response in CRC patients, Rahma et al combined the 
peptide vaccination of mKRAS with IL -2 or granulocyte -macrophage colony -stimulating factor  
(GM -CSF)  [Rahma , 2014 ]. The strongest immune response could be detected in the group with 
GM-CSF as adjuvant; all CRC patients had an increase in interferon gamma (IFN) producing, 
specifically -activated T cells. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_637547], no ne of these advanced 
metastatic  patient s showed clinical response and disease progressed in all cases.

Confidential  34  4.1.3.  Non-small Cell Lung Cancer  
NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the [LOCATION_002], with a n estimated incidence  
in 2021 of over 235,000  and estimated  deaths of over 131,000  [Siegel et al., 202 1]. While 
surgically treated patients with Stage 1A enjoy long -term disease -free survival, relapse is 
common following surgery for Stage  1B, II, or IIIA disease, with 30%, 60%, and 75% mortality 
[Ravdin 2006 ]. However, neither adjuvant chemotherapy [ Strauss et al., 2008 ] nor radiation 
therapy [PORT Meta-analysis Trialists G roup, 2005 ] improves overall survival for IB tumors. 
For Stage II tumors, meta -analysis of multiple trials [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_556675]., 2008 ] supports a modest 
adjuvant chemotherapy benefit (HR 0.89 , 95% CI, 0.82 –0.96; p= 0.005); similar benefit was 
observed in neoadjuvant meta -analysis  [Burdett et al., 2007 ], and radiation appears to shorten 
rather than benefit survival outcome [PORT Meta -analysis Trialists Group, 2005 ]. For Stage IIIA 
tumors, both neoadjuvant [Burdett et al., 2007 ] and adjuvant [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_556675]., 2008 ] chemotherapy 
confer modest benefit. Imm unotherapy with  checkpoint inhibit ion using  durvalumab was 
associated with longer progression -free survival  in NSCLC  patients following chemoradiation , 
with a median 16.8 versus 5.6 months (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.42 -0.65, p <0.001) [Antonia et al., 
2017 ]. Similarly, in a Phase 3 trial of 1005 NSCLC patients following complete surgical 
resection and adjuvant platinum -based chemotherapy whose tumors expressed PD -L1 on 1% or 
more of tumor cells, patients  randomized to atezolizumab had not reached the median disease -
free survival compared with best supportive care where the median was 35.3 months (HR : 0.66; 
95% CI 0.50 -0.88; p=0.0039 ) [Felip, et al., 2021 ]. In addition, nivolumab was approved by [CONTACT_637617] -816 trial which 
compared 3 cycles of combined nivolumab/platinum -based chemotherapy versus platinum based 
chemotherapy alone; the median event -free survival was 31.6 months versus 20.8  months (HR: 
0.63; p=0.0052) [ FDA Press Release ]. Since immunotherapy appears to be more active in 
NSCLC, novel  agents like ELI -[ADDRESS_852168] completed 
neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, chemoradiation, or checkpoint inhibitor therapy, as 
appropriate for their stage of tumor, when they remain ctDNA positive indicating a high risk for 
relapse.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  KRAS Mutations  in NSCLC  
Tumor genetics is assessed as standard of care to detect actionable mutations in ALK, ROS1, 
EGFR, NTRK and BRAF, and KRAS is frequently included in the DNA sequence methods. 
KRAS mutations ( Table  6) are present in approximately 26% of NSCLC patients  [Dogan et al., 
2012 ], with a high proportion of G12C alleles ( Table  6); NRAS mutations are very rare  [Illei et

Confidential  35  [IP_ADDRESS].  Circulating Tumor DNA  in NSCLC  
The TRACERx (Tracking Non -Small -Cell Lung Cancer Evolution Through Therapy [Rx]) study  
demonstrated the ability of a personalized  ctDNA assay to detect MRD  post-operatively in 
patients with non -small cell lung cancer [ Abbosh et al., 2017 ]. Additionally, ctDNA kinetics 
reflected the tumor response to treatment, and predicted a patient’s early cancer recurrence 
before relapse could be detected via standard imaging studies.  Consistent results were observed 
in a smaller single -center study of 37 NSCLC patients, where detection of ctDNA within 
4 months of completion of locoregional therapy for Stage 1B -III tumors was associated with 
poor freedom -from -progression and disease -specific survival [Chaudhuri, et al., 2017 ]. 
Reduction from baseline of <50% in ctDNA level was significantly associated with disease 
progression (HR:  2.28; p= 0.013) in a cohort of 99 metastatic NSCLC patients undergoing PD -
L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy [Nabet, et al., 2020 ]. Therefore, additional effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_637548] a high risk of relapse following surgery 
and adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy; post -baseline reductions in ctDNA holds promise as a 
potential early endpoint.  
4.1.4.  Ovarian Carc inoma  
Ovarian cancer , associated with primary peritoneal cancer and cancer of the Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916],  is the 
leading cause of gynecologic cancer death in developed countries and most often presents at an 
advanced stage. At diagnosis, 80% of patients present with stage 3 and 10% with stage 4. The 
5-year survival rate is approximately 30%.  
During 2021 , the American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 21,410 women will be  
diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma, and approximately 13, 770 patients will die  as a result of the 
disease  [Siegel et al, 202 1]. Worldwide, 295,414 new patients per year (2018), and 
184,799  deaths  [Bray et al, 2018 ]. Ovarian cancer is the second most common cancer of the 
female genital tract. In the US, it is responsible for more cancer deaths than all other gynecologic 
tumors.  
The prevalence is approximately 10 times its incidence, with Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and 
End Results  (SEER ) data estimating 233,364 women in the US living with the disease in 2017  
[SEER , 2020 ]. A paucity of symptoms indicative of early disease, coupled with the absence of 
validated screening tools, makes ovarian carcinoma the deadliest of the gynecologic 
malignancies, with 10 -year DFS rate less than 10%.  
Malignant epi[INVESTIGATOR_637549] 
90% of cases , with the remainder comprised of low-grade  borderline tumors . The treatment of 
ovarian cancer has been based mainly on tumor grade and stage, but the histologic subtype is 
very important in-patient  management.  
Most patients have advanced disease at initial diagnosis: primarily stage III (75 -80%), and fewer 
stage IV  (5-10%). Regardless of tumor type, the estimated 5 -year OS according to the 26th 
International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  annual report is 50 % to 65% for stage III 
and 20 % to 25% for stage IV.  
The current standard -of-care for the treatment of this majority of patients involves cytoreductive 
surgery and platinum -based chemotherapy. The NCCN Ovarian  Cancer guidelines ( Version 
1.2022) include as preferred chemotherapy regimens for ovarian cancer. These are paclitaxel

Confidential  36  175/carboplatin, as well as 5 -FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin with  or without bevacizumab, or 
capecitabine/oxaliplatin with or without bevacizumab.  
Although approximately 80% of patients achieve complete clinical response  through extensive 
cytoreductive surgery and platinum - and taxane -based chemo therapy, most ultimately develop 
recurrent chemo -resistant disease . 
Therapeutic options for patients in complete response following combined modality therapy 
depend on the primary chemotherapy regimen used, and  the BRCA1/2  mutation status. Poly 
(ADP -ribose) polymerase  inhibitors are effective  in the BRCA1/2  mutated subpopulation of 
tumors [Armstrong  et al, 2020 ; Boussios et al, 2019 ]. 
• Patients who are in clinical remission , defined as no evidence of disease, after 
primary chemotherapy without bevacizumab  have several options:  
1. Investigational t herapy such as ELI -002 in the context of a clinical trial  
2. Observation   
3. Olaparib or niraparib for those with a  BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutation  
Therefore, ELI-002 will be evaluated in the population whose tumors lack mutation in BRCA1/2 
who are in clinical remission  after primary chemotherapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ovarian KRAS Mutations   
Tumor molecular testing is frequently performed in ovarian cancer to assess for BRCA1/2 
mutation, and KRAS is often included. KRAS mutations  (Table  8) are present in primary tumors 
at 9.6%  to 12.5%  of serous, 11.76%  to 33% of end ometrioid, 43.6% to 61% of mucinous , and 
14% to 26.3% of clear cell histologies [Auner et al, 2009 ; Morikawa et al, 2018 ; Perren, 201 6; 
Rechsteiner et al, 2013 ; Dobrzycka et al, 2011 ]. Borderline tumors may harbor KRAS mutations 
but have a favorable prognosis [Prat et al, 2018 ; Rambau et al, 2017 ]. The spectrum of mutations 
in ovarian cancer is similar to gastrointestinal  tumors with the most fr equent mutation being the 
G12D allele ( Table  7). NRAS  mutations are rare in ovarian tumors.

4.5 months in a cohort of 98 Dutch patients [ van der Burg et al., 1990 ]. Therefore, ELI-002 will 
be evaluated in ovarian cancer patients with KRAS mutations who are ctDNA positive following 
therapy and those who are at high relapse risk  due to serum CA -125 tumor biomarker above the 
normal range . 
4.1.5.  Cholangiocarcinoma  
Cholangiocarcinoma s (CCAs) are rare and aggressive tumors. About 8,000 patients are 
diagnosed with CCA  each year in the US. In 2016, there were 7,000 new patients in the US and 
5,600 deaths [Yao et al, 2016 ]. An increasing incidence has been reported worldwide since the 
last 10 years, especially the intrahepatic subtype: the number of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma  
(iCCA ) has more than doubled and the global mortality rate has increased to 36% [Kirstein et al, 
2016 ].  
CCA s are one of the most fatal cancers: although 1 -year mortality has improved over time, the 
5-year survival is still as low as 10%. The only curative option for patients with CCA is surgical 
resection , but many patients are diagnosed with distant disease, and 10 % to 45% of those 
considered appropriate for surgery are found to be unresectable at laparotomy [ Blechacz  et al,  
2017 ]. At advanced stage, CCA has a devastating prognosis with a median OS of only  12 to 
15 months.  
CCA s are diverse biliary epi[INVESTIGATOR_637550], perihilar, and distal biliary 
tree. They  are categorized according to anatomical location as iCCA, perihilar 
cholangiocarcinoma  (pCCA), or distal cholangiocarcinoma  (dCCA) . The 5 -year survival rates 
are: intrahepatic 21% to 40%, perihilar 10 % to 37%, distal  23% to 45% [Blechacz et al, 2017 ]. 
For patients with advanced -stage or unresectable CCA , first-line systemic therap y with cisplatin 
and gemcitabine provides a survival advantage over gemcitabine alone  [Valle et al, 20 10]; 
however , there is  limited effectiveness: median OS with the standard regimen  is less than 1 year 
[Rizvi et al, 2018 ], and  there is no standard for later -line therapy . 
ELI-[ADDRESS_852169] benefit to a 6 -month course of oral capecitabine chemotherapy was observed 
in the BILCAP trial for patients with iCCA and dCCA [Primrose et al, 2019 ; Shroff et al, 2019 ]. 
The NCCN Hepatobiliary Cancer guidelines ( Version 5.202 1) recommend adjuvant 
capecitabine, alternative fluoropyrimidine -based, gemcitabine -based, or chemoradiation for R1 
resected tumors, but leave the choice of therapy or observation to the treating physician’s 
discretion for R0 resected tumors.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cholangiocarcinoma KRAS Mutations  
The frequency of KRAS mutations has been reported higher at 36% to 40% of  extrahepatic CCA  
compared with 8% to 24% in iCCA  in US -based series  [Ettrich et al, 2019 ; Churi et al, 2014 ]. 
Likewise , in an Italian series, the KRAS mutation frequency was higher at 47.4% of extrahepatic 
CCA versus  15.7% in iCCA  [Simbolo et al, 2014 ]. A limited number of manuscripts have 
reported the spectrum of KRAS mutations  (Table  9), where G12D is the most common observed 
allele in iCCA but G12C is more common in extrahepatic CCA  [Zou et al, 2014 ; Churi et al, 
2014 ].

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has been investig ated for potential use in  detecting actionable 
mutations  such mKRAS  [Ettrich  et al, 2019 ]; however, studies of relapse prediction in an 
adjuvant setting have not yet been reported.  Small studies of serum tumor biomarkers have been 
performed in this rare tumor type. For example, Kato and colleagues [ Kato et al., 2016 ] studied 
143 patients with extrahepatic CCA, finding that those whose initial postoperative CA19 -9 was 
>37 U/mL had increased recurrences within 1 year (69.4% vs 42.3%, p=0.012) and shorter 
survival (24.0 vs 42.9 months, p<0.001). Similarly, elevated post operative CA19 -9 >37 U/mL 
predicted short survival for iCCA patients [ Kondo et al., 2014 ].

deadly cancer worldwide [Bray et al, 2018 ]. About 3,[ADDRESS_852171] been diagnosed with gallbladder cancer. This constitutes 1.2% 
of all cancer diagnoses.  
Gallbladder cancer is disproportionately deadly because it is rarely found before it has advanced 
or metastasized. In fact, in the US, only about 1 in 5 gallbladder cancers are diagnosed in the 
early stages , and median survival for advanced stage cancer is no more than about a year [Rawla 
et al, 2019 ].  
The optimal treatment strategy for patients with resected cancer has not been determined . A 
phase 3 trial confirmed that gallbladder carcinoma patients treated with adjuvant mitomycin C 
and 5 -FU had a higher 5 -year survival rate of 26% compared with 14% in the control group 
(p=0.0367 ) [Takada  et al,  2002 ]. For R0 or R1 resected gallbladder cancer patients, the NCCN 
Hepatobiliary Cancer guidelines [ Version 5.2020 ] recommend capecitabine as the preferred 
adjuvant regimen, with a list of acceptable neoadjuvant regimens (BIL -C). Some institutions use 
fluoropyrimidine based chemoradiation for patients with R1 positive margins or regional nodes.  
In a small study  of patients with gallbladder cancer, K RAS  mutations were detected in 8 primary 
tumors  cases , with a limited spectrum 75% G12R and 25% G12C  [Kim et al, 2000 ]. Circulating 
tumor DNA assessment has not been widely studied in gallbladder cancer. ELI-[ADDRESS_852172] consisting of

Nonclinical studies with ELI -002a or components of ELI -002a have been performed to support 
the clinical investigation of the multivalent product.  
ELI-002 2P is an investigational therapeutic vaccine consisting of a subset of 2  of the 7 Amph -
Peptides (G12D and G12R) and Amph -CpG -7909.  Elicio plans to investigate the use of an

The objective of the nonclinical pharmacology program for ELI -002 was to demonstrate, in a 
C57BL/6 mouse model, the improved potency of the amphiphile -conjugated subunits (both 
antigens and adjuvant) in eliciting cellular immune responses to KRAS peptides.  The C57BL/[ADDRESS_852174] mouse pharmacology studies

immunologic responses of mice  to mKRAS  peptides, they consistently mounted potent immune 
responses to the amphiphile conjugated vaccine  that were superior  to control soluble vaccines 
lacking the amphiphile modification .  
• The weight of evidence of in vivo data indicate s that immunization with amph -
mKRAS  peptides and a mph-CpG1826 or soluble mKRAS and Amph -CpG -1826 
stimulated a stronger memory immune response, as indicated by [CONTACT_123606], to

mKRAS  and soluble CpG -1826 or soluble mKRAS + pIC.  (KRAS Imgen #7; KRAS 
Imgen #12, KRAS Imgen #8, KRAS Imgen #9) . 
• The immunologic response was characterized by a strong Th1 response and cytolytic 
function against K RAS -specific targets , both in vitro and in vivo. Very low amounts 
of Th2 cytokines like IL4 and IL10 were generated  in vitro ( KRAS Imgen #12, 
KRAS Imgen #14) .  
• The most robust responses were generated when both peptide and adjuvant were 
amph -conjugated  (KRAS Imgen #4).  
• Restimulation with short peptides elicited a weaker response than restimulation with 
long peptides  (KRAS Imgen #14, KRAS Imgen # 7, KRAS Imgen # 8). 
• Restimulation with long wide type ( WT) peptide did elicit responses in cells from 
animals vaccinated with mutant peptide but responses were lower than those induced 
by [CONTACT_637618] (Imgen #4, Imgen #14).  During toxicity 
evaluation WT Ras tissues were unaffected,  suggesting that low level responses to 
WT peptide may not present a safety concern.   
• Increasing the frequency of dosing did not affect the immune response towards long 
peptide stimulation. However, it did seem to improve responses to short -peptide 
stimulation  (KRAS Imgen #9).  
• Amph iphilic CpG -7909  (Amph -CpG -7909)  dose-dependently increased the immune 
response to K RAS  antigen. No significant immune response was detected at the 
lowest concentration of CpG; however, medium and high concentrations generated 
robust immune responses (KRAS Imgen  #14.2). 
• The minimum adjuvant (aCpG) dose needed to achieve a robust immune response 
was 5  nmol ( KRAS Imgen  #15, KRAS Imgen  #14.2). 
• The minimum effective dose (MED) identified for immunogenicity of  ELI-002 in

tolerated with a dose -dependent reduced  (relative to the high dose)  incidence and severity of 
local irritation and limited associated effects. However, high dose adjuvant ( 125 µg Adjuvant 
alone and 48  µg Amph -Peptide s/125 µg Adjuvant ) was not well tolerated, with 3 of 90 animals 
in each group (with and without peptide)  animals euthanized in extremis as a result of increased 
severity of clinical observations around the injection site. There were also positive dermal scores; 
clinical pathology and organ weight including increased lymph node size, effects indicative of an 
immune/inflamm atory response; and histopathology consisting of injection site ulceration, 
inflammation and osseous proliferation, as well as the spread of extensive abdominal/peritoneal 
and regional inflammation . These effects were all considered subsequent to exacerbated local 
toxicity at the injection site and were considered adverse. Therefore, the no -observed -adverse -
effect level (NOAEL) was 48  µg Amph -Peptide s/[ADDRESS_852192] dose of adjuvant that was well tolerated in mice

of soluble mKRAS peptides.  
Similarly, soluble CpG -7909 has been previously evaluated and found to be well tolerated in

4.6. ELI-002: A n Investigational Treatment for KRAS/NRAS Mutated 
Solid Tumors  
4.6.1.  Mechanism of Action  
Therapeutic vaccines for cancer commonly seek to stimulate the expansion of cytotoxic T  cells 
specific to antigens from malignant cells. Following activation, these antigen -specific cells 
infiltrate tumor sites, recognize tumor cells expressing antigen through major histocompatibility 
complex (MHC ) presentation, and execute cytotoxic effector functions to kill target cells. 
ELI-002 employs this general paradigm to target mKRAS  and mNRAS -driven malignancies 
expressing mutant forms of KRAS /NRAS . The sequence of amino acids is identical between 
KRAS and NRAS surrounding positions 12 and 13, and the National Cancer Institute has 
demonstrated that RAS -specific T cells cross recognize both mKRAS and NRAS tumors 
[Chatani and Yang, 2020 ]. Upon SC injection, the components of the vaccine are drained from 
the peripheral tissues into the lymph  nodes. KRAS /NRAS  Amph -Peptides are then taken up by 
[CONTACT_488] -presenting immune cells for processing through the proteasomal pathway. Peptide 
fragments produced through proteasomal degradation are loaded onto MHC molecules and 
presented on the cell surface for recognition by T lymphocytes through T-cell receptor 
interactions. In parallel, Amph -CpG -7909 is taken up by [CONTACT_637621]. Immune cells expressing TLR -9 are activated by [CONTACT_637622], a process which 
leads to express ion and secretion of pro -inflammatory factors supportive of adaptive immunity 
including T lymphocyte activation. Within this pro -inflammatory context, T -cells capable of 
specific recognition of antigen engage with APCs  and are clonally expanded, activated, and 
licensed for killing of antigen -bearing target cells  [Yang et al, 2016a ; Yang et al, 2016b ; Yang et 
al, 2017 ]. 
4.6.2.  Amphiphile Lymph Node Delivery Background  
Subunit vaccines are an attractive strategy for eliciting therapeutic immunity given the ease, 
speed, and low cost of manufacturing for small molecules and biopolymers such as peptides and 
oligonucleotides  [Liu et al, 2014 ]. However, subunit vaccines consisting of linear peptides and 
molecular adjuvants often elicit only minimal immunological responses in animals and humans. 
Previous studies have demonstrated that poor lymphatic drainage, and thus inefficient delivery to 
immune cells, is a significant factor leading to the observed lack of potency for these vaccination 
strategies.  
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_637553] 2 competing mechanisms for solute drainage from peripheral 
tissues: (1) passage through the endothelial basement membranes into systemic blood circulation 
and (2) drainage from the tissue into lymphatic vessels and circul ation through the lymph 
system. The predominant pathway taken for any individual molecule following SC injection is 
determined by [CONTACT_637623]. Specifically, solutes <3 nm in size easily pass through the 
endothelial basement membranes and are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_637554]. Importantly, molecules of this size are not delivered to 
ELI-002  Protocol ELI -002-001 
Elicio Therapeutics, Inc.    Version 8.0 
 
Confidential  49  draining lymph nodes. Conversely, for solutes >3 nm in size, passage into blood vessels is 
inefficient, and molecules >[ADDRESS_852195] through the  subclavian vein. Thus, the minimal potency observed for 
subunit vaccines can be attribute d, in substantial part, to their lack of delivery into the lymph 
nodes based on their size of <[ADDRESS_852196] 
demonstrated that compounds <3 nm in size which bind avidly to albumin after injection are 
effectively concentrated in draining lymph nodes rather than being clea red through the systemic 
circulation. Further, these albumin -binding compounds efficiently accumulate in 
antigen -presenting immune cells once delivered into the draining lymph nodes. The basis for this 
paradoxical observation is the innate biodistribution pattern of endogenous albumin. Albumin, a 
66.5 kDa protein, is present at high concentrations throughout the body, and is exclusively 
drained from the peripheral tissues into the lymphatics due to its high molecular weight  (MW) . 
Therefore , compounds which otherwise would be cleared into the blood due to their small 
molecular size take on the biodistribution properties of albumin by [CONTACT_637624].  
Vaccine responses have been boosted by [CONTACT_637625] T -cell 
responses against tumor antigens. Moynihan et al found that vaccines that were modified with 
albumin -binding domains helped to transport these molecules throughout the lym phatic system 
and increased  T-cell response  [Moynihan et al, 2018 ]. Liu et al reported this lymph -node 
targeting as “albumin hitchhiking.” In mice, structurally optimized CpG -DNA/peptide -amph -
vaccines increased lymph node accumulation and resulted in a 30 -fold increase in T -cell priming 
and enhanced anti -tumor efficacy with reduced systemic toxicity [ Liu et al, 2014 ]. 
Building on these observations, the amphiphile approach  seeks to improve vaccine potency by 
[CONTACT_637626]. Specifically, peptide antigens 
or molecular adjuvants are chemi cally conjugated to fatty -acid moieties which take advantage of 
the natural function of albumin as a fatty -acid transporter. Antigens and adjuvants modified in 
this way reversibly and persistently asso ciate with albumin at the injection site and are carried by 
[CONTACT_637627] -specific immunity.  
4.6.3.  Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
Elicio will evaluate safety and tolerability of ELI -[ADDRESS_852197] s with 
KRAS /NRAS  mutated PDAC and other solid tumors who have MRD to determine whether the 
potential for clinical benefit is sufficient to warrant further testing while minimizing risk.  
ELI-[ADDRESS_852198] been extensively reviewed  by 
[CONTACT_637628]  [Kudrin , 2012 ]. In brief, therapeutic cancer vaccines can be available  off-the-shelf  
(recombinant antigen cocktails , recombinant microorganisms, whole tumor cell derived 
(allogeneic), oncolytic viruses, anti -idiotypic antibodies, DNA and gene -therapy  based products) 
which could be manufactured and distributed worldwide and personali zed cancer vaccines 
(autologous cells and antigens, adoptive cell transfer) which are heavily dependent on 
specialized centers of expertise and manufacturing. With extensive prior efforts and trials, one 
cancer vaccine: Dendreon’s PROVENGE® (sipuleucel -T), a dendritic cell for metastatic 
castration -resistan t prostate cancer, was approv ed by [CONTACT_2165]  (FDA ) 
in [ADDRESS_852199] been associated with PROVENGE  cancer 
vaccine : acute infusion reaction , chills , fever, and fatigue  back pain , joint ache , fatigue , nausea , 
headache  and f ever [PROVENGE®  USPI].  
As reported by [CONTACT_637629]én et al , no signs of toxicity were reported and no serious adverse events 
(SAEs ) attributable to the vaccine treatment were observed in any of the subject s following 
soluble mKRAS peptide vaccination , including long -term survivors who received up to 
30 injections each  [Wedén et al , 2011 ]. 
Likewise,  [ADDRESS_852200] s were vaccinated at Day 0, and booster vaccinations were 
performed similarly on Days 7 -10 and at 1 month. Further booster vaccinations were performed 
at 4-6–week intervals or as long as the subject ’s immunological response and overall 
performance status permitted over a period of [ADDRESS_852201] . No sign of toxicity and no adverse 
events (AEs) were observed [ Gjertsen et al, 1996 ].  
ELI-002 is expected to elicit common side effects often associated with vaccines such as local 
skin reaction, fever, fatigue, pain, among others which generally subside within a day or two. 
Reactogenicity refers to a subset of reactions that occur soon after vaccination and are a physical 
manifestation of the inflammatory response to vaccination. In clinical trials, information on 
expected signs and symptoms after vaccination is actively soug ht (or ‘solicited’). These 
symptoms may include pain, redness, swe lling or induration for injected vaccines, and systemic 
symptoms, such as fever, myalgia, headache, or rash. The broader term “safety ” profile refers to 
all A Es that could potentially be caused/triggered or worsened at any time after vaccination, and 
includes A Es, such as anaphylactic reactions, diseases diagnosed after vaccination and 
autoimmune events.  
The administration of 48  µg Peptide with either 5 or 25  µg Adjuvant was well tolerated in the 
rodent Study No. 2795 -002 with a dose -dependent reduced incidence and severity of local 
irritation and limited associated effects. Therefore, the NOAEL was 48  µg Amph -Peptide s/[ADDRESS_852202] s who receive peptide injections, 
and there is always a possibility of hypersensitivity reactions. Injection site reaction is the only 
AE known to be attributed to ELI -002. Reactogenicity monitoring will occur throughout the 
ELI-002-001 trial (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] )  
Since ELI -[ADDRESS_852203] 
undergone resection surgery  and/or who have MRD fol lowing locoregional therapy , a clinical 
setting with the highest ratio of ELI -[ADDRESS_852204] already received 
chemotherapy/ chemoradiation  (in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting)  as well as 
pancreatectomy with an R0 (no residual tumor cells observed) or R1 (microscopic residual tumor 
cells observed) outcome, yet who have poor prognosis with persistent ctDNA post -surgery 
indicating an expected median relapse -free survival  (RFS)  of only 5 months [ Groot et al, 2019 ]. 
The selection of cancer patients with MRD  for evaluation of a cancer immunotherapy product 
candidate has several potential advantages:  
• Maximization of the effector T -cell:target tumor cell ratio by [CONTACT_637630]  
• Maximization of T -cell trafficking potential because the fibrous stromal present in 
advanced tumors that can exclude T -cells has not yet formed  
• Clinical setting s where cytotoxic chemotherapy is not utilized, preserving the full 
potential of induced T -cells to persist and traffic  
The Phase 1 study is an open -label, single -arm, dose -escalation trial incorporating a 3+[ADDRESS_852205] s with KRAS /NRAS  mutated PDAC and other solid tumors who have MRD . 
Approximately [ADDRESS_852206] s are planned to  be enrolled in Phase 1 to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability , and exploratory pharmacodynamic efficacy of SC ELI-002 using the adjuvant at 
3 planned dose levels ( Amph -CpG -7909 0.1  mg SC, 0.5 mg SC, 2.5 mg SC)  in combination with 
a fixed dose of Amph -Peptides (700 μg each) . Additional cohorts may be added to explore 
intermediate or higher dose levels.  This will be based on the cumulative safety review and 
preliminary review of efficacy.  If additional cohorts are added, this will be documented in a 
study memo sent to all clinical sites and submitted to IRBs, per IRB guidance.

all 7 Amph -Peptides (G12D, G12R, G12V, G12A, G12C, G12S, G13D) admixed with Amph -

Since ELI -[ADDRESS_852208] dose of ELI -002. In the absence of toxicity 
during the dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) assessment window, ELI -002 will be escalated . Planned 
cohort dose levels are listed below:  
• Cohort 1  Dose Level 1: Amph -CpG -7909 0.1 mg with Amph -Peptides  
• Cohort 2  Dose Level 2: Amph -CpG -7909 0.5 mg with Amph -Peptides  
• Cohort 3  Dose Level 3: Amph -CpG -[ADDRESS_852209] s (the number will depend on whether DLTs are observed). 
In order to ensure an adequate number of evaluable subject s, up to [ADDRESS_852210] s may be enrolled per 
cohort even in the absence of a DLT.  
Dose escalation from one cohort to the next will be determined by [CONTACT_45000] ( SMC ), and will be based on treatment -emergent A Es, clinical laboratory data, 
physical examination  (PE) findings including vital signs, after all subject s within a cohort have 
completed [ADDRESS_852211] s in a cohort experiences a 
DLT, then 3  (or 2, if 4 were originally enrolled) additional subject s will be enrolled at the same 
dose level.  If [ADDRESS_852212] 28 days, then this dose will be considered the 
toxic dose. The trial may proceed at a lower dose , at a less frequent schedule , or omitting the 
Amph -CpG -7909 adjuvant while continuing to administer the peptides , based on emerging 
toxicity or pharmacodynamic data until the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) is determ ined.  
A trial memo will be sent to all sites following each SMC m eeting  summarizing the decisions ; if 
additional cohorts are to be enrolled, the dose level and schedule will be provided.  
The recommended Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) will be defined in consideration of the MTD (if any), 
safety data, and pharmacodynamic data . The RP2D will be  communicated to all sites  in a trial 
memo following the last SMC cohort review.  Once the RP2D is determined, the cohort 
evaluating the Phase [ADDRESS_852213]  replacement : If a subject  discontinues for any reason other than toxicity  prior to 
completing [ADDRESS_852214] s per cohort complete 28 days of ELI -002 therapy.  
4.6.5.  Rationale for Endpoints  
The safety and tolerability endpoints to define the MTD  (in the event there is an MTD ), to define 
the RP2D, and to characterize the incidence of A Es and clinically significant changes laboratory 
tests are standard endpoints that are used in many trials of immune -therapy agents including with 
CAR T cells that exhibit similar mechanism of action to ELI -002. For example, CD19 CAR T 
cells were initially evaluated with the standard 3+3 design [Lee et al, 2015 ] as were BCMA CAR 
T cells [Raje, 2019 ]. Important immune related adverse events (IRAEs) may occur late with 
immune -oncology products. For example, the median time to onset of IRAEs when the 
checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab was administered in [ADDRESS_852215] s with advanced metastatic 
melanoma was 5.0 weeks for skin toxicities and 15.0 weeks for renal toxicities [Weber et al, 
2017 ]. Therefore, the safety evaluation committee will take into account not only the MTD 
evaluation but rather the totality of all safety observations obtained to that point in the conduct  of 
the trial including any serious toxicities occurring beyond the DLT evaluation window when 
making dose escalation decisions and when considering the definition of the RP2D.  
Median RFS and median OS are exploratory endpoints that will provide preliminary data that 
may show  a trend for a dose response in an outcome measure suitable to support the design of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_637555]. For example, DFS has been used as the primary endpoint 
supporting the approval of adjuvant breast cancer hormonal therapy, adjuvant chemotherapy for 
CRC , and  adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer [Guidance for Industry, Clinical Trial 
Endpoints, 2018 ], and OS may be suitable in populations where there is a short interval between 
progression and death.  
Exploratory objectives are intended to confirm the preliminary efficacy of ELI -002, and to 
provide evidence of a dose response in pharmacodynamic activities that may show when the 
optimal biologic dose has been achieved. Minimal residual disease response c an provide a 
preliminary proof of concept for efficacy if ELI -002 results in reduction/ clearance of ctDNA  
and/or serum tumor biomarkers . Emerging data using the ctDNA assay have shown a high 
median lead time for ctDNA changes relative to radiographic relap se and very high positive 
predictive value for in colorectal and NSCLC [Abbosh et al , 2017 ; Reinert et al, 2019 ] resulting 
in an FDA Breakthrough Device Designation s in 2019 and 2021 . Efficacy biomarker s CA-125, 
CEA, and CA19 -9 will also be characterized  where appropriate . In addition, exploratory 
objectives are included to document that ELI -002 induces the intended immune responses . T cell 
responses in PBMCs will be assessed by [CONTACT_637631]  Fluorospot , intracellular 
cytokine staining (ICS), and/or dextramers. Patient reported outcomes  (PROs)  will be 
characterized to explore the potential symptomatic benefit of immunotherapy in protocol  
population.  The PROs used are European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  
(EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) -C30 for general health, and for specific tumor 
types, QLQ -PAN26 for pancreatic, QLQ -CR29 for colorectal, QLQ -OV28 for ovarian  
carcinoma , QLQ -BIL21  for biliary cancer , or QLQ -LC13  for NSCLC.  
ELI-[ADDRESS_852216] 40 mg and on a 
body weight basis as high as 0.48 mg/kg [ Melisi et al , 2014 ]. The dose -ranging Study No. 2795 -
001 (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) also strongly support s the starting dose being proposed in this trial.  
The administration of 48  µg Amph -Peptide with either 5 or 25  µg Adjuvant was well tolerated in 
the rodent Study No. 2795 -002 (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) with a dose -dependent reduced incidence and 
severity of local irritation and limited associated effects. Therefore, the NOAEL was 48  µg 
Amph -Peptide/25 µg Adjuvant.  
The 3 planned dose levels  for this trial are  Amph -CpG -7909 0.1 mg SC, 0.5  mg SC, and 2.5 mg 
SC in combination with a fixed dose of 2 Amph -Peptides (700 μg each ).

ELI-002-001 is an open -label, Phase 1 trial of ELI -002 immunotherapy as adjuvant treatment for 
subjects with KRAS /NRAS  mutated PDAC and other solid tumors who are at high risk for 
relapse (ie, presence of isolated tumor cells  as detected by [CONTACT_637632]’s body , in which the primary tumor has been removed and is currently 
without clinical signs of disease) . High relapse risk is defined by [CONTACT_5640] a ctDNA -positive result 
or an elevated serum tumor biomarker (such as C A19-9, CEA, or CA -125).  
This Phase 1  study  comprise s an open label, single arm, dose -escalation trial incorporating a 3+3 
design in subjects with mKRAS/mNRAS solid tumors (PDAC, CRC, NSCLC , ovarian, CCA ,

• A Screening Period in which study specific procedures , including eligibility 
determination,  will begin at Visit 1, following  surgical resection . 
• An Immunization Period which will consist of 6 SC injections: 4 weekly injections

• A Booster Period , consisting of 4  weekly injections  (Visit 12 to Visit 15) , in which 
eligible subject s will receive further lymph node  antigen exposure . 
• A Follow -up Period which will provide continued safety and efficacy data.  
All subject s will be observed for safety and tolerability. Computed tomography ( CT) with

guidance.  
During the study , ELI -002 will be comprised of 1.4 mg of 2 Amph modified KRAS peptides, 
Amph -G12D, and Amph -G12R  (0.7 mg/peptide) admixed with Amph -CpG -[ADDRESS_852231] containing 
all 7 Amph -Peptides (G12D, G12R, G12V, G12A, G12C, G12S, G13D) admixed with Amph -
CpG -7909 (ELI -002 7P)  in future clinical trials .  
Subject s will receive the initial dose of ELI -002 and be monitored for [ADDRESS_852232] s. In the absence of toxicity 
during the dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) assessment window, ELI -[ADDRESS_852233] s (the number will depend on whether DLTs are observed). 
In order to ensure an adequate number of evaluable subject s, up to [ADDRESS_852234] s in a cohort experiences a 
DLT, then 3  (or 2, if 4 were originally enrolled) additional subject s will be enrolled at the same 
dose level.  If [ADDRESS_852235] 28 days, then this dose will be considered the 
toxic dose. The trial may proceed at a lower dose, at a less frequent schedule, or omitting the 
Amph -CpG -7909 adjuvant while continuing to administer the Amph -Peptides, based on 
emerging toxicity or pharmacodynamic data until the MTD is determined.  
A trial memo will be sent to all sites following each SMC meeting  summarizing the decision ; if 
additional cohorts are to be enrolled, the dose level and schedule will be provided.  
Safety monitoring is further detailed in the SMC Charter.  
The RP2D will be defined in consideration of the MTD (if any), safety data, and 
pharmacodynamic data . The RP2D will be  communicated to all sites in a trial memo following the 
last SMC cohort review.  Once the RP2D is determined, the cohort evaluating the Phase [ADDRESS_852236] 6  subjects at this dose level.

6.1.2.  Criteria for Booster and Additional Booster Vaccine s  
Accumulating clinical evidence indicates some subjects treated with an immunotherapy, such as 
ELI-002, may be assessed as having  disease progression by [CONTACT_637633]/or stable disease  [Wolchok et al, 2009 ]. This 
pseudoprogression  has been observed in the ELI -002-[ADDRESS_852237] is that enhanced inflammation within the lesions 
could lead to an increase in the lesion size which would appear as enlarged index lesions and 
therefore as newly visible small non -index lesions. Over time, both the malignant and 
inflammatory po rtions of the lesion(s) may then decrease leading to overt signs of clinical 
improvement. The second hypothesis is that, in some subje cts, the speed of the lesion growth 
may initially outpace the anti -tumor immune activity of  the therapy.  With sufficient time, the 
anti-tumor activity will dominate and become clinically apparent. Therefore, subjects 
participating on ELI -002-001 will be allowed to continue ELI -002 treatment , as specified in this 
protocol,  after initial investigator assessed progression ( iUPD via iRECIST) if the subject is 
deriving clinical benefit and tolerating the study treatment well in the judgement of the 
investigator.  Subject s must discontinue treatment upon confirmed disease progression.   
All subject s free of confirmed radiographic progression will receive booster doses unless they 
have unresolved toxicity . For subject s which have encountered signs of toxicity , the investigator 
must consult with the sponsor’s medical monitor  who must agree with resuming the subsequent 
booster vaccinations  (see Section  6.7.1 ).  
Subject s who remain in the  trial until the end of the required  Follow -up Period may be eligible to 
enroll in a separate extension protocol to continue to receive  further lymph node  antigen 
exposure  to maintain effective levels of antigen -specific T -cells.   
6.1.3.  Screening for Human Leukocyte Antigen  Subtypes

Only one IVD will be used for each  subjec t’s enrollment , based on  ability to access acceptable 
tumor sample  and/or upon Elicio ’s instruction . 
1. Tissue -informed personalized ctDNA assay: This approach requires two assays, a  tissue 
based Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) test based on WES (KRAS mutation) 
followed by  a personalized ctDNA assay (MRD status).  Both assays are performed at 
central laboratories under CLIA and CAP requirements.  
2. Plasma RAS ctDNA  assay: This approach requires a single ctDNA assay to monitor both

The tumor informed personalized ctDNA assay is composed of two parts, WES from tumor 
DNA to identify tumor -specific mutations and a plasma -based ctDNA assay to detect 
ctDNA. CGP -WES test is a  CAP - and CLIA -validated Laboratory Developed Test, performed at 
a single -site laboratory. The assay compares the whole exome sequence of tumor and germline 
DNA, facilitating identification of tumor -specific DNA alterations which for the ELI -002-[ADDRESS_852257] s with mKRAS /mNRAS  alleles for Pancreatic and other solid tumors

mKRAS alleles has been  documented in pancreatic [ Liang et al, 2012 ] and colon cancer 
[Shanmugam et al, 2014 ]. 
The tissue -based CGP test is intended for inclusion of subject s who are positive for any of the 
specific mutations ( eg, G12D and G12R) within the KRAS  or NRAS  gene s that are targeted by 
[CONTACT_637636] -[ADDRESS_852260] Signatera  assay is based on tracking driver clonal/truncal mutations that occur early 
in tumor initiation. Signatera tracks a subset of these early clonal variants to detect residual 
ctDNA with significantly increased sensitivity using a multiplexed PCR methodology . In brief, 
WES  of tumor and matched normal blood are used to identify [ADDRESS_852261]  
assays serial plasma biospecimens – presence or absence of ctDNA is highly pr edictive of 
response to treatment or MRD [ Sethi et al, 2018 ]. Signatera ctDNA positive status was 
significantly correlated with RFS across several tumor types, including mKRAS -positive colon 
[Reinert et al, 201 9] and lung [ Abbosh et al, 2017 ].  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Plasma RAS  ctDNA Assay 
The Sysmex SafeSEQ RAS -RAF pathway assay  was designed to deliver a clinical grade, ultra -
sensitive liquid biopsy solution for the identification of gene mutations in KRAS, NRAS, BRAF 
and PIK3CA . This test identifies different genomic alterations (single and multiple base 
substitutions, insertions and deletions) across [ADDRESS_852262] assay  will identify 
subjects who are positive for any of the specific  mutations ( eg, G12D and G 12R) within the 
KRAS  or NRAS  gene s that are targeted by [CONTACT_637636] -[ADDRESS_852263] candidate . In addition, the 
SafeSEQ assay will inform the presence or absence of ctDNA.  Unlike the tumor -informed 
personalized assay, tumor tissue  is not required for KRAS mutation identification ; instead , a 
single plasma sample will inform both KRAS mutation type and ctDNA  positivity  (MRD) . 
SafeSEQ is an amplification -based NGS method which was designed for ctDNA analysis to 
suppress NGS errors and to improve the calling of low frequency mutations.  This approach 
enables confidence in the calling of mutations from clinical specimens even with a low volume 
of input DNA.  SafeSEQ provides nearly 100% conversion of DNA input, so that molecules, 
including rare ctDNA molecules, are effectively measured.  This allows for high sensitivity and 
accuracy by [CONTACT_637637] e mutations.  Use of SafeSEQ to 
identify KRAS and NRAS gene mutations has been documented in colorectal  and pancreatic 
cancers  [Bettegowda  et al,  2014 ]. Sysmex SafeSEQ positive ctDNA detection after resection was 
associated with an increased risk of relapse in pancreatic [Lee, Lipton, et al, 2019 ] and colorectal 
[Tie et al,  2019 ] cancers.

6.7. Management of Study Drug -Related Events  
6.7.1.  Temporarily Suspend ing Treatment Administration  
If a subject  meets any of the following conditions within 48 hours prior to  the scheduled 
administration of the trial treatment, treatment administration  will be temporarily suspend ed: 
1. To reduce the risk of CRS, subjects will not be given a repeat dose of ELI -002 if they are 
exhibiting T ≥38°C and/or IL -6 ≥500 pg/mL  (cytokine collection, including IL -6, may be 
performed up to 7 days prior to treatment) . In addition, if a subject exhibits IFN γ 
≥1000  pg/mL, the Elicio medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_409493].  
2. Adverse event(s) that meet the definition of DLT caused by [CONTACT_380121]. See 
Section  6.7.3  for the definition of a DLT; see Section  12.4 for the definition of Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE s). 
3. Any subsequent dosing in a subject  who has experienced Grade ≥2 CRS/  immune 
effector cell -associated neurotoxicity syndrome  (ICANS ) 
Investigators must consult the medical monitor to discuss any subject s meeting the above 
criteria.  
In the event the ELI -[ADDRESS_852268] should not receive any make up dose and 
remain on the original protocol schedule (ie , their next dose will be at the next protocol -specified 
dose if they meet the criteria for dosing). All trial procedures and treatment administration will 
be resumed as soon as the subject ’s condition allows or at the investigator’s discretion after 
Sponsor approval.  
The trial may proceed at a lower dose, at a less frequent schedule, or omitting the Amph -CpG -

• Other anti -cancer treatment  
4. Non-compliance with trial treatments/procedures. If a subject  misses  [ADDRESS_852271] s whose treatment is discontinued prematurely, the procedures outlined for End of 
Treatment/ Visit  15 (Table  14) will be carried out and, if possible, prior to the initiation of any 
other anti -cancer treatment. These subject s should then enter the Follow -up Period, where 
procedures listed in  Table  [ADDRESS_852272] will not 
continue to be evaluated in the Follow -up Period, the End of Study visit  (Visit 24)  should be 
scheduled , and all procedures performed.  
6.7.3.  Dose -limiting Toxicity Guidelines  
A DLT will be defined as any event at least possibly related  to ELI -002 as follows:  
a. Any Grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic toxicity except  asymptomatic laboratory 
abnormalities (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
b. Any Grade ≥  3 toxicity involving major organ systems for greater than 72 hours and 
occurring within 28 days of subcutaneous administration  
c. Grade 3 CR S that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 7 days  
d. Any Grade 4 CRS that does not improve to < Grade 2 within 72 hours  
e. Any Grade ≥ 3 autoimmune disorder  
f. Any Grade ≥ 3 rash that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 1 within 7 days with appropriate 
treatment  
The DLT observation period will be 28 days . 
Maximum tolerated dose definition: The MTD is defined as the highest dose level with a DLT 
incidence <33% of cohort subject s. 
See protocol Section  6.7.1  and Section  6.8 for management of toxicity.  
6.8. Management of Risks and Toxicities  
Review of the ELI-002 pre-clinical data indicates that certain cytokine levels such as IL -6 may 
be elevated  (see Section  4.4). Elevated cytokines are  a hallmark of CAR -T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_637560] .  
Consequently, the management of such toxicities have been extensively reviewed  through the 
CAR -T Toxicity Management Workgroup [ Lee et al, 2019 ]. To be fully prepared in the event 
that CRS is observed , this trial will follow the same guidelines as are used for CAR -T stud ies as 
outlined in Section  6.8.[ADDRESS_852273] ELI -002 dose . 
6.8.1.  Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome  
Since ELI -002 activates T cells by a novel amphiphile mechanism whereby [CONTACT_637645], there is a theoretical risk for observation of T -cell-mediated toxicity.  
To reduce the risk of CRS, subjects will not be given a repeat dose of ELI -002 if they are 
exhibiting T >38°C and/or IL -6 >500 pg/mL. In addition, if a subject exhibits IFN γ 
≥1000  pg/mL, the Elicio medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_409493].  
In the event the ELI -[ADDRESS_852274]  should not receive any make up dose and 
remain on the original protocol schedule (ie , their next dose will be at the next protocol -specified 
dose if they meet the criteria for dosing  and with approval from the medical monitor ).  
Cytokine release syndrome  is caused by [CONTACT_637646] -6, 
IL-2, IFNγ, and TNFα, which causes a systemic inflammatory response similar to sepsis. The 
release of cytokines occurs when  cells that are targeted by [CONTACT_79425], immune effector cells  
(T and B -cells, Natural Killer cells, and monocytes/macrophages) are recruited to the tumor area 
and the subject ’s immune cells are activated. The importance of cytokine secretion of CAR 
T cells after exposure to tumor cells is closely related to their killing activity, and the degree of 
cytokine elevation is correlated to the bulk of residual disease at the time of adoptive T -cell 
infusion , ie, tumor burden, as well as with the number of detectable CAR T -cells after 
administration [ Brentjens , 201 2; Lee et al, 2015 , Lee et al, 2019 ]. IL-6 levels in patients with low 
grade 0 -3 CRS were a median of 100  pg/mL, whereas IL -6 was a median of 10,000 pg/mL 
[Teachey  et al, 2016 ] in patients with high grade 4 -5 CR S. Likewise,  IFNγ  was approximately 
40 pg/mL in  patients with low grade CRS , versus approximately 4,000 pg/mL  in those with high 
grade CRS  [Teachey et al, 2016 ] ; therefore , this protocol takes a conservative cut -point and 
mandates dose hold for ELI -002 if IL -6 >500  pg/mL is observed  or contact [CONTACT_637647]γ  > 1000 p g/mL is observed, making the assumption that although 
CRS guidelines address CAR -T safety management, ELI -002 may elicit sufficient T cells to 
merit a similar approach . The goal of CRS management is to prevent life -threatening 
complications while preserving the antitumor T cell immune response.  
Clinical signs and symptoms  of CRS  listed in Table  17 should raise concern.

The Common Toxicity Criteria ( ie, CTCAE) grading system was originally developed to capture 
a cytokine syndrome occurring during infusion therapy; therefore, it is inadequate to capture the 
delayed CRS that occurs after repeat dose ELI -002 administration . Appreciating the scale needed 
to be adapted for other therapeutics, to define mild, moderate, severe and life -threatening events, 
account for overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_637562],  and allow cross -trial 
comparison , an objective  revised consensus CRS grading system was developed by [CONTACT_637648] (ASTCT ) as provided in  Table  18

The following clinical laboratory parameters will be followed in addition to expeditious local

• C-reactive protein ( CRP ) 
• Complete blood count ( CBC ) with differential  
• Blood chemistries  
• Liver function tests  
• Ferritin  
• Coagulation parameters including prothrombin time , partial thromboplastin time , 
fibrinogen, D -dimer  
• Blood cultures  
Tocilizumab must  be used as the first -line agent in the treatment of CRS. If the subject ’s 
condition does not improve or stabilize within 24 hours of the tocilizumab dose, administration 
of a second dose of tocilizumab and/or a second immunosuppressive agent (such as 
corticosteroids) should be considered.  
• Tocilizumab is a recombinant humanized anti -human IL -6 receptor monoclonal 
antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG1k subclass. It binds both the membrane 
bound and soluble forms for the IL -6 receptor, and thus blocks IL -6 mediated 
pro-inflammatory effects. Tocilizumab is approved for the treatment of CRS 
occurring in the setting of CAR -T cell therapy, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis and po lyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis [ ACTEMRA® 
USPI ]. 
• Tocilizumab at a dose of 8mg/kg (max dose 800  mg; or at the level recommended by 
[CONTACT_104130]) should be administered intravenously over 1 -hour, with the option to 
repeat the dose if clinical improvement does not occur within 24  to 48 hours. There 
should be a minimum of 8 hours between consecutive doses of tocilizumab  [Grupp et 
al, 2013 ; Lee et al, 2014 ; Maude et al, 2015 ]. 
• Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may ablate or significantly impair T -cell function and 
may limit therapeutic benefit. However, they may be used as a secondary agent or in 
cases of severe or life -threatening CRS as front -line therapy or in conjunction with 
Tocilizumab.  
• Methylprednisolone ( 1mg/kg  every 12 hours ) is recommended, but consideration 
should be given to using Dexamethasone (10  mg/dose  every 6 hours ) in subject s with 
neurologic symptoms who may benefit from more efficient penetration of the blood 
brain barrier  [Bonifant et al, 2016 ; Maude et al, 2014 ; Neelapu et al, 2018 ]. 
• Additional agents: Siltuximab (anti -IL6 mAb)  [Chen et al , 2016 ], Etanercept (soluble 
TNFα receptor antagonist), Dasatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)  [Mestermann et al, 
ELI-002  Protocol ELI -002-001

Confidential  83 2019], and Anakinra (IL -1R antagonist)  [Giavridis et al, 2018 ] are investigational but 
may be considered for use in the context of severe CRS.  
Subject s will be advised via the informed consent of the signs and symptoms of CRS . Subject s 
will be given a protocol -specific card with all necessary information  for health care professionals 
to be aware that the subject is on a clinical trial and  to contact [CONTACT_85661] (PI)

previous CAR T -cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_637566] -002 potently activates T cells there is a theoretical 
risk for  ICANS . 
Evaluation of any new onset ≥Grade 2 neurotoxicity should include a neurological examination, 
brain MRI,  and examination of the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] ( CSF) as clinically indicated.  
Endotracheal intubation may be needed for airway protection in severe ICANS cases. 
Tocilizumab and corticosteroids should be used as outlined in Table  22, and anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_637567]. Medications with sedative properties should be avoided , if 
possible, in the setting of neurotoxicity.  ICANS should be graded in accordance with the ASTCT

6.8.4.  Management of On-target Off-tumor Toxicity  
Examples of on -target off -tumor toxicities have been observed in different immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_637575] -clinical data. It is difficult to anticipate all 
“autoimmune inflammation” that theoretically may be induced by [CONTACT_63689] -target off -tumor effect 
of ELI -002. For that reason, Grade 3 or higher autoimmune toxicity is considered a DLT (ie , fits 
non-hematologic Grade 3 toxicity ; see Section  6.7.3 ) Any observed treatment emergent 
autoimmune events must be followed closely. The exact diagnostic and the therapeutic approach 
to be followed will be left to the investigator’s discretion  who can contact [CONTACT_637652] . The Sponsor may discuss any specific case with the SMC  members to 
evaluate appropriate therapeutic action.  
6.8.5.  Management of Mac ulo-Papular or Acneiform Rashes, Injection Site Reactions  
For routine injection site reactions manifested as  maculo -papular or acneiform rashes,  erythema, 
induration, pruritis  and pain, topi[INVESTIGATOR_637576], antihistamine or 
corticosteroids may be used. If needed, systemic antihistamines and antipyretics may be added.

Home Health Visits: Based on assessment of risk, and to ensure subject  safety and minimize 
risks to trial integrity, off -site study visits can be performed in the event a study participant 
cannot attend an on -site visit during the COVID -19 crisis [Food and Drug Guidance , 2020 ]. The 
procedures that cannot be performed during a home health visit include:  
• CT/MRI  scans 
• First ELI -002 dose administration (Visit 3, Day 57); this must occur on -site as per 
Section  10.2. 
• Leukapheresis (Visit 2, Visit 9 ) 
The informed consent form will describe the availability of  home health visit s if applicable at the 
clinical site .  
The subject  will be invited to continue future study visits  on-site per protocol, as soon as local 
and federal Covid -19 regulations  allow.  
10.1. Screening and Observation Period  
Visit 1  (Day 10) , subject s will provide written informed consent before any trial-related 
procedures are performed.   
• Once a subject has consented among the first procedures will be:  
o A retrospective tumor tissue sample from the prior surgery will be 
requisitioned  for WES . Tumor DNA will be sequenced to guide ctDNA 
testing in subsequent blood samples and baseline tumor gene expression will 
be assessed  (Table  11).  
o In parallel, a  6-mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  (EDTA ) whole blood tube 
will be collected and shipped at the same time as the tissue sample. The 
somatic DNA from the EDTA tube will serve as a control to ensure only 
tumor -specific DNA is included for subsequent ctDNA testing.   
At Visit 2  (Day 26 ±5 days ), the following visit procedures will include:  
• Administer the  EORTC QLQ -C30 and the tumor type -specific PRO  (see 
Section  11.3). 
• Collect a urine sample for a pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential . 
• Record d emographic  information  (including sex, age, race and ethnicity) . 
• Record  height  and weight .

Confidential  107 • Collect a whole blood sample for immunogenicity testing  (central laboratory).  
The Visit 2 8/End of Study  visit will be scheduled for subjects who complete the study or for 
any subject that discontinues from the study early.  
ELI-[ADDRESS_852307]  REPORTED OUTCOMES  
Clinical activity, immune assessments, and PROs will be collected according to the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  11, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, Table  15, and Table  16). 
Median RFS and [ADDRESS_852308] criteria  [Seymour et al, 2017 ]; subject s will be followed 
for OS. Unscheduled CT or MRI imaging may be performed at any time, if the investigator 
determines that there are clinical signs of disease progression.  
In addition, biomarker  response rate  will be based on the percentage of subject s achieving 
biomarker  reduction or clearance , as measured by [CONTACT_637663]/or reduction , or if ctDNA was not detectable 
at baseline, serum tumor biomarker (such as  carbohydrate antigen [ CA]19 -9, carcinoembryonic 
antigen [CEA], and CA -125) reduction and clearance compared to baseline  will be recorded . 
T cell responses in PBMCs will be assessed by [CONTACT_637631]  Fluorospot , ICS, 
and/or dextramers.  
Immune responses will be correlated to clinical efficacy parameters.  
11.1. Immunogenicity  
Patients will have leukapheresis and blood samples drawn to evaluate the immunogenicity of 
ELI-002. T cell responses in PBMCs will be assessed by [CONTACT_637631]  
Fluorospot , ICS, and/or dextramers. Serum cytokine, CA-125, CEA  and CA  19-9 levels will also 
be examined.   
HLA Typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : High resolution HLA typi[INVESTIGATOR_637580] . Cohorts will be enrolled regardless of the HLA subtype.  
Serum Cytokines : Concentrations of cytokines, IL-2, IFNγ, IL -6, IL -10, and  TNFα , will be 
measured using multiplex technology in serum samples (local laboratory).  
Cellular immune response : The cellular immune response to ELI -002 will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_66567] T cell responses using immune assays such as Fluorospot  and ICS. The Fluorospot  
assay enumerates the release of IFN  in human PBMCs following KRAS peptide stimulation.  
The ICS assay i s a flow cytometry -based  assay  that can detect cytokine production by [CONTACT_398]4+ and 
CD8+ T cells to the KRAS peptides. For both assays, PBMCs will be stimulated individually 
with mKRAS peptide  pools  to determine the frequency of KRAS -specific T cells per patient and 
timepoint. Dextramers are fluorescently labeled HLA multimers that can detect antigen -specific 
T cells. In subjects with HLA alleles for which dextramer(s) are available, the freque ncy of 
KRAS -specific T cells can be monitored in PBMCs before and after vaccination.  
Full details of the leukapheresis or phlebotomy procedure to obtain PBMCs will be provided in 
the Central Laboratory Manual.  
Standard of Care Biopsies:  Tum or tissue specimens will be collected post -dosing from 
biopsies performed as standard of care per iRECIST criteria (ie; following observation of new 
lesions on radiographic imaging and investigator assessment that tissue can be safely obtained).  
If there is sufficient sample collected, the pathology laboratory should perform in situ gene

microenvironment.  
11.2. Tumor Tissue Collection  at Surgery  
Once a subject  has consented, and depending on the clinical site location, the trial coordinator 
will requisition a tumor tissue sample  that was collected at surgery . Details for tumor tissue 
collection are provided in the  Central Laboratory Manual ). 
11.3. Patient Reported Outcomes  
Patient reported outcomes will be  assessed by [CONTACT_26740] -C30 and  QLQ -PAN26 , QLQ -CR29, 
QLQ -OV28, QLQ -BIL21 or QLQ -LC13 and will be administered to subject s according to the 
Schedule of Assessments and prior to other visit procedures (Table  11, Table  12, Table  13, 
Table  14, Table  15, and Table  16). All the PROs have been fully validated by [CONTACT_152853], except 
QLQ -PAN26 , which has completed phase III of validation and is on-track for full validation in 
2021. Verification of validation can be obtained through EORTC , and the list of questionnaires 
and the phase of validation can be found at the following site :

11.3.1.  EORTC QLQ -C30 
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire 
(EORTC QLQ -C30) is a tool  for assessing the quality of life (QoL) of cancer subject s 
participating in clinical trials . The EORTC QLQ -C30 incorporates 9 multi -item scales: 
5 functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional and Social Functioning); 3 symptom 
scales (Fatigue, Pain and Nausea/Vomiting); and a Global Health Status/QoL scale. Six single 
item scales are also included (Dyspnoea, Insomnia, Appetite Lo ss, Constipation, Diarrhoea and 
Financial Difficulties).  The psychometric properties of the questionnaire have been determined 
to be valid, reliable, and sensitiv e [Aaronson et al, 1993 ; Osoba et al, 1994 ; Kaasa et al, 1995 ]. 
11.3.2.  Tumor type -specific PROs  
Tumor type -specific PROs are intended to supplement the EORTC QLQ -C30 with questions 
appropriate for the symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_637664]. Please refer to  the 
EORTC website for the PRO validation documentation. Tumor type -specific PROs will include:  
• QLQ -PAN26: pancreatic  cancer

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Event  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a 
pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, 
whether or not considered study -drug related . An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom of disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, without any 
judgement about causality (see current ICH guidelines) . 
In this study, investigators should report A Es based on CTCAE v5.[ADDRESS_852311] 
consensus criteria in the event of either CRS or immune effector cell associated neuro toxicity 
ELI-002  Protocol ELI -002-001 
Elicio Therapeutics, Inc.    Version 8.0 
 
Confidential  114 syndrome (ICANS). Treatment -emergent A Es (TEAEs) are defined as events not present prior to 
the initiation of study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity of 
frequency following exposure to study treatment. AEs must be recorded in the eCRF and on 
forms as provided by [CONTACT_637667] . 
An AE does not include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (eg , surgery, endoscopy, dental extraction, transfusion); 
the condition th at necessitates the procedure is the AE  
• Any pre -existing disease or condition, or laboratory or ECG abnormality, which is 
present prior to the start of the study medication and that does not worsen  
• Laboratory or ECG abnormalities without clinical significance (ie , those which do not 
require medical intervention or that do not result in discontinuation or interruption of the 
study drug)  
• Situations where an adverse medical event has not occurred (ie, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800], social admission)  
• Overdose of study medication or any concomitant medication without any signs or 
symptoms, unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637581] A Es for each subject begins from the time the 
subject is administered the first dose of study drug through end of treatment (EOT) or early 
discontinuation of treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE  is an AE occurring during any trial phase (ie, screening , treatment, or follow -up), and at 
any dose of the investigational product, that fulfils one or more of the following:  
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -threatening  
• It requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
• It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
The time period for collecting and documenting SAEs for each subject begins from the time the 
subject provides informed consent through the end of study (EOS) or early discontinuation from 
the study.  For this study, the reporting of CRS and/or ICANS /Neurotoxicity  events will follow 
the SAE timelines and reporting requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reactogenicity to the Vaccine  
Injection site reactions, skin rash, and pruritis will not be considered a DLT or safety event and 
should be recorded in the  patient diary and  eCRF for reactogenicity. (See Section  6.7.3  for DLT 
ELI-002  Protocol ELI -002-001 
Elicio Therapeutics, Inc.    Version 8.0 
 
Confidential  115 Guidelines , Section  6.8.5  for toxicity  management,  and Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for SAE definition.)  
Severe skin rashes such as Steven -Johnson Syndrome or toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN) will 
be considered a DLT and should be reported on the eCRF as safety events including SAE as 
appropriate. Reactogenicity monitoring  will include subject ’s reactogenicity to the trial drug 
(vaccine). This  will be captured at several time points as follows:  
• 1-hour post ELI-002 dose administration (subject s will be observed in the clinic for at 
least 1 -hour after each dose)  
• 1-week post ELI-002 dose administration (subject s will record daily observations in 
diary)  
• Any unresolved reactogenicity event should be followed until resolution . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cytokine Release Synd rome  
The definition, management, and grading  of CR S are provided in Section  6.8. 
12.3. Relationship to Trial  Drug  
An investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related , or Related ). The investigator 
should decide whether, in his or her medical judg ement, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  
Unrelated : The AE is definitely not associated with the study drug administration and is judged 
related to causes other than the study drug.  
Possibly Related (Suspected Adverse Reaction [SAR]) : A causal relationship between treatment 
with the study drug and the AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the relationship cannot be 
ruled out. This implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than a related AE. Additional 
evidence to sugge st a SAR includes:  
• Occurrence of uncommon A Es that are known to be strongly associated with drug 
exposure (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema, blood dyscrasias, rhabdomyolysis, hepatic 
injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome)  
• Occurrence of A Es that are uncommon in the study population, but not commonly 
associated with drug exposure (eg, intussusception in healthy infants)  
Related (Adverse Reaction) : A causal relationship between the study drug administration and the 
AE is definite.  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possible” the event will be considered related to the investigational product for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting.  
ELI-002  Protocol ELI -002-001 
Elicio Therapeutics, Inc.    Version 8.0 
 
Confidential  116 12.4. Severity  of Adverse Events  
The CTCAE Version 5 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity 
for each AE based on this general guideline:  
• Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated   
• Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age  
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ( such as preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_637582] s, using the telephone, managing money, etc .)  
• Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
self-care activities of daily living (such as  bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden )  
• Grade 4  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5  Death related to AE.  
For CRS/ICANs, A Es will be graded according to the ASTCT criteria ( Table  18 and Table  21). 
12.5. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_127205]/or in response to an open question 
from the trial personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_637668] . Treatment emergent A Es (TEAEs) are defined as events not present 
prior to the initiation of study drug or any event already present that worsens in either intensity 
of frequency following exposure to study treatment. A Es must be recorded in the eCRF and on 
forms as provided by [CONTACT_637667] . The AE term  should be reported in standard medical terminology 
when possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), severity , causality, action taken, outcome, and whether or not it 
caused the subject  to discontinue the trial. 
Severity  will be assessed according to CTCAE or ASTCT as appropriate for the event. For AEs 
not described in the consensus criteria, the following scale  will be used : 
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated . Concomitant prescription 
medications are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms ) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities . Concomitant 
prescription medications/treatment(s) may be needed for relief of symptoms ) 
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities . Requires interruption 
or discontinuation of study medication. Systemic drug therapy or other treatment is 
needed ) 
Reactogenicity  will be assessed according to the toxicity grading scale for local reactions for 
preventive vaccines  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
ELI-002  Protocol ELI -002-001 
Elicio Therapeutics, Inc.    Version 8.0 
 
Confidential  117 It is important to distinguish between serious and severe A Es. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  [IP_ADDRESS] . An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious.  
12.6. Pregnancy  
Should a pregnancy occur  within [ADDRESS_852312] be reported on Elicio ’s paper pregnancy form. Neither 
pregnancy itself nor an induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy for non -medical 
reasons is considered an AE. However, an induced therapeutic abortion to terminate a pregnancy 
due to complications or other medical reasons will be recorded  as an SAE. The underlying 
medical reason for this procedure should be recorded  as the AE term. Pregnancy outcomes 
considered to be SAEs are:  
• Spontaneous abortion (miscarriage)  
• Stillbirth  
• Induced therapeutic abortion to terminate pregnancy due to complications or other 
medical reasons  
• Neonatal death; this includes all neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of the 
expected birthdate (ie, either before or after the expected birth date)  
• Infant death occurring 1 month after birth, if the investigator assesses the death as 
possibly related to in utero exposure to study treatment  
• Congenital anomaly (in live birth or aborted fetus)  
If the subject has signed the pregnancy informed consent, t he outcome of all pregnancies 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be 
followed up and documented even if the subject  was discontinued from the trial. 
12.7. Reporting Adverse Events  
All A Es and SAEs will be reported on the appropriate eCRF pages , which will also be the 
reporting mechanism to Elicio safety/pharmacovigilance . All A Es (related and unrelated) will be 
recorded from first dose administration until 30 days after the end of study treatment 
administration. All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of the ICF  
until [ADDRESS_852313] source records.  
Elicio  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain events. It is the 
PI’s responsibility to notify the  Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of all SAEs that occur at his or

all unexpected, serious, drug -related events ( Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
[S[LOCATION_003]R ] Reports) that occur during the clinical trial. Each  trial center  is responsible for 
notifying its IRB of these additional SAEs  in accordance with local requirements . If the clinical 
site submits to a central IRB, S[LOCATION_003]R reports will be submitted by [CONTACT_637669].  
12.8. Extension  Protocol  
Subject s who remain in the trial until the end of the required  Follow -up Period may be eligible to 
enroll in a separate Extension protocol to continue to receive further mKRAS /mNRAS  lymph 
node immunotherapy  to maintain effective levels of antigen -specific T -cells.

test or serum tumor biomarkers persisting ≥[ADDRESS_852315] ELI -002 consists of up to 2 amphiphile -modified 
KRAS peptides plus an amphiphile -modified C pG adjuvant.  
Each cohort will be evaluated separately ; however, combined analysis of the RP2D and higher 
dose cohorts may be carried out to improve statistical precision via larger sample size . 
13.1. Sample Size  
Approximately [ADDRESS_852316] s are planned to enroll: [ADDRESS_852317] s enrolled in the 3+[ADDRESS_852318] deviation, 
median, minimum value, and maximum value. Categorical variables will be summarized using 
frequency counts and percentages. Time to event data will be summarized using the 
Kaplan -Meier method. Where appropriate, CIs around point estimates will be presented, and 
estimates of the median and other quantiles, as well as individual time points (for time to event 
data) will be produced.  
All statistical hypothesis testing within (for change from baseline) and between dose cohorts will 
be conducted at the [ADDRESS_852319] dose.  No formal 
tests of hypotheses are planned for safety analyses.  
The following methods will be used in this trial for descriptive summaries and hypothesis testing 
unless otherwise indicated:  
• Mean change from baseline . Compared to zero change and compared between dose 
levels  using  t-tests from repeated measures as the analysis model and/or via non -
parametric tests based on ranks, as appropriate.  
• Median time to event for a single group (non -comparative).  The Kaplan -Meier 
method will be used to estimate median time to event; 2 -sided CIs will use the 
method of Brookmeyer and Crowley; p -values will not be computed.  
• Hazard ratio of a time to event endpoint comparing two groups.  A stratified Cox 
proportional hazards model using Efron’s method for ties will be used to estimate the 
HR and 2 -sided CI; p-values will be computed using the log rank test.

Elicio Therapeutics, Inc.    Version 8.0 
 
Confidential  120 • Time to event analysis at a fixed time point.  The Kaplan -Meier method will be 
used to estimate the survival (or event -free) probability; 2 -sided Cis for a single 
survival probability or for a difference of two survival probabilities will use the 
complementary log -log method; p -values will be computed using the complementary 
log-log test statistic.  
• Binary endpoint for a single group (non -comparative) . The binomial parameter 
(probability of success/failure) will be estimated by [CONTACT_637670]. 2 -sided 
CIs will use the method of Clopper and Pearson; p -values will not be computed.  
• Comparison of binary endpoint between two groups . Difference of sample 
proportions will be used to estimate the difference in binomial parameters. 2 -sided 
CIs will use Newcombe’s score method without continuity correction; p -values will 
be computed using stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test. 
All descriptive statistical analyses will be performed using SAS statistical software (Version  9.3 
or later), unless otherwise noted. Medical History and AEs will be coding using MedDRA.  
No adjustment for multiple testing will be made.

Demographic and other baseline data, including but not limited to age, sex, race, ethnicity, 
height, weight, baseline ECOG Performance Status, primary diagnosis, disease stage at diagnosis 
and screening, and prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], r adiation, and surgeries, etc.) 
will be listed individually by [CONTACT_637671] (continuous data) or contingency tables (categorical data). The FAS will be 
used.  
13.3.2.  Immunogenicity Analysis  
A positive immune response for each KRAS /NRAS  peptide will be determined, for example, 
using a non -parametric distribution -free resampling method for the Fluorospot  assay. For all 
immunogenicity assays, cellular immune responses to ELI -[ADDRESS_852324] will be used to compare magnitude of response 
or changes before and after vaccination when applicable. The p -values associated with these tests 
will not be used for hypothesis testing.  
13.3.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relapse -free survival  
Relapse -free survival  will be censored on the date of the last evaluable CT scan on trial for 
subject s who do not have recurrence and who do not die while on trial. Subject s without any post 
baseline CT scans will have their RFS time censored on the date of randomization. Subject s who 
withdraw from the trial (including withdrawal of consent and lost to follow -up) will be censored 
at the last of the last CT scan. For disease recurrence documented by [CONTACT_637672], the actual date of the scan will be used. For death or recurrence after no mor e than 
ELI-[ADDRESS_852325] evaluable disease assessment.  
RFS (in months) is calculated as : 
• [(date of recurrence/death – date of randomization) + 1)]/30.4375  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Biomarker Response  
Response will be defined as any subject with a reduction or clearance  of biomarker (ctDNA or 
serum tumor biomarker)  compared with baseline  [Tie et al, 2019 ]. Subject s who do not attain a 
response  for any reason (eg, missing data due to withdrawal) will be counted as non -responders. 
The subset of subjects with biomarker clearance will also be summarized.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of Duration of Biomarker Response  
Duration of biomarker response  (ie, reduction or clearance)  will be reported for  subject s who 
meet the biomarker  reduction  or clearance  definitions .  
• Duration of biomarker reduction  is calculated from the date of the first biomarker  
blood test with a reduction compared to baseline, until  the earliest date of any of the 
following events: (1) subsequent increase in  biomarker ; (2) subsequent disease 
recurrence; or (3) death due to any cause.  
• Duration of biomarker clearance  is calculated from the date of the first negative 
ctDNA  test or the date when the serum tumor biomarker is ≤ULN  to the earliest date 
of any of the following events: (1) subsequent positive ctDNA  test or subsequent 
serum tumor biomarker >ULN ; (2) subsequent disease recurrence; or (3) death due to 
any cause.  
If a subject  has not experienced any of the events  for reduction or clearance , duration of response  
will be censored on the date of the last biomarker  assessment.  
Response duration will be summarized for each cohort . Assessment of biomarker response  
duration is considered supportive of the primary biomarker response analysis and is not 
considered part of the fixed sequence testing procedure to control overall type 1 error.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of 1 -Year RFS 
Exploratory a nalysis of 1 -year RFS will be reported . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis of OS  
Exploratory a nalysis of OS will be reported . 
OS is calculated from the day of first ELI -[ADDRESS_852326] 
recorded date known alive. OS (in months) is defined as : 
• [(date of death or last known alive  – date of  first ELI -002 dose ) + 1)]/30.4375

All data will be stored in a validated database that is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_637583]. The principal 
investigator (or sub -investigator) must review, sign and date the eCRFs a t the time of study 
completion to attest to the accuracy and completeness of the study data at the clinical site.  
14.2. Source Documentation  
Source documents are defined as documentation of the observations and activities of a clinical 
study. Source documents may include, but are not limited to, study progress notes, email 
correspondence, subject QLQs  (or PROs), subject diaries, laboratory data and pathology and/or 
imaging reports. All source documents for this study will be maintained by [CONTACT_637677], the sponsor designee and regulatory authorities. The signed 
informed consent document and statement of cons ent will be maintained in the subject study 
records, and a copy of the informed consent will be provided to the subject.  
14.3. Study Drug Accountability  
At all times, a record of the study drug inventory and study drug accountability must be 
maintained. Inventory and accountability records must be readily available to the study monitor, 
the sponsor , and any regulatory authority. The investigator, in conjunction with the site 
pharmacy or study drug preparation lab, is responsible for ensuring accountability of all used and 
unused study drug.  
At the end of the trial, and following study monitor verification of drug accountability, Elicio or 
its designee will provide instruction for the destruction of unused study drug supplies remaining 
at the clinical site. During the conduct of the study, use d vials may be destroyed on -site if Elicio 
has approved the destruction policy and only after the study monitor has verified drug 
accountability. If study drug destruction by [CONTACT_637678], 
the investigator must en sure that all study drug is destroyed in compliance with institutional 
ELI-[ADDRESS_852327] be adequately documented.  
14.4. Laboratory Assessments  
Local laboratories will be responsible to analy ze safety laboratory tests for this study. All local 
laboratory results will be captured on eCRFs. Central labs will be used for the analysis of 
pharmacodynamic and immunology assays, as well as specialty biomarkers.  
14.5. Trial  Monitoring  
During the trial, Elicio and/or its designee will perform periodic monitoring visits to ensure that 
the protocol and ICH/GCP are being followed in the conduct of the study. Study monitoring will 
be performed in accordance with ICH/GCP, the sponsor and/or its designee’s SOPs, the study 
protocol and study plans, as well as applicable local regulations. The monitor will maintain 
current personal knowledge of the study through observation, review of study records and source 
documentation, as well as discussion on the conduct of the study with the investigator and site 
staff. The monitor will review all study source documents to ensure that the eCRFs are 
completed and accurate.  
The monitor, Elicio representatives and regulatory authorit ies will be given direct access to all 
study related documentation (such as medical charts/records, laboratory reports, diagnostic 
reports, study drug logs), study staff training documentation and institutional SOPs  to verify 
study conduct . His verification may continue following completion of the study.  It is important 
that the investigator and study staff are available during the monitoring visit and that sufficient 
time is devoted to items requir ing follow -up or resolution.  
14.6. Protocol Deviations  
A deviation from the protocol is a departure from the procedures and/or processes approved by 
[CONTACT_637679].   
Protocol deviations will be reported to the sponsor or its designee as they occur or are discovered 
and must be documented as appropriate in the study source record. In addition, protocol 
deviations will be reported to the IRB per the individual IRB guidel ines. The monitor will 
document deviations discovered throughout the course of monitoring visits and review of the 
eCRFs. These deviations, and any necessary corrective actions, will be reviewed and discussed 
with the sponsor and the investigators as appli cable.  
14.7. Audits and Inspections  
During and/or after the completion of the study, a uthorized representatives of Elicio , a regulatory 
authority, or an IRB may visit the  trial center  to perform audits or inspections, including source 
data verification. The purpose of a n audit or inspection , which is independent from routine 
monitoring,  is to systematically and independently evaluate  all trial-related activities and 
documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, according to the protocol, GCP 
and curre nt ICH guidelines , and a pplicable regulatory requirements.

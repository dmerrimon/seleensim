Statistical Analysis:
Continuous participant demographic variables (e.g., age, body mass index (BMI), time since 
surgery) were summarized with descriptive statistics (e.g., sample size, mean, standard error). 
Categorical variables (e.g., sex assigned at birth) were summarized with descriptive statistics (e.g., 
counts and percentages). Summary statistics are also presented by [CONTACT_1570]. A chi-squared 
test was used to evaluate between- -sample t-
tests were used to evaluate between-  
 
All primary and secondary outcomes were continuous. For each outcome, change scores were 
calculated as: post-intervention (4-[ADDRESS_457464]-surgery) – pre-intervention (baseline pre-
surgery). Two-sample t-tests were then used to assess between-
scores. Distributional assumptions of two-sample t-tests were assessed using plots of each 
outcome. An analysis of blinding was performed for each of the participants, the data analysts, and 
the primary investigator of the study. Chi-square tests (or Fisher’s exact tests in the case of small 
cell counts) were used to identify any association between guesses and treatment group for each of 
the blinded groups. All analyses were performed using R (R version 4.1.2, R Core Team, 2023) and

 Version Date: 02 /06/2019   STUDY SUMMARY : 
The purpose of this study is to : a) identify enablers and barriers to deliberate ultraviolet 
light exposure  by [CONTACT_192789] ( SMM), and b) quantify the extent of their 
deliberate ultraviolet light exposure .   
 
OBJECTIVES: 
Aim 1: To develop survey items to assess tanning attitudes and behaviors  
Nine s urvey items used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_192783]’s Institute for Sexual and 
Gender Minority Health and Wellbe ing. Discussions with the PI, research personnel and 
members of  the institute developed the hypothesis that in addition to the previously 
reported appearance motivations young SMM may be engaging in tanning (indoors or 
outdoors) as a social activity. A tenth survey item w as developed to assess deliberate 
tanning as a social activity.    
 Aim 2:  Analyze the tanning attitudes and behavior  data acquired in an online 
survey of young adult sexual minority males , who regularly participate in the 
RADAR study .   
RADAR is a longitudinal study with cohorts from the greater Chicago region recruited 
between 2008 and 2015. The 10 survey items about tanning attitudes and behaviors were added to the online survey that examines SMMs’ behavior in the prior 6 months.  
 
Knowledge gained from this study may be help reduce deliberate ultraviolet light 
exposure and the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_192784].  
 
BACKGROUND : 
Sexual minority males , who have one of the highest known estimated lifetime skin cancer 
prevalence, are an at -risk group for developi[INVESTIGATOR_192785]. The estimated lifetime skin cancer 
prevalence for SMM  is 8.1% , compared to 6.7% for heterosexual men . (Singer 2020) Elevated 
rates of skin cancer  among SMM  are thought to be driven by [CONTACT_192790], who are motivated by [CONTACT_192791], appearance concerns , and affect regulation. (Blashill 
2017, Mansh 2015, Morrison 2019)  In the past nationally representative samples of US 
adolescents found that SMM  were significantly more likely than heterosexual men to have ever 
engaged in indoor tanning by 16 years of age (27.0% vs 8.6%; odds ratio 3.9; 95% CI, 1.6- 9,8) 
(Blashill 2014,2017) .  
 
In national self -reported surveys of adolescent men,  who participated in indoor tanning,  were  
more frequent outdoor sunbathers and substance users, such as tobacco or alcohol abuse and 
marijuana use (Demko 2003,  Miyamoto 2012, Miller 2018 ). Historically, adolescents and young 
adults living in the American Midwes t (adjusted odds ratio 2.38;95% confidence interval 1.53 -
3.68)  have high rates of indoor tanning because extremes in the availability of natural light 
appear to send intentional tanners indoors. (Demko 2003)  The Midwest has the highest 
proportion of gyms with tanning beds. (Pagoto 2019)  Even i n regions of the US with more 
available natural sunlight  than the Midwest , 25% of young adult (AYA) males in a college in 
Alabama concurrently engaged in both types of tanning, indoor and outdoor. (Daniel 2018) 
Excessive tanning  may be a manifestation of tanning addiction (Mosher 2010,Miller 2018 ) 
Addictive tanning may have a physiological basis, as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light

effects. (Kourosh 2010)  
 
The decline in indoor tanning among US adults from 2007 -2018 is attributed to indoor tanning 
youth access legislation. (Bowers 2020).  It is possible that the 2012 Chicago and 2013 Illinois 
law banning indoor tanning f or teens younger than 18 influenced  the tanning habits of young 
SMM.  (banning laws ) While SMM may engage in both types of tanning, data on outdoor tanning 
by [CONTACT_192792]. We will address this gap  by [CONTACT_192793], tobacco, and marijuana use.  
 
STUDY ENDPOINTS:  
Aim 1 : Primary Outcome:  
Determine the test, re- test reliability of the 10 survey items using the RADAR 
participants in the deidentified database.  
 
Aim 2: Primary  Outcome:  
Perform analysis of the data acquired in [ADDRESS_228917] deviation of the 10 survey items with Likert scale (1 strongly disagree, 5 strongly agree) will be assessed  for those who tan occasionally and those who tan more than 10 times 
in 6 months .   
 STUDY INTERVENTION S: 
none  
 PROCEDURES INVOLVE D:  
After  500 responses to the online survey are collected, the deidentified data will be 
analyzed.  
 DATA AND SPECIMEN BANKING : 
See Data Management . Specimens will not be banked.  
 SHARING RESULTS WITH PARTICIPANTS : 
Since this is a deidentified database, the results of the analysis cannot be shared with 
the participants.  
 STUDY TIMELINES:   
Reliability test (test, re -test performed after 2 weeks) will be performed in the summer of 
2019. Participants will complete one online survey in the 6- month period from Sept 
2019- Feb 2020.   
 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:  
Inclusion Criteria:  
- Young adult SMM (age 18 -39) 
- Able to read English

Exclusion criteria  
- None  
 
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS : 
This study will not include the participation of vulnerable populations  
 
PARTICIPANT  POPULATION S: 
500-600 young SMM, who regularly participate in the RADAR study  
 RECRUITMENT METHODS : 
Participants are not recruited for this study . This is a secondary analysis of an existing 
deidentified database.  
 COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES : 
Research subjects will not be compensated.   
 RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS : 
The potential risks to participants are expected to be minimal if they occur.   Participants may enhance their awareness of their risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] s kin cancer .   
 POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO PARTICIPANTS : 
Because of the potential for the survey  to enhance awareness of the importance of sun 
protection, participants may  choose to use sun protection. We feel that the potential 
benefits to the subject outweigh the risk of potential enhanced anxiety in discovering 
that they are at risk to develop a skin cancer .  
 
DATA MANAGEMENT AND CONFIDENTIALITY : 
Data Management and Quality Control  
Data will be collected via the RADAR  study . The deide ntifie d data for this deliberate 
ultraviolet light exposure will be exported in an Excel file.   
 
Analysis  
Aim 1. The reliability of the survey items  
For test -retest reliability  of the 10 items , 50 participants would allow a two- category κ to 
be estimated to within ±0 .15 using 95% confidence intervals assuming that Cronbach’s 
alpha values  were 0.[ADDRESS_228919]/ re- test reliability will be 0.75 -0.80.   
 Aim 2. Analysis of survey data  
The demographic characteristics of the population will be compared for never purposely 
tan vs ever purposely tan with χ
2 tests. The primary analysis will be analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) for the mean Likert  scale values of the 10 self -reported survey items. Multiple

predictors of deliberate ultraviolet light exposure to get a tan.

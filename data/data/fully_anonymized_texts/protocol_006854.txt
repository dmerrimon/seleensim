 Page 4 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, [ADDRESS_778786] the following aims:   
Aim 1: Identify early -s
 tage cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological 
mechanisms a ctivated by [CONTACT_590878]. 
We will manipulate exposure to weight discrimination to assess  causal effects on 
cognitive (e.g., impaired self-regulation), affective (e.g., negative emotion), 
behavioral (e.g., comfort eating), and physiological (e.g., inflammation) outcomes in people with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2). We hypothesize that, relative to control 
participants, participants in the weight discrimination condition will display elevated responses on early -stage mechanisms that culminate in increased risk for 
poor cardiovascular health (e.g., more impaired self-regulation, higher negative emotion, lower positive emotion, more social withdrawal and comfort eating, and increased cortisol secretion).  
Aim 2: Identify psychologic a
 l variables that moderate effects of weight 
discrimination. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_590842]. The proposed experiments will identify psychological individual di fferences (e.g., internalized weight bias, self -
compassion) that moderate responses to the weight discrimination manipulation. We 
hypothesize that self -compassion and conscientiousness will be associated with resilience 
to the negative effects of weight di scrimination, while internalized weight bias and 
neuroticism will increase risk for poor outcomes.  
Aim 3: Identify demographic characteristics that moderate effects of weight discrimination. Given the paucity of studies recruiting diverse samples, coupled with methodological limitations of previous research, little is known about whether demographic cha racteristics moderate (amplify or mitigate) effects of weight 
discrimination. We will recruit a diverse sample and conduct exploratory analyses to assess whether the negative effects of weight discrimination differ by [CONTACT_654], sex/gender, race, and ethnicity.   
3.0 Background  
Prior research and gaps in current knowledge. 
Discrimination is a critical social determinant of health that underlies poor health 
outcomes.1-4 One common but understudied form of discrimination is weight 
discrimination. Weight discrimination is the behavioral manifestation of weight stigma —
the social devaluation of people with excess body weight.5,[ADDRESS_778787] people with obesity are perpetuated by [CONTACT_590879].6 Indeed, 
weight discrimination is a pervasive —sometimes daily —experience for people with 
obesity.5,7-9 Encounters with weight discrimination range from inappropriate comments

 Page 5 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, [ADDRESS_778788] when 
controlling for body mass index (BMI),14,16- [ADDRESS_778789] largely ignored the possibility that different people respond to weight discrimination in different ways. To address this gap, we will identify psychological factors (e.g., self-compassion) and demographic characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity) that moderate the negative health effects of weight discriminatio n.  
 SIGNIFICANCE  
Obesity is widespread and people with obesity are frequently subjected to discrimination. Currently, 42.4% of US adults meet criteria for obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2).23 By 2030, nearly 1 in 2 adults is expected to meet criteria for obesity and 1 in 4 
will meet criteria for class II or III obesity (BMI ≥ 35 or 40 kg/m2).[ADDRESS_778790] prevalence found in non-Hispanic Black adults (49.6%), followed by [CONTACT_590880] (44.8%) and non-Hispanic White adults (42.2%).
23,25 Weight discrimination is a pervasive—sometimes 
daily —experience for people with obesity.5,7-9 Encounters with weight discrimination 
range from inappropriate comments and bullying to diminished opportunities for education, employment, and healthcare.
5-11 A recent meta- analysis on the prevalence of 
weight discrimination fou nd that 19% of individuals with class I obesity (BMI = 30-34.9 
kg/m2) and 42% of individuals with class II (BMI = 35-39.9 kg/m2) or III obesity (BMI ≥ 
40 kg/m2) have experienced weight discrimination.9  
Weight discrimination is a serious public health problem.5,8 Weight stigma stems 
from the perception that body weight is highly controllable and thus people with obesity are personally responsible for their weight.
6 Although the etiology of obesity is complex 
and involves many factors (e.g., genetics, behavior, environment), the prevailing message that weight can be easily controlled through diet and exercise perpetuates negative stereotypes and prompts discrimination against people with obesity.
[ADDRESS_778791] yet widely held belief that stigmatizing people for their weight will motivate them to lose weight. The reality is quite the opposite: Being stigmatized for one’s weight is highly stressful and prompts further weight gain, resulting in a vicious cycle between weight discrimination, obesity, and poor health.
6,8,14,20,26,27

 Weight discrimination is associated with increased risk for poor cardiovascular 
health. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_590843] (e.g., angina pectoris, tachycardia),
17,18 as well as established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
including arteriosclerosis, diabetes, depression, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and obesity.12-14,18,28 
Weight discrimination is also associated with physiological processes underlying CVD 
such as  high allostatic load, lipid/metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress, and 
inflammation.19-22,26 Importantly, many (though not all) of the associations between 
weight discrimination and CVD risk remain after controlling for BMI,14,16- 18,[ADDRESS_778792] been largely ineffective.
29 As weight discrimination continues to be a pervasive societal problem, 
there is a critical need for interventions to better support individuals who are the target of weight discrimination.  
To inform such interventions, research is needed to identify earl y-stage  mechanisms 
that underlie the adverse effects of weight discrimination, as well as  moderators of 
those effects.  Guided by [CONTACT_590881] (Figure 1), we propose 
that repeated 
exposure to weight discrimination results in a cascade of negative cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological processes that gradually culminate in poor cardiovascular health. These effects are expected to be moderated by [CONTACT_590882]. Our model draws on the broader literature on interpersonal discrimination (e.g., due to race, gender, sexual orientation) and health 
3,6,15,30,[ADDRESS_778793]. Tomiyama’s cyclic model of weight stigma,26 which proposes that exposure to 
weight discrimination triggers a stress response that prompts physiological (e.g., cortisol secretion), emotional (e.g., feelings of shame), and behavioral (e.g., impaired self-

PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 7 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 regulation, comfort eating) processes that prom ote weight gain, thus creating a vicious 
cycle between weight stigma and obesity.  
Little is known about mechanisms that explain the link between weight 
discrimination and poor health. Previous studies have suggested mechanisms that may underlie the link between weight discrimination and poor cardiovascular health (e.g., overeating, cortisol secretion), yet most of this work relies on correlational studies, thus limiting the ability to make causal inferences.
19-22,[ADDRESS_778794] documented an association between self -reported experiences with weight 
discrimination and unhealthy eating behavior  (e.g., overeating, binge eating).13,34,[ADDRESS_778795] will advance the literature by [CONTACT_590883].  
Identifying moderating variables will guide interventions to reduce the harmful 
effects of weight discrimination.  Previous research has largely failed to examine 
variables that moderate effects of weight discrimination on poor health outcomes. To 
address this gap, we will identify both psychological variables (Aim 2) and demographic 
characteristics (A im 3) that moderate responses to experimentally manipulated weight 
discrimination. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_590844]. 
For example, one candidate is internalized weight bias, or the extent to which people 
devalue and stigm atize themselves for their weight. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], participants with 
higher internalized weight bias were more likely to view a negative social interaction as 
reflecting weight discrimination and, in turn, to display more negative affect, poorer self -
esteem, and higher self -regulation failure. Replicating this finding in the current project 
would identify a valuable intervention target for mitigating the harmful effects of weight 
discrimination. Identifying demographic moderators (e.g., race, ethnicity, sex/gender) 
will also be useful for personalizing interventions to those groups with the highest need.     
Using a rigorous experimental approach, we will identify moderators of and mechanisms through which weight discrimination undermines cardiovascular 
health.  Identifying moderators and mechanisms is a critical first step for intervention 
development.
[ADDRESS_778796] either primed obesity stereotypes37-39 or manipulated concerns that participants 
could be stigmatized for their weight  (i.e., activated weight -based social identity 
threat).40-44 Yet these manipulations lack the core component of weight stigma – personal 
devaluation for having excess body weight -- because the stereotypes primed were not personally directed at participants and the social identity threat manipulations never involved any actual devaluation of the participant. Reliance on these manipulations may underestimate the full impact of weight discrimination. We are aware of only one study (by [CONTACT_15957]- I [CONTACT_590921]) that experimentally manipulated exposure to weight 
discrimination by [CONTACT_590884] a shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_590845].
45 Thus, to address the dearth

discrimination commonly occurs (e.g., the workplace).

discrimination.
7 Whether effects of weight discrimination di ffer by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity, 
however, is largely unknown. We will help fill this important gap by [CONTACT_590885]/ethnic minority participants to directly investigate whether race or ethnicity moderates effects of experimentally manipula ted weight discrimination on 
early -stage mechanisms.  
Preliminary Studies  Our preliminary studies provide valuable pi[INVESTIGATOR_590846]’s ability to (1) conduct rigorous lab- based experiments that manipulate weight discrimination, (2) 
recru it sufficient numbers of adults with obesity, including racial and ethnic minority 
participants, and (3) work together in successful collaborations. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] 1: Qualitative Study on People’s Experiences with and Responses to 
Weight Discrimination . We conducted in -depth qualitative interviews with a diverse 
national sample of 32 adult men and women with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2) who had 
experienced mistreatment for their weight.46,47 We identified common forms of weight -
based discrimination (e.g., receiving offensive comments, being stereotyped, experiencing social rejection) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_590847] 
(e.g., health care, employment). For instance, weight discrimination was highly prevalent in employment settings. Participants were frequently labeled with derogatory obesity-
related stereotypes (e.g., lazy, incompetent, unintelligent, lacking self -discipline) and 
regularly excluded from job- related opportunities for advancement (e.g., trainings, 
promotions). We also identified common cognitive (e.g., self -regulation deficits, self -
acceptance); emotional (e.g., psychological distress, shame, anger); and behavioral (e.g., 
unhealthy eating behavior, social avoidance or withdrawal, social support seeking) 
responses to weight discrimination. These findings guided Aim 1 of the proposed 
research by [CONTACT_590886], as well as cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes (mechanisms) activated in response to weight discrimination. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] 2: Early -Stage Cognitive and Affective Responses to Manipulated Weight 
Discrimination . This lab experiment demonstrated that perceptions of weight 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 9 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 discrimination evoke a number of negative responses.48 Adults with obesity (N=109) 
participated in a “first impressions” study in which they received negative (vs. neutral 
control) feedback from a partner (a member of the study team). Participants who viewed the negative f eedback as weight discrimination showed elevated negative emotions 
(shame, anger) and poorer performance on a self-regulation task (Stroop task).  
Psychological moderators. Further, participants high in internalized weight bias 
(IWB) and neuroticism were m ore likely to view the negative feedback as reflecting 
weight discrimination and to report more negative emotions, whereas participants high in self-compassion and conscientiousness demonstrated the opposite pattern. Findings 
support Aim 1 by [CONTACT_590887] -regulation and Aim 2 by [CONTACT_590888].   
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] 3: Cognitive, Affective, and Behavioral Correlates of Expectations of 
Rejection . This lab study identified individua l differences associated with expectations of 
rejection during a novel social interaction and the implications of those expectations for psychological and behavioral outcomes. Before completing a task with a partner (a member of the study team), adults with obesity (N=111) reported the extent to which they thought they would be accepted vs. rejected by [CONTACT_304485]. Participants who anticipated rejection by [CONTACT_590889]. Expectations of rejection were also associated wit h social withdrawal, indicated by [CONTACT_590890].  
Psychological moderators. Participants high in internalized weight bias and 
neuroticism reported higher expectations of rejection, more distress and anxiety, and greater social withdrawal. In contrast, participants high in self-compassion demonstrated the opposite pattern. These findings demonstrate support for Aim 2. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] 4: Experiences with Weight Discrimination in Black, Hispanic, and 
Sexual Minority Women. We recently conducted another qualitative study with 32 Black, Hispanic, and sexual minority (e.g., lesbian) women (BMIs ≥ 30 kg/m
2) to assess their 
lived experiences with weight discrimination. In addition to replicating several findings from Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116] 1, we observed additional sample-specific findings. Although higher body weight was perceived to be more acceptable within Black and Hispanic communities, women from these communities nevertheless reported facing high levels of weight stigma, which contributed to cumulative stress produced by [CONTACT_590891]/ethnicity. Further, although levels of internalized weight bias varied, most of the women interviewed appeared to struggle with at least some degree of internalized weight bias. These findings support Aims 2 and 3 by [CONTACT_590892].   
Background: Scientific Rationale  
Rationale for experimental manipulations. T he proposed study will leverage rigorous 
methods from the extensive experimental social psychology literature on social exclusion. This literature has produced well-validated procedures for manipulating social rejection and personal devaluation in effective but ethical ways.
49,50 These manipulations 
produce immediate behavioral effects  but, after thorough debriefing, no lasting distress or 
adverse effects. The proposed study relies on a controlled laboratory manipulation in which participants are led to believe that they were excluded from a group of “co-workers” who hold biased viewed toward people with higher body weight and apply 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 10 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 weight-based stereotypes to the participant . This approach simulates a “real -world” 
experience with weight discrimination in a way that is impactful and personally relevant.     
Rationale for outcome measures (Aim 1). Selection of outcome measures (i.e., 
mechanisms) was guided by [CONTACT_346171],6,15,20 theory, 3,6,15,26,30,31 and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_116378].3,30,31 Our central premise is that experiencing weight discrimination elicits a stre ss 
response that results in a cascade of cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological responses which, over time and with repeated exposure, lead to poor cardiovascular health (Figure 1 and Table 1).
6,15,20,26  
Cognitive mechanisms.  We will assess self -regulation. We are interested in two 
aspects of self -regulation: executive control and delay discounting. Executive control 
reflects one’s ability to exert control over one’s thoughts, feelings, and behavior. It plays an essential role in the downregulation of stress
51 
and is associated with a range of positive health behaviors relevant to cardiovascular health.
52 Anticipating that 
one may be stigmatized for one’s weight has been shown to result in poor executive functioning.
40,42 Delay 
discounting reflects a tendency to delay gratification and prioritize long -term incentives,
53 and underlies behaviors such as 
healthy eating and exercise that bri ng long-term cardiovascular benefits.54 Deficits in 
executive control and delay discounting can trigger processes (e.g., heightened stress, overeatin g) that contribute to poor cardiovascular health.
20 We hypothesize that weight 
discrimination will cause deficits in self -regulation (Aim 1).  
Affective mechanisms.  We will assess negative and positive emotion triggered by 
[CONTACT_590893]. Negative, stress-based emotions include shame, anger, anxiety, and distress, which together reflect the broader construct of negative affect. Exposure to obesity stereotypes, weight-based social identity threat , and rejection have 
all been shown to produce high levels of negative affect among people with obesity.
15,26,40,[ADDRESS_778799] risk factor for CVD.55,56 Further, 
specific negative emotional states (e.g.,  shame, distress) are associated with 
psychological (e.g., depression), behavioral (e.g., comfort eating, social withdrawal, sedentary behavior), and physiological stress responses (e.g., cortisol secretion) that can harm cardiovascular health .
26,57,58 Conversely, exposure to weight discrimination is 
linked with low levels of positive emotion. A recent study that used ecological momentary assessment found that more daily epi[INVESTIGATOR_590848] -of-the-day positive emotions (e.g., happi[INVESTIGATOR_008], pride), which in turn were 
associated with less motivation to diet, exercise, and lose weight.
59 With repeated 
exposure to weight discrimination, these affective mec hanisms can become activated Table 1. Outcome variables for proposed experiment

 chronically and lead to a pattern of harmful responses that increase CVD risk. We 
hypothesize that exposure to weight discrimination will increase negative emotion and 
decrease positive emotion (Aim 1).  
Behavioral mechanisms.  We will assess eating behavior, self- efficacy and intentions 
for weight control behavior, and social withdrawal. Numerous studies link weight 
discrimination to unhealthy eating behavior.35 Exposure to weight discrimination is 
predicted to increase comfort eating as a means of immediate stress 
reduction.13,20,26,35,38,60 If left unregulated, however, comfort eating can promote further 
weight gain and impair cardiovascular health.61-64 Additionally, exposure to weight 
stigma undermines self -efficacy for engaging in effective weight control behavior 
(confidence in one’s a bility to resist eating in certain situations).39,43,59,[ADDRESS_778800] cardiovascular 
health.71-73 We hypothesize that exposure to weight discrimination will increase comfort 
eating, reduce self -efficacy and intentions for weight control behavior, and increase 
social withdrawal (Aim 1).   
Physiological mechanisms.  We will assess salivary cortisol, a steroid hormone that 
regulates the body’s response to stress. Experimental work has demonstrated sustained 
cortisol reactivity in response to weight stigma (vs. control).44,45,74 Cortisol contributes to 
weight gain directly by [CONTACT_590894], especially hyperpalatable foods.20 Over time, weight gain and obesity 
contribute to poor cardiovascular health.75-77 We hypothesize that exposure to weight 
discrimination will lead to increased cortisol reactivity (Aim 1).    
 
Rationale for moderators (Aims 2 and 3).  
Psychological moderators (Aim 2). We will assess psychological individual 
difference variables as pot ential moderators of the effect of weight discrimination on 
primary outcomes. Guided by [CONTACT_80669]3,13,28 and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732] (see below), we 
identified psychological factors expected to moderate the negative effects of weight 
discrimination (Table 2). Internalized wei ght bias and neuroticism are expected to 
amplify the effects of weight discrimination on mechanisms, that is, effects of weight 
discrimination are expected to be stronger in individuals characterized by [CONTACT_590895]. 
People high in internalized weight bias direct weight- based stereotypes at themselves and 
fear stigmatization due to their weight.78-80 They are also more likely to use maladaptive 
strategies to cope with weight stigma (e.g., social is olation, overeating).7,[ADDRESS_778801] personality trait reflecting the tendency to experience negative emotions.82 Thus, 
individuals high in Neuroticism may be more sensitive to and negatively affected by 
[CONTACT_590896]. Conversely, self-compassion and conscientiousness are 
hypothesized to be resilience factors, that is, effects of weight discrimination are expected 
to be weaker in individuals characterized by [CONTACT_590895]. Self -compassion is the tendency 
to respond to painful and difficult experiences with self-kindness rather than self-
criticism.83 Thus, individuals with high self-compassion, may be less likely to display 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 12 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, [ADDRESS_778802] 
personality trait reflecting the tendency to be organized and disciplined.82 People high in 
conscientiousness tend to interpret ambiguous situations as opportunities rather than 
threats84 and thus may be less likely to view unfair treatment as discriminatory. Further, 
people high in conscientiousness may be less likely to engage in unhealthy behaviors 
following weight discrimination.85  
Demographic moderators (Aim 3). We will examine whether age, sex/gender, race, 
and et hnicity moderate the effects of weight discrimination. Analyses will be exploratory 
given the lack of available data supporting robust predictions; most studies do not 
examine demographic moderators and those that have generally show mixed or null 
effects.7,14,[ADDRESS_778803] been limited by [CONTACT_590897] (e.g., correlational designs, use of self- report measures of weight 
discrimination, insufficient representation of racial/ethnic minorities). Thus, definitive 
tests of moderation are needed.  
There are reasons to expect moderating effects. 
For instance, younger people are more likely to 
report experiencing weight discrimination than 
older people,[ADDRESS_778804] 
to sex/gender, women are more likely than men 
to report w eight discrimination9 and women randomly assigned to anticipate weight 
stigma sometimes display relatively worse outcomes (e.g., poorer self-regulation, more 
shame).40 Nevertheless, weight discrimination is associated with adverse health outcomes 
in both men and women, and the magnitude of moderating effects of gender is 
unclear.16,86,87 We considered competing predictions regarding moderation by 
[CONTACT_545]/ethnicity: On one hand, effects of weight discrimination could be amplified among 
Black and  Hispanic/Latino participants relative to non -Hispanic Whites, based on 
evidence indicating that possessing multiple stigmatized identities places individuals at 
greater risk for more cumulative exposure to discrimination and in turn, worse health due 
to greater stress and reduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_175815].46,88,[ADDRESS_778805] whether age, race (Black/African American vs. non- Black), 
ethnicity (Latino/Hispanic vs. non-Latino/Hispanic), or sex/gender (male/man vs. 
female/woman) moderate the effect of weight discrimination on proposed outcomes to 
determine whether certain demographic subgroups are more vulnerable to the negative 
effects of weight discrimination. Although these analyses will be exploratory, it is critical 
to evaluate whether effects are similar or different across sociodemographic groups 
because any differences would indicate that interventions need to be tailored to 
populations, or conversely, if similar, that interventions may be generalizable. 
In summary, this research will identify novel and highly modifiable targets for 
interventions designed to reduce the adverse health effects of weight discrimination. In 
testing moderator variables, this work will identify individuals who display particular vulnerability vs. resilience to the harmful effects of discrimination. Information about Table 2. Proposed moderating variables

likely to benefit from intervention. Given the high prevalence of obesity and the millions of Americans affected by [CONTACT_590896],
23 this work will address a critical public 
health issue. At a broader level, this research will also provide crucial insights into mechanisms that potentially underlie the adverse health consequences of other common forms of social stigma (e.g., discrimination due to race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, social class).  
 
4.0 Study Endpoints  
Outcome measures include cognitive (self -regulation); affective (emotional states); 
behavioral (social withdrawal, comfort eating); and physiological (cortisol secretion) respo nses to experimentally manipulated weight discrimination.  
Measures to assess cognitive mechanisms.  
Delay discounting task.
96 Delay discounting involves the subjective depreciation of 
an incentive bas ed on its timing. The measure assesses the ability to delay gratification, 
that is, a tendency to prioritize larger long- term rewards over smaller short -term rewards. 
Participants will complete a well-validated task in which they choose short vs. long- term 
rewards from a set of five dichotomous choices (e.g., to receive $1 immediately or $10 in one month).
97 The task takes about 1 minute to administer, is highly reliable, and 
correlates well with longer and more extensive measures of delay discounting97 (metric: 
discount rate (k) ranges from 0-1).  
Stroop task. The Stroop task provides a measure of executive control by [CONTACT_590898] (reading) in favor of performing a more 
controlled task (color naming). The task is a classic, widely-used and well- validated 
measure of executive control.[ADDRESS_778807] Scale -Expanded Form (PANAS- X)100 to assess emotions in 
response to the experimental manipulation. The scale demonstrates good validity and 
reliability.100 Emotions will be assessed with 46 adjectives (e.g., angry, confident). 
Participants will be asked to indicate the extent to which they feel each emotion at that 
moment (1= very sl ightly or not at all  to 5= extremely). A composite score for positive and 
negative emotion will be created by [CONTACT_590899].  
Measures to assess behavioral mechanisms.  
Social withdrawal. Social withdrawal will be assessed with a measure from previous

[ADDRESS_778808].
102 Participants will be asked to rate each of the 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 14 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 foods/drinks to ostensibly guide the development of their food marketing campaign later 
during the study. To avoid ceiling effects and to allow participants to eat without fearing that the experimenter will negatively judge the amount they have eaten, large quantities of each food will be made available. Participants will have 10 minutes to complete the task alone in a private room. Bowls will be weighed (unobtrusively) before and after the task to compute the difference in grams, which will then be converted to kilocalories based on published nutrition information from the food maker.  
Self-efficacy for weight control behavior.  Self-efficacy (perceived confidence) in  
one’s ability to engage in weight control behaviors (e.g., dietary restraint, physical activity) over the next six months will be assessed with items adapted from previous research. Self -efficacy for dietary restraint will be assessed with the short form of the 
Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire
103 (e.g., I can resist eating … when I am 
depressed or down; 8 items). Self- efficacy for physical activity will be assessed with the 
Exercise Self -efficacy Scale104 (e.g., I am confident I can participate in regular exercise 
when … I am tired; 5 items). To mask th e study’s focus, weight control items will be 
interspersed with items assessing self -efficacy for other health behaviors (e.g., flu 
vaccination, sleep, cancer screening). Participants will rate their self -efficacy for each 
behavior on an 8-point scale (0= not at all confident  to 7= very confident ). Items will be 
averaged to create a composite score.  
Intentions for weight control behavior.  Using the same health behaviors assessed for 
self-efficacy, we will also assess intentions for weight control behavior. P articipants will 
be asked to rate the extent to which they intend to engage in each behavior over the next six months.
105 Each item will be rated on an 8 -point scale (0= strongly disagree  to 
7=strongly agree ). Items will be averaged to create a composite score.  
Measures to assess physiological mechanisms. 
Cortisol reactivity.  We will measure cortiso l secretion via saliva (passive drool) at 
three timepoints during the session: baseline, [ADDRESS_778809]- manipulation (to assess 
reactions to the manipulation), and [ADDRESS_778810]-manipulation (to assess recovery).106 
As in previous research,106 participants will be asked to swish their mouths with water 2 -
3 times before the final sample is collec ted to avoid altering cortisol levels. Within 2 
hours of collection, saliva samples will be frozen at -20°C. As in our previous work,48 
samples will be analyzed in duplicate with immunoassays. Participants will be instructed 
to refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, or exercising for 1 hour before the session. To 
reduce diurnal cortisol variability, sessions will be conducted between 1:00 and 7:[ADDRESS_778811] assay results (e.g., 
consumption of food, alcohol, nicotine within the past 12 hours; presence of oral diseases 
or injury; current medications), so that we can control for them in analyses if needed.  
Measures to assess moderators (Table 2).  Moderators will be assessed with an online 
survey completed at least one week before the experimental session. We will use reliable and well -validated measures to assess all psychological moderators. Internalized weight 
bias will be assessed with the 11 -item Modified Weight Bias Internalization Scale.
79 Self-
compassion will be assessed with the 26- item Self -Compassion Scale.83 The 60 -item Big 
Five Inventory-282 will be used to assess  the five core personality domains (extraversion, 
agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness). To mask the study’s focus, the survey will include other measures unrelated to weight stigma (e.g., emotion

 Page 15 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 regulation),107 plus demographic characteristics (e.g., education, biological sex) and 
health status (e.g., physical and mental health status, past medical history).   
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  
The study intervention does not involve drugs or devices that are regulated by [CONTACT_1622].  
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions : experimental (weight 
discrimination) vs. control  manipulation . The experimental manipulation will involve 
three components :  
1. Learning that their group mates  are biased  against overweight people  
2. Receiving feedback that  label s them  with negative weight -based stereotypes ( e.g., 
lacking self -discipline )  
3. Not being selected as a partner  for the remaining lab tasks  (social exclusion).  
In contrast, participants in the control condition will: 1) learn that their groupmates are 
very accepting of overweight people (i.e., they have positive attitudes toward people with higher body weight), 2) receive positive feedback about their personal attributes that are not consistent with negative weight -based stereotypes, and 3) will be told that one of their 
group members had to leave early for an emergency so the pairs cannot be as sembled as 
usual  (i.e., they will not experience social exclusion) . In neither condition is any explicit 
reference to the participant’s body weight, size, or shape included.  
 All three components of the planned experimental  manipulation reflect common 
exam ples of weight discrimination reported by [CONTACT_590901][INVESTIGATOR_10299].
46,[ADDRESS_778812] been used in previous IRB-approved 
experimental studies involving weight stigma or social exclusion. Interacting with a confederate/partner who is biased  against overweight people  (component 1)  has been 
used in published studies
[ADDRESS_778813] interaction with a 
confederate who expresses (veiled) negative stereotypes about the participant  (we will 
not use this latter procedure in our study) . Giving people bogus feedback about their 
personal attributes has a long history in soci al psychology (component 2) . Classic 
and recent studies , for example, have provided participants with bogus negative feedback 
about their intelligence .108,[ADDRESS_778814] given participants bogus negative 
feedback about their  level of competence to assess effects on psychological processes .110 
Finally, t he group exclusion manipulation (component 3)  in which participants interact 
with a group and then learn that nobody chose to work with them has been used in many published studies ,
[ADDRESS_778815] components  a few  years ago 
in a study in which participants received (bogus) negative feedback from their partner to manipulate weight stigma.
48 In (bogus) written feedback  shared with the participant  after 
viewing their video, a  confederate (i.e., member of our study team who was pret ending to 
be their partner for the study)  indicated they were not looking forward to the face -to-face 
interaction with their partner  (as indicated by a “2” on a 7- point scale ranging from 1 ‘not 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 16 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 at all’ to 7 ‘very much’), and that they had a negative overa ll impression of their partner 
(as indicated by a “2” on a 7 -point scale ranging from 1 ‘very negative’ to 7 ‘very 
positive ’). Their feedback also included the following hand- written  note: “Her/His video 
was fine, but I guess I’m not that excited about talking face- to-face.”  
 
In summary, all components of the experimental manipulation used in the current study have been used in previous studies to produce immediate behavioral effects but, after thorough debriefing, no lasting distress or adverse effects have been reported .  
 Please see section 6.0 (Procedures Involved) for more detail about the experimental 
manipulation.   
6.0 Procedures Involved  
Describe and explain the study design. 
The study uses a between -subjects experimental design. Participants will be randomly 
assigned to one of two conditions: experimental  vs. control. 
Research procedures , includin g procedures being performed to monitor 
subjects for safety or minimize risks.  
The study involves two parts: a pre-session online baseline survey and an experimental 
session that will take place in the lab.  Trained research assistants will guide participants 
through study procedures in the lab , including delivery of the intervention 
(man ipulation), assessment of study outcomes, and study debriefing. 
As identified in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_590849],5,7-9,46,113 employment is a common 
setting for weight discrimination. Negative employment outcomes (e.g., lower wages, 
fewer opportunities for promotion) often stem from negative stereotypes that cast employees with obesity as lazy, unintelligent, and incompetent.
5,8 To manipulate weight 
discrimination, this study will adapt manipulation s widely used in previous experimental 
studies of social exclusion (conducted by [CONTACT_15957]- I [CONTACT_590922])50,112 and weight stigma,41 as 
well as our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732].48  
The study will be presented as an investigation of “decision making in the workplace,” during which participants (adults with obesity) will “ interact with ” and receive initial 
impression ratings from three “co- workers” (“confederates,” that is, research assistants 
posing as other participants). Participants will be told that the research team has partnered 
with the FSU marketing department to study how psychological factors affect decision  
making and that during the lab session they w ill work with their groupmates to develop a 
food product marketing campaign.  
To begin, participants will create  a 3-minute introductory “getting to know you” (GTKY) 
video, as in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].
[ADDRESS_778816] of “gettin g to know you” questions (please see attached video 
introduction questions ) they can answer in their video. Participants will also complete a 
“getting to know you” questionnaire in which they will be asked to indicate their personal 
qualities (filler questions that assess self -monitoring  practices) and social values where 
they will be asked to rate their attitudes toward elderly adults, overweight people, and 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 17 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 racial and ethnic minority individuals. Participants’ videos and “getting to know you” 
questionnair e responses (averaged across the three members) will (ostensibly) be shown 
to their group members, and participants will view three similar videos created (ostensibly) by [CONTACT_590902] . (Please s ee two sample confederate videos 
that were uplo aded to IRB staff member Annette Allman’s NiFTy account) . After 
watching the videos , participants will provide impression ratings of each group member.  
Participants will also be informed that, for the next portion of the session, the group will be divided into pairs to perform a taste -test task and develop ideas for the marketing 
campaign. Pairs will (ostensibly) be based on each person’s preferences for whom they most want to work with based on the initial videos, and participants will be asked to indicat e their preferences.  The expe rimenter will say the following:  
“For the marketing task we want to partner people with someone they’d like to work 
with. Things work better that way. So please indicate here on this paper (at the 
bottom of the ‘First Impressions Questionnaire’ page 2) which one of your group mates (A, B, or C) you would most like to work with so we can try to partner you with them.”   
As described in Section 5.0 (Study Intervention), p articipants will be randomly assigned 
to one of two manipulations . In the experimental (weight discrimination) condition, 
participants will learn that their group members are biased  against overweight people but 
not elderly or racial /ethnic minority individuals , as indicated by [CONTACT_590903]’s ratings will be presented in averaged form  
(experimental condition) . Participants  will also receive negative feedback about their 
personal attributes by [CONTACT_590904] -based stereotypes (as indicated 
by [CONTACT_590905] ; 
experimental condition). Although some ratings will be positive ( e.g., they will receive 
high ratings on being friendly and kind), participants will be rated poorly on attributes  
viewed as necessary to develop a strong marketing campaign (i.e., motivation to work hard, possessing self -discipline  to persist at the task , and competence) . 
In the control condition, participants will learn that their group members have positive attitudes tow ard people with higher body weight, as well as elderly and racial /ethnic 
minority individuals , as indicated by [CONTACT_590906]  (control 
condition) . Participants  will also receive positive feedback about their personal attributes, 
as indicated by [CONTACT_590907]  (control 
condition) . 
After (ostensibly) assembling the group’s preferences, the experimenter will inform 
participants in the experimental condition that no one selected them to be their partner, thus they will perform the next few tasks alone. This manipulation has been shown to prompt feelings of social exclusion.
[ADDRESS_778817] wording of the social exclusion manipulation, please see the attached script (social exclusion manipulation).  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 18 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 After the manipulation  has been delivered , participants will complete  a manipulation 
check  (see lab survey) . Participants will be asked to indicate their overall impressions of 
their groupmates and their perception of their groupmates’ overall impressions of 
themselves. Participants will be also report the extent to which they think the impressions their group members formed of them thus far are based on various factors including their gender, race or ethnicity, weight, age, personality, and what they said in their video.
48  
Next, participants will complete  primary outcome measures (Table 1). To assess comfort 
eating, participants will take part in a well-validated faux taste test from previous research  (described below) .
102 To provide a measure of social avoidance/ withdrawal, we 
will use a previously validated measure50 in which participants indicate the extent to 
which they prefer to complete the final task either by [CONTACT_1029], with a member of their previous group, or with a new partner (described below) . Anthropometric measures (i.e., 
height, weight, waist and hip circumference) will be assessed at the end of the study following standard lab -based procedures. 
To assess cortisol  (a steroid  hormone that regulates the body’s response to stress), 
participants will be asked to provide three saliva samples during the lab visit. The first saliva sample will be collected at baseline (5 -10 minutes after they arrive at the lab). The 
second and third saliva samples will be collected [ADDRESS_778818] saliva sample, they will be asked to watch a video about marketing strategies  to presumedly help them prepare for the final task. Here’s a link to 
the kind of video that will be shown to participants: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ty64auIk_w
  
The experimenter will be instructed to stop t he video when it’s time to collect the sample.  
 We will use off -the- shelf foods for the taste test task . The following foods/drinks will be 
offered to participants: Lay’s classic potato chips, Chips Ahoy cookies, milk chocolate 
M&M candies, and Sprite. During the taste test, participants will be provided with plentiful quantities of each food item (i.e., 80 grams of chips, 15 cookies, 300 grams of M&Ms) and 2 (355 mL) can of Sprite. These quantities were selected to circumvent both ceiling ef fects (i.e., participants eating all of the food available) and floor effects (i.e., 
participants eating no food at all) and are currently being used in a similar study being conducted by [CONTACT_15957]-I, [CONTACT_590921]. All food items will be stored according to packa ge 
instructions (e.g., in airtight containers to preserve freshness ). Cans of Sprite will be 
refrigerated. Participants will not be given food items  that have become stale or are 
beyond their “best by” date. Any expi[INVESTIGATOR_590850]. For sanitary reasons, any food or drink that is leftover after the taste test will be discarded as soon as the 
research assistant has logged the post- task weight for each item .   
Participants will be screened for relevant food allergies on the screening survey (see attached) . Those individuals who report being allergic to one or more of the products on 
the list will be excluded from the study. To take additional precautions, the consent form will remind participants of the food tasting and rating task that will take p lace during the 
lab visit. Participants will be instructed to alert a member of the study team if they have a relevant food allergy. If this occurs, the participant will be informed that they do not meet the eligibility criteria for the study and thus will not be scheduled for the lab visit (i.e., they will be withdrawn from the study for not meeting eligibility criteria).  Further, 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 19 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, [ADDRESS_778819] any relevant food allergies. If a participant admits to having a food allergy, any food items containing the specified ingredient(s) will not be offered to the participant during the taste test. In the unlikely event that a participant is allergic to all of the items of the food allergy list, the food tasting exercise will not be conducted.   
The experimenter will bring the food to the lab room on a tray and will wear gloves while 
handling the food and presenting it to the participant. After setting down the tray, the experimenter will open a can of Sprite in front of the participant. To introduce the task the experimenter will say the following :  
“Okay, now it’s time for the food tasting and rating task. These are the same foods that you’ll be promoting in your food marketing campaign, so we wanted to give you a chance to try them . Please have at least a taste of each item so that you can rate 
them. R ate the foods using this form [hand participant food rating form ; see attached 
food rating form ]. You are welcome to have as much as want. It is important that you 
answer the questions on the form as accurately as you can, so if you need more food to answer th e questions, please let me know. [Add off-handedly] And if you finish 
early, feel free to eat as much as you want. For sanitation purposes, we have to throw it away after you go anyway. You’ll have about 10 minutes for this  task. If you finish 
before I ret urn, please feel free to review your ratings to make sure they are accurate.”  
To assess social avoidance/withdrawal, the experimenter will say the following after the participant has completed the food tasting  task:  
“Next, you’ll be sharing your ideas for the food marketing campaign. There are a few ways we can do it and it’s up to you. You can do it by [CONTACT_202699], you can do it with one of the remaining people from your previous group—the same people in the videos you watched earlier—or there’s someone els e who showed up late for the  
study and you could do it with them . You haven’t met them yet, but they’ll be doing 
the marketing task as well so that’s another option. Just so you know, t he task will 
take the same amount of time whether you do it by [CONTACT_590908].  
So again, your options are by [CONTACT_202699], with a former group member, or with the new 
group member who showed up late. Please give it some thought. I’ll be back in a few minutes and you can let me know your preference then.”  
Parti cipants will be asked to indicate their response verbally to the experimenter, who 
will record their response.  
Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks 
and source records  Our team is highly committed to the protection of participant welfare. We will work 
closely with our university’s Institutional Review Board to ensure participant wellbeing and safety. Further, we will follow best practices for debriefing all study participants.  
We will follow best practices for saliva sample collection. For example, participants will 
receive verbal instructions from the experimenter along with a written handout that 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 20 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 repeats the instructions and provides additional tips if they are having difficulty 
producing enough saliva (please see attached) . Participants will also be given privacy and 
as much time as needed to provide the sample.   
All participants  will undergo a “funneled” debriefing process at the end of the study that 
begins with broad questions that narrow to probe for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798]. Th e debriefing process 
will consist of an initial verbal debriefing with the research assistant, followed by [CONTACT_590909] a written debriefing form that provides additional information and psychological support resources. After receiving this information, participants will have the opportunity to discuss the study with the research assistant and ask questions. Here, we provide a brief summary of the verbal debriefing process and the information contained in the written debriefing form.  
Debriefing Procedure Summary: The research assistant will begin by [CONTACT_190133] a series of questions to assess prior knowledge of any aspects of the study (e.g., “Did anyone else tell you anything about what you would be doing in this study before your session today?”) and gauge suspi[INVESTIGATOR_590851] (e.g., What do you think today’s study was about? Was there anything we told you during the study that you didn’t believe ?”). Afterwards, the research assistant will explain the goals of the 
study and the nature of the two experimental conditions. All aspects of the procedure, including all elements of deception, will be explained clearly to participants. Participants will be assured that any feedback they received during the session from their ostensible partners was  not real (i.e., the GTKY and first impression ratings from their “co -
workers,” being told that no one wanted to work with them on the partner task) and was developed by [CONTACT_590910]. Research assistants will emphasize this point until they are confident participants understand that none of the study procedures reflect any actual evaluation of the participant. The research assistant will apologize for not initially disclosing the purpose of the study and apologize for any discomfort that may have been experienced while completing the study measures or tasks.  
Research assistants will be trained on how to assist participants who experience distress. 
Further, participants will be given a list of psychological suppor t resources they can 
utilize (e.g., helplines) if they experience any lingering distress after the study has ended. Upon receiving full disclosure of the study goals, participants will be given the opportunity to withdraw their data from the study.  
Partic ipants will be thanked for their participation and given the written debriefing form. 
The debriefing form will provide a more detailed version of the verbal debriefing by 
[CONTACT_590911]. After receiving the verbal and written debriefing, participants will be given an opportunity to discuss the study with the research assistant and ask questions about the procedures and study goals. Participants will also be provided with several suggested readings if t hey are interested in 
learning more about weight discrimination and health, efforts that will be taken to protect their confidentiality, and a list of psychological support resources. The form will include contact [CONTACT_71722] ([CONTACT_590923]) and th e FSU human subjects committee 
should participants have any additional questions or concerns about the study. Participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_590852] a copy of the

Source Records:  Please see attached documents for all surveys that will be used to 
collect data about participants (i.e., screening survey, baseline survey, lab survey).  
Describe what data will be collected during the study and how that data will be 
obtained. 
Outcome measures include cognit ive (self -regulation); affective (emotional states); 
behavioral (social withdrawal, comfort eating); and physiological (cortisol secretion  as 
indicated via saliva ) responses to experimentally manipulated weight discrimination. 
Measures will be assessed wit h experimenter -administered and self -administered survey 
questions, computer -based tasks, a saliva sample, and a faux taste test. Please see

12.0 Local Number of Subjects  
 
Total number of subjects: 320  
13.0 Recruitment Methods 
Participants will be recruited from the local Tallahassee community and the surrounding area (e.g., Thomasville, Crawfordville). Following procedures used in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we will use a variety of recruitment strategies (e.g., flyers, online ads, community outreach). Ads for the study will be distributed in the local 
Tallahassee community via flyers, online message boards (e.g., Craig’s List), and social media sites (e.g., Facebook).  
To facilitate recruitment of a racially/ethnically diverse sample, we have partnered with 
the FSU Center for Translational Behavioral Science’s (CT BS) Community Engagement 
Core. The Community Engagement Core provides community liaison services, consults on engagement methodology, and facilitates the Community Advisory Council. The Council is a community advisory group comprised of area health care providers, professionals, and community members who have come together to enhance CTBS's mission toward effective community engagement in research. The Community Engagement Core is facilitated  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ennis and [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_590854]. As leaders of local community -
based organizations, Council members also provide stakeholder input to facilitate recruitment.  Participants will be recruited via direct outreach to locations such as local 
churches and community-based organizations.   Interested participants will be directed to an online screening survey to assess eligibility criteria.  
The ads will provide a brief description of the study and  the location where the 
study will take place. The ads will also mention that study participants will be compensated. Ads will include a link or QR code for the screening survey. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_590855] e attached.   
Participants will receive $ 75 cash upon completion  of the lab -portion of the study.

 Page 23 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, [ADDRESS_778822] a relevant food allergy. 
If this occurs, the participant will be informed that they do not meet the eligibility 
criteria for the study and thus will not be scheduled for the lab visit (i.e., they will be withdrawn from the study for not meeting eligibility criteria).  
If a participant arrives at the lab and does not appear to meet the minimum BMI criteria (BMI = 30 kg/m
2), the research assistant will be instructed to re -assess 
eligibility criteria to catch errors that were possibly made on the screening survey when reporting height and weight. Participants who may have entered inaccurate height or weight information on the screening survey (and thus do not meet the required BMI cutoff) will be told they cannot enroll in the study as they do not meet eligibility criteria. We do not anticipate having to do this very often, but it has happened a few times  in our previous work, so we will have a procedure in 
place to address it.  
Participants may decide to withdraw from the study at any time. No additional data will 
be collected after a parti cipant withdraws. If a participant shares their intent to withdraw, 
the investigator will ask if the information that has already collected can be used or whether it should be destroyed.   
15.0 Risks to Subjects  
Potential Risks: Participants may experience psychological distress in response to the experimental manipulation. The manipulation used in this study is like other commonly used procedures designed to produce acute short- term distress in a laboratory setting 
49,50,[ADDRESS_778823] measurable acute effects in the lab 
without contributing to long- term risk.  
Potential risks also include those associated with providing the three saliva samples (e.g., di
sgust with the procedure, difficulty producing enough saliva). Overall, these risks are 
considered to be minimal as th e probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipated in this study are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life.  
 
Information about the study’s actual purpose will be withheld from participants until the 
debriefing process, which will take place at the end of the lab -portion of the study. 
During the consent process the experimenter will provide participants with a statement to the effect that participants may not be made aware of som e features about the study and 
will be provided with additional information about the study at the end of their participation or at any time they withdraw. All participants will take part in the funneled debriefing process at the end of their participation or at any time they withdraw. Please

 Aim 1: Iden tify early -stage cognitive, affective, behavioral, and physiological 
mechanisms activated by [CONTACT_590878]. We hypothesize that, relative to participants in the control condition(s), participants in the weight discrimination (experimental) condition (vs. control) will display more impaired self-regulation, higher negative emotion, lower positive emotion, more social withdrawal 
and comfort eating, lower self -efficacy and intentions for engaging in weight control 
behavior, a nd increased cortisol secretion.  
Aim 1 power  and analysis.  Nine  outcomes  are assessed  for the  study (Table 1),  hence  
we adopt  a conservative Bonferroni  adjustment  when  evaluating  the primary  hypothesis  
and use significance  level  α = 0.[ADDRESS_778825] observed in  
our pi[INVESTIGATOR_123704].
48 We plan  to recruit  160 subjects  per condition for the  study, which  yields  
90% power  (α = 0.005)  to detect  the medium  Cohen’s  d = 0.50 between  the control  and 
experimental  conditions.  
Aim 1 analyses  will use  unadjusted ANOVA followed by [CONTACT_590912]. To  analyze 
effects  of the manipulation on cortisol  secretion  (assessed  at 3 timepoints),  we will 
calculate the  area under  the curve  (AUC)  with  respect  to ground (AUCg).120 For all Aims,  
residual  diagnostics  will assess model  assumptions  (e.g., normality,  homogeneity)  and 
responses  will be  transformed  if necessary.  Effect  of experimental  weight  discrimination  
will be  reported  for both unadjusted and  adjusted  analyses.  
 Aim 2: Identify psychological variables that moderate effects of weight 
discrimination. We hypothesize that the effect of weight discrimination (vs. control) will be stronger for individuals who score higher on certain psychological variables (i.e., internalized weight bias, neuroticism) and weaker for individuals who score higher on other va riables (i.e., self -compassion, conscientiousness; See Table 2). In other words, 
possessing some traits will be protective, while possessing other traits may render individuals more vulnerable to the harmful effects of weight discrimination.  
Aim 2 power  and analysis . The  very  high power  of these designs  for the  primary  
hypotheses  of Aim  1 ensures  sufficient  power  for Aim 2 and  additional  analyses.

 Page 25 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, [ADDRESS_778826] of equal correlation between moderator and outcome in all groups. Using Fisher’s z transform of the correlations to approximate normality, The study (with 160 subjects in each of two conditions) provides 90% [80%] power (2-sided, α  = 0.05) to detect the 
change in correlation between moderator and outcome from 0.65 to 0.39 [0.43] associated with treatment assignment.
[ADDRESS_778827] for 
baseline characteristics by [CONTACT_590913]; 
estimated moderation effects will be reported for both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. 
 Aim 3: Identify demographic characteristics that moderate effects of weight 
discrimination. We will conduct exploratory analyses to assess whether the negative effects of weight discrimination are moderated by [CONTACT_654], sex/gender, race, and ethnicity.  
Aim [ADDRESS_778828] of a binary moderator as the difference in the standardized effects of intervention associated with the two levels of the moderator, The study provides 88% power for a moderator effect of 0.70.
122 If the 
moderator is unbalanced (e.g., 60% of participants are female), then the power to detect a moderator effect of 0.70 is 86%. Power is maintained at 84% when there is a more severe imbalance (e.g., 1/3 Hispanic vs. 2/3 non-Hispanic). 
All analyses  will use the intent- to-treat data sets, meaning all participants will be included 
and associated with the experimental condition to which they were assigned. Missing outcomes will be addressed using multiple imputation or marginalization (i.e., maximum likelihood). Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we anticipate little missing data. If the missingness exceeds 10%, however, we will evaluate the potential for nonignorability by [CONTACT_590914].  
Participant privacy and data will be carefully protected. Participant information will be collected using a secure web -based application. The baseline survey will be as brief as 
possible and will be configured for easy completion on multiple platforms (e.g., cell phone, tablet, laptop). Participants will have the option to skip questions that make them uncomfortable. The experimental session will take place in a private laboratory on campus and will be guided through the study by a research assistant.  
Data  Security  
Procedures to eliminate risks related to breach of confidentiality are as follows: Each participant will be given a unique identifier in the data set which will be stripped of all personal information to protect confidentiality. Data sets used for analysis will contain participant identification numbers but neither names nor any other identifying information. Identification information will be retained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_590857].  Data will be stored 
in password-protected databases on secure servers, accessible only to project staff. Collaborators will receive data stripped of personal identifiers (de -identified data). To 
ensure complete confidentiality, access to the “key” l inking personal identifiers to

the data storage and reporting procedures. The “key” linking personally identifiable information to the participant’s ID in the data set will be destroyed at the end of the study. Reports will only use aggregated data and will not identify individual participants. All study staff will be trained in security and confidentiality procedures before receiving access to any participant data.  
Quality Control The baseline and lab -based survey will include several data quality checks (e.g., 
attention checks ) and a “speeding check” to identify any surveys that may be 
associated with poor quality.  
Data Handling and Storage  
All data will be stored on the PI’s password protected computer in a secure folder on the College of Medicine server. [CONTACT_590923] will oversee d ata storage and 
handling procedures. Only members of the study team will have access to the data. De- identified data will be stored into perpetuity. Collaborators will receive 
data stripped of personal identifiers (de- identified data). Data transmission 
procedures will follow best practices to ensure data safety and security during transfer.  
Saliva samples will be h andled following standard laboratory procedures to 
ensure participant privacy and specimen protection. Saliva samples will be frozen at -20°C within 2 hours of collection and will be stored in a secure area (card -
access only) . Saliva samples will be  stored  until they are ready for analysis. 
Samples will be  assayed for cortisol by [CONTACT_590915] , depending on how quickly data collection takes 
place. Specimens will be shipped following standard protocols  required by [CONTACT_590916].   
18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety  of Subjects  
This research constitutes a clinical trial and, as such, requires a Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP), but not a formal Data Safety and Monitoring Board.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
Potential Risks: Participants may experience psychological distress in response to the 
experimental manipulation. The manipulation used in this study is like other commonly 
used procedures designed to produce acute short- term distress in a laboratory setting 
49,50,[ADDRESS_778830] measurable acute effects in the lab 
without contributing to long- term risk.  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 27 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 Potential risks also include those associated with providing the three saliva samples (e.g., 
disgust with the procedure, difficulty producing enough saliva). Overall, these risks are 
considered to be minimal as th e probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipated in this study are not greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life.  
Any unexpected or serious adverse events that occur during the course of the study will be reported by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_590923]) to the [LOCATION_012] State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) in accordance with current University guidelines for reporting adverse events.  
[CONTACT_590923] will be responsible for monitoring data to ensure the safety of participants. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_590858]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_590859], intervention administration, and all data collection activities. The research team will have weekly meetings to monitor the progress the study. 
At the end of every experimental session, the r esearch assistant will document whether 1) 
any problems that occurred during the lab session (e.g., session started late; computer 
problems; participant could not produce sufficient saliva; participant continued to experience psychological distress after the debriefing procedure), 2) whether the participant indicated that their data should be kept or discarded (and if so, why), and/or 3) 
if a participant decided to withdraw from the study (and if so, why). The research assistant will be instructed to inform [CONTACT_590923] immediately  after the lab sessio n if 
a participant decides to have their data discarded, if a participant continue s to 
exhibit psychological distress after the debriefing process, or if a participant decides to withdraw from the study.  
In order to assure privacy for participants and to minimize risk, we will be primarily 
using computer-based data collection procedures. This reduces the number of people who view the data and increases self -disclosure on sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]. Access to the data will be 
password protected. 
Each participant will be given a random unique identifier in the data set that will be 
stripped of all personal information to protect confidentiality. Data sets used for analysis will contain participant identification numbers but neither names nor other identifying information such as home address. Identification information will be retained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_590860]. Collaborators will receive data stripped of personal identifi ers (de -identified 
data). To ensure complete confidentiality, access to the “key” linking personally identifiable information to the participant’s ID will be restricted to the PI. Reports will not identify individual participants. [CONTACT_590923] will oversee t he data storage and 
reporting procedures. De-identified data will be stored into perpetuity. The “key” linking personally identifiable information to the participant’s ID in the data set will be destroyed at the end of the project. Reports will only use aggregated data. All study staff will be trained in security and confidentiality procedures before receiving access to any participant data.

19.[ADDRESS_778831] subjects’ privacy interests. During recruitment, potential participants will decide for themselves whether they would like to answer the questions in the online screening survey and/or provide their contact [CONTACT_590918]. Participants who are eligible for the study 
will be contact[CONTACT_590919] -based session. Participants who are no longer interested in 
taking part in the study will be able to decline participation at any time.  
Data collection procedures will take into account privacy interests by [CONTACT_590920] ’s own 
pace. We will follow best practices for survey design and ask sensitive questions 
in a respectful manner. Sensitive questions (e.g., annual income) will include a “prefer not to answer” option.  
The research team will not be permitted to access any additional sources of 
informatio n about subjects beyond data provided in their screening survey, 
baseline survey, or during the lab -based study itself.

21.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
N/A 
22.0 Consent Process  
Participants interested in taking part in the study will be sent a link to the baseline survey by [CONTACT_9137]. The baseline survey will begin with the informed consent form. Participants will be asked to ‘sign’ the e -consent form by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_102202]. Participants 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 29 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, 2022 
 will not be allowed to complete any study procedures (including the baseline s urvey) 
until they have completed the informed consent form.  
At the start of lab visit (which will take place approximately one week later), the 
experimenter will review key information about the study from the consent form and ask participants if they hav e any questions about the study or their rights as a participant. 
After all questions are answered to the participant’s satisfaction, the study will begin.  
The experimenter will follow SOP: Informed Consent Process for Research (HRP -090). 
Alteration of Co nsent Process  
As this research involves deception, the true purpose of the study will not be disclosed in 
the consent form. The true purpose of the study will be provided during the debriefing. The research could not practically be carried out without this alteration. T o further mask 
the focus of the study, information that would traditionally be included the informed consent form for clinical trials such as circumstances that make a participant eligible (e.g., having a BMI ≥ 30)  or ineligible for the study (e.g., having participated in one of 
our previous studies on weight stigma)  will not be included. Further, t he consent form 
will not mention that participants  will be randomized to receive the experimental vs. 
control manipulation, however, this information will be rev ealed and discussed during the 
debriefing process.   
ClinicalTrials.gov Requirements  
The clinical trial proposed in this application will be registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.  An 
unsigned copy of the IRB -approved consent form will be posted to the ClinicalTrials.gov 
site as required by [CONTACT_4289].  
23.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing  
As informed consent will be obtained electronically at the beginning of the baseline survey, partic ipants will be asked to ‘sign’ the e -consent form by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_590865]. Please see attached consent document for details.   
Participants who would like a copy of the consent form will be informed they can print or save a copy of the screen . Additionally, participants can request a hard copy of the 
consent form from the experimenter during the lab visit. This information will be  
included at the end of  the consent form.    
24.0 Setting  
Participants will be recruited from the local Tallahassee community and the surrounding area (e.g., Thomasville, Crawfordville). Following procedures used in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we will use a variety of recr uitment strategies (e.g., flyers, 
online ads, community outreach) . Ads for the study will be distributed in the local 
Tallahassee community via flyers, online message boards (e.g., Craig’s List), and social media sites (e.g., Facebook) .  
To facilitate recr uitment of a racially/ethnically diverse sample, we have partnered with 
the FSU Center for Translational Behavioral Science’s (CTBS) Community Engagement Core. The Community Engagement Core provides community liaison services, consults on engagement methodology, and facilitates the Community Advisory Council. The 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Decision Making Study  
 Page 30 of 38  Revis ed: August 12, [ADDRESS_778833] come together to enhance CTBS's mission toward effective community engagement in research. The Community Engagement Core is facilitated  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ennis and [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_590866]. As leaders of local community -
based organizations, Council members also provide stakeholder input to facilitate recruitment. Participants will be recruited via direct outreach to locations such as local churches and community- based organizations.  
Particip ants will complete the online baseline survey at their own convenience in a 
location of their choosing.  
The lab -based portion of the study will take place on campus at [LOCATION_012] State 
University. Data collection will take place in a private room in the lab of co-
investigator, [CONTACT_590924], Department of Psychology.  
25.[ADDRESS_778834]. The team has a successful history of 
collaboration and experience conducting similar studies in a laboratory setting.  
• As roughly two thirds of U.S. adults are overweight or obese, the team 
will have access to a large pool of potential participants for the study.  
• [CONTACT_590923] will devote approximately 20% effort to this study to ensure timely completion of the project.  
• [CONTACT_590923] will train all study staff and research assistants  assisting with 
this research. Further , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_590867].  
 The study team consists of six FSU faculty members and one external faculty member from UCLA, Dr. A. Janet Tomi yama. [CONTACT_590921] will not be engaged 
with data collection  (i.e., obtaining informed consent from participants, running 
participants through the study)  and thus the FSU IRB does not need to serve as 
her IRB of record .

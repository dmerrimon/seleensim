[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
November 5, [ADDRESS_1139539] the primary  outcomes, 
the nighttime sleep measures (minutes of sleep, sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and 
circadian  rhythmicity from actigraphy data; PSQI score; MALSQ score) and safety measures, a s 
well as the secondary  endpoints. The primary analytic strategy for the efficacy analyses will 
employ linear mixed models with  measures from the actigraph data (a fourteen -day baseline, 
plus two seven -day intervention data collection  periods for each trea tment condition) or one of 
the survey sleep measures (two observations per treatment  condition) as the dependent 
variable, a random effect for study participant, and a fixed effect for treatment (i.e.  a dummy 
variable for the experimental condition, with t he control condition as the reference category). 
These  analyses allow for different numbers of observations for different participants. As part of 
data cleaning prior  to analysis, actigraph data recorded while the monitor is not worn will be 
identified and  removed from the  analyses. This will include periods identified as such in the 
subjects’ sleep logs, in addition to actigraphy data  in which no activity is present for more than 
30 consecutive minutes, and days that contain more than 10% of  missing data, and data sets 
with fewer than [ADDRESS_1139540] by [INVESTIGATOR_3086]  a dummy variable in the linear mixed model (with period 
one as the reference). We will also adjust for  covariates that may be may be found to be 
associated with night -time sleep, such as gen der, age, cognitive status,  functional status, 
baseline sleep disturbance and sedative medication load; however, because of the crossover  
nature of the study, in which participants serve as their own controls, it is not expected that 
covariate adjustment  will markedly alter estimates of treatment effect.

1. SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
The care of extremity trauma has evolved over the past 25 years. In the era of prolonged skeletal 
traction and/or casting following extremity trauma, the use of post -injury supervised physical 
therapy (PT) was required t o achieve good outcomes.  Seminal changes in the care of extremity 
trauma include early long bone fracture fi xation and stable joint reconstruction. These techniques 
allow for immediate ambulation with assistive devices, early joint range of motion and major 
muscle group activation. However, evidence on the use of more efficient and cost effective 
rehabilitation methods has not evolved at the same pace. Consequently, post -injury, clinic -based 
PT is often uniformly included as a standard of care rehabilitation protocol for uncomplicated 
extremity fractures. No data exist to guide clinical decision making regarding the neccesity of 
this approach or to identify subgroups of patients who may be able to achieve similar outcomes 
using a standardized self -directed, home exercise program . The impact of a home -based PT 
program on clinically relevant outcomes following isola ted and uncomplicated lower extremity 
fracture has never been evaluated.    
 
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and value of clinic -based PT and a 
home -based, self -directed exercise program (SDEP). The home exercise program will be 
developed by a team of physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], orthopaedic trauma surgeons and experts in 
rehabilitation engagement in collabortion with patients recovering from traumatic lower -
extremity injuries. The study will also determi ne which subgroups of individuals based on 
patient and injury characteristics are the best candidates for a home exercise program.  
 
Hypothesis:  The overall hypothesis is that return to work/major activities as well as clinical 
and functional outcomes and health -related quality of life for patients who receive clinic -
based PT will be similar to patients receiving SDEP.  
 
Specific Aim 1 : To compare the effectiveness of  SDEP, exercise instructions given by 
[CONTACT_291216] -based PT for improving return to work/major activities, clinical and 
functional/performance outcomes and health -related quality of life in patients following 
selected lower -extremity fractures.  
Specific Aim 2 : To determine which sub -groups of patients, based on patient and injury 
characteristics, are most likely to benefit from SDEP . 
Specific Aim 3 : To compare the cost -effectiveness of clinic -based PT and SDEP.  
 
2. BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE  
There is little clinical debate that patients with multiple extremity injuries or injuries wit h 
associated complex soft tissue damage  or nerve deficits benefit from supervised PT. Prior 
V1 
2/16/[ADDRESS_355470]  
This study builds on a growing body of data that indicate, following various elective and 
traumatic orthopaedic procedures, patients who are provided structured self -directed home -based 
rehabilitation can achieve similar outcomes to those who receive traditional clinic based 
rehabiliation services.12-23 Our institution recently completed an observational  study assessing 
the outcomes of patients with severe ankle fractures with and withou t dislocation.12 47% of the 
patients (those in community based practice) received post -operative in -person, supervised PT, 
whereas  53% of the patients (those from an academic medical center) received only a surgeon 
directed home -based exercise program. At  [ADDRESS_355471] injury, physical function outcomes 
measured by [CONTACT_291217] (SMFA)24  and Foot and Ankle 
Ability Measure (FAAM)[ADDRESS_355472] -fixation lower extremity fractures for selected injuries and in 
selected patients.   
 
3. METHOD  
We are proposing a pi[INVESTIGATOR_16282] a multi -center, randomized controlled trial that will compare  clinic -
based  PT, self-directed, home exercise program (SDEP) , and standard of care surgeon exercise 
instructions (SOC -SEI) in patients with selected lower -extremity fractures. Patients between the 
ages of 18 -65 and with fractures of  the femur or tibia treated with intramedullary fixation or 
with articular fractures of the distal femur (33A,B ,C), proximal (41A,B ,C) or distal tibia (43A, 
B,C) treated with plate fixation  will be enrolled. Assessments will be conducted at baseline)  and 
3, 6, and 12 months after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Patients will complete a battery of questionnaires 
measuring psychosocial factors, return to major activities/work, pain, and health -related quality 
of life as well as performance -based tests with electronically augmented kinematic data capture 
via the Mobility Toolkit at each assessment visit. Range of motion and strength will also be 
V1 
2/16/2018  
assessed using goniometry and a stabilized hand -held force gauge, respectively.  
 
Inclu sion criteria:  Patients aged 18 -65 with operative fractures of the femur and tibia (to 
include distal femur (33A, B), plateau (41A, B), pi[INVESTIGATOR_44768] (43A, B), and selected ankle injuries 
(44A, B)) presenting to the Orthopaedic Surgeon for either acute care or for  the follow -up of 
care performed elsewhere (within 14 days of the injury) . All patients must be English or 
Spanish competent and able to be followed at the sites for at least 12 months following 
injury.   
Exclusion criteria:   Patients with ISS>18, bilateral  lower -extremity injuries that preclude 
crutch ambulation, associated spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], pelvic, and/or acetabular fractures that otherwise alter 
weightbearing plans, type III B/C open fractures, Glasgow Coma Scale <15 at time of 
discharge, major peripheral nerve inju ry, or planned admission to a skilled nursing facility 
or inpatient rehabilitation facility , pregnant women, and patients diagnosed with a TBI  will 
be excluded from the study.  
 
Comparators:  Patients will be randomized to one of three  groups –  
Insured pat ients  
• Clinic -based PT : Patients will be referred to PT by [CONTACT_291218] a clinic -based PT program per usual referral patterns at the surgeon’s 
center. Patients will receive services based on their health care benefits defined by [CONTACT_291219].  
• SDEP : The full SDEP program, which will be developed by [CONTACT_149440][INVESTIGATOR_11437], 
orthopaedic trauma surgeons, and investigators with experience in health behavior 
change, will be designed to maximize adherence/compliance with the program. The 
SDEP ma nual will provide detailed instructions on exercises, such as repetitions, 
frequency, and required equipment, which can be implemented in the home 
environment. The basis for the exercise regimen is derived from the AAOS sample 
home based exercise program a vailable in handout form, which can be found at 
http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00672 . The program provides instructions 
on exercises, repetitions or duration, frequency, and requi red equipment which can be 
implemented in the home environment.  
Uninsured P atients  
Patient with no access to health insurance  will be approached for the study and randomized 
to the full SDEP program or standard of care/surgeo n exercise instructions ( SOC -SEI).  
• SDEP: The full SDEP program, which will be developed by [CONTACT_149440][INVESTIGATOR_11437], 
orthopaedic trauma surgeons, and investigators with experience in health behavior 
change, will be designed to maximize adherence/compliance with the program  
• Standard of Ca re-Surgeon Exercise Instructions (SOC -SEI): stretching and range of 
motion instruction s given by [CONTACT_291220] . 
Observational cohort  
 Patients who are unwilling to be randomized will be enrolled in an observational arm of the 
study. They will  be asked to complete all baseline and follow -up assessments , and 
V1 
2/16/2018  
participation in formal PT or SOC -SEI will be documented . 
 
 
Data Collection:  Patients will be assessed at baseline and then at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_355473] outcomes (self -efficacy, patient activation, fear of movement/re -injury, resiliency, and 
depression) will be assessed at baseline and  all follow -up visits .

Primary and Secondary Outcomes:  The primary outcome measure for the study will be return 
to work/major activities. Secondary outcomes include  the  pain, functional status , health -related 
quality of life, physical activity, kinesiophobia, depression,  psychosocial risk factors,  time to 
recovery, range of motion assessed using a goniometer, and strength assessed using a stabilized 
hand held force gauge. Outcome measures covering multiple areas will be used to ensure that 
the po tential benefits and/or limitations associated with selected interventions are effectively 
captured.  
 Secondary functional outcomes will be assessed with a battery of validated performance -
based tests captured via the Mobility Toolkit (10m walk test, Time d Up and Go)  at each clinic 
visit.  The Mobility Toolkit is a HIPAA compliant, web -accessible, cloud -based application for 
V1 
2/16/[ADDRESS_355474] patients and 
compare their results over time (i.e. rehab trajectories) or compare 
results versus similar patients or matched non -injured controls.  The 
data are captured by [CONTACT_291221] (IMU) that is chest -
mounted, positioned at the top of the sternum using a simple harness 
(Figure 1). The IMU is a wireless -telemetry, [ADDRESS_355475] tempera ture sensor. Custom 
software has been  developed to appropriately filter the raw data, establish a fixed global 
coordinate system (i.e. aligned with the body coordinate system), segregate gait segment data 
from turn data, and delineate and  compi[INVESTIGATOR_291213]. 
The software is also used to calculate quantitative descriptors of gait which are observable 
during subjective gait evaluation but not readily quantified. Set up and test time for the IMU is 
approximately [ADDRESS_355476]

7. Data Management and Storage.    
The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery utilizes the NIH -funded Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) project for all data management and stor -age. REDCap is a state of the art, 
metadata driven application for distributed data collection and data management in clinical 
studies.  
Security. Privacy and security are central considerations for distributed data systems with ac -cess 

V1 
2/16/2018  
to Personally Ident ifiable Information (PII). The overall private website will be secured with a 
challenge/response password protection mechanism. An additional level of security, requiring 
entry of a unique individual password, further protects access to the REDCap data man agement 
system. Numerous steps are being taken to maintain the integrity and security of the data sys -
tem.  First and foremost among these is the provision of careful training, certification, and guid -
ance to all research staff.  Each user account will hav e its own password and staff will be trained 
to recognize as misconduct the sharing of passwords.  
Distributed Data System.  The REDCap data management allows for a web -based, distributed 
data entry system using most web browsers to access an internet -connec ted database server. The 
system will permit research staff to have access to data as soon as they are entered, allow -ing for 
near-real-time recruitment reports and increased data entry availability and convenience for the 
clinical sites. The primary functi ons of the data system include the following existing fea -tures of 
the REDCap application: registration of all candidates for the trial; entry of all study data forms; 
inventory, management, and editing of study data; maintenance of full audit trails of al l data 
entry and editing; and real time performance report generation. The REDCap data entry system 
also includes extensive data validation functionalities, including field level validation (i.e., 
checking the correct format and range of each entered item,  intra-form validation, checking for 
logic errors, skip pattern violations across items on a form; and inter -form validation, checking 
for inconsistencies across forms).  
Data Export and Reporting.  REDCap has a number of built -in data export capabilities, i nclud -ing 
the capacity to directly produce data files for several common statistical analysis and data 
management packages (Microsoft Excel, SPSS, SAS, R, Stata).  In addition, a well -developed 
report generation utility makes it possible to extract real -time information in support of perfor -
mance monitoring, quality assurance, and Data and Safety Monitoring Board interim reports.

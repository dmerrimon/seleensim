PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Protocol Number:  17P-ES-003  
Title: A Phase 3B, Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind Study of 
Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection, 250 mg/mL, Versus Vehicle for the 
Prevention of Preterm Birth in Women with a Previous Singleton Spontaneous 
Preterm Delivery  
Study Phase:  Phase 3B  
Study Sites: Sites will be recruited in the [LOCATION_002] and other countries.  
Study Drug, Dosage 
and Route of 
Administration:  Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection, 250mg/mL (17P), weekly [ADDRESS_154049]. 
Control Drug, Dosage, and Route of Administration:  Vehicle, weekly intramuscular injections of 1 mL vehicle (castor oil, benzyl 
benzoate and benzyl alcohol)  until [ADDRESS_154050].  
Objectives: There are two co -primary objectives of this study  
1. Determine if treatment with 17P reduces the rate of preterm birth < 350 
weeks of gestation in women with a previous singleton spontaneous preterm delivery.  
2. Determine if 17P reduces the rate of neonatal mortality or morbidity. 
Neonatal mortality or morbidity is measured by a composite index comprised of:  
o Neonatal death.  
o Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage.  
o Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505].  
o Bronchopulmonary dysplasia.  
o Necrotizing enterocolitis.  
o Proven sepsis.  
The secondary objectives of this study are to:  
o Exclude a doubling of the risk of fetal/early infant death, defined as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage (delivery from 16
0 through 196 weeks of 
gestation) or neonatal death occurring in liveborns born at less than 24 weeks gestation or stillbirth (antepartum or intrapartum death from 20 weeks gestation through term), in the 17P group compared to the vehicle 
group. 
o Determine if 17P reduces the rate of preterm birth < 32
0 weeks of 
gestation.  
o Determine if 17P reduces the rate of preterm birth < 370 weeks of 
gestation.  
o Determine if 17P reduces the rate of stillbirth defined as all stillbirths/fetal deaths/in-utero fetal losses occurring from 20 weeks gestation until term.  
o Determine if 17P reduces the rate of neonatal death (from minutes after 
birth until 28 days of life) occurring in liveborns born at 24 weeks gestation or greater. 
o Evaluate the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of 17P in a subset of pregnant women.  
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154051] Population :  A total of 1707 women (1138 active and 569 vehicle) with a singleton pregnancy, 
aged 18 years or older, with a documented history of a previous singleton 
spontaneous preterm delivery.  
Study Design:  This study is a multi- center, randomized, double- blind, vehicle -controlled clinical 
trial. Subjects will be assessed and receive weekly injections of study drug from 
randomization (160 through 206 weeks of gestation) until [ADDRESS_154052]. 
Efficacy 
Assessments:  All randomized  subjects will be followed until delivery for efficacy assessments. 
The primary and secondary maternal outcome measures will be determined based on the date of delivery and the estimated date of confinement (EDC), which is evaluated in a standardized manner. Neonates born to randomized subjects will be followed until day 28 or the date of discharge from the NICU, whichever occurs 
later. Discharge from the NICU is defined as discharge to any of the following: 
home, a non- medical facility, a chronic- care facility, or a step -down unit.  The 
neonatal outcome measures will be determined from review of the neonatal medical record and will be based on standardized definitions of the morbidity measures.  
 
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments:  Pharmacokinetic assessments will  be made based on a sparse sampling of 
approximately 450 subjects (300 active and 150 vehicle) stratified according to body mass index (BMI) to analyze the dose -plasma concentration -time 
relationship of 17P. Three blood samples will be drawn:  
1. Before study drug dosing at either Visit 6 or 7 (i.e.,  Dose 5 or 6).  
2. Before study drug dosing at either Visit 8 or 9 (i.e.,  Dose 7 or 8).  
3. At a separate, non -dosing visit 1 to 6 days after Visit 9, 10, or 11 (i.e.,  1 to 
6 days after Doses 8, 9, or 10). Subjects will be stratified 2:1 (17P: vehicle) 
such that an even distribution of samples will be drawn on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4, or day 5/[ADDRESS_154053] the inhibition or induction of HPC will be evaluated and modeled as data permit.  
Safety Assessments:  Safety assessments include but are not limited to determination of maternal adverse events, maternal pregnancy complications, and investigation of the cause 
of stillbirth/fetal death/in -utero fetal loss and will be based on standardized 
definitions. Mater nal pregnancy complications include such events as gestational 
diabetes, oligohydramnios, significant antepartum bleeding or hemorrhage, 
preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, abruption, and chorioamnionitis.  
Statistical Methods:  Using a 2:[ADDRESS_154054] a 
reduction of 35% in the rate of the composite index (from 17% to 11%) with a 
power of 90% (assuming a two- sided type I error of 5%).  Assuming 2.5% of 
pregnancies will result in miscarriage or stillbirth, an additional 42 women need to 
be enrolled for a total of 1707 women (1138 active and 569 vehicle).  A total sample size of 1707 subjects provides 98% power  to detect a reduction of 
approximately 30% in the rate of preterm birth <  35
0 weeks of gestation (from 
30% to 21%) using a two -sided type I error of 5%.  The effect size for the neonatal 
composite index as well as preterm birth < 350 weeks gestation was chosen to 
represent a clinically significant reduction.  
Significant differences between the 17P and vehicle group in the proportion of 
subjects who deliver prior to 350 weeks gestation will be determined using a 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154055] stratified by [CONTACT_135754] (160 
weeks - 176 weeks gestation and 180 weeks – 206 weeks gestation), where the 
effective sample sizes for each treatment group and stratum will be derived from 
Greenwood’s formula and a staggered entry Kaplan -Meier analysis using the time 
from randomization until delivery as the analysis variable.  Subjects w ith missing 
outcome data will be censored on the date last known pregnant.  
The number and percentage of liveborn infants with the neonatal composite index will be presented by [CONTACT_135755], for each treatment group.  Signifi cant differences between the 17P and vehicle group will 
be determined using the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel procedure stratified by 
[CONTACT_135754].  
A two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the relative risk of fetal/early infant 
death for 17P relative to vehicle will be calculated using the method of Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratified by [CONTACT_135754]. If the upper bound 
of the CI is less than or equal to 2.0, a doubling in risk of fetal/early infant death can be ruled out. 
The percentage of subjects with a preterm birth <32
0 and <370 weeks of gestation 
will also be determined from the staggered entry Kaplan -Meier analysis and tested 
for statistical differences using the same analytic approach as for <[ADDRESS_154056] 
stratified by [CONTACT_135754].

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Prevalence and Prevention of Preterm Birth 
Preterm birth, defined as birth before the 37th week of gestation, is a very serious health 
concern, and is recognized as the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in the US .1  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_135730], the incidence of preterm birth remains high in the US. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it peaked in 2006 when 12.8% 
of the 4.3 million births occurred preterm, which represented a 21% increase since 1990 and a 33% increase from 1981 to 2004.
2,3  Since 2006, the rate has fallen slightly to a rate of 11.99% 
in 2010.[ADDRESS_154057] 
studies to be ineffective.7,8  One of the preventive measures that has shown effectiveness in 
randomized trials is the use of progesterone agents.9,10  Progesterone has been shown to support 
gestation and to inhibit uterine activity.   
Hydroxyprogesterone caproate (HPC) has a long history of use in pregnant women dating back 
numerous decades when it was marketed as Del alutin® (E.R. Squibb & Sons, Inc.) for habitual 
and recurrent abortion, threatened abortion, and post -partum after pains.  In addition a number 
of studies support the use of HPC  for prevention of preterm births.11-15 
1.2 Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate (HPC) 
In a large, controlled clinical study conducted by [CONTACT_85666] (NICHD), 17P
 was shown to significantly reduce the rate of recurrent 
preterm birth among women at high -risk for preterm birth.15 This multi- center, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- controlled study enrolled a high- risk population of pregnant women 
between 160 and 206 weeks of gestation with a history of previous singleton spontaneous 
preterm delivery. A total of 463 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive weekly injections  of either 17P
 (310 subjects) or placebo (153 subjects) through [ADDRESS_154058]. 
The results from this study confirmed earlier reports of the efficacy of HPC in preventing 
preterm birth. Treatment with 17P  significantly reduced the incidence of preterm birth less than 
370 weeks of gestation compared with placebo (P  < 0.001). The 17P  treatment also significantly 
reduced the incidence of preterm births when defined as <  350 (P = 0.0263) or <  320 
(P = 0.0273) weeks of gestation and prolonged the duration of pregnancy from time of 
enrollment (P  = 0.0024). 
Treatment with 17P  also led to significantly (P  < 0.05) lower rates of low birth weight infants 
(< 2500 g), neonates with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), neonates having any grade 3 or 4 
intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), neonates requiring supplemental oxygen, and neonates requiring admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Although the differences did

 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
not reach statistical significance, rates of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (RDS), ventilator 
support, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were also reduced following 17P  treatment.  
The effectiveness of 17P treatment in the NICHD study was accompanied by a favorable safety 
profile. Weekly intramuscular inject ions of 17P were well tolerated by [CONTACT_37111], with 
injection site reactions being the most commonly reported adverse event (AE). Treatment with 17P
 did not lead to increased rates of pregnancy complications or pregnancy -related 
procedures. The most common pregnancy complications (those reported by > 5% of subjects) were preeclampsia or gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes, which occurred at comparable rates in the 17P
 and placebo groups. The total incidence of miscarriages, stil lbirths, 
and neonatal deaths during the study was not different between the 2 treatment groups: 6.2% 
in the 17P group and 7.2% in the placebo group ( P = 0.6887). The incidence of miscarriages 
and stillbirths was slightly higher in the 17P group (3.5%  vs. 1.3%); while the incidence of 
neonatal deaths was 2 -fold lower in the 17P group (2.7% vs. 6.0%). Neither of these between-
group differences was statistically significant. Moreover, the rates of congenital anomalies identified at birth in the NICHD study wer e similar between treatment groups and were 
consistent with those reported in general population surveys.  
In the follow -up study of children born to mothers who participated in the NICHD 17P
 study, 
the authors reported that they did not detect differences in developmental delays, safety concerns related to overall health or physical development, or genital or reproductive anomalies between children with in -utero exposure to placebo and in- utero exposure to 17P. 
The results of the NICHD 17P
 study led to a recommendation from the American College of 
Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee on Obstetric Practice that progesterone be used to prevent recurrent preterm birth.
15,16-18  
1.3 Rationale for Clinical Trial 
The FDA -approved indication for 17P (Makena, Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection) 
states that it is a progestin indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women with a 
singleton pregnancy who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth.  However, since this is a subpart -H approval the following caveat is added: “ The effectiveness of 
Hydroxyprogesterone Caproate Injection is based on improvement in the proportion of women who delivered < [ADDRESS_154059] clinical benefit, such as improvement in neonatal mortality and morbidity.” 
Study 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154060] sufficient size and power to evaluate both a reduction in the risk of 
preterm birth < 35
0 weeks of gestation and an improvement in neonatal mortality and morbidity 
if one exists.  The study will include women with a singleton pregnancy, aged 18 years or 
older, with a previous singleton spontaneous preterm delivery, and includes a population pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy to assess the HPC exposure -response relationship and the 
effect of BMI on the PK of 17P. The effects of concomitant medications on 17P 
pharmacodynamics will also be investigated.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objectives 
The two co -primary objectives of this study are to:  
• Determine if treatment with 17P reduces the rate of preterm birth < 350 weeks of gestation 
in women with a singleton pregnancy, aged 18 years or older, with a previous singleton 
spontaneous preterm delivery.  
• Determine if 17P reduces the rate of neonatal mortality or morbidity.   Neonatal mortality 
or morbidity is measured by a composite index comprised of (See Section 13.2 for definitions): 
– Neonatal death.  
– Grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrh age. 
– Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]. 
– Bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 
– Necrotizing enterocolitis.  
– Proven sepsis. 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are to: 
 
• Exclude a doubling of the risk of fetal/early infant death, defined as spontaneous 
abortion/miscarriage (delivery from 160 through 196 weeks of gestation) or neonatal death 
occurring in liveborns born at less than 24 weeks gestation or stillbirth (antepartum or intrapartum death from 20 weeks gestation through term), in the 17P
 group compared to 
the vehicle group. 
• Determine if 17P reduces the rate of preterm birth < 320 weeks of gestation.  
• Determine if 17P reduces the rate of preterm birth < 370 weeks of gestation.  
• Determine if 17P reduces the rate of stillbirth defined as all  stillbirths/fetal deaths/in -utero 
fetal losses occurring from 20 weeks gestation until term.  
• Determine if 17P reduces the rate of neonatal death (from minutes after birth until 28 days 
of life) occurring in liveborns born at 24 weeks gestation or greater. 
• Evaluate the PK/PD of 17P in a subset of pregnant women. 
3 STUDY PLAN  
3.1 Overall Design 
This study is a multi- center, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled clinical trial in 
women with a singleton pregnancy, aged 18 years or older, with a history of a previous singleton spontaneous preterm delivery. A total of 1707 subjects will be randomized in a 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-003 
 15 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
2:1 ratio to receive either 17P  or vehicle, respectively. Subjects will receive weekly injections 
of study drug from randomization (160 through 206 weeks of gestation) until [ADDRESS_154061]. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be made based 
on a sparse sampling of approximately 450 subjects (300 active and 150 vehicle), stratified 
according to BMI to analyze the dose -plasma concentration -time relationship of 17P. 
Randomized subjects will be followed for efficacy outcomes through the date of delivery and for adverse events up to the End of Treatment Period Visit defined as 35 ± [ADDRESS_154062] 
dose of study drug.  If the End of Treatment Period Visit is prior to the date of delivery, maternal and fetal deaths should be reported until delivery. Neonates of randomized subjects will be followed until day 28 or the date of discharge from the NICU or equivalent, whiche ver 
occurs later.   Discharge from the NICU is defined as discharge to any of the following: home, a non-medical facility, a chronic -care facility, or a step -down unit. At centers participating in 
the 17P-FU-004 study, every effort will be made to obtain informed consent for the 17P -FU-
004 study from all randomized subjects while they are pregnant.  If it is not possible to obtain 
consent during the pregnancy, consent may be obtained up to the point that their child reaches one year of age.

k Between 160 and 206 weeks of gestation.  
l Three blood samples will be drawn from the PK population at the following times: (1) Before study drug dosing at either Visit  
6 or 7 (i.e., dose 5 or 6). (2) Before dosing at either Visit 8 or 9 (i.e., Dose 7 or 8). (3) At a separate, non- dosing visit 1 to  
6 days after Visit 9, 10, or 11 (i.e.,  1 to 6 days after Doses 8, 9, or 10). Subjects will be stratified 2:1 (17P: vehicle) such that 
an even distribution of samples will be drawn on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4 or day 5/[ADDRESS_154067] 5 days apart and no more than 10 days apart . 
n AEs are recorded from administration of the trial injection through the End of Treatment Period Visit including medications 
to treat the AE. Preterm birth is an antic ipated outcome and is not considered an AE.  Maternal or fetal deaths will be recorded 
through delivery.   
 
3.2 Efficacy Assessments 
All randomized subjects will be followed until delivery for efficacy assessments. The primary 
and secondary maternal outcome measures will be determined based on the date of delivery and the estimated date of confinement (EDC), which is evaluated in a standardized manner. Neonates born to randomized subjects will be followed until day 28 or the date of discharge from the NICU , whichever occurs later. Discharge from the NICU is defined as discharge to 
any of the following: home, a non- medical facility, a chronic -care facility, or a step -down unit.  
The neonatal outcome measures will be determined from review of the neonatal medical record and will be based on standardized definitions of the morbidity measures.
 
3.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Subjects may be offered the opportunity to participate in a pharmacokinetic sub- study until 
approximately 450 subjects (300 active and 150 vehicle) have been enrolled.  Pharmacokinetic 
assessments will be made based on a sparse sampling stratified according to pre -pregnancy 
BMI to analyze the dose- plasma concentration -time relationship of HPC.  
Three blood samples will be drawn: 
1. Before study drug dosing at either Visit 6 or 7 (i.e., Dose 5 or 6). 
2. Before study drug dosing at either Visit 8 or 9 (i.e., Dose 7 or 8). 
3. At a separate, non -dosing visit 1 to 6  days after Visit 9, 10, or 11(i.e., 1 to 6 days after 
Doses 8, 9, or 10). Subjects will be stratified 2:1 ( 17P: vehicle) such that an even 
distribution of samples will be drawn on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4 or day 5/[ADDRESS_154068] -dose. 
This will result in approximately 60 17P and 30 vehicle samples on each day interval.  
Study sites should follow the procedure outlined in the study manual.   
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154069] the inhibition or induction of HPC will be evaluated and modeled as data permit.

The investigator will maintain accurate records of receipt , return or destruction of all study 
medication, including the dates of receipt and return. In addition, accurate records will be kept 
regarding when and how much study medication is dispensed and used by [CONTACT_134319], including the number of unused doses remaining in an open multidose vial. Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing regimen must also be recorded. At the completion of the study, to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all study 
medication will be reconciled and retained or destroyed according to applicable local and 
national regulations. 
4.[ADDRESS_154079] of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a separate aliquot of each PK blood sample will be retained for potential future analysis of any important metabolites that may be identified through ongoing PK analyses, outside of this study.  
[ADDRESS_154080] meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:  
1. Age ≥ [ADDRESS_154081] ultrasound, as described in “Gestational Age Determination” below. 
4. Documented history of a previous singleton spontaneous preterm delivery. Spontaneous preterm birth is defined as delivery from 20
0 to 366 weeks of gestation following 
spontaneous preterm labor or pPROM. Where possible, the gestational age of the previous preterm birth (referred to as the qualifying delivery) should be determined as described in “Gestational Age Determination” below. If the gestational age at delivery is obtained 
directly from the medical record and more than one gestational age appears, the latest will be used. As a validation of the gestational age of the previous delivery, if the  infant weighed 
more than 3300 grams

will not qualify as preterm. The previous preterm delivery cannot be an antepa rtum 
stillbirth. 
5.1.1 Gestational Age Determination 
Gestational age is determined in the following manner and is denoted ‘project gestational age’. 
The ‘project EDC’ will be determined by [CONTACT_135764] a reliable menstrual history and measurements ob tained at the subject’s first ultrasound examination. The project EDC is based 
on the project gestational age and cannot be revised once a determination has been made. Because the project EDC depends on information from the earliest dating ultrasound, if no ultrasound has been performed previously, one must be performed before the subject can be 
randomized. 
1. The first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) is determined and a judgment made as to 
whether or not the subject has a ‘sure’ LMP date. 
2. If the LMP date is unsure, the ultrasound measurements obtained at the subject’s first ultrasound examination will be used to determine the project gestational age, by [CONTACT_135765]. 
3. If the date of h er LMP is sure, and the ultrasound confirms this gestational age within the 
number of days specified in ‘Cut -offs for Using LMP to Determine Gestational Age’ (Table 
2), the LMP derived gestational age will be used to determine the project gestational age. 
4. If the ultrasound- determined gestational age does not confirm the LMP generated 
gestational age within the number of days specified in Table [ADDRESS_154082] ultrasound by [CONTACT_135766] 196 weeks of gestation  ±7 days 
200 through 206 weeks of gestation  ±[ADDRESS_154083] dose of study medication  
3.2. Subjects received hydroxyprogesterone caproate  
3.3. The progestin was administered by a route other than oral or intra-vaginal.

4. Heparin therapy during current pregnancy or history of thromboembolic disease. 
5. Maternal medical/obstetrical complications including:  
– Current or planned cerclage 
– Hypertension requiring medication  
– Seizure disorder 
 
6. Subjects with a uterine anomaly (uterine didelphys or bicornuate uterus ).  However, 
subjects with uterine fibroids are eligible for the study.  
7. Unwillingness to comply with and complete the study. 
8. A [ADDRESS_154084] from section 5.3.2 of the 
investigational brochure :  
• Current or history of thrombosis or thromboembolic disorders 
• Known or suspected breast cancer, other hormone -sensitive cancer, or history 
of these conditions 
• Undiagnosed abnormal vaginal  bleeding unrelated to pregnancy  
• Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy 
• Liver tumors, benign or malignant, or active liver disease  
• Uncontrolled hypertension 
Other examples to consider incl ude uncontrolled diabetes, known HIV infection or renal 
dysfunction. 
13. Have any significant medical disorder that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would preclude accurate evaluation of the subject’s condition or outcome or compromise the subject’s safety in the study.  
5.3 Rando mization Procedures  
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 17P  or vehicle treatment (two 17P  to 
[ADDRESS_154085]) using a blocked randomization sequence stratified by [CONTACT_135767] (160 weeks - 176 weeks gestation and 180 weeks – 206 weeks 
gestation). Randomization is stratified by [CONTACT_135768] [ADDRESS_154086] management. The rationale for 2:[ADDRESS_154087].  
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154088] or the randomization visit cannot be rescheduled ≤ [ADDRESS_154089] cannot 
be randomized.  Randomization will occur through the use of an interactive voice response system (IVRS).  
5.[ADDRESS_154090] (DSMB) will review summary safety data (see Section 9.6.1) and the DSMB Charter will provide the option for the 
DSMB to request unblinde d review of the data.  
5.[ADDRESS_154091]’s treatment assignment.  
Prior to any unblinding, the investigator is strongly advised to discuss options with the Medical Monitor or appropriate sponsor study personnel. As soon as possible, and without revealing the subject’s study treatment assignment (unless important to the safety of subjects remaining in the study), the investigator must notify the sponsor if the blind is broken for any reason and the investigator was unable to contact [CONTACT_1152]. The investigator will record in source documentation the date and reason for revealing the blinded treatment assignment for that subject.  
5.[ADDRESS_154092] Withdrawal from Study Drug 
Subjects will be considered withdrawn from study drug if they are prematurely discontinued 
from administration of study drug (i.e., prior to the anticipated full course of study drug therapy 
for a reason other than delivery). If possible the subject should remain on study and at a minimum, delivery data will be obtained. Reasons for subject withdrawal from study drug are recorded in the approp riate page(s) of the eCRF and may include, but are not limited to:  
• Withdrawal of consent.  
• At request of the investigator due to the occurrence of an AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], warrants the subject’s permanent discontinuation from study drug therapy. In 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-003 
 27 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
the event of discontinuation from study drug therapy due to the occurrence of an AE, the 
study site should notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible (see Section 8.6). At the time of withdrawal, the site staff should attempt to obtain end-of-study information from 
the subject.  
• Significant subject noncompliance, defined as unwillingness or inability to adhere to the 
prescribed dosing regimen. 
5.6.[ADDRESS_154093] delivery data are not obtained 
(i.e., the subject is lost to follow -up). The investigator should make reasonable attempts to 
contact [CONTACT_135769] [ADDRESS_154094] to follow -up will not be 
replaced. 
5.6.4 Sponsor’s Termination of Study 
The sponsor reserves the right to terminate an investigational site or this clinical study at any 
time. Reasons for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this study indicates a potential health hazard to subjects. 
• Serious or persistent noncompliance by [CONTACT_135770], clinical research 
agreement, US FDA Form FDA 1572, GCP, or other applicable regulatory guidelines in 
conducting the study. 
• IRB/IEC decision to terminate or suspend approval for the investigation or the investigator. 
• Investigator request to withdraw from participation.  
• Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
 
[ADDRESS_154095] 5 days apart and no more than 10 days apart.  Three blood samples will be collected from approximately 450 subjects (300 active and 150 vehicle) for the population PK analysis at specified visits during the trial. If the treatment is 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154096] will be asked about possible AE(s) experienced since the last injection, the use of concomitant medications, and information related to addi tional risk factors for miscarriage will be collected.  
6.1 Baseline (Visit 1) 
The Baseline (Visit 1) will occur wherever possible within [ADDRESS_154097] (or legal guardian of the potential subject) will sign an informed consent form (ICF). 
All subjects who present for prenatal care after [ADDRESS_154098]/legal guardian will be asked to sign a medical records release so that the 
medical records of her previous delivery(ies) may be obtained. Documentation of the subject’s previous de livery(ies) will be reviewed to ensure the subject meets the inclusion criteria. If an 
abdominal ultrasound examination has not been performed at [ADDRESS_154099]’s first ultrasound, gestational age. The ultrasound results will be made available to the subject’s physician. 
At Baseline (Visit 1), potential subjects will undergo the follo wing procedures:  
• If not already done, obtain written informed consent. No study specific procedures will be 
performed without informed consent.  Informed consent may be obtained at a gestational age of 10 weeks or greater to facilitate obtaining records from the qualifying delivery.   
• At centers participating in the 17P -FU-004 study, every effort will be made to obtain 
informed consent for the 17P -FU-004 study from all randomized subjects while they are 
pregnant.  If it is not possible to obtain consent during the pregnancy, consent may be 
obtained up to the point that their child reaches one year of age. 
• If not already done, obtain permission to release medical records from previous preterm 
birth. 
• Obtain demographic information including age, ethnicity, and race.  
• Obtain social history including marital status, years of education, alcohol use, tobacco use, and illicit drug use.  
• Obtain medical and obstetrics history, including pre -pregnancy weight, history of 
significant illnesses, previous surgical history, sexually transmitted disease history, history 
of douching before and during pregnancy, history of uterine and vaginal infection, history of corticosteroid use, outcome of all prior pregnancies, potential risk factors for miscarriage.

• Monitor for and record presence or absence of pulmonary oil microem boli (POME) 
symptoms, such as transient coughing or dyspnea, that may occur within the first 10 
minutes after administration of the injection (please refer to Section 8.1 – Adverse Events).  
• Record AE(s) associated with the trial injection.  
• Record information related to risk factors of miscarriage.  
• If one has not been conducted, schedule an ultrasound. 
• Schedule randomization (Visit 2). 
6.2 Active Treatment Period (Visit 2 to 366 Weeks of Gestation or Delivery) 
During the Active Treatment Period, subjects will report to the site weekly until the subject is [ADDRESS_154101].  
At Active Treatment Period Visits, subjects will undergo the following procedures:  
• Review medications and record as concomitant medications on the subject’s eCRF . 
• At visit 2, confirm the subject still meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomize 
the subject and record any new AE(s) associated with administration of the trial injection.  
• At visit 2, conduct a brief physical examination including a brief head- to-toe visual 
inspection, if not conducted at Baseline (Visit 1). 
• Obtain weight. 
• Administer intramuscular injection of study drug.   
• Adverse events will be collected at all study visits that occur after the subject’s randomization and administration of the initial dose of study medication. 
• Monitor for and record presence or absence of POME symptoms, such as transient coughing or dyspnea, that may occur within the first 10 minutes after administration of the 
injection (please refer to Section 8.1 – Adverse Events).  
• Record any pregnancy complications, including complications associated with fetal/early infant death, visits for labor and delivery or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059](s) for preterm labor.

7.6 Pharmacokinetic Testing  
Pharmacokinetic assessments will be made based on a sparse sampling of approximately 450 subjects (300 active and 150 vehicle) to analyze the dose -plasma concentration -time 
relationship of 17P . Participation in the PK substudy will be stratified by [CONTACT_094] -pregnancy BMI, 
into ≤ 28 and > 28 such that approximately 40% and 60% of subjects are expected to be in 
each BMI category, respectively. In addition, for the third blood sample, subjects will be 
stratified 2:1  (17P: vehicle) such that an even distribution of samples will be drawn on day 1, 
day 2, day 3, day 4 or day 5/[ADDRESS_154111] in the PK substudy: 1. Before study drug dosing at either Visit 6 or 7 (i.e., Dose 5 or 6). 
2. Before study drug dosing at either Visit 8 or 9 (i.e., Dose 7 or 8). 
3. At a separate, non -dosing visit 1 to 6 days after Visit 9, 10, or 11 (i.e., 1 to 6 days after 
Doses 8, 9, or 10). Subjects will be strat ified 2:1 ( 17P: vehicle) such that an even

(i.e., events occurring prior to study medication exposure) should be recorded as medical 
history. 
A treatment -emergent AE  (TEAE) is defined as any event not present prior to exposure to 
study medication or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency 
following exposure to study medication from Randomization through End of Treatment Period Visit. 
All AEs that occur after trial injection through the End of Treatment Period Visit must be 
reported in detail on the appropriate eCRF and followed to satisfactory resolution or until the 
investigator deems the event to be not significant for further follow up. The description of the AE will include the onset date, date of resolution, severity, seriousne ss (see Section 8.5), and 
the likelihood of relationship of the AE to study treatment (see Section 8.4). For the purposes 
of this study, preterm birth and associated neonatal morbidities will not be reported as an AE. Preterm birth and associated neonatal morbidities are  an anticipated outcome of this population 
and will be captured on a specific page in the subject’s eCRF but will not be recorded on the 
AE page. 
Because other drugs which contain a castor oil -based vehicle have been associated with rare 
cases of POME, investigators will be asked to monitor for symptoms of POME, such as 
transient coughing or dyspnea, for [ADDRESS_154113] observations in the eCRF . 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any event that results in maternal, fetal, neonatal death; is immediately life threatening; requires subject inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (for more than 
24 hours)  for reasons other than pregnancy complications and/or preterm delivery; or 
prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect. For the purposes of this study, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135740]/pPROM that does not result in delivery, is expected and will be recorded on the subject’s eCRF  and not reported as an SAE.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135741]’s eCRF (not reported as an SAE). However, complications requiring 
the mother to remain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_135742].  
For the purposes of this study, preterm births that result in admission to the NICU and/or a 
prolonged stay in the NICU are expected and will be recorded on the subject’s eCRF and not 
reported as an SAE.  For the purposes of this study, all congenital anom alies detected at the time of birth will be 
recorded in the eCRF and will not be reported as an SAE.  Any congenital anomalies that 
become apparent after birth through [ADDRESS_154114] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent

accidents, used any new medication, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and OTC medications). 
All randomized subjects, regardless of when they deliver, should be contact[CONTACT_135771](s). The contact [CONTACT_135759] 35 ± [ADDRESS_154117] also be reported. All AEs will be followed 
to adequate resolution. Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
) version 10.[ADDRESS_154118] is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an AE. However, if it deteriorates or worsens significantly from baseline at any time during the study, it shoul d be recorded as an AE.  
8.4 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported. 
The relationship or association of the study medication in causing or contributing to the AE 
will be characterized using the following classification and criteria:  
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-003 
 35 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Definite: 
a. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug, or 
in which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissues and, 
b. Improves or disappears on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_47732] (dechallenge) and, 
c. Is an unusual  event that is known to be associated with the drug or this class of compound, 
and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_135772]'s physical condition, or 
d. Reappears on a repeated exposure (rechallenge).  
Probable: 
a. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug 
and, 
b. Improves or disappears by [CONTACT_135773],  
c. The reaction cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]'s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the subjec t, and  
d.  Rechallenge was not attempted.  
Possible:  
a. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug and, 
b. It is reasonable to suspect drug causation after considering basic illness, concomitant illness, and other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
Unlikely/Remote:  
a. Any reaction not meeting the criteria for definite, probable or possible and, 
b. Current knowledge indicates that a relationship is unlikely. 
Definitely Not: 
a. Any reaction not meeting the criteria for definite, probable or possible and, 
b. That is known to be associated with the subject's clinical condition, or with other medication taken by [CONTACT_423].  
8.5 Assessment of Severity 
The intensity of the AE will be rated as mild, moderate, or severe using the  following criteria:  
Mild events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities.  
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154119] (IRB). Copi[INVESTIGATOR_135743], governing 
authorities, ethics committees, and the sponsor must be submitted to the sponsor for filing. 
A subject experiencing 1  or more SAEs will receive treatment and follow- up evaluations by 
[CONTACT_135774] -
up. All AEs, whether serious or nonserious, should be followed to resolution or until the AE is 
determined by [CONTACT_135775].  
8.7 Investigating the Cause of Stillbirth/Fetal Death/In-Utero Fetal Loss 
The etiology of a death following a live birth may be different from that of a stillbirth/fetal death/in-utero fetal loss. The investigation of the cause of sti llbirth/fetal death/in -utero fetal 
loss involves evaluation of some fetal and maternal factors and is based on the recommendations from the Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network of the NICHD
 and the 
2009 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guideline on management of stillbirths.
21,22 
The fetal components of the investigation include: 
• Autopsy if parental/legal guardian consent is obtained. It should be performed by a 
pathologist, with perinatal autopsy expertise whenever possible.  If consent for autopsy is not obtained, every attempt should be made to gather information through options such as photographs, X -ray imaging, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging or sampling of 
tissues.   
• Placental evaluation along with the cord and the membrane.  
• Karyotype if parental/legal guardian consent is obtained to collect  tissue/specimen.  
• Weight, length and head circumference, and description of any gross abnormalities. 
The investigation of the maternal factors that may provide the cause of the stillbirth will involve the performance of the following tests shortly after the delivery:  
• Thyroid stimulating hormone,  
• Indirect Coombs test (If not performed as part of routine clinical care), 
• Serologic test for syphilis,  
• Urine toxicology screen, 
• Screen for fetal -maternal hemorrhage (Kleihauer -Betke or other) and, 
• Parvovirus serolo gy. 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-003 
 38 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Relevant family medical history will also be collected to investigate the etiology of the 
stillbirth. 
If there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798], the following maternal tests will be considered: 
• Lupus anticoagulant screen, 
• Anticardiolipin antibodies, 
• Factor V Leiden mutation,  
• Prothrombin G20210A mutation, 
• Screen for protein C, protein S, Antithrombin III deficiency and 
• Uterine imaging study.  
9 STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 Sample Size  
In 3 studies of high -risk pregnant women, the rate of preterm birth <  350 weeks of gestation in 
women receiving vehicle ranged from 26.5% to 30%.15,23,24 The NICHD study also found that 
17.2% of live born infants in women receiving vehicle had the neonatal composite index.  
Using a 2:[ADDRESS_154120] a reduction 
of 35% in the rate of the composite index (from 17% to 11%) with a power of 90% (assuming a two-sided type I error of 5%).  Assuming 2.5% of pregnancies will result in miscarriage or 
stillbirth, an additional 42 women need to be enrolled for a total of 1707 women (1138 active and 569 vehicle).  A total sample size of 1707 subjects provides 98% power to detect a reduction of approximately 30% in the rate of preterm birth <  35
0 weeks of gestation (from 
30% to 21%) using a two- sided type I err or of 5%.  The effect size for the neonatal composite 
index as well as preterm birth < [ADDRESS_154121] significant 
differences between the treatment groups for both outcome measures may be reduced.  If the 
outcome measures are independent, the power is 88.2% and if the outcome measures are 
perfectly correlated, the power is 90%.  Data from the NICHD Study indicate these outcome 
measures are highly correlated with 56% of liveborn infants of women who delivered < 350 
weeks gestation with the neonatal composite index compared with 2% of live born infants of women who delivered ≥ 35
0 weeks gestation.  Thus, the power to detec t significant differences 
between the treatment groups for both outcome measures is expected to be close to 90%.  
There is also sufficient power to detect clinically significant reductions in the secondary outcomes of delivery <  32
0 and < [ADDRESS_154122] ation as indicated in Table 3 Sample Size 
Calculation.

Table 3  Sample Size Calculation  
 
Secondary Outcome  Outcome Rate in 
Vehicle Group  Percent 
Reduction  Power  
    
Delivery <  320 weeks of gestation  20% 33% 92% 
Delivery <  370 weeks of gestation  40% 33% >99% 
Assuming a 4% fetal/early infant death rate with a two -sided alpha of 5%, a sample size of 
1707 subjects provides 82.8% power to rule -out a doubling in the risk of fetal/early infant death 
(i.e., the upper bound of the confidence interval for the re lative risk of 17P compared to vehicle 
will be ≤2.0). 
A fetal/early infant death rate of 4.0% is based on the results of Study 17P -CT-002 (the NICHD 
17P trial).  
Approximately 450 subjects will participate in the population PK substudy. Subjects in the PK 
population will be stratified based on BMI (≤ 28 and > 28), such that approximately 40% and 
60% of subjects are in each BMI category, respectively. Additionally, for the third blood sample draw, subjects will be stratified 2:1 ( 17P: vehicle) such that an even distribution of 
samples will be drawn on day 1, day 2, day 3, day 4 or day 5/[ADDRESS_154123] -dose. This sample size, 
while not based on any statistical considerations, will enable generation of a sparse sample that will permit adequate nonlinear modeling of the  PK/PD effects of 17P.  
9.2 Populations to be Analyzed 
Six populations are defined in the analyses:  
Intent-to-treat (ITT) Population:  ITT Population will consist of all randomized subjects. All 
subjects will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized regardless of whether the subject received study drug. 
Modified ITT (MITT) Population:  MITT Population will consist of all subjects in the ITT 
Population with outcome data of delivery date available. 
Per-Protocol (PP) Population:  PP Population will  consist of all subjects who are compliant 
with the study protocol. Each subject will be classified as compliant or not with the protocol based on the following criteria: subject was fully eligible (met all inclusion and had none of the exclusion criteria) , at least 90% compliant with study drug, and outcome data available. 
Safety Population:  The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who received any amount 
of study drug. 
Liveborn Neonate Population:  The Liveborn Neonate Population will consist of all babies of 
randomized women (ITT Population) who were liveborn and have morbidity data available. 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-003 
 40 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Population: The PK Population will consist of subjects who received 
study drug and had PK data appropriate for PK analysis. Three blood samples will be drawn 
from each subject participating in the PK Population portion of the study. 
9.[ADDRESS_154124] deviations, medians, minimums and maximums for continuous variables will be provided. Listings of individual subjects’ data will 
also be provided. A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan will be prepared and finalized 
prior to database lock and analysis of the data.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_154125] Population and Characteristics  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, withdrawals from the study (i.e., discontinuation from study drug), and subjects who are lost to follow -up will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Demographics (age, race, marital status, and years of education), pre -pregnancy and 
enrollment weight/BMI, diabetic status, use of cigarettes, alcohol and street drugs during pregnancy, and obstetrical history (e.g., gestational age of the qualifying delivery, number of previous preterm deliveries, previous miscarriage, previous  stillbirth, uterine and vaginal 
infection or use of corticosteroids prior to randomization, additional risk factors of miscarriage, etc.) will be summarized. Differences between treatment groups will be analyzed using the chi -
square or Fisher’s exact test  for dichotomous variables and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for 
ordinal and continuous variables. 
9.4 Efficacy Analysis  
9.4.1 Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure 
The primary hypothesis for efficacy compares the proportion of subjects with a preterm 
delivery < 350 weeks of gestation between the 17P ( ∏17P) and vehicle ( ∏V) treatment groups 
in the ITT Population and the percent of neonates with the neonatal composite index between 
the 17P (P 17P) and vehicle (P V) treatment groups in the Liveborn Neonatal Population.  The 
null (H O) and alternative (H A) hypotheses are as follows:  
HO: ∏17P = ∏V    and    P17P = PV            
HA: ∏17P ≠ ∏V     or     P17P ≠ PV 
An alpha level of 0.05 will be used for the primary analysis of both primary outcome measures as an adjustment for multiple comparisons is not required for testing the null hypothesis when stated as above.  
The percentage of subjects with a preterm birth <35
0 weeks of gestation will be determined as 
the point estimate of the survival function from a stagge red entry Kaplan -Meier analysis 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-003 
 41 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
(which adjusts for gestational age at randomization) using time from randomization to delivery 
as the analysis variable.  Subjects with missing delivery data will be censored at the last known pregnancy.  Significant differe nces between the 17P  and vehicle group in the proportion of 
subjects who deliver prior to [ADDRESS_154126] stratified by [CONTACT_135754]  (160 weeks - 176 weeks gestation 
and 180 weeks – 206 weeks gestation) , where the effective sample sizes for each treatment 
group and stratum will be derived from Greenwood’s formula and a staggered entry Kaplan-
Meier analysis using the time from randomization until delivery as the analysis variable .  
Subjects with missing outcome data will be censored on the date last known pregnant. 
The number and percentage of infants in the Liveborn Neonatal Population with the neonatal 
composite index  will be presented  by [CONTACT_135755], for each 
treatment group.  Significant differences between the 17P and vehicle group will be determined 
using the Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel procedure stratified by [CONTACT_135754].  
The percen tage of subjects who deliver prior to 350 weeks of gestation will also be determined 
for subjects who received study drug (the Safety Population) and for the PP  Population using 
the same analytic method as described above for the ITT Population.  If there are baseline imbalances between the treatment groups with respect to prognostic factors 
such as the number of previous preterm deliveries, an adjusted analysis of the primary outcome measures will be conducted using the Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel procedure (for the neonatal 
composite index) and/or a Cox regression model (for preterm delivery <35
0 weeks gestations). 
An additional analysis of the primary efficacy outcomes will be performed to determine if there is a treatment- by-site interaction. A Breslow -Day test for the neonatal composite index and/or 
treatment -by-site interaction terms will be included in a Cox regression model to determine if 
there is consistency of results across the sites.  
9.4.2 Secondary Outcomes 
Analysis of the secondary outcome of fetal /early infant death will be conducted in the ITT 
Population.  The relative risk of fetal/early infant death for the 17P group relative to the vehicle 
group will be determined using the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel procedure stratified by 
[CONTACT_135776]. A two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the relative 
risk will be constructed using the method of Cochran- Mantel-Haenszel adjusted for gestational 
age at randomization. If the upper bound of the CI is less than or equal to 2.0, a doubling i n 
the risk of fetal/early infant death can be ruled out.  Treatment -by-gestational age at 
randomization interaction terms will be included in a logistic regression model to determine the relationship, if any, between gestational age at randomization and the risk of fetal/early infant death in the 17P
 group compared to the vehicle group.  
Analyses of the secondary maternal outcomes (delivery < 320 and < 370 weeks of gestation) 
will be conducted using the ITT, Safety and PP Populations. The number and percent ages of 
subjects with delivery <  320 and < 370 weeks of gestation will be presented by [CONTACT_135777]. The number and percentage of subjects with a stillbirth (MITT Population), and 
whose neonates died (liveborn infants of subjects in the MITT Population) will also be 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154127] for statistically significant differences between the 17P
 and vehicle groups. 
9.5 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic/phar macodynamic analysis will be conducted in the PK Population. 
Nonlinear mixed effects modeling will be used to analyze the dose -plasma concentration -time 
data of 17P using a population PK approach and the NONMEM software  
.  
As a starting point for the sparse data to be collected in the study, a structural PK model will be initially developed. The structural PK model will contain PK parameters such as clearance and volume as fixed- effect parameters. The dependence of apparent clearances and volumes 
on BMI will be examined as primary covariate. Based on available literature, it is anticipated that a two -compartment model with first order absorption and elimination rates will be 
adequate to describe this data.
25-[ADDRESS_154128] (intersubject) variability in 
the parameter estimates and the random residual error in the data will be estimated with an 
appropriate error model. The best base model will be selected based on the standard criteria such as minimum objective function value and diagnostic plots. 
The relationship of 17P
 steady-state exposure with the pharmacodynamic (PD) response 
markers will be defined using an appropriate PK/PD model such as an inhibitory maximum 
observed effect (E max) model. The selection of a starting base PD model will be based on 
graphical evaluation of the exposure- response data as well as biological meaningfulness.  
The PK Population will be stratified by [CONTACT_135778]. Body mass index will be investigated as the primary covariate for its potential influence on the volume of distribution and clearance of 17P through its formal inclusion in the NONMEM models. 
Statistical significance will be concluded by [CONTACT_135779].  
Other factors including race, and number of previous preterm delivery(ies) may be considered as covariates. Findings of a cli nical relevant magnitude will be investigated further.  
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-[ADDRESS_154129] of these compounds will be on 17P.  Therefore, PK/PD models to evaluate 
effects on concomitant medications that may affect the inhibition or induction of HPC will be evaluated and modeled as data permit.

required to participate in this study.  Every attempt will be made to keep study subjects and clinical site staff blinded to treatment assignment.   Women who 
need translation assistance will be enrolled by a person fluent in their language 
and both verbal and written informed consent obtained in that language; if such are not available, they will not be included. 
Before recruitment and enrollment, each prospective subject and/or her legal guardian will be 
given a full explanation of the study and be allowed to read the approved ICF. Once the 
investigator is assured that the subject/legal guardian understands the implications of participating in the study, the subject/legal guardian will be asked to give consent to participate 
in the study by [CONTACT_12568].  
The investigator shall provide a copy of the signed ICF to the subject and/or legal guardian. The original form shall be maintained in the subject’s medical records at the site.  
11.5 Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_135785]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_093]. The investigator or designee must document and explain in the subject’s source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. Protocol deviations will also be documented by [CONTACT_135786]. The 
investigator will be notified of deviations in writing by [CONTACT_2037]. The IRB/IEC should be notified of significant protocol deviations in a timely manner.  
11.6 Study Reporting Requirements

 51 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
13.2 Neonatal Outcomes  
• Neonatal D eath: Death of a liveborn infant from minutes after birth until 28 days of 
life.  Note: for the purposes of the neonatal morbidity and mortality index only, a death 
prior to discharge from the NICU will also be counted as a neonatal death. 
• Transient Tachypnea (TTN) :   Term or late preterm infant  presents in the first hours 
after birth with mild cyanosis and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (grunting, nasal flare, chest 
retractions and/or tachypnea).  The chest films shows perihilar streaky infiltrate.  Final clinical impression excludes pneumonia or RDS Type I. 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053]  (RDS):  
Must meet both criteria A and B below:  
A. PaO
2 <50 mmHg in room air, central cyanosis in room air, a requirement for 
supplemental oxygen to maintain PaO2 >50 mmHg, or a requirement for supplemental oxygen to maintain a pulse oximeter saturation over 85% within the first [ADDRESS_154145] radiograph consistent with RDS (for example, reticulogranular appearance 
to lung fields with or without low lung volumes and air bronchograms) within  the first 
24 hou rs of life. 
Note:  Include diagnosis of hyaline membrane disease, Type I RDS, hyaline membrane 
disease and respi[INVESTIGATOR_135745].  Do not include transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN or Type II RDS). Do not include (brief) 'blow by' 
oxygen administration. 
• Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD):  Chronic lung disease, defined as  
– Respi[INVESTIGATOR_135746] 
– Chest radiograph abnormalities  and 
– A requirement for supplemental oxygen in an infant born <[ADDRESS_154146] menstrual age (PMA).  
 
• Persistent Pulmonary H ypertension of the N ewborn (PPHN) :  Diagnosed clinically 
by [CONTACT_135790] . 
• Duration of V entilator Support: The total calendar days, including multiple periods 
on the ventilator.   This refers to mechanical ventilation only that is the infant was on a 
ventilator with a rate recorded and does not include CPAP.  This does include the use of synchronized mechanical ventilation (SIMV) but does not include simultaneous 
combination of CPAP with mechanical ventilation, sometimes referred to as cycled CPAP. Count the number of calendar days on which the infant received treatment at some point during the day (e.g., if the infant was started at noon on one day and taken off at noon the following day, this would count as  two calendar days rather than one 
day). 
• Duration of Oxygen Therapy: The number of calendar days that the infant received 
supplemental oxygen (Fi0
2 > 0.21) after admission to nursery from Labor and Delivery 
(e.g., if the infant was started at noon on one day and taken off at noon the following 
Version: 6.0, Version Date: 06 April 2016  Protocol Number: 17P -ES-003 
 52 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
day, this would count as two calendar days rather than one). Do not include "blow by" 
oxygen administration. Record "000 if no oxygen was administered outside Labor and Delivery. If infant receives oxygen while also o n the ventilator include those hours in 
the totals for both duration of ventilator support and duration of oxygen therapy.

Suspect – when attending physician records questionable seizures 
Yes – when the attending physician believes that seizures definitely occurred.  
A positive EEG may be available to confirm the diagnosis.  
• Intraventricular Hemorrhage (IVH) : Bleeding from blood vessels in the 
periventricular germinal matrix of the brain. The hemorrhage may be confined to the matrix or may extend to the ventricles and the parenchyma of the brain.  
The degree of IVH is graded as Non e, Grade I, Grade II, Grade III and Grade IV (5 
level categorical variable).  
Grade I – Isolated subependymal hemorrhage 
Grade II – IVH without ventricular dila tion 
Grade III – IVH with ventricular dilation  
Grade IV – IVH with parenchymal extension  
Note: The grade of the hemorrhage will be determined by [CONTACT_135792][INVESTIGATOR_135747].
[ADDRESS_154147] or MRI. 
 
• Periventricular Leukomalacia  (PVL) : Defined by [CONTACT_716]31: 
 Grade I involves periventricular flares persisting for more than 7 days 
 Grade II indicates small periventricular cysts  
 Grade III is defined as extensive periventricular cysts  
 Grade IV is multicystic leukomalacia in the periventricular and subcortical  
region 
• Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Stage: D efined by [CONTACT_135793]. 
• Proven Sepsis:  If an infant has at least one of the following signs/symptoms or in the 
judgment of the investigator has other symptoms that are indicative of sepsis, the physician should order appropriate cultures to document sepsis.

Page 3 of 21 Background, Rationale, and Context :  
Non-neurogenic Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic condition characterized by 
[CONTACT_264047].  It can 
be a particularly bothersome syndrome with a worldwide prevalence of approximately 
10.7% and is projected to be as high as 20.1% in 2018 [1]. The American Urological 
Association (AUA) and the Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and 
Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) have established a combined set of guidelines for the 
treatment of OA B, amended in 2015, to help the clinician diagnose and treat patients in 
a tiered approach [2]. First line treatments are aimed at behavioral modifications (fluid 
management, bladder retraining, urge suppression techniques, pelvic floor muscle 
exercises, a nd physical therapy). Second line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_264036], and the 
two classes of medications are the antimuscarinics and a beta -[ADDRESS_321190] and second line 
thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014], include these three options: intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA ( Botox® , 
Allergan, Inc .), sacral neuromodulation (SNM), and peripheral tibial nerve stimulation 
(PTNS).  
The [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a dose of 
100 unit s of Botox®  for refractory OAB based on rates of improvement of continence 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_264037] [the most common being urinary tract infections 
(UTIs) and urinary retention requiring clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)]. However, 
what is not known is the optimal number of injections of the 100 units. The AUA/SUFU 
OAB guidelines do not recommend a specific number of injection sites. The European 
Association of Urology consensus report [3] recommends 10 Units/ml per injection (10 
one ml  injections for 100 units). However, this was not based on randomized trials, and 
no studies have been done that directly compare different numbers of injection sites. The 
package insert for Botox® recommends 100 units combined with 10 cc of saline to be 
distributed in 20 injections (0.5 cc per injection) [4]. However, a literature search involving 
the methods of administration shows a range of 10 - 30 injections for 100 units of Botox® 
[3,5,11].   
One of the concerns about administering Botox® into the bladder is the patient’s 
comfort during the procedure as he or she is usually awake during this office based 
procedure. Patient experience is becoming a more important aspect of patient care, and 
is a marker for which provider are being measured. Currently, there are ongoing studies 
to assess whether or not 10 injections of Botox delivers the equivalent efficacy of 20 
injections of Botox in a national, multi -institutional trial . Uniquely, we would like  to assess 
if there is a difference in the pain of procedure with 10 injections versus 20 injections.   
Our hypothesis is that Botox® distributed in 10 injections will result less pain of 
procedure perceived by [CONTACT_264048] 20 injections . 
 
Objectives:  
● Primary endpoint:  The primary endpoint to be assessed is the difference in pain 
of procedure experienced by [CONTACT_264049] 100 units of Botox ® in [ADDRESS_321191] Health Department of Urology  
Protocol# IRB00059454   
Protocol version: 1  
Page 4 of 21 ○ Pain of procedure :  
■ Pain of procedure: To assess pain of procedure, we will use the  11 
point  Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) . We expect that the 
patients receiving [ADDRESS_321192] less pain associated with 
the procedure. The patients will rate their level of pain immediately 
following the completion of bladder injections by [CONTACT_20683] a  whole 
number from 0 to 10 that represents their level of pain ( [ADDRESS_321193] severe pain) during the pr ocedure. This 
scale has been validated, and correlates similarly to other pain 
scales [7].  
● Secondary endpoints: Secondary endpoints to be assessed will be efficacy, OAB 
symptoms (nocturia, urgency, and frequency), post void residual volume (PVR) at 
[ADDRESS_321194] -procedure, disease specific bother , health related 
quality of life (HRQoL),  the patient’s perceptions of change,  and adverse events 
as detailed bel ow: 
○ Efficacy:  The reduction in mean urge incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_264038] 3 days as recorded in a bladder diary. Success will be defined as a 
greater than 50% reduction in urge incontinenc e epi[INVESTIGATOR_264039]® based on [ADDRESS_321195] -injection. This outcome measure is consistent with 
results reported in previous trials involving Botox® for overactive bladder 
[6].  
○ Disease specif ic bother and HRQoL : To assess OAB symptoms other than 
incontinence and impact on quality of life, we will administer the Overactive 
Bladder Questionnaire Short Form (OABq -SF) at baseline, at [ADDRESS_321196] -procedure. This is an abbreviated version of the 
Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OABq) developed to evaluate the bother 
and health related quality of life for patients with overactive bladder. The 
OAB -SF contains 6 items to assess symptom bother and 13 items to assess 
HRQOL. This questio nnaire is commonly used, and has been validated for 
use in clinical practice [8].  
○ PVR at 2 weeks and 12 weeks : To measure PVR at 2 weeks and 12 weeks, 
we will use a bladder scanner which measures volume based on ultrasound.  
The provider may also chose to m easure PVR by [CONTACT_264050].  
○ Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale : In order to help 
determine the clinical significance of change, we will utilize the PGIC scale 
[16] administered at [ADDRESS_321197] Health Department of Urology  
Protocol# IRB00059454   
Protocol version: 1  
Page 5 of 21 ○ Adverse events: Specific to intradetrusor injections of Botox®,  the most 
common adverse events are urinary retention requiring intermittent 
catheterization (approximately 4%) [9 ] and urinary tract infections 
(approximately 15.5% -35%) [10]. Patients will be closely monitor ed for 
urinary tract infections as they will undergo urinanalysis and assessment of 
symptoms at their post-operative  visits.  
Methods and Measures  
● Design :   
- This study is a randomized clinical trial to assess whether or not 1 0 
injections of 100 units of intradetrusor Botox® toxin is perceived as less 
painful compared to 2 0 injections of 100 units of intradetrusor Botox® toxin 
for the treatment of refractory OA B. Refractory OAB is defined as persistent 
urinary frequency and urgency despi[INVESTIGATOR_264040], failing a 
trial of 2 medications (anticholinergics or beta 3 agonists), have a 
contraindication to the medications, or are unable to tolerate medicat ions 
due to allergies or side effects.  
- The primary outcome will be assessed by [CONTACT_264051], the NPRS, to be completed by [CONTACT_264052]. The patient will receive the questionnaire 
from the nurse or medical assistant after the provider has performed the 
procedure.  We will then compare mean value of the NPRS for the 10 
injection group to the 20 injection group.  
- Efficacy will be assessed  by [CONTACT_264053]’s reduction in urge 
urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_264041] a [ADDRESS_321198] of care. If subjects demonstrate a 50% reduction in urge 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_264042] a 3 -day bladder diary , they will be categorized as 
“treatment success ” wh ereas those who do not will be categorized as 
“treatment failure .” This dichotomous outcome will define efficacy as a 
secondary endpoint . 
- All eligible participants will be considered for the study. Patients will be 
counseled about the study in the office s etting . Upon enrollment, patients 
will share a 3-day voiding diary . Diary is dispensed to all patients when they 
decide to undergo injection procedure.  Disease specific bother and health 
related quality of life questionnaires  will be completed following consenting. 
As per standard of care,  urinalysis and post -void residual volume will be 
measurement . The only assessment in this list that is not part of standard 
clinical care are the questionnaires. If patients are on medicatio ns for 
Wake Forest Baptist Health Department of Urology  
Protocol# IRB00059454   
Protocol version: [ADDRESS_321199] 3 weeks prior to 
undergoing the baseline 3 day voiding diary.  
After consenting to enrollment in the study, the patients will be scheduled for Botox®  
injections in the office. Randomization will be performed using random sequence number 
generation in blocks of 10 with randomization assignment concealed in sequentially  
numbered opaque envelopes. Randomization will be performed  before the study startup  
by [CONTACT_264054] ( sealed  envelope ). Envelopes with 50% 
carrying 10 injections instructions, and 50% carrying [ADDRESS_321200] . Three envelopes will be  carried to the Greensboro Wake 
Health System during coordinator’s  scheduled clinic days . And then coordinator will bring  
those packets back to the Charlois Blvd Urology clinic on a regular base.  On the day of 
the procedure, the provider will select the next numbered  envelope that will contain  the 
randomization assignment for  the number of injections . Subjects will be blinded to the 
randomization result.  All patients will undergo a urinalysis prior to the procedure. If there 
is concern for an acute, untreated urinary tract infection, the patient does not undergo the 
procedure, and is treated with antib iotics while a urine culture is sent. All participants will 
be given preoperative antibiotics (except aminoglycosides). 100 units of Botox® will be 
combined with 20 cc saline for the purposes of 20 injections, or 100 units of Botox® will 
be combined with [ADDRESS_321201] 15 minutes prior to the procedure . Cystoscopy with either 
a rigid or flexible cystoscope (per surgeon preference) will be performed using sterile 
technique. The Botox® will be injected in a grid like pattern avoiding the trigone as seen 
below. Study patients do not know the number of inje ctions received in the bladder. 
There are two providers in the room for each procedure. Injection counting will be 
verbalized as Injection 1, Injection 2… to up to Injection [ADDRESS_321202]-
procedure . Immediately after the procedure, the patient will receive a questionnaire to 
rate the pain of procedure using the numeric pain scale. The patient will then be 
discharged to home. Figure  1: Diagram showing sites of injections for patients undergoing 
10 injections of 100 units of Botox® .

- At two weeks, the patient will return to clinic  for a standard office visit . She 
will have a post void residual checked using either a bladder scan or 
catheter, and a urinalysis (urine culture will be sent per clinic protocol). If a 
urine culture grows any bacteria, and the patient is symptomatic,  she will be 
treated with cu lture specific antibiotics. She  will then be asked about 
symptoms of a urinary tr act infection, if they have been treated for a urinary 
tract infection, difficulty emptying the bladder, or required intermittent or an

the PGI-C and the OAB -SF. The patient will be  sent home with a [ADDRESS_321203] practice 
(urine culture will be sent per clinic protocol). If a urine culture grows any 
amount of bacteria  and th e patient is symptomatic, she will be treated with 
culture specific antibiotics. She will then be asked about symptoms of a 
urinary tract infection, if they have been treated for a urinary tract infection, 
difficulty emptying her  bladder, or required intermittent or an indwelling 
Foley  catheter since the Botox®  therap y. She  will again take the OABq -SF 
and PGIC.

● Sample Size:   
• This study is unique as there are no previous trial s assessi ng pain of 
procedure associated with intravesical administration of bladder Botox. To 
calculate sample size in the study, we will assume an effect of size of 1. We 
expect that patients receiving 20 injections will be wit hin the moderate pain 
range (between 5 to 7 on the NPR scale). Therefor we will assume a mean 
NPR rating for patients receiving [ADDRESS_321206] less 
pain and  be in the mild pain range (from 1 to 4 on the NPR scale). Based 
on this, we would need 16 patients in each group. Accounting for a 20% 
drop out rate, we would need to accrue 20 patients in each group.  
● Statistical Analysis:   
1. Primary endpoint: Each patient will be asked to rate her pain level of 
procedure by [CONTACT_264056]. The 
mean NPRS score  of each group (10 injections vs 20 injections)  will be 
calculated  and compared using a  paired T tes t.  
2.   Secondary endpoints  
▪ Each patient’s mean number of urge urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_264043] 3 days as recorded on a 
bladder diary. This will be calculated pre -intervention at baseline and 
at 12 weeks . As previously described, “treatment success” is defined 
achieving greater than 50% reduction in the number of urge urinary 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 12 weeks  after treatment with Botox® . A 
“treatment failure” will be defined as achieving less than 50% 
reduction in the number of urge urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 12 
weeks after treatment with Botox® . Our hypothesis is that there will 
be more  significantly  “treatment responders” in patients receiving 20 
injections  compared to 10 injections . To  assess for clinical 
significance C hi square (Χ2) will be used.

those receiving 10 injections) . To test for significance we will use the 
t-test. 
Interventions and Interactions  
● This study will use the FDA approved dose for refractory overactive bladder which 
is 100 units of onabotulinum toxin A ( Botox® ). 
● Per surgeon preference, a flexible cystoscope or a rigid cystoscope will be used to 
inject the Botox®  in the wall of the bladder.  
● Injections will be in a grid-like fashion.  
● We will use a 3 day bladder diary obtained from the International Urogynecological 
Association (IUGA) for baseline  and 12 week follow up. (Appendix 1)  
● Immediately after the treatment, patients will be asked to rate their pain using the 
Numeric Pain Scale. Please see appendix.  
● Patients will be assessed for adverse events, symptom specific and global quality 
of life using the form in the appendix.  
● All surveys will be handed to the patients by [CONTACT_41207]. Patients  will fill out the forms 
before  seeing a physician.

Subject Recruitment Methods:  Patients evaluated in the office setting and who are 
diagnosed with refractory overactive bladder will be counseled regarding their options for 
treatment. The 3 treatment options include: intradetrusor injection of onabotulinum toxin, 
sacral neuromodulati on, and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation. After weighing the 
risks and benefits of all procedures, patients opting for therapy with onabotulinum toxin A 
will be considered for the trial. A member of the study team will discuss eligibility, review 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria, and answer questions. Informed consent will be signed. 
Three day diary provided during the at visit as per Standard of Care will be reviewed 
belonging all participants in order to capture the information. Any patient who wishe s to 
withdraw from the study may do so at any time. If the patient chooses to withdraw, they 
will be presented with the option to allow the data collected up to that point to be retained, 
or have it removed.

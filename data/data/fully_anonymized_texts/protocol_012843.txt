4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE 
4.1 Locally Advanced Non- small Cell Lung Cancer  
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer -related death worldwide, with more than 1.5 million 
deaths per year [1, 2]. More than 220,000 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed e ach year in 
the [LOCATION_002].  Non–small -cell lung cancer represents more than 80% of lung cancers, and 
about 35% of NSCLC patients present with stage III disease [3] . Standard treatment for patients 
with locally advanced N SCLC, which may be defined as stage III disease or unresectable stage II 
disease, typi[INVESTIGATOR_787570]- fractionated (1.8 -2.0 Gy/day) radiotherapy to a total 
dose of approximately 60 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy. This treatment approach yields 
median survival times of only 16 -30 months  and can cause significant acute and late toxicities 
[4-9]. The five -year survival rate following concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC 
is approximately 20%. Outcomes for patients who are deemed unfit for concurrent chemoradiotherapy are even poorer.  
In the recently published PACIFIC study [10], the anti -programme d death ligand 1 ( PD-L1) 
antibody durvalumab was compared to placebo as consolidation therapy lasting up to [ADDRESS_1083439] immunogenic tumors through the presentation of neo-antigens. In many lung tumors, a T -cell response is established but is negatively regulated 
via the tumoral expression of checkpoint molecules. In the majority of cases of advanced NSCLC, the molecular makeup of the tumor measured by [CONTACT_787588], the inflamed status of the tumor measured by [CONTACT_787589] T4/T8 
subsets, regulatory T -cell numbers and myeloid derived suppressor cells , and tumoral “defense” 
response, assessed by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 expression, provide promising biomarkers to assess candidacy for 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy [11]. 
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_787571] -010 study, pembrolizumab was proven to prolong progression- free and 
overall survival compared to docetaxel in patients with PD -L1 positive (defined as PD -L1 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/[ADDRESS_1083440] 1% of tumor cells ) NSCLC that was previously treated with at least one 
line of , with a striking improvement in the subset of patients with PD -L1 expression of a t least 
50% [12] . This study led to FDA approval of pembrolizumab in the second line setting for PD -
L1 pos itive (expression>1%) tumors and provided impetus for biomarker selected first- line 
studies such as the Keynote -[ADDRESS_1083441] doublet chemotherapy for patients with treatment- naïve advanced N SCLC 
with PD -L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) of 50% or higher . Treatment with pembrolizumab 
rather than chemotherapy led to a significant overall survival benefit and fewer adverse event , 
leading to the approval of pembrolizumab as first- line treatment for advanced PD -L1 positive  (≥ 
50%) NSCLC [13].  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1083442] tested changes or additions to systemic therapy [14-18], radiotherapy dose escalation, 
and the addition of surgical resection[19] but have failed to improve overall survival for this 
patient population. A recent landmark randomized trial demonstrated that radiotherapy dose escalation, applied to the primary tumor and all involved regional lymph nodes, may reduce survival rates, highlighting gaps in our understanding of the effects of thoracic radiotherapy for LA-NSCLC.  
A growing body of literature indicates that minimizing cardiac irradiation should be a goal in planning thoracic radiotherapy. Recent publications have demonstrated a strong association between cardiac irradiation and both cardiac events [20- 23] and all -cause mortality [17]. The 
risks of cardiac irradiation may be highest in subjects with comorbid conditions such as existing heart disease[20, 21]  or a smoking history [23], which are common in NSCLC patients. 
Somewhat surprisingly, these effects have been seen within a few years of radiotherapy delivery  
[17, 20-22] and in populations with high risk of cancer -specific mortality [17, 20, 21]. In 
retrospect, this is consistent with previous analyses demonstrating that excessive [24]  or 
unnecessary [25] mediastinal irradiation for lung cance r can meaningfully reduce survival rates. 
Thoracic irradiation may directly lead to coronary artery stenosis [26] and may also impair 
patients’ immune systems [27]. 
Based on accumulating evidence demonstrating the prognostic and predictive value of FDG -PET 
metrics [28-32], we recently performed a single- institution phase II study testing dose -painted 
intensity -modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) as a strategy to improve the efficacy and safety of 
chemoradiothera py for locally advanced NSCLC [33]. In that trial, tumors and lymph nodes 
deemed to be at low risk for local progression following chemoradiotherapy were treated with a relatively low radiotherapy dose of 52.5 Gy. Our results  indicate that this novel strategy yields 
high rates of metabolic  response, local disease control, and overall survival. The aforementioned 
high- profile studies highlighting the importance of minimizing cardiac irradiation in NSCLC

Montefiore/Einstein Cancer Center have established a novel program to monitor patients for acute co mplications during radiotherapy. We performed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_787572] a variety of malignancies were equipped with commercial fitness trackers, and activity levels were monitored throughout the treatment course[34]. We 
found that daily step counts can serve as powerful and dynamic predictors of unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787573]. Specifically, we found a 38% reduction in the risk of  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787574] 1,[ADDRESS_1083444] tool for evaluating health -related quality of 
life, treatment preferences, and treatment quality in cancer care [35]. They may be particularly 
important in studies involving radiotherapy for NSCLC. This is exemplified by [CONTACT_787590] 0617, which was a multi -institutional randomized trial testing uniform radiotherapy dose 
escalation (including all tumors and regional lymph nodes) with concurrent chemotherapy for LA-NSCLC. Dose escalation from [ADDRESS_1083445] dose of 60 
Gy and only 20 months for subjects treated with 74 Gy[17]. Investigators found no statistically 
significant differences in serious (grade ≥ 3) adverse events between radiotherapy dose groups, demonstrating the disconnect between physician- scored toxicity and important clinical outcomes. 
Impairments in patient -reported quality of life, on the other hand, occurred more frequently in 
the high dose radiotherapy arm [36]. Additionally, baseline quality of life score was found to be a 
powerful predictor of overall survival.  
 The N ational Cancer Institute recently developed the Patient -Reported Outcomes Version of the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO -CTCAE) [37]. The PRO -CTCAE item 
library is comprised of 78 symptomatic adverse events, each of which is elicited using between one and three questions (representing frequency, severity, and/or interference), for a total of 124 individual questions. For any given clinical trial, relevant PRO -CTCAE items can be selected 
from the online library to create a concise patient questionnaire that has been validated in several languages. This promising tool has not yet been utilized extensively in chemoradiotherapy trials for NSCLC. One recent study demonstrated the extent to which CTCAE and PRO -CTCAE 
findings may differ in this setting [38].  As an example, clinicians using CTCAE reported that 
high- level anxiety occurred in 0/130 subjects.  PRO -CTCAE demonstrated that  28/120 subjects

relevant to LA -NSCLC patients who are treated with thoracic radiotherapy (Appendix). We 
expect that patient -reported outcomes for these elements will be improved with the use of 
radiotherapy and pembrolizumab compared to standard chemoradiotherapy in this setting. 
 4.[ADDRESS_1083447] chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced 
NSCLC patients with high (≥ 50%) PD -L1 expression. We will explore this hypothesis in the 
“pembroRT” arm of this  prospective non- randomized trial. Subjects with PD -L1 expression 
below 50% will also be enrolled to a “chemoRT arm” and treated with standard concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy, to allow exploratory comparisons of toxicities and clinical outcomes 
following pembrolizumab and radiotherapy versus chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Subjects on both arms will use wearable fitness trackers, which will allow us to monitor closely for adverse 
events and demonstrate that our novel treatment approach preserves functional status compared to standard chemoradiothe rapy. We will also follow patient -reported outcomes  for subjects in 
both cohorts. 
While study subjects allocated to the “chemoRT” arm of this trial based on low PD -L1 
expression, will not be receiving novel therapy, we believe that the inclusion of the “ch emoRT” 
arm in this trial is critical for several reasons:  
• To characterize outcomes following chemoradiotherapy and modern adjuvant therapy. Since RTOG 0617 was conducted (2007-2011)[17], and even after our in -house PAINT 
trial (2013-2016)[33], early results from the PACIFIC trial have changed  the standard of 
care for many patients with locally advanced NSCLC [10]. Clinicians caring for this 
patient population are currently in an unusual situation, where we consider treatment with 
one year of adjuvant durvalumab following chemoradiotherapy without published data demonstrating how this treatment affects overall survival. It is therefore important that we characterize survival rates in a contemporary patient cohort receiving 
chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC.  Of note, the PACIFIC trial 
demonstrated that the prolongation of PFS and distant metastasis -free survival with 
durvalumab was not influenced by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 expression. Additionally, we have not found 
that PD-L1 expression is a prognostic factor for patients treated with chemoradiotherapy 
at our institution (see figures below). While comparisons of outcomes in our two study cohorts will be limited by [CONTACT_11339]- randomized treatment allocation, outcomes in the 
“chemoRT” cohort will provide some frame of reference for outcomes seen in the “pembroRT” group.

institution and underwent tumor PD-L1 testing. 
• To allow comparison of the safety profiles of “pembroRT” and “chemoRT ”. 
We expect that, compared to standard chemoradiotherapy, sequential pembrolizumab and 
dose- painted accelerated radiotherapy will reduce clinician and patient -reported serious 
adverse event rates, reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285], and preserve physical function. Of note, 
we have not found that PD -L1 expression is associated with hospi [INVESTIGATOR_787575] 
(see figures below). While comparisons of outcomes in our two study cohorts will be limited by [CONTACT_11339]- randomized treatment allocation, adverse event rates in the 
“chemoRT” cohort will provide some frame of reference for those seen in the 
“pembroRT” group.  
 
4.6.1 Justificatio n for Pembrolizumab Dose   
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W).  Based on the totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type.  As outlined below, this dose is justified by: 
• Clinical data from 8 randomiz ed studies demonstrating flat dose - and exposure- efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W),  
• Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit-risk including overall survival at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and 
• Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically -based PK

 Among the 8 randomized dose-comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled 
with melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), covering different disease settings 
(treatment naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched, and all- comers) and different treatment 
settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy).  Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006).  These studies demonstrated flat dose- and exposure-response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 - to 7.5- fold difference in 
exposure.  The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed-dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied.  Subsequently, flat dose-exposure- response relationships were also observed in 
other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming [ADDRESS_1083449], PK data 
in KN001 evaluating target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD -[ADDRESS_1083450] tumor PD-1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration and PD -1 expression.  This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg 
Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. 
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed- dosing provides 
similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the 
distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose.  Supported by [CONTACT_219502] -dose has advantages of reduced dosing 
complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed- dose was selected for 
evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.

• Survival duration following study enrollment. 
o Overall survival is a standard assessment of clinical benefit of treatments for NSCLC.  
• Disease progression during induction pembrolizumab for patients with PD -L1 expression 
≥ 50%.  
o As induction pembrolizumab prior to radiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC is a novel treatment approach, it will be important to characterize the rate of disease progression during induction therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoints  
• Severe (grade ≥  3) adverse events, scored using CTCAE v 4.03. 
o It will be important to characterize the toxicity profile of sequential pembrolizumab and radiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC, as this is a novel treatment approach.  
• Pneumonitis (grade ≥ 2). 
o It will be important to characterize the rate of pneumonitis, which m ay occur 
because of  radiotherapy or immunotherapy, for study subjects. 
• Patient -reported treatment-related toxicity, scored using PRO- CTCAE.  
o See Section 4.5 
• Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
o Many patients treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced NSCLC are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787577]. It will be important to characterize the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787578]. 
• Daily step counts, measured using wearable fitness trackers.  
o See Section 4.4 
[IP_ADDRESS] Translational Endpoints

 o Subjects in the PembroRT and ChemoRT  cohorts will undergo circulating tumor 
DNA testing at study entry and several weeks after the completion of thoracic 
radiotherapy. Circulating tumor DNA clearance may be a powerful predictor of 
disease control following conventional treatment for locally advanced 
NSCLC[39] . We will test the prognostic utility of circulating tumor DNA testing 
for patients treated with pembrolizumab and radiotherapy and compare rates of circulating tumor DNA clearance in the two study cohorts.  
• PD-L1 TPS score and expression of alternate immune checkpoint molecules.  
o Tumor PD -L1 expression as determined by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) has 
been implicated as a predictive biomarker  for benefit from treatment with PD -
1/PD -L1 inhibitors [40, 41] . We will assess baseline PD -L1 expression for each 
study subject using our in -house and FDA -approved immunohistochemical assay 
on archival FFPE tumor tissue . Sections cut from FFPE blocks will be 
depar affinized and subjected to heat -induced epi[INVESTIGATOR_787579] l. Slides will be 
incubated with the primary antibody (monoclonal mouse anti -PD-L1, clone 22C3) 
and visualized using the EnVision FLEX system on the Dako Autostainer Link 
48. Protein expression will be quantified as tumor proportion score (TPS), which 
is the percentage of tumor cells demonstrating PD-L1 membrane staining. 
Subjects will be assigned to the PembroRT or ChemoRT  cohort based on PD -L1 
expression, using a cutoff of 50%. Within each cohort, we will explore if PD -L1 
expression level is associated wi th clinical outcomes, including progression -free 
survival and overall survival.  
o We will also quantify baseline tumor expression of alternate immune checkpoint molecules in peripheral blood as well as from fresh tumor material (if available). 
From blood samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be isolated using Ficoll Paque density gradient centrifugation, followed by [CONTACT_787591]. From biopsy specimens, tumor will be dissociated without enzymatic 
digestion, followed by [CONTACT_787592]- color flow cytometric analysis 
that will focus on expression of HHLA2, PD -L1, PD -L2, B7- H3, and B7x (B7-
H4/B7S1) in CD8 -positive T cells and regulatory cells.  We will explore if 
expression of immune checkpoint molecules is associated with  clinical outcomes.  
• Tumor mutational burden. 
o Tumor mutational burden has been identified as a predictive factor for response to immune checkpoint blockade in several settings [42-44]. We will utilize a 
validated commercial platform to explore tumor mutational burden as a prognostic factor for study subjects. 
• Markers of immune activation . 
o The PD -[ADDRESS_1083452] with 
potential inhibitory effects on T, B, and monocyte responses[41, 45] . We will

 throughout the treatment course. Blood collected from study subjects will be 
centrifuged to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and flow cytometry will 
be performed for immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_787580] B cells, CD4 and CD8 cells, natural killer cells, 
monocytes, and myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. CD4, CD8, and 
regula tory T cell populations will be tested for markers of activation, including 
expression of PD -1, ICOS, and CTLA -4. We may identify predictors of long- term 
clinical outcomes.  Additionally, we may identify bottlenecks where treatment 
resistance may be overcom e by [CONTACT_787593].

 [IP_ADDRESS] Pembrolizumab Dose Modification  and Manage ment  of Immune -Related Adverse 
Events  
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the 
last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than on body system simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduc e complications.  Based 
on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in Table 3 .

Other allowed dose interruption for pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab may be interrupted for situations other than treatment- related AEs such as 
medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy. Participants should 
be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed w ith the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be documented in 
the patient's study record.  
 
5.2.2 Chemotherapy (ChemoRT Cohort Only) 
Chemotherapy will be administered weekly during radiotherapy. This concurrent 
chemotherapy will consist of carboplatin (AUC 2, IV) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2, IV). 
Standard institutional procedures will be used for chemotherapy formulation, calculation of AUC, and chemotherapy administration. Treating  physicians may implement dose reductions 
or withhold chemotherapy in the event of adverse events or laboratory abnormalities, per usual care.  
Adjuvant systemic therapy may be administered for patients on the ChemoRT  cohort, at the 
discretion of the treating physicians. In some cases, this may consist of adjuvant syst emic 
doses of chemotherapy ( e.g.: carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m
2). Based on 
emerging data [10], patients on the ChemoRT  cohort may be treated with adjuvant 
immunotherapy. 
 5.2.[ADDRESS_1083471] to systemic therapy in the two study cohorts is 
summarized in the Study Flow Chart . 
Immobilization, Simulation, and Localization  
Patients will be immobilized in a stable position capable of allowing accurate daily 
reproducibility of the target position. A variety of immobilization systems may be used, 
including stereotactic frames that surround the patient on three sides and large rigid pi[INVESTIGATOR_50151] (conforming to patients’ external contours) with reference to the stereotactic coordinate system.  Pat ient immobilization must be reliable enough to ensure that the gross tumor 
volume (GTV) does not deviate beyond the confines of the planning treatment volume (PTV) with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%).  
Special considerations will be made to accoun t for the effect of internal organ motion (e.g., 
breathing) on target positioning and reproducibility. Acceptable maneuvers include reliable abdominal compression, accelerator beam gating with the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126], active breath -
holding techniques, and us e of 4D simulation CT to generate internal target volumes (ITVs).  
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/[ADDRESS_1083472] be reliable enough to ensure that the GTV does not 
deviate beyond the confines of the PTV with any significant probability (i.e., < 5%). 
Computed tomography will be the primary image platform for targeting and treatment 
planning. Axial acquisitions with gantry 0 degrees and spacing ≤ 3.0 mm between scans in the region of the tumor are required. Images will be transferred to the treatment planning system for radiotherapy planning.  
Isocenter or reference point port localization images (anterior/posterior and lateral) should be obtained immediately before each treatment to ensure proper alignment of the geometric center (isocenter) of the simulated fields.  Verification CT scans and portal films following each treatment may be taken at the discretion of the treating physician but are not required. 
Target Volumes and Treatment Planning  
Target lesions will be drawn on simulation CT imaging, u sing lung or mediastinal window 
levels as appropriate.  PET imaging should be registered to simulation CT scans to aid with 
localization of hypermetabolic lesions. If 4D CT simulation is used, gross tumor volumes (GTVs) should be generated on each CT phase  that will be used for treatment (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 4/10 
phases if respi[INVESTIGATOR_787581] 10/10 phases if the patient will be treated while breathing freely).  GTVs will be combined to form internal target volumes (ITVs).  
For patients treated with pembr olizumab and radiotherapy, the low -risk GTV ( GTV_4800) 
shall include the pulmonary tumor(s) as well as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_688096] (based on appearance, PET findings, size ≥ 1cm in short axis, or pathologic data).  A high- risk gross 
tumor volume (GTV_5500),  will also be defined and will include only lesions with MTV > 
20 cc on PET obtained after induction pembrolizumab and before radiotherapy.  MTV calculations will be performed on PET imaging using a semiautomatic gradient- based 
contouring algorithm (“PET Edge”, MIMvista Corp, Cleveland, OH) or using a thresholding tool to encompass all voxels with SUV > 40% of the maximum SUV [46].  GTV_5500 will 
be contained within GTV_4800. Each GTV (or ITV) will be expanded by 7- 10 mm to form a 
CTV ( CTV_4800 and CTV_5500).  CTVs may be trimmed to exclude anatomic boundaries 
to microscopic tumor spread.  CTV_5500 will contained within CTV_4800. Each CTV will be expanded to form a PTV. PTV expansions will be 5 mm in all directions if respi[INVESTIGATOR_787582] ( e.g.: with beam gating, breath hold, or use of 4D -CT to form 
internal target volumes).  Otherwise, PTV expansions will be 5 mm radially and approximately 10 mm in the superior and inferior directions.  PTV_5500 will be contained within PTV_4800. Adaptive radiotherapy (adjustment of target volumes during the course of radiotherapy) is not allowed in this protocol , unless difficulties with daily patient setup 
require repeating the CT simulation procedure. 
Subjects receiving standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy may be treated with a standard 
treatment planning approach, where the entire target volume is treated with a uniform prescription dose, or with a dose -painting technique. The prescription dose must be between 
48 Gy and 66.6 Gy, delivered over a course of 20-37 fractions. 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/2020
26 
 
 Megavoltage equipment is required with effective photon energies of 6- 18 MV. Use of IMRT 
or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) should be used for dose -painting in this 
protocol. If these treatment techniques are not available for some reason ( e.g.: a subject’s 
insurance company refuses to authorize IMRT), treatment may  be delivered using a 
sequential boost technique (2.75 Gy x 17 to the low -risk PTV followed by 2.75 Gy x 3 to the 
high- risk PTV). All treatment planning will be performed using tissue heterogeneity 
corrections.  
Target Coverage 
The goal is to deliver conformal treatment that minimizes normal tissue irradiation.  As a 
guideline, a conformity index (ratio of the volume of the highest prescription isodose surface to the corresponding PTV) of < 1.[ADDRESS_1083473] 95% of each PTV.  The minimum PTV dose (to 0.3 cm
3) must not fall 
below 90% of the prescription dose.  The maximum dose must not exceed a value that is 115% of the highest prescribed dose, and the hot spot must be located within the PTV.  
Critical Structures  
Lung, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], esophagus, brachial plexus, and heart/pericardium should be contoured

Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the  investigator and/or the participant’s primary physician.  
5.4.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications 
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a participan t’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) including all prescription, over -the- counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
and fluids.  If changes occur during the trial period, documentation of drug dosage, 
frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF. 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_1083478] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2. 
5.4.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Participants  are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_80025] (including retreatment for post- complete response relapse) of this trial:  
• Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol 
• Chemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
• Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab 
 
• (PembroRT Cohort only) Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1083479] dose of study 
treatment and while participating in the study.  Examples of live vaccines include, but 
are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow 
fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines ( e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

 • Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an 
event of clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the Sponsor. 
Participants  who, in the assessment by [CONTACT_093], require the use of any of the 
aforementioned treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study.  All treatments that the Investigator considers n ecessary for a participant’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_77981].   
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing study.  If there is a clinical indication for any medication or vaccination specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study therapy or vaccination may be required.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the participant's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the participant on study treatment requires the agreement  of the investigator, the Sponsor and 
the participant.  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_3927]- Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.4.3 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care 
Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs w ith 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Section 5.2.2 , [Table 3 ].  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV 
treatment with corticosteroids, as well as additional anti- inflammatory agents if symptoms do 
not improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care.  The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the Investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note : If after the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to pembrolizumab, 
the Investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance.  Refer to [Table 3 ] in Section 
5.2.2 for guidelines regarding dose modification and supportive care.  It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
5.5 Participant  Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Participants  may discontinue study treatment  at any time for any reason or be dropped from 
the study treatment at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In 
addition, a participant  may be discontinued from study treatment by [CONTACT_787594], the trial plan is violated, or for administrative

treatment discontinuation are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
A participant must be discontinued from study treatment but continue to be monitored in the 
study for any of the following reasons: 
• The participant or participant’s legal ly acceptable representative requests to 
discontinue study treatment  
• Confirmed radiographic disease  progression  outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described in Section 5.2.2. 
• The participant has a medical condition or personal circumstance which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_11922]/or sponsor, placed the participant at unnecessary risk from continued administration of study treatment.  
• The participant  has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
• Recurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis 
• The participant  is lost to follow -up 
• Completion of 15 treatments (approximately 1 year) with pembrolizumab

7.1 Trial Procedures 
The Trial Flow Chart summarizes selected trial procedures to be performed at each visit.  
Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to perform 
these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_093].   
Furthermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deem ed necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/ or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to participant safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local regulations may require that additional informe d consent be obtained from the participant.  In these cases, 
such evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations. 
7.1.1 Administrative Procedures 
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent  
The Investigator must obtain documented consent from each potential par ticipant  prior to 
participating in a clinical trial.  
Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_2299]’s d ated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_2299] ’s 
legally acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dated 
signature [CONTACT_63564].  
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the participant  before 
participation in  the trial.  
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consent form 
and any written information provided to the participant  must receive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The participant  or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes available that may be relevant to the participant ’s willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the participant ’s dated signature 
[INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_2299] ’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at the protocol level.   
The informed consent will adhere to IRB/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations

 7.1.2 Clinical Procedures/Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator or qualified designee will assess each participant  to evaluate for potential 
new or worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically 
indicated.  Adverse experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and during the follow -up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Appendix).  Toxicities will 
be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment.  
Please refer to section 7.2 for detai led information regarding the assessment and recording of 
AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Full Physical Exam 
The investigator or qualified designee will perform a complete physical exam during the 
screening period.  Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as me dical 
history.  A full physical exam should be performed during screening,  
[IP_ADDRESS] Directed Physical Exam  
For cycles that do not require a full physical exam per the Trial Flow Chart, the investigator 
or qualified designee will perform a directed physical exam as clinically indicated prior to trial treatment administration.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
The investigator or qualified designee will take vital signs at screening, prior to the administration of each dose of trial treatment and at treatment discontinuation as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.  Vital signs should include temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], weight  
and blood pressure.  Height will be measured at screening only. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Scale 
The investigator or qualified designee will assess ECOG status (see Appendix ) at each clinic 
visit,  as specified in the Trial Flow Chart.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease  
Except where PET/CT is indicated based on the Study Flow Chart , computed tomography 
(CT)  is the preferred  tumor imaging.  For the abdomen and pelvis, contrast-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used when CT with iodinated contrast is 
contraindicated, or when local practice mandates it.  MRI is the strongly preferred modality for imaging the brain.  The same imaging technique regarding modality, ideally the same scanner, and the use of contrast should be used in a participant throughout the study to 
optimize the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new tumor burden and improve 
the accuracy of the assessment of response or progression based on imaging.

 Brain imaging is required for all participants at screening.  MRI is preferred; however, CT 
imaging will be acceptable, if MRI is medically contraindicated.  
Participant eligibility will be determined using local assessment (Investigator assessment) 
based on RECIST 1.1.  In addition, images (including via other modalities) that are obtained at an unscheduled time point to determine disease progression, as well as imaging obtained for other reasons, but which demonstrate radiologic progression, should also be used to determine progression . 
When the Investigator identifies radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, efforts should be 
made to verify radiologic PD. Treatment should continue until PD has been verified.  Regardless of whether PD is verified, if the Inv estigator considers the participant has 
progressed, but elects to implement iRECIST, the Investigator will assess for confirmation of progression by [CONTACT_19434].   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1083486] be submitted  to the central imaging vendor for retrospective 
review.  
Tumor imaging performed as part of routine clinical management is acceptable for use as 
screening tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 42 days prior to the date of all ocation and can be assessed by [CONTACT_11343].  
Brain imaging is required to rule out radiographically detectable  untreated  brain metastases.  
Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred; however, CT imaging will be acceptable, if MRI is medically contraindicated or CT is mandated by [CONTACT_53246]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Tumor Imaging During the Study  
On-study imaging assessments should be performed at the timepoints (±7  days) detailed in 
the Trial Flow Chart for each study cohort.  Imaging timing should follow calendar days and 
should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts.  Imaging should continue to be performed 
until disease progression is identified by [CONTACT_737]. Once disease progression is confirmed, imaging should be performed as needed for routine clinical care and does not need to adhere to the Trial Flow Chart. 
Per iRECIST (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), disease progression should be confirmed by [CONTACT_779] [ADDRESS_1083487] met the conditions detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Participants who receive confirmatory imaging do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point, if clinically stable.  Participants who 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/[ADDRESS_1083488], as assessed by [CONTACT_779], will discontinue 
study treatment.  Exceptions are detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 End of Treatment and Follow -up Tumor Imaging  
In participants who discontinue study treatment, tumor imaging should be performed a t the 
time of treatment discontinuation (± 4-week  window).  If previous imaging was obtained 
within [ADDRESS_1083489], this is the final required tumor imaging.  
In participants who discontinue study treatment without documented disease progression, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by [CONTACT_388107]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1083490] 1.1 will be used as the prima ry measure for assessment of tumor response, date of 
disease progression, and as a basis for all protocol guidelines related to disease status ( e.g., 
discontinuation of study treatment).  Although RECIST  1.1 references a maximum of 5  target 
lesions in tota l and 2 per organ, the Sponsor allows a maximum of 10 target lesions in total

7.2.1 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this study , an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 
1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on 
the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab . In the event of overdose, the participant should 
be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. 
 If an adverse event(s)  is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006]  product , 
the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness 
criteria are met.

 7.2.5 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs and investigators in accordance with all applicable global laws and regulations.  
8.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
8.1 Statistical Analysis Plan – Primary Endpoint and Sample Size Calculation  
The primary endpoint  is progression- free survival (PFS) in the PembroRT  cohort one year 
following study enrollment.  PFS duration will be defined as the time from study registration 
to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. In cases where a scan is concerning for progressive disease based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, and progression is confirmed on a subsequent scan 4- 8 weeks later (satisfying iRECIST criteria for 
progression), the date of disease progression would be the date of the first scan demonstrating progression. PFS rates will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier Survival 
method, from which the probability of PFS at various time points and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be estima ted. If a patient is lost to follow -up without having disease 
progression, progression- free survival will be censored at the date of the patient’s last clinic 
visit. Based on published multi- institutional trials and data from our institution, we expect the 
one-year progression-free survival rate (H0) to be to 40% with standard chemoradiotherapy.  We hypothesize that this rate will be at least 65% (H1) for subjects in the PembroRT cohort.  
A one sample two -sided log- rank test will be used to compare the one- year PFS rate in the 
PembroRT cohort against the expected rate with ChemoRT . We plan to accrue [ADDRESS_1083510] e size will provide 81% power 
to detect an improvement in PFS at 1 year at a 5% level of significance using a one sample two-sided log- rank test [48, 49]. 
The ChemoRT  cohort will be open to accrual while accrual to the PembroRT  cohort is 
ongoing. We expect that approximately 40% of patients with locally advanced NSCLC have PD-L1 expression of at least 50%.  We therefore expect that approximately [ADDRESS_1083511] concurrent chemoradiotherapy as part of this trial, 
which will yield a total sample size of a pproximately 63 subjects .  
 
8.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  – Secondary Endpoints  
Time -to-event outcomes (overall survival, freedom from distant metastasis, freedom from 
intrathoracic progression, freedom from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be analyzed using the Kaplan -
Meier method, from which rates at various time points and corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals will be estimated.  Exploratory comparisons for time -to-event outcomes between 
the PembroRT  and ChemoRT  cohorts will be performed using log- rank tests. Univariate and 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/2020
50 
 
   
 
 multivariable Cox regression models will be used to evaluate associations between time- to-
event outcomes and clinical covariates, including study cohort. 
Rates of radiographic responses and disease pro gression during induction pembrolizumab for 
subjects in the PembroRT cohort will be described using counts and percentages.  Logistic 
regression models will be used to evaluate potential predictors of response or progression 
(e.g.: PD -L1 TPS).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_787586] a dverse event rates, scored using CTCAE as well as PRO -CTCAE, 
will be presented as counts and percentages. Exploratory comparisons between the PembroRT cohort and the ChemoRT  cohort will be performed using chi -square or Fisher 
Exact testing, as appropriate.  
Daily step counts throughout the study period will be presented using descriptive statistics 
and will be analyzed using a generalized linear mixed -model for repeated measures.   
Rates of circulating tumor DNA clearance will be presented as counts and percentages, and predictors of circulating tumor DNA clearance will be explored using chi-square or Fisher 
exact testing, as appropriate.  Exploratory analyses will be performed to evaluate PD -L1 
expression, expression of alternative immune chec kpoint molecules (e.g., HHLA2, B7x, and 
B7-H3), baseline tumor mutational burden, and markers of immune activation (e.g., 
expansion of T4/T8 subsets, myeloid derived suppressor cell  levels , expansion of T -cell 
repertoire) as predictors of PFS and overall survival.

 Appendix 3 : Contraceptive Guidance and Pregnancy Testing  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) 
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below)  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: ● Premenarchal  
● Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
○ Documented hysterectomy  
○ Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
○ Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
● Postm enopausal female 
○ A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  ▪ A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may 
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range is required.  
○ Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Contr aception Requirements  
Female Participants: 
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Table 10 while receiving study therapy.

● Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole 
male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be u sed.  
● Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)  
Notes:  
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies .  
 
a) Typi[INVESTIGATOR_122955] -use failure rates (i.e. when used consistently and 
correctly).  
b) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, 
acceptable hormonal contraceptives are limited to those which inhibit ovulation.  
 
Pregnancy Testing  
WOCBP should only be included after a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy 
test.  
Following initiation of treatment, pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected

 Appendix 4 :  Description of the iRECIST Process for Assessment of Disease 
Progression  
Assessment at Screening and Prior to RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1083514] 1.1 the Investigator will 
decide whether to continue a participant on study treatment until repeat imaging is obtained (using iRECIST for participant management (see Table 5  and Figures 1 and 3).  This decision 
by [CONTACT_787600]’s overall clinical condition.  
Clinical stability is defined as the following:  
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of disease  
• No decline in ECOG performance status  
• No requirements for intensified management, including increased analgesia, radiation, or other palliative care  
Any participant deemed clinically unstable should be discontinued from study treatment at  
site-assessed first radiologic evidence of PD, and is not required to have repeat tumor 
imaging for confirmation of PD by [CONTACT_19393].  
If the Investigator decides to continue treatment, the participant may continue to receive study treatment and the tumor assessment should be repeated [ADDRESS_1083515] 1.1, 
including: 
• Increase in the sum of diameters of target lesion(s) identified at baseline to ≥  20% and 
≥ 5 mm from nadir  
o Please note: the iRECIST publication uses the t erminology “sum of 
measurements”, but “sum of diameters” will be used in this protocol, consistent with the original RECIST 1.1 terminology.  
• Unequivocal progression of non- target lesion(s) identified at baseline  
• Development of new lesion(s) 
iRECIST  defines new response categories, including iUPD (unconfirmed progressive 
disease) and iCPD (confirmed progressive disease).  For purposes of iRECIST assessment, the first visit showing progression according to RECIST 1.1 will be assigned a visit (overall) response of iUPD, regardless of which factors caused the progression.  
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/[ADDRESS_1083516] 1.1.  From measurable new 
lesions, up to 5 lesions total (up to 2 per organ), may be selected as New Lesions – Target.  The sum of diameters of these lesions will be calculated, and k ept distinct from the sum of 
diameters for target lesions at baseline.  All other new lesions will be followed qualitatively as New Lesions – Non -target.  
Assessment at the Confirmatory Imaging  
On the confirmatory imaging, the participant will be classified  as progression confirmed 
(with an overall response of iCPD), or as showing persistent unconfirmed progression (with an overall response of iUPD), or as showing disease stability or response (iSD/iPR/iCR).  
Confirmation of Progression  
Progression is conside red confirmed, and the overall response will be iCPD, if ANY of the 
following occurs: 
• Any of the factors that were the basis for the initial iUPD show worsening  
o For target lesions, worsening is a further increase in the sum of diameters of ≥ 5 mm, compared  to any prior iUPD time point  
o For non-target lesions, worsening is any significant growth in lesions overall, compared to a prior iUPD time point; this does not have to meet the “unequivocal” standard of RECIST 1.1 
o For new lesions, worsening is any of thes e: 
 An increase in the new lesion sum of diameters by ≥  5 mm from a prior iUPD 
time point  
 Visible growth of new non- target lesions  
 The appearance of additional new lesions 
• Any new factor appears that would have triggered PD by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
Persistent iUPD  
Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overall response remains iUPD, if: 
• None of the progression- confirming factors identified above occurs AND  
• The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) remains above the initial PD threshold (by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) 
Additional imaging for confirmation should be scheduled 4 to 8 weeks from the scan on which iUPD is seen.  This may correspond to the next visit in the original visit schedule.  The 
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/2020
58 
 
   
 
 assessment of the subsequent confirmation scan p roceeds in an identical manner, with 
possible outcomes of iCPD, iUPD, and iSD/iPR/iCR.  
Resolution of iUPD 
Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overall response becomes iSD/iPR/iCR, if: 
• None of the progression- confirming factors identified above  occurs, AND  
• The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) is not above the initial PD 
threshold.  
The response is classified as iSD or iPR (depending on the sum of diameters of the target 
lesions), or iCR if all lesions resolve.  
In this case, the initial iUPD is considered to be pseudo -progression, and the level of 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_19367] “reset”.  This means that the next visit that shows radiographic progression, whenever it occurs, is again classified as iUPD by [CONTACT_19393], and the confi rmation process is repeated before a response of iCPD can be assigned.  
Management Following the Confirmatory Imaging 
If repeat imaging does not confirm PD per iRECIST, as assessed by [CONTACT_737], and the 
participant continues to be clinically stable, study treatment may continue and follow the regular imaging schedule.  If PD is confirmed, participants will be discontinued from study treatment.  
NOTE: If a participant has confirmed radiographic progression (iCPD) as defined above, but the participant is  achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, an exception to continue study 
treatment may be considered.  In this case, if study treatment is continued, tumor imaging should continue to be performed following the in tervals as outlined in the Trial Flow Chart. 
Detection of Progression at Visits After Pseudo -progression Resolves  
After resolution of pseudo-progression (i.e., achievement of iSD/iPR/iCR), iUPD is indicated by [CONTACT_19518]: 
• Target lesions 
o Sum of diameters reaches the PD threshold (≥  20% and ≥  5 mm increase from 
nadir) either for the first time, or after resolution of previous pseudo -progression.  
The nadir is always the smallest sum of diameters seen during the entire trial, 
either before or after an instance of pseudo -progression. 
• Non-target lesions  
o If non-target lesions have never shown unequivocal progression, their doing so for the first- time results in iUPD.  
IRB NUMBER: 2018-8945
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 09/09/2020
59 
 
   
 
 o If non-target lesions had shown previous unequivocal progression, and this 
progression has not resolved, iUPD results from any significant further growth of non-target lesions, taken as a whole.  
• New lesions  
o New lesions appear for the first time  
o Additional new lesions appear  
o Previously identified new target lesions show an increase of ≥  5 mm in the new 
lesion sum of diameters, from the nadir value of that sum  
o Previously identified non-target lesions show any significant growth 
If any of the events above occur, the overall response for that visit is iUPD, and the iUPD evaluation process (see Assessment at the Confirmatory Imaging above) is repeated.  Progression must be confirmed before iCPD can occur. 
The decision process is identical to the iUPD confirmation  process for the initial PD, except 
in one respect. If new lesions occurred at a prior instance of iUPD, and at the confirmatory 
scan the burden of new lesions has increased from its smallest value (for new target lesions, their sum of diameters is ≥5 mm increased from its nadir), then iUPD cannot resolve to iSD or iPR. It will remain iUPD until either a decrease in the new lesion burden allows resolution to iSD or iPR, or until a confirmatory factor causes iCPD.  
Additional details about iRECIST are provide d in the iRECIST publication [47].

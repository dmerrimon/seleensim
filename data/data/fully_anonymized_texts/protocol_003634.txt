CooperVision, (CVI) is extending the power range of the commercially available Biofinity silicone 
hydrogel contact [CONTACT_813233] (Biofinity MFT). 
This study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the Biofinity MFT lenses. 
2 Study Objective 
The objective of this non -dispensing clinical study is to compare the  clinical performance of  
Biofinity Multifocal Toric (BF MFT) with Proclear Multifocal Toric (PC MFT) contact [CONTACT_13276] . 
The primary  variable of interest is: 
•Visual acuity  (VA)
The secondary variable of interest is: 
•Subjective assessments of visual performance
2.[ADDRESS_1126076]  lenses.  
This study will be  composed of two parts. Part A will involve a screening/baseline visit for the 
determination of subject’s contact [CONTACT_813234]. With the 
information  obtained from Part A, Biofinity Multifocal Toric and Proclear Multifocal Toric contact 

[CONTACT_813235] 2.0: CV -18-10 v 3.2: 17-Apr -[ADDRESS_1126077] be able to participate in both parts of the study ; Part A of the study will last 
approximately 1-[ADDRESS_1126078]  approximately 3-4 hours duration.    
4 Ethics Review / Statement of Compliance  
4.1 Relevant Standards / Guidelines 
This implementation document  has been developed in accordance with the following:  
•ISO [ZIP_CODE] Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects
•21 CFR 812.2(b) Investigational Device Exemption – Abbreviated Requirements
•ISO [ADDRESS_1126079] Lens and Lens Care products – Guidance for Clinical Investigations
•ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice
•Declaration of Helsinki
4.[ADDRESS_1126080] regulations (U.S. 21CFR 
Part 56.103) or applicable IEC regulations. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28078]/IEC correspondence with the 
investigator/sponsor will be kept on file.

ol Version 2.0: CV -18-10 v 3.2: 17-Apr -[ADDRESS_1126082] lenses and/or different lens care products at no cost to them .  
The investigational contact [CONTACT_813237] (NOT extended wear) with usage of up to four hours only, in contrast to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for 
daily wear lenses. In addition, this study is a non- dispensing study, meaning the lenses are not 
dispensed to subjects to take home and lens wear will be monitored closely by [CONTACT_473].  
This study is considered to be a non- significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
administration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines due to no potential 
of serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject.  
Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact [CONTACT_479600], dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edem a and eye infection. Although contact 
[CONTACT_13293]-related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does exist.  The incidence of infection due 
to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk 
is assumed by [ADDRESS_1126083] meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria listed below.

 16 8 Adverse Event  Reporting 
8.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered to be device- related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant  adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’ as defined below.  
 
 
 AE classification, coding (for reporting to the sponsor) and examples are provided in the following table of Contact [CONTACT_813248]:  
 
Code  Condition  Reporting  
Serious Adverse Events  
01 Presumed infectious keratitis or infectious corneal ulcer  
Notify sponsor as

03 Corneal injury that results in permanent opacification within central cornea 
(6mm)  
04 Uveitis or Iritis (e.g. presence of anterior segment inflammation as described 
in ISO [ZIP_CODE], Annex B)  
05 Endophthalmitis  
06 Hyphema Classification  Definition  
Serious Adverse 
Event  Those events that are life -threatening, or result in permanent impairment of a body 
function, or permanent damage to a body structure or necessitate medical (therapeutic) or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.  
Significant 
Adverse Event  Those non- serious adverse events that occur with contact [CONTACT_813249] -threatening but are usually symptomatic and may warrant therapeutic 
management and /or temporary or permanent discontinuation of contact [CONTACT_13279].  
Non- Significant 
Adverse Events  Those less severe non -serious adverse events that occur with contact [CONTACT_813250] -threatening, may or may not be symptomatic and may warrant 
palliative management, such as ocular lubricants or temporary  interruption of contact 
[CONTACT_13279].  
Unanticipated 
Adverse Device 
Effect  Adverse events in a clinical trial that were not previously identified in the protocol in 
terms of nature, severity, or degree of incidence. An Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect is an unanticipated adverse event that is serious in nature and caused 
by [CONTACT_528720].

Normal or adaptive symptoms  
Transient symptoms such as end -of-day dryness, lens awareness, itching or burning or other 
discomfort may occur with contact [CONTACT_154147]. These are 
not reported as adverse events unless in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_813230], severe or have a high rate of occurrence.  
 This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes , such as 
comfort, vision or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as Adverse Events.

 19 9 Device Malfunctions  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or 
otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens  that is likely to cause or contribute to a Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223988] 24 hours of 
the investigator becoming aware of the malfunction. 
 
Other defective lenses should be reported to the Sponsor as soon as possible.  
 This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as complaints or Device M alfunctions.  
 
10 Statistical Analysis  
10.1 Statistical Plan  
Summary statistics will be produced (e.g. mean, standard deviation). Paired t test will be used to compare slit lamp biomicroscopy, lens fit and subjective scores between study lens types.  Repeated Meas ures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or paired analysis will be used to compare the variables 
between study visits. The critical alpha level for statistical significance will be set at p ≤ 0.05, with 
adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
 All participants who were evaluated will be used  in the analysis. In the event of missing data, 
individual data points will be excluded in the analysis and not extrapolated from the collected data.

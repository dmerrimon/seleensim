CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 5 of 14 SAP template version 3.0  1 INTRODUCTION 
This document describes the statistical analysis for protocol D 7870C00002 (Amendment 2, 
28Nov2017), a trial of MEDI5884 in a Phase 2a randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-design study to evaluate the safety, PK, p harmacodynamics (PD), and 
immunogenicity of multiple subcutaneous (SC) doses of MEDI5884 in subjects with stable 
CHD who are currently receiving high-intensity statin therapy. This document details the 
statistical summaries relating to each study objective and desc ribes the general conventions 
and definitions that will be used. In addition, a set of table,  listing, and figure templates and 
specifications is planned to be created in a statistical progra mming plan (SPP) to complement 
this document. 
2 STUDY OVERVIEW 
2.1 Study Objectives 
2.1.1 Primary Study Objective(s) 
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated monthly dosing  with MEDI5884 in subjects 
with stable CHD 
2.1.[ADDRESS_1076417] of MEDI5884 on HDL-C and apoB 
x Assess immunogenicity 

2.1.[ADDRESS_1076418] 
120 subjects are planned to be ra ndomized across approximately 25 study sites in the United 
States of America to evaluate up to 5 dose levels of MEDI5884 v ia SC injection (50, 100,

monthly for 3 months and will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ra tio to receive MEDI5884 
(50, 100, 200, 350, or 500 mg) or placebo (volume matched for 5 0, 100, 200, 350, or 500 mg 
MEDI5884). Subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_1076419] dose  (up to Day 151). 
 
Figure 2.2-1 Study Flow Diagram 
2.3 Treatment Assignment and Blinding 
An (Interactive voice/web response system) IXRS will be used fo r randomization to a 
treatment group and assignment  of blinded investigational produ ct. A subject is considered 
randomized into the study when the investigator notifies the IX RS that the subject meets 
eligibility criteria and the IXRS provides the assignment of bl inded investigational product 
kit numbers to the subject. 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive M EDI5884 (50, 100, 200, 350, 
or 500 mg) or placebo (volume matched to 50, 100, 200, 350, or 500 mg MEDI5884). 
This is a double-blind study in which MEDI5884 and placebo are visually distinguishable 
until SC doses are prepared. Neither the subject nor any of the  investigator or sponsor staff

MEDI5884  14DEC2017; Final version 1.0 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 7 of 14 SAP template version 3.0  who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation of the  subjects will be aware of the 
treatment received (ICH E9). 
In order to maintain the blind, an unblinded pharmacist will be  responsible for dose 
preparation including preparation of volume matched placebo inj ections. 
Once prepared, MEDI5884 and placebo are indistinguishable. A bl inded qualified designee 
will administer investigational  product to subjects via SC inje ction. 
2.[ADDRESS_1076420] 120 subjects is planned for the study with a minimum of 20 subjects in 
each treatment group. The sample size of 20 in each treatment g roup will provide > 80% 
power to rule out 10 mg/dL increase from baseline in apoB at Da y 91 for the comparison of 
each MEDI5884 treatment group versus placebo at a one-sided alp ha of 10% without 
multiplicity adjustment, assuming a t-distribution for the plac ebo adjusted change from 
baseline in apoB at Day [ADDRESS_1076421] deviation of 1 4 mg/dL. In addition, this 
sample size will provide 95% powe r to detect a 30% increase fro m baseline in HDL-C at Day 
91 for the comparison of each MEDI5884 treatment group versus p lacebo at a two-sided 
alpha of 5% without multiplicity adjustment, assuming a t-distr ibution for the placebo 
adjusted change from baseline i n HDL-C at Day [ADDRESS_1076422] deviation of 
25%. If the observed placebo adjuste d increase from baseline in  HDL-C is 30%, the 95% 
confidence interval of this  point estimate is (13.4%, 46.6%) ba sed on the same assumption. 
[ADDRESS_1076423] (LOCF) is used to impute for missing post-baseline 
data, only post-baseline data wi ll be carried forward (e.g., ba seline data will not be carried 
forward).

[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Secondary Pharmacodynamic Endpoint(s) 
PD analysis will be based on the As-treated population. The sec ondary PD endpoints, change 
from baseline to Day [ADDRESS_1076425] bo will be performed using an  analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) by [CONTACT_782717] l ast-observation-carried 
forward (LOCF) approach to handle any missing data. A one-sided  upper 95% confidence 
interval comparing each MEDI5884 t reatment group to placebo for  change from baseline to 
Day 91 in apoB will be provided. T here will be no adjustment fo r multiple comparisons or 
multiple endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Endpoint(s) 
x Change in total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, LDL-C (direct and Fried ewald equation), 
VLDL-C, and triglycerides from baseline to Day 91 
x Change in free fatty acids and apoA1 (mg/dL) from baseline to D ay 91

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 10 of 14 SAP template version 3.0  x Baseline and change from baseli ne for EL mass and biomarkers of  EL activity, 
including serum total phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_782714], including total phosphol ipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], are exploratory 
endpoints and assays for these pa rameters may be performed and reported separately. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Endpoint(s) 
Exploratory PD endpoints, including change from baseline to Day  91 in total cholesterol, 
non-HDL-C, LDL-C (direct and Friedewald equation), VLDL-C, and triglycerides, free fatty 
acids, apoA1, lipoprotein particle size and number, cholesterol  efflux, hsCRP, total 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], HDL-PL, etc. will be  analyzed similarly to the a nalysis of primary PD 
endpoints.  
For ANCOVA, if the data are not no rmally distributed, the analy ses will be conducted on 
rank-transformed data. Descriptiv e statistics at each visit wil l be provided by [CONTACT_782718]. 
3.6 Other Additional Analyses 
The dose-response profile for HDL-C may be explored using the m ultiple comparison 
procedure – modelling (MCP-Mod) method (Bretz et al, 2005). The MCP-Mod me thod is a 
unified approach combining the advantages of MCP and modeling m ethods. The analysis 
contains two main steps: 
• MCP step: calculation of optimal c ontrasts, critical value, con trast test statistics and p-
values, and selection of a set of significant models; 
• Modelling step: model fitting, model selection/model averaging,  and dose estimation. 
A set of candidate dose-response models, including linear log, EMax, sigmoid EMax, and 
logistic, and their parameters may be considered. In addition, as a sensitivity analysis, 
secondary PD endpoints, including change in apoB from baseline to Day 91 and percent 
change in HDL-C from baseline to Day 91 and potentially change in other PD markers, may 
be summarized similar to the  analysis in section [IP_ADDRESS] for in  the as-treated population who 
did not have any major protocol violation that would be expecte d to alter their laboratory 
response to treatment. The violations that would exclude a subj ect from this population will 
be determined by [CONTACT_44686] m onitor prior to unblinding. Relev ant events could include 
premature discontinuation of d rug or change in background lipid  medications

laboratory values, 12-lead ECGs, and vital signs as AEs.  In ad dition, numeric values from 
clinical laboratory tests, ECGs and vital signs will be summari zed descriptively.  Other safety 
parameters, such as descriptive ECG readings and physical exami nation entries will be 
provided as listings.    
The evaluations will be descriptive in nature, and observed dif ferences will be evaluated for 
medical relevance. No formal statistical comparisons will be pe rformed for the safety 
summaries. 
3.7.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) a nd Treatment emergent serious A Es (TESAEs) are 
events that had an onset after the first dose of investigationa l product. TEAEs and TESAEs 
will be coded with the most up dated version of the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA), and the incidence, severity and relationsh ip to investigational product 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_782719]5884 overall for each MedDRA system 
organ class and preferred term reported. Adverse events leading  to discontinuation, AEs 
leading to death, and deaths will also be summarized. Specific AEs will be counted once for 
each subject when calculating percentages. In addition, if the same AE occurs multiple times 
within a subject, the highest severity and level of relationshi p observed will be reported. All 
TEAEs and TESAEs will be summariz ed overall, as well as categor ized by [CONTACT_99129]. I njection site assessments (red ness, swelling, and pain) 
regardless reported as AEs or  not will also be summarized. 
Subjects with potential immunogenicity related TEAEs for immune  complex diseases, 
allergic reactions, and injection site reactions according to S tandardized MedDRA Queries 
(SMQ) will be summarized. The US Food and Drug Administration h as requested that safety 
data be analyzed for this study according to the following SMQs :  Systemic lupus 
erythematosus (broad and narrow  terms); vasculitis (broad and n arrow terms); Guillain-Barre 
syndrome (narrow terms) and allergic reactions (narrow SMQs for  anaphylactic reaction,

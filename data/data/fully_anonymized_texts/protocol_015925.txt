 SECTION  V: RESEARCH PLAN 
 
1. Statement of Purpose:  State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested.  
 
This study is designed to determine whether automated, electronic alerts for Acute Kidney Injury 
(AKI) will be effective at reducing progression of AKI, inpat ient dialysis, and inpatient mortality 
rates in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203725].  
 
2. Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. 
Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.  
 
Acute ki dney injury (AKI) carries a significant, independent risk of mortality among 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] 1,2. Recent studies have demonstrated increased mortality among patients 
with even small increases in serum creatinine concentration 3,4.  International guidelines for the 
treatment of AK I focus on appropriate management of drug dosing, avoiding nephrotoxic 
exposures, and careful attention to fluid and electrolyte balance5. Early nephrologist involvement 
may also improve outcomes in AKI6. Without appropriate provider recognition of AKI, however,  
none of these measures can be taken, and patient outcomes may suffer. AKI is frequently 
overlooked by [CONTACT_15098]7, but carries a substantial cost, morbidity and mortality burden.  
Our research group conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], randomized trial of electronic alerts for acute 
kidney injury in 2014.8 The trial, which randomized 2400 patients with AKI as defined by [CONTACT_203741] 0.3mg/dl over 48 hours or 50% over 7 days, found that alerting 
physicians to the p resence of AKI did not improve the course of acute kidney injury, reduce 
dialysis or death rates. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_203726], and that alerting to the presence of this condition (wh ich does not have 
a treatment) is not standard of care.  
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_203727] a single hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and the alert itself did not describe 
specific actions that a provider could take. In the present proposal, we seek to expand upon our 
prior study to determine if the use of an electronic alert will improve best practices for the care of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203728]/or improve rates of progression of AKI, dialysis or mortality 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203729].  
We propo se a randomized, controlled trial of an electronic AKI alert system. Using the 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) creatinine criteria, inpatients at six 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], including Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], YNH – St. Raphael Campus, and Bridgeport 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], will be randomized to usual care versus an electronic alert informing providers of the 
presence of AKI and providing them with an AKI order set for management of AKI. The form of 
the electronic alerts (including the information contained in the al ert) is described in detail in the 
research plan. The primary outcome will be a composite of progression of acute kidney injury, 
dialysis and death within 14 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes would focus on the 
efficient delivery of care and includ e length of stay, ICU utilization, rate of acute dialysis, 30 -day 
readmission rate, and a variety of process of care variables.

Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Due to the nature of this research, subjects will be recruited when electronica lly identified by [CONTACT_46918] a rising serum creatinine concentration as defined by [CONTACT_113994].  
 
Identification of subjects will be performed within the EPIC system, using a best -practice alert build 
developed by [CONTACT_203743] (JDAT) at Yale. The build will examine the most recent 
creatinine value, and compare it to the minimum value in the past 48 hours and 7 days. If the current 
value is 0.3mg/dl above the 48 -hour minimum, or 50% higher than the [ADDRESS_242864] to 
clinician behavior (such as AKI documentation) will NOT be linked to individual clinicians. All such 
data will only be analyzed in aggregate.  
 
Intervention  
Description  
Patients randomized to the intervention will have an alert generated within the electronic health record, 
which will consist of a “pop -up” within the EMR when the provider assesses a patient record after the 
AKI-defining creatinine value has been registered. Providers who receive an alert include physicians, 
physician assistants, nurse practitioners, advanced practice registered nurs es, fellows, 
physician/anesthesiologists, physician/sedation specialists, and residents.  These alerts will be built by 
[CONTACT_203744], who, as mentioned, have agreed to aid in the development of this study. The alert text will be 
displayed as follows:  
 
 
HIC #[PHONE_4379]  
Page 5 of 13 
  
 
Interven tion Duration  
The AKI alert will  be displayed to the relevant provider whenever the chart is opened.  If the 
provider dismisses the alert, it will continue to “pop -up” on each subsequent opening of the 
patient’s medical record. The alert will stop firing fo r the provider under the following 
conditions.  
• The provider acknowledges the alert by "agreeing" that AKI is present (alert will be 
suppressed for 48 hours  
• The most recent creatinine does not meet AKI criteria  
• The patient receives an order for hemodialysis , continuous renal replacement therapy, or 
peritoneal dialysis  
• The patient is transferred to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203731]  
• The patient is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203732], as developed by 
[CONTACT_203744]. Randomization is achieved within the Epic system using a random number rule that is 
incorporated in the alert. This ensures that, upon meeting criteri a, each patient is immediately and 
randomly assigned to an arm. Logic checks within the alerts ensure that once a patient is assigned to 
an arm, they  remain on that arm for the remainder  of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
 
 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy  

HIC #[PHONE_4379]  
Page [ADDRESS_242865] patients 
will not be familiar with "acute kidney injury" and informing them of the presence of the condition 
may engender significant stress or anxiety without offering a tangible benefit.  
 
All investigators will be blinded to treatment assignment u ntil the end of the trial period. Care 
providers will, obviously, not be blinded to the intervention as they are receiving the alert. We will 
engage in both pre -trial and periodic teaching and discussion with all care providers (administered 
through short presentations at divisional conferences) to inform clinicians about the nature of the 
study, the fact that alerts do not fire for all patients with AKI, and to discuss specific factors that are 
being measured.  
 
 
Primary Study Endpoints  
Primary Outcome:  The primary outcome will be a composite of progression to a higher stage of 
acute kidney injury (a doubling or tripling of creatinine from the pre -alert baseline), inpatient dialysis,

Study Procedures  
Randomization  
Randomization will occur the moment AKI is detected by [CONTACT_203745], as developed by [CONTACT_203744] . Beyond the primary intervention, no 
further tests or procedures will be performed on subjects in this trial. Randomization will be performed 
within the Epic system using a random number rule that is incorporated in the alert.  This ensures that, 
upon meeting criteria, each patient is immediately and randomly assigned to an arm.  Logic checks 
within the alerts ensure that once a patient is assigned to an arm, they remain on that arm for th e 
remainder of their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].

Statistical Plan  
Sample Size Determination  
: 
In our retrospective analysis of patients w ith AKI at 3 potential study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], the composite 
outcome of death, dialysis, and progression of AKI was 24.5% (of 29,027 individuals with AKI). We 
believe a clinically meaningful relative reduction in this risk would be 20%, leading to an absolute rat e 
of 19.6% in the intervention group.  By [CONTACT_79323] 5,024 patients (2,512 in each group), we would have 
90% power to detect a difference in outcome at least this extreme at a two -sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_242867] (acc ounting for 6 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203734]).   We have 
elected to increase this number by 20% to account for potential contamination of the effect across 
HIC #[PHONE_4379]  
Page [ADDRESS_242868] a 16% increase in best practices measures in the intervention group.   
 
 
We must also consider that patients enrolled once in the trial will be excluded from enrolling again (on 
another admission, for example). While we don't have data on the rates of recurrent AKI we estimate 
that up to 20% of eligible patients may be excluded  on this basis, which may slow recruitment 
somewhat.  
 
In addition, pauses in trial enrollment may occur due to protocol changes / amendments based on 
feedback from providers and for quality improvement activities.  
 
As such, we expect active enrollment, dat a acquisition, and outcome assessment to be completed over 
a three -year period.   
 
 
Statistical Methods  
The primary analysis will utilize the intention to treat principle.  The primary outcome (a composite of 
progression of AKI, dialysis, and death) will b e compared across the groups using the  Mantel -
Haenszel chi-square test for correction for the 6 study strata (by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307]). Statistical significance will 
be based on a p -value of <0.05.  
 
In addition, a retrospective examination will be performed to assess improvement in the control group 
before / after intervention as a measurement of contamination.  We expect that providers who receive 
AKI alerts on some patients may be more likely to look for AKI in other patients, potentially diluting 
the effect of the i ntervention – this pre/post intervention analysis will help in assessing that level of 
contamination.  
 
Because we are enrolling patients across six sites, we will do an exploratory analysis to determine the 
efficacy of alerts independently at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
 
We have specified several subgroups in whom the benefit of an AKI alert may differ from the general 
population.  These groups will be analyzed as secondary and exploratory analyses.  They include:  
 -Surgical patients  
 -Subjects with baseline creatinine <1.0mg/dl  
-Subjects with baseline creatinine <0.5 mg/dl  
-Females (due to lower rate of increase in creatinine after AKI)  
 -African Americans (due to higher rate of increase in creatinine after AKI)  
 -Elderly subjects  (age > 65, age > 70, and age > 75)  
 -Subjects in an ICU at the time of the alert  
 -Subjects who enter the study based on relative vs. absolute creatinine criteria vs. both  
  
Finally, as the academic year progresses, new clinicians (such as residents and interns) may become 
more facile in their  ability to recognize AKI, which may attenuate the effect of this intervention. We 
will model this in exploratory analyses using an intervention -by-time of year interaction term in 
models of the primary outcome.

intervention). This assessment is performed within the Epic best practice alert framework as built 
with JDAT. Those that meet the inclusion criteria and who have no exclusion criteria will be 
automatically enrolled.  
 
 
9. Risks:  Describe the reasonably foreseeable risks, including risks to subject privacy, 
discomforts, or inconveniences associated with subjects participating in the research.  
 
We consider the primary intervention (alerting of providers to the presence of a condit ion) to be 
minimal risk, however no intervention is risk free.  
 
Risks of the generic AKI alert: Providers may be overly aggressive with diagnostic or therapeutic 
interventions if they are informed of the presence of Acute Kidney Injury. While we did not se e 
this behavior in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we can imagine that providers who see an alert might give more 
fluids, or keep the patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203738].  Though, in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], there was no effect 
of the alert overall on rates of renal consult or dialys is, we did see a higher  rate of renal consult 
and dialysis in the surgical ward subgroup, though this trend did not maintain statistical 
significance when adjusted for multiple comparisons.  
HIC #[PHONE_4379]  
Page 11 of 13 
  
Risks to providers:  The primary risk to providers is annoyance and interruption in workflow due 
to the presence of alerts.  Providers are, however, exposed to many alerts already in the usual 
flow of care. In fact, the evaluation of alerts in the clinical  trial paradigm is actually vital to 
reduce  the amount of alerts providers receive (by [CONTACT_203747]).  
 
General Risk of Alerting in the Trial Format:  Not all patients with AKI will be randomized to 
alerting arms of this study.  As  such, providers may be less attentive to the presence of AKI in all 
patients.  We mitigate this alert by [CONTACT_203748] “THIS ALERT DOES NOT FIRE FOR 
ALL PATIENTS WITH AKI” at the end of every alert.  In addition, prior to the onset of the 
study, ou r study team will engage in brief educational talks with all sections practicing in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203739], 
again, that not all patients with AKI will receive an alert.  
 
As with all studies where PHI is collected, loss of privacy is a risk for participants. We limit this 
risk through our use of an entirely -electronic data collection system and our data security plan 
outlined below.  
 
10. Minimizing Risks:  Describe the manner i n which the above -mentioned risks will be 
minimized.  
 
All patient data will be kept on a secure, HIPAA -compliant server with [ADDRESS_242870] from the primary dataset which includes clinical information.  Thi s linking dataset will 
be maintained on a separate HIPAA -compliant server and will only be accessible by [CONTACT_47203].  
 
11. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
(DSMP) based on the investigator’s ri sk assessment stated below. (Note: the HIC will make 
the final determination of the risk to subjects.) For more information, see the Instructions, 
page 24.  
 a.  What is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk level for subjects 
participating in t his study?  
The protocol presents minimal risks to all subjects. If an unlikely adverse event should occur, it 
will be dealt with as outlined in response 11c.  
 
b. If children are involved, what is the investigator’s assessment of the overall risk 
level for  the children participating in this study?  
  (N/A)  
 
c. Include an appropriate Data and Safety Monitoring Plan . Examples of DSMPs are   
 available here  http://www.yale.edu/hrpp/forms -templates/biomedical.html . 
 
We have uploaded our Data and Safety Monitoring Plan with this Application.

12. Statistical Considerations:  Describe the statistical analyses that support the study design.  
 
Statistical Methods  
The primary analysis will utilize the intention to treat principle.  The primary outcome (a 
composite of progression of AKI, dialysis, and death) will be compared acros s the groups  
using the  Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test for correction for the 6 study strata (by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
Statistical significance will be based on a p -value of <0.05.  
  
 
In addition, a retrospective examination will be performed to assess improvement i n the control 
group before / after intervention as a measurement of contamination.  We expect that providers 
who receive AKI alerts on some patients may be more likely to look for AKI in other patients, 
potentially diluting the effect of the intervention – this pre/post intervention analysis will help in 
assessing that level of contamination.  
 
We have specified several subgroups in whom the benefit of an AKI alert may differ from the 
general population.  These groups will be analyzed as secondary and explor atory analyses.  They

 -Subjects who enter the study based on relative vs. absolute creatinine criteria vs. both

interact ion term in models of the primary outcome.

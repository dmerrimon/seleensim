Title of Study: A Randomized, Double- Masked, Placebo -Controlled Phase 3 Study of the Safety and 
Efficacy of RVL -1201 in the Treatment of Acquired Blepharoptosis (Study RVL-1201-202) 
Studied Period (Years) :  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: March  [ADDRESS_30771] patient completed: February  2019 Phase of Development :  
3 
Objectives: The primary objective s of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of RVL -1201 Ophthalmic 
Solution in the treatment of  acquired blepharoptosis at 2 weeks and to assess th e safety of RVL -1201 for 
a dosing period of 6 weeks. 
Methodology: This will be a randomized, multicenter, double- masked, placebo -controlled study 
conducted over 42 days  (6 weeks) .  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment arms and treated for 42 days : 
• RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution 1 drop in each  eye once daily ( QD) in the morning (N = 104) 
• Vehicle (placebo) 1 drop in each  eye QD  in the morning (N = 52) 
Both eyes will be treated and assessed , but the more ptotic eye (the  eye with the smaller marginal reflex 
distance (MRD)  measurement)  will be the study eye. If the MRD = [ADDRESS_30772] ( ≥ 0.5 mm) will be the study eye.  If the MRD is the same in 
both eyes, the eye with the greater visual field defect (the lower  Leicester Peripheral Field Test [LPFT] 
Total Score from Visit  1, Hour 6, based on number of points seen on the top 4 rows ) will be  the study 
eye. If the MRD and LPFT are the same in both eyes, the right eye will be the study eye.  
Following screening evaluations, a determination of eligibility will be made following review of external 
photographs and LPFT  printouts for each subject b y the Medical Monitor, who will also designate the 
study eye.  The Medical Monitor will subsequently inform the site whether the subject is eligible and 
which eye will be the study eye.  Eligibility must be confirmed by [CONTACT_31441] , 
Day 1, Hour 0 ( Visit 2 ), before subjects are randomized to and receive study treatment and undergo 
efficacy and safety evaluations at specified intervals.  Safety and efficacy evaluations will also be 
conducted at Day 14 (Visit 3) , and final safety  and tolerabi lity assessments will take place at Day 42  
(Visit 4) , the last day of study treatment. 
Study medication, RVL -1201 or V ehicle (placebo) will be provided in identical-appearing unit-dose 
vials . The identity of the study medications will be masked to the subj ect, Investigator, study personnel 
responsible for ophthalmic evaluations, and Sponsor personnel. 
Number of Patients (Planned) : Approximately  156 subjects will be enrolled  (104 subjects in the 
RVL -1201 group and 52 subjects in the Vehicle group) at approx imately [ADDRESS_30773].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03 6

   Study Procedures  (continued) : 
Day -7 to Day - 3 (Visit 1): Screening  Subjects will provide written informed consent before any 
study- related screening procedures are conducted . For minor subjects, signed informed consent will be 
obtained from the subject’s parent or legal guardian , and assent will be obtained from the subject  
following Institutional Review Board  (IRB) guidelines. External photographs of the subject’s eyes will 
be taken . The LPFT will be administered twice, with 6  hours interven ing. If the Humphrey Visual Field 
(HVF ) Analyzer issues an “XX” for fixation losses, false positives, and/or false negatives, the test will 
be deemed unreliable. If deemed unreliable, t he test must  be retaken (once per scheduled test ). There 
must be ≤ 4 points of variance in the LPFT Eligibility Score  between the V1H0 and the V1H6 LPFT s. 
Safety assessments will be conducted. Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed and the external

RVL -[ADDRESS_30786].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03 10 
   Efficacy Assessments: Efficacy will be assessed with the LPFT , a validated visual field test using the 
HVF Analyzer and photographic measurement of MRD ( the distance from the central pupi[INVESTIGATOR_31419] ). External  digital photographs will be used to measure MRD.  
Safety and Tolerability  Assessments: Safety assessment will include bilateral SLE/CFS , measurement 
of pupil diameter  from external photographs, dilated ophthalmoscopy /fundus examination, tonometry, 
Snelle n VA using recent correction, if applicable, vital signs (BP/HR), and collection of adverse events 
(AEs) . Ocular tolerability  will be rated by [CONTACT_1175] a 4-point scale.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy Endpoints  
Primary Efficacy Endpoints: 
The pri mary efficacy endpoints will be the mean change from Baseline (Day 1, Hour 0) in the 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30787] 
at each of 2 time points: 
1. Day 1  Hour 6 (Visit 2 )  
2. Day 14  Hour 2 (Visit 3)  
A hierarchical analysis will be conducted to compare RVL -[ADDRESS_30788] V ehicle (placebo) at the 2 time 
points listed above. 
Secondary Endpoints: Secondary endpoints will include the mean observed values and change from 
baseline values for MRD  data  in the RVL -1201 group versus the Vehicle group assessed at Day 1 
(Visit 2), Day 14 (Visit 3) , and at Day 42 (Visit 4). 
Safety Endpoints  The safety of RVL -1201 will be compared to Vehicle with analysis of safety 
variables including ophthalmic safety assessments (VA, SLE/CFS, pupil diameter , dilated 
ophthalmoscopy/fundus examination, and tonometry), vital signs (BP/HR), and AEs. The ocular 
tolerability  of study medication will be rated by [CONTACT_423].  
Statistical Methods:  
A detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock.  
Analysis Populations:  
The primary efficacy analysis of the LPFT endpoints at Day 1 Hour 6 and Day 14 Hour 2 will be 
conducted on the intent- to-treat (ITT) population (all randomized subjects). Supportive efficacy a nalysis 
will also be conducted on the per protocol population (those subjects in the ITT population who had no 
major protocol deviations ). Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population (all 
randomized subjects who received at least one d ose of the randomized study medication).  
Sample Size:  
A two -group t- test with a 0.[ADDRESS_30789] 90% power to detect a difference in 
LPFT means of 3.50, assuming that the common standard deviation is 6.0, when the sample sizes i n the 
2 groups are 94 and 47, respectively (a total sample size of 141). The planned total of 156 subjects will 
allow for a 10% drop -out rate. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30790].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03 11 
   Statistical Methods  (continued) :  
Efficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order specified. For a claim of 
statistical significance, the null hypothesis being tested, and all higher ordered null hypotheses must be 
rejected, i.e., the Day [ADDRESS_30791], and if P < 0.05, the Day [ADDRESS_30792] placebo at a significance level of 0.05. It is important to note that if the Day 1 Hour 6 endpoint is 
statistically significant (at the 0.05 lev el) but Day 14 Hour 2 is not statistically significant (at the 0.05 
level), the study will still be considered positive.  
If both primary efficacy endpoints are significant at the 0.05 significance level, then the secondary 
efficacy endpoints (MRD) will also be tested sequentially. Testing will stop if a P value ≥ 0.05 for a 
comparison. 
The order of testing for the secondary efficacy endpoints is as follows:  
1. Day 1 Hour 2 
2. Day 14 Hour 2 
3. Day 1 Hour 6 
4. Day 14 Hour 6 
5. Day 1 Minute 15 
6. Day 14 Minute 15 
7. Day 1 Minute 5 
8. Day 14 Minute 5 
All other comparisons are considered exploratory.  
The efficacy measures (LPFT and MRD) taken on Day 1,  Hour 0 (Visit 2) prior to dosing will serve as 
baseline. The mean change from baseline (at each corresponding time point) in each efficacy measure 
after the initial dose will be compared between treatment groups. 
The analysis of continuous and ordinal variables will use the applicable parametric methods (t -test, 
analysis of variance [ANOVA], analysis of covariance [ANCOVA]). Descriptive statistics will be used 
to summarize continuous outcomes (number of subjects [N], mean, standard deviation or standard error 
of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical variables (frequency and percentage) at 
each assessment time point.  
A summ ary of the efficacy endpoints will be prepared at each time point and will include an estimate of 
the mean change from baseline for each treatment group and of the adjusted treatment difference and 95% confidence interval. The between-treatment comparison will employ ANCOVA with treatment as a 
fixed factor and baseline as a covariable. A t- test on least square means will be used to compare 
RVL -1201 to Vehicle with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Wilcoxon rank sum tests will also be 
used to compare tre atments at each time point.  
All efficacy analyses will be based on observed cases (without imputation). Multiple imputation will be 
performed only for the primary time points if more than 5% of data are missing for either  treatment 
group; if 5% or fewer da ta are missing, an analysis with last observation carried forward (LOCF) for 
missing data will be conducted on the ITT population only. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30793].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03 12 
   Statistical Methods  (continued) : 
Safety Analysis  
Safety endpoints will be reported on the Safety population. Safety assessments include AEs, vital signs 
(BP/HR), ophthalmic assessments (Snellen VA, bilateral SLE/CFS, measurements of pupil diameter 
from external photographs, dilated ophthalmoscopy/fundus examination, and tonometry), and a 
tolerability assessment. Safety assessment will be based on descriptive statistics utilizing actual and 
change from baseline values, where appropriate, and individual subject listings .

   4. INTRODUCTION 
Revit aLid Inc.  (RevitaLid) is pursuing the development of RVL-1201 Ophthalmic Solution 
(oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.1%) for the treatment of acquired 
blepharoptosis (ptosis). Ptosis is experienced by [CONTACT_3450] 12% of adults over the age of 50 
(Sridharan  et al, 1995). It is a unilateral or bilateral abnormal droopi[INVESTIGATOR_31420] a partial or complete dysfunction of the muscle(s) that elevate the upper 
eyelid: the levator palpebrae superioris and/or Müll er’s muscle.  Patients with ptosis may 
experience significant superior visual field defects, which can affect daily activities such as 
driving, crossing streets, and reading. 
Treatment for acquired ptosis usually involves surgery, with risks of infection, bleeding, over- or 
undercorrection, reduced vision, and lagophthalmos (inability to close the eyelids completely) (Finsterer,  2003) . Mechanical treatment of ptosis (scleral contact [CONTACT_31447] a bar to lift the 
eyelid  (Shah -Desai  et al, 2010) , eyelid ptosis crutches attached to glasses, or adhesive tape or 
putty to affix the upper eyelid to the supraorbital structures) is limited by [CONTACT_31448], contact [CONTACT_31449], or skin irritation. Pharmacologic treatment of ptosis 
has not been pursued because the agents that have been evaluated ( e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], dipi[INVESTIGATOR_31421], 
apraclonidine, phenylephrine, brimonidine) either caused mydriasis, resulting in blurred vision or 
photophobia, or unacceptable systemic side effects ( Matjucha,  2011; Scheinfeld,  2005; 
Kass  et al, 1979;  Fraunfelder and  Scafidi,  1978).  
Oxymetazoline  is a direct -acting α
2-adrenergic agonist that has been used at a 0.025% 
concentration as an ocular vasoconstrictor for nearly 30 years and at a 0.05% concentration as a 
nasal decongestant for almost 50 years. When administered at a 0.1% concentration it stimulates 
the α 2 adrenergic receptors in Müller’s muscle causing it to contract, thereby [CONTACT_31450], and retracting the lower eyelid to a lesser degree. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_31422] (0.01%, 0.025%) results in 
vasoconstriction and reduction of hyperemia but does not have the pharmacologic effect of raising the upper eyelid . 
RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution contains oxymetazoline hydrochloride 0.1% as the active 
ingredient, and it is provided in preserv ative -free unit -dose vials. 
Oxymetazoline  hydrochloride , a well -characterized and selective α
2-adrenergic agonist, was first 
approved as the active ingredient in the vasoconstrictor/decongestant nasal spray, Afrin® 
(oxymetazoline hydrochloride, 0.05%) in 1966.  
Detailed information on the nonclinical and clinical studies performed with RVL-1201 may be 
found in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
4.1. Justification of Route, Dose, Regimen, and Treatment Period  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_31423] (0.01%, 
0.025%) results in vasoconstriction and reduction of hyperemia but does not have the pharmacologic effect of improving the superior visual field or increasin g the marginal reflex 
distance (MRD ). This effect is present at a concentration of 0.1%, the concentration of 
RVL -1201, based on the results of the Phase [ADDRESS_30806].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03 20 
   Study RVL -1201-001, showed that RVL -1201 administered  once daily ( QD) and twice daily 
(BID) was more effective at elevating the upper eyelid than Vehicle, but BID dosing did not 
result in increased upper eyelid elevation compared to QD dosing. The safety profile of 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30807] ice Statement  
This study will be conducted according to all stipulations of the protocol including all statements 
regarding confidentiality and in compliance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and all applicable US federal regulations and local legal and regulatory requirements. 
4.3. Population to Be Studied  
Study subjects will be male or female subjects  ≥ 9 years of age  with acquired blepharoptosis. See 
Section  7 for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Written informed consent will be obtained prior to 
enrollment in the trial; for minor subjects, written informed consent from the parent/guardian and assent from the subject will be obtained  following Institutional Review Board  (IRB) guidelines .

   6. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
This will be a Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the safety  and efficacy of QD treatment with RVL -1201 compared to Vehicle (placebo ) 
for the treatment of acquired ptosis. The stud y will be conducted over 42 days  (6 weeks) .  
Eligible  subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of 2 treatment arms and treated for 
42 days:  
• RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution 1 drop in each  eye QD in the morning (N = 104) 
• Vehicle (placebo) 1 drop in each eye QD in the morning (N = 52) 
Both eyes will be treated and assessed , but the more ptotic eye (the eye with the smaller  MRD  
measurement ) will be the study eye. If the MRD = [ADDRESS_30809] (≥ 0.5 mm) will be the study eye . If the MRD  is the same in 
both eyes, the eye with the greater visual field deficit (the lower  LPFT Total Score  from Visit 1, 
Hour 6 [ V1H6 ] LPFT , based on number of points seen in the top 4 rows) will be the study eye. If 
the MRD and LPFT are the same in both eyes, the right eye will be the study eye.  
Prior to randomization, each subject will attend  a screening visit on or between Day -7 to Day -3 
(Visit 1). The Visit 1 LPFT will be administered twice, with 6 hours intervenin g. If the HVF 
Analyzer issues an “XX” for fixation losses, false positives, and/or false negatives, the test will 
be deemed unreliable. If deemed unreliable, t he test must be retaken (once per scheduled test ). 
There must be ≤ [ADDRESS_30810] at Visit 1 Hour 0 
(V1H0) and Visit 1 Hour 6 (V1H6). External photographs of the subject’s eyes will be taken,  and 
safety assessments will be conducted. I nclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed, and the 
external photograph and LPFT printouts will be sent to the Medical Monitor for 
reading/confirmation of eligibility/determination of study eye. The Medical Monitor will 
subsequently inform the site whether the subject is eligible and which eye will be the study eye.  
At Da y 1, Baseline (Visit 2) , subjects will undergo safety and efficacy assessments at Hour  [ADDRESS_30811] be ≤ [ADDRESS_30812]  at Visit 2 Hour 0  (V2H0) and the V1H6  test performed 
at Screening . Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will complete the remaining baseline 
assessments and the site will access the Interactive Web Response System  (IWRS) to  randomize 
the subject to study treatment and assign the st udy medication kit to be dispensed. The subject 
(or caregiver, if the subject is not able to s elf-administer the medication) will then administer the 
first dose of allocated masked study medication at the clinical site and undergo safety and 
efficacy asses sments at Hours 2, [ADDRESS_30813].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03 23 
   From Days 2  through 13, study medication will be administered in each eye QD in the morning, 
and subjects will return to the clinical site on Day 14  ± 3 days (Visit 3) in the morning prior to 
instillation of study medication. Subjects will return all opened and unopened study medication 
materials and  undergo safety  and efficacy  assessments at Hour 0. After instillation of stud y 
medication at the clinical site, the subject will undergo safety and efficacy assessments  at Hours 
2, 6, and 8. S ite personnel will dispense study medication and conduct study medication 
accountability procedures. 
From Day 15 through the morning of Day 42, randomized study medication will be administered 
QD (in the morning), and subjects will return to the clinic on Day 42 ± 3 days (Visit 4) prior to 
instillation of study medication. After return ing all opened and unopened study medication 
materials , stud y medication will be administered , and subjects will undergo safety  and efficacy 
assessments and rate the ocular tolerability of study medication . Site personnel will conduct final 
study medication accountability procedures.

b For precise timing of adverse events at each visit, please refer to details of each individual visit in Section  10. 
c Resting  blood pressure and heart rate are taken seated after [ADDRESS_30815] and pupil diameter  will be measured from the external photograph. On Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 14 (Visit 3), and Day 42 (Visit 4), the timing of MRD 
measurements must  be at 5 minutes (+2 minutes) and 15 minutes (+ 2 minutes) post dose . For a description of the timing of  all MRD measurements, please 
refer to details of each ind ividual visit in Section  10. 
e LPFT will be conducted bilaterally at Screening (Visit 1). All other LPFT examinations will be conducted unilaterally on the study eye. For subjects with 
surgical monovision correct ion, a neutralizing trial lens may be put in the lens holder located in front of the chin rest of the HVF Analyzer . Instruct the subjects 
to keep their chin and forehead against the chin and forehead rests, to keep their brows relaxed, and to look at the f ixation point throughout the test.  
f The LPFT assessment must be performed approximately [ADDRESS_30816] -administration of study medication at Day 1 (Visit 2), and approximately [ADDRESS_30817]-administration of study medication at Day 14  (Visit 3). This require ment supersedes the order of procedures shown in the table above and in the text in 
Section  10.2.1 and Section  10.2.3. 
g If the corrected or uncorrected VA is 20/80 or better, no additional refraction is necessary. If corrected or uncorrected VA is worse than 20/[ADDRESS_30818]’s eye.  
h Only tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] (Mydriacyl) should be used for t his exam. Phenylephrine hydrochloride (Neosynephrine) may NOT be used.  The dilated 
ophthalmoscopy/fundus exam  at Screening (Visit 1) must be conducted after the LPFT assessment at Hour 6.  
i Study medication will be administered at the study site at Hour 0  on Day 1  (Visit 2), Day 14  (Visit 3) , and Day 42 (Visit 4). Subjects should be instructed not to 
dose before coming for Day 14 (Visit 3)  or Day 42 (Visit 4) ; if the subject has dosed, the visit must be rescheduled. Otherwise, study medication will be 
admin istered QD in the morning at home daily.

   8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
8.1. Description of Study Medications  
RVL -1201 and Vehicle (placebo) are formulated for topi[INVESTIGATOR_31429], sterile, non-preserved ophthalmic solutions and contain 0.1% or 0% of the active 
ingredient, oxymetazoline hydrochloride , respectively . Both RVL-1201 and V ehicle will be 
packaged in identical  unit-dose vials  to maintain masking of treatment identity . 
8.2. Randomization and Masking  
Study medication will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution  [N = 104]; 
Vehicle [placebo]  [N = 52]). A randomized block design will be used, and the randomization 
will be created by a biostatistician  independent of the trial. Randomization will not be stratified 
by [CONTACT_31453].  
If subjects meet eligibility criteria (see Section  7) at Screening (Visit 1 ) as well as at Baseline 
(Visit 2 ), sites will access the IWRS to randomize subjects to study treatment and assign the 
study medication  kit to be dispensed. The drug kit and randomization numbers will be recorded 
in the subject’s e CRF . Study medication from the IWRS -assigned kit will be d ispensed to the 
subject after initial dosing at the study site on Day 1  (Visit 2)  and Day 14  ± 3 ( Visit 3) . 
The study will be double masked. The study medication will be provided in identical- appearing 
pouches with no labeling indicating the identity of the study group or the contents of the 
unit-dose vial s. The pouches will contain identical-appearing unit-dose vials (see Section  8.1). 
Study subjects, Investigators and staff, and study management personnel will be masked to the 
identity of treatment until after the final database lock.  
8.2.1. Unmasking During the Study Period 
Should it be necessary to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment in case of emergency, the Investigator may obtain the treatment code for a given randomized subject from the IWRS . The 
treatment  code is to be obtained only if a medical emergency exists and knowledge of the 
medication being taken will influence the medical management of the subject.  
The following procedure should be followed: 
1. The Investigator  should attempt to contact [CONTACT_31454] a subject unless it is not possible to do so without risk to the subject. 
2. The Investigator should document the AE and justification for unmasking in the Study 
Summary and Comments pages of the e CRF .  
3. If the subject is to be discontinued from study medication , then ALL procedures 
described in the Early Discontinuation Visit ( Section  10.3) should be completed. 
4. The Investigator should contact [CONTACT_31455] -Safety@ oculos cr.com within 
[ADDRESS_30827]’s welfare t hat will not interfere with the evaluation 
of the study medication may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. If there is any question 
as to whether the medication may interfere, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_31456]. Whenever possible, medications should be administered in dosages that remain constan t throughout the study duration. Note: Contact [CONTACT_31457]. 
Contact  [CONTACT_31458] [ADDRESS_30828] should continue with study medication . 
Prohibited medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_31430]:  
• Periocular neurotoxin (e.g., Botox, Xeomin, Dysport, Myobloc) injections within 
3 months prior to Visit 1 and during the study. 
• MAOIs ( e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) within 14 days prior to 
Visit 1 and  during the study. 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_31431] (i.e., Latisse
®) to the eyelashes within 7 days prior 
to Visit 1 and during the study. 
• Topic al ophthalmic medications (including anti-allergy [ e.g., antihistamines],  dry eye 
[i.e., Restasis®, Xiidra®], antimicrobial drugs [e.g., antibiotics and antivirals], and 
anti-inflammatory drugs [including nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
and steroids] other than the assigned study medication within 7 days prior to Visit 1 and during the study. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_31432]. All other topi[INVESTIGATOR_31433].

• Current punctal plugs or placement o f punctal plugs during the study. 
• OTC vasoconstrictor/decongestant eye medication ( e.g., Visine® L.R.®) or any 
ophthalmic or non-ophthalmic α-adrenergic agonist including OTC products (e.g., 
Afrin®); at any time during the study, artificial tears are allow ed. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30829]  that 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_29963] (eDC) system.  
8.5. Discontinuation of Study Medication  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the subject will be withdrawn from study 
medication and followed through the conclusion of the pregnancy ( Section  9.6).  
Subjects may be discontinued from study medication because of  either  of the following: 
• Adverse event: A  clinically significant or serious AE  that in the Investigator’s or 
Medical Monitor ’s judgment, suggests that  continued  administration of study 
medication  is not in the subject’s best interests for safety reasons. Additionally, i f an 
AE requires treatment , the Investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor may 
determine  that study medication should not be concurrently administered with a 
required concomitant medication. 
• Subject request: Subject requests to be withdrawn from study medication. 
When possible, a decision to discontinue a subject from study medication should first be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor. If a subject is discontinued from study medication, every 
effort should be made to encourage the subject to continue to attend study visits to be followed for safety, rather than withdrawing the subject from the study  or, failing that, to perform all early 
discontinuation assessment procedures at the visit the subject is withdrawn ( Section  10.3). 
Reasons for considering subject withdrawal from the study are discussed in Section  7.3.  
8.6. Study Medication Materials and Management  
8.6.1. Packaging and Labeling 
Study medication will be packaged and labeled at a central packaging facility.  Study sites will 
utilize the IWRS  to assign kits to subjects.  
8.6.2. Storage and Administration 
Study medication must be stored at room temperature 15°-25° C (59°-77° F). A room temperature log will be maintained at each study site. Subjects should be instructed not to store 
or place the study medication where it can be exposed to extreme temperatures (e.g., 
refrigeration or leaving it in a hot car) or light. The study medication will be provided in a child -resistant package.  Importantly, subjects MUST store the eye drops out of reach of children 
at all times. Accidental ingestion by [CONTACT_31459]. If a child accidentally swallows these eye drops, call the National Capi[INVESTIGATOR_31434] (1-800-222- 1222) and seek emergency medical care immediately.  
Site person nel will instruct the subject on the proper instillation technique at Day 1  (Visit 2) and 
the subject (or caregiver, if the subject is not able to self- administer the medication) will 
administer  the first dose at the study site, instilling [ADDRESS_30830] it in the box for return to the study site. On Day 14  ± 3 days ( Visit 3), s ubjects will 
return all opened and unopened study medication materials, and site personnel will conduct study 
medication accountability procedures and dispense study medication for the remaining study period. On  Day 42  ± 3 days (Visit 4 ) the box, complete with opened unit- dose vials/pouches and 
any unopened study medication will be returned to the study site, and final  study medication 
accountability will be conducted . The Day [ADDRESS_30831] day of study treatment; no 
further study medication will be dispensed at this visit.  
Note:  Contact [CONTACT_31457]. Contact  [CONTACT_31460] [ADDRESS_30832]’s 
kit will contain sufficient study medication for the duration of the trial. Final s tudy medication 
accountability will be conducted at Day 42 ± 3 days (Visit 4); study medication will not be 
re-dispensed at this visit. T he Investigator or clinical site staff  will account for all received and 
returned study medication. The monitor will review dispensing and study medication accountability records during site visits and at the completion of the study and note any discrepancies. All investigational study medication must be stored in a secure facility with access 
limited to the Investigator and authorized staff.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_30833]’s parent or legal guardian must provide permission by [CONTACT_31461], and assent from  the minor subject  should also be obtained following IRB 
guidelines . If a subject becomes [ADDRESS_30834] be performed in the order specified in Table 2.  
9.1. Demographic and Background Characteristics  
9.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
A complete medical history will be ob tained from each subject. Demographic information 
including date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, iris color, and date of informed consent will be 
recorded.  
9.1.2. Concomitant Medications History  
All concomitant medications (prescription and OTC) taken at Visit 1 (Screening) and for 
[ADDRESS_30835] 
dose, site of dosing ( e.g., right eye, left eye, bot h eyes  [OU] , systemic), and the reason the 
concomitant medication is being taken must be recorded in the e CRF . When a concomitant 
medication has been taken at a stable dose for longer than [ADDRESS_30836] will be performed for females  of childbearing potential only (females  
who have started their menstrual cycles) . 
9.2. Efficacy Assessments  
The efficacy of RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution compared to the V ehicle for the pharmacologic 
treatment of acquired blepharoptosis will be measured by [CONTACT_31462]  (as 
determined b y LPFT assessment)  and increase in MRD.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_30837] designed specifically to assess ptosis ( Ho et al, 2011), 
will be performed using a Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer . It is an age -corrected screening test 
with a three -zone strategy . Thirty -five points are tested in the superior field while 14 points are 
tested in the inferior field. A maximum of 48° is tested in the superior visual field. The center of 
fixation is shifted 15o inferiorly to allow for maximum superior field testing ( Ho et al, 2011). The 
inferior field test serves as a reference but  is not used in the analysis. 
 
Figure  1: Leicester Peripheral Field Test Grids  
Clinical site staff must instruct the subjects to keep their chin and forehead against the chin and forehead rests, and to keep their brows relaxed. Clinical site staff must also instruct the subjects to look at the fixation target  throughout the test.  A corrective lens is not necessary on the LPFT 
UNLESS the subject would have a difficult time seeing the target without it ( e.g., high myope, 
high hyperope, or high astigmat). 
There are two types of scores for the LPFT assessment:  
LPFT Eligibility  Score: The total number of points missed  in th e top 2 rows on the LPFT. 
LPFT Total Score: The total number of points seen  in the top [ADDRESS_30838] is reliable.  If the HVF Analyzer issues an 
“XX” for fixation losses, false positives, and/or false negatives, the test will be deemed 
unreliable. If deemed unreliable, the test must be retaken (once per scheduled test ). If the 
outcome of the repeated test is reliable it will be used in the efficacy analysis, and if the repeated 
test is unreliable it will be included in the ITT analysis set but excluded from the PP analysis set.  
9.2.2. External Photography 
An external photograph of the subject’s face will be taken using the provided digital camera. It is 
crucial that the same level of ambient lighting be maintained for each photograph throughout the study.  The subject will be required to remove mascara and any other eyelid makeup if applicable. 
The subject will also  be asked to relax his/her facial muscles. The photograph will frame the 
subject’s face from mid -forehead to the tip of the nose vertically and from ear- to-ear 
horizontally. A standardized millimeter ruler label will be placed vertically on the forehead, 
centered above the eyebrows , as a measurement legend. All measurements (MRD and pupil 
diameter ) will be made from the digital image or color printed copy of the photograph using a 
handheld caliper and the millimeter ruler label as the legend.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Marginal Reflex Distance Measurement  
The distance from the center pupi[INVESTIGATOR_31435]. The MRD will be measured from the external photograph. 
9.3. Safety Assessmen ts 
Assessment of the safety and tolerability  of RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution  compared to 
Vehicle will include bilateral ophthalmic examinations ( Snellen  VA, pupil diameter 
measurement, SLE/ CFS, intraocular pressure ( IOP) tonometry, dilated ophthalmoscopy /fundus 
exam), measurement of vital signs, and recording of adverse events. Subject rating of study 
medication tolerability  will also be obtained.  
9.3.1. Vital Signs  
Blood pressure (from the same arm, and with the same cuff size, appropriate for arm 
circumference,  throughout study) and heart rate will be measured after at least [ADDRESS_30839]’s current corrective lens prescription, if applicable,  at a distance equivalent to 
20 feet (6  meters). If the corrected or  uncorrected visual acuity  is 20/80 or better, no additional 
refraction is necessary . If corrected or uncorrected visual acuity is worse than 20/80, then an 
updated refraction must be performed. This refraction must be used for all VA and visual field (if 
applicable) assessments during the study. The subject must wear the same glasses (if applicable) 
at each visit. The updated refraction can be placed in  a trial frame or phoropte r for VA 
assessments, and the trial frame only for visual field (if applicable)  assessments.

eye. 
9.3.3. Pupil Diameter Measurement  
Pupil diameter will be measured  (either horizonta lly or vertically if top of pupil is not visible in 
photograph) from the external photograph (see Section  9.2.2). 
9.3.4. Slit Lamp Exam/Corneal Fluorescein Staining  
A routine SLE will be performed to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye, including lids, 
cornea, conjunctiva, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Abnormalities will be documented. 
Fluorescein staining of the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_31436]’s standard of care.  
Staining will be graded on a 5- point scale:  
0 = No staining 
1 = Trace 
2 = Mild  
3 = Moderate 
4 = Severe 
9.3.5. Dilated Ophthalmoscopy/Fundus Exam  
Direct dilated ophthalmoscopy will include assessment of the optic nerve head for pallor and 
cuppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. A fundus exam consisting of the vitreous, optic nerve, macula, and peripheral retina 
will be conducted, and the structures will be graded as normal or abnormal. Only tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 
(Mydriacyl) should be used for this exam. Phenylephrine hydrochloride (Neosynephrine) may NOT  be used. 
9.3.6. Intraocular Pressure Tonometry 
Intraocular pressure will be measured utilizing a Goldmann , Tono- Pen, or iCare tonometer 
(whichever is chosen, it must be used for the duration of the trial ; no combination is permitted)  
and using the standard of ca re. If possible, the same calibrated instrument should be used for a 
given subject throughout the study.

   9.3.7. Study Medication Tolerability  Assessment  
Subjects will be asked to rate the ocular tolerability  of the medication according to the following 
4-point sc ale: 
0 = No discomfort 
1 = Mild discomfort 2 = Moderate discomfort 
3 = Severe discomfort  
9.4. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
9.4.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study subject administered a 
study medication (pharmaceutical/biological product) that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship to this medication. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or diseas e temporally associated with the 
use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Study medication 
includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator product or vehicle placebo 
that is given during any phase of the study. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results 
constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. 
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_31463]-ended questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. At each clinic visit, study personnel should ask the following question: "Ha ve 
you had any problems since your last visit?” AEs also may be detected when they are 
volunteered by [CONTACT_31464]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, 
• Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term "life -threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (excluding progression/outcome of the disease under study), 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
RVL -[ADDRESS_30842].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03  40 
   • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
• Is medically  significant; i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the health of the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. 
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre- existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study, is not 
considered an SAE. 
All SAEs that are ongoing at the time of completion or discontinuation from the study will be 
followed until stabilization or resolution of the event. 
9.5. Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of AEs to the study medication should be assessed by [CONTACT_31465]. 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship unlikely, or, other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
Suspe cted:  The temporal relationship of the event to the study medication makes a causal 
relationship possible or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not 
provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
If there is any val id reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect 
relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be 
considered “suspected.” 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by [CONTACT_31466] “suspected” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational 
product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
9.6. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], regardless of severity or potential association with the study medication or study procedures, will be recorded in the e CRF . 
Changes from baseline assessments that are part of the disease being studied will not necessarily be recorded as adverse events unless the Investigator deems them as such. Clinically significant 
changes in blood pressure and heart rate should be reported as AEs. All AEs that occur following  
consent and until the final study visit ( Day 42, Visit 4) should be collected and recorded on the 
AE eCRF  page. Serious adverse events will be followed until the event is resolved or stabilized. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30843] medical terminology when possible. For each AE, 
the Investigator will evaluate and report the following: 
• Onset (date);  
• Resolution (date); 
• Severity grade (mild, moderate, severe);  
• Relationship to study medication (not suspected, suspected); 
• Action taken (none, study medication temporarily interrupted, study medication 
permanently discontinued; concomitant medication taken; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; other); 
• Serious outcome (yes/no). 
The severity grade should be determined by [CONTACT_31467]. 
• Mild : Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal daily activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities  
It is important to distin guish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
(as defined directly above) whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
An AE of severe intensity may not be cons idered serious. 
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form. Pregnancy in 
itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_31438] a contr aceptive medication.  The subject will be 
withdrawn from study medication and followed through conclusion of pregnancy. The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital 
abnormality) must be followed up and documented. 
9.7. Reporting Adverse Events  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded following consent and until the final study 
visit, Day 42 (Visit 4 ), following the end of treatment exposure. Any SAEs “suspected” to be 
related to the investigational product and discovered by [CONTACT_7201].  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported to Oculos within [ADDRESS_30844] assess the SAE relationship and complete 
the SAE form.  Oculos/ RevitaLid Inc. may request additional information. Follow-up information 
(e.g., discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to 
. 

RVL -[ADDRESS_30845].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03  42 
   In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRF  page with the serious 
question marked “Yes”.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis 
as instructed by [CONTACT_31469]’s determination of causality.  
All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event. 
RevitaLid Inc.  will report all SAEs to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the 
appropriate schedule depending if the event is drug related or not drug related, expected or 
unexpected (based on the available information in the Investigator’s Brochure ). 
Any deat h occurring during the study and follow up period should be reported as an SAE. For 
any death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study medication , the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to Oculos. A death occurring after 
completion of the study does not require completion of the SAE form.

   10. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
Table 2 provides a tabular summary of all scheduled visits and procedures to be performed 
during the clini cal study.  
Hour number (when not “0”) refers to hours passed since administration of study medication. 
10.1. Screening Visit  
Screening eligibility assessments are obtained during the Screening Visit conducted on or 
between Day -7 to Day -3 (Visit 1 ). Key eligibi lity determinants will be MRD measured from 
external digital color photographs, [ADDRESS_30847] with ≤ 4 points of variance in the LPFT 
Eligibility Score  between the V1H0 and V1H6 LPFTs, and Snellen VA. All assessments of 
efficacy (LPFT  and MRD) and sa fety (VA, pupil diameter , SLE)/CF S, IOP, dilated 
ophthalmoscopy/fundus exam) will be conducted in both eye s (OU) at Screening. External 
photographs and LPFT printouts will be sent to the Medical Monitor for reading/confirmation of eligibility/determination  of study eye.   
10.1.1. Day -7 to Day -3 ( Visit 1 ): Screening  
At Screening , Day -7 to Day -3 (Visit 1 ), subjects will provide informed consent before any 
study- related procedures are conducted . For minor subjects, permission  will be obtained from the 
subject’s  parent or legal guardian by [CONTACT_31470], and assent will be 
obtained from the minor subject  following IRB guidelines . Subjects will then participate in 
screening procedures to establish eligibility for the study. At the end of the  visit, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed and external photograph and LPFT printouts will be sent to the Medical Monitor for reading/confirmation of eligibility/determination of study eye.   
Screening procedures include the following: 
• Informed c onsent /assent  
• Demographics 
• Medical and ocular histories  
• Urine pregnancy test (females  of childbearing potential only) 
• Prior and concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
• BP/HR  
• Snellen visual acuity (OU)  
• MRD  (OU)  (from external photograph) 
• Pupil diameter measuremen t (OU) (from external photograph) 
• LPFT  (OU) ; administered twice, with 6 hours intervening. If the HVF Analyzer 
issues an “XX” for fixation losses, false positives, and/or false negatives, the test will 
be deemed unreliable. If deemed unreliable, t he test must be retaken (once per 
scheduled test ).

At the end of the visit, i nclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed and ext ernal photographs 
and LPFT printouts will be uploaded through the eDC system to  the Medical Monitor for 
reading/confirmation. The Medical Monitor will subsequently inform the site whether the subject 
is eligible and which eye will be the study eye.  
If both eyes qualify, t he more ptotic eye (the eye with the smaller  MRD measurement), will be 
the study eye. If the MRD = [ADDRESS_30849] (≥ 0.5 mm) will be the study eye. If the MRD is the same in bo th eyes, the eye 
with the greater visual field defect (the lower  LPFT Total Score from the V1H6 LPFT , based on 
the number of points seen in the top 4 rows) will be the study eye. If the MRD and LPFT are the same in both eyes, the right eye will be the stud y eye.  
10.2. Treatment Visits  
For all treatment visits , LPFT assessments will be performed  in the study eye ; safety assessments 
(VA, pupil diameter , SLE/CF S, IOP, dilated ophthalmoscopy /fundus exam)  and efficacy 
assessment from external photography (MRD) will be  conducted OU. The window for each 
hourly assessment time point is ±30 minutes.

   11. STATISTICS  
11.1. General Considerations  
This is a  Phase 3  study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of QD treatment with RVL -1201 
Ophthalmic Solution  (oxymetazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.1%) compared to 
Vehicle (placebo) for the treatment of acquired ptosis. 
Subjec ts will be randomized in a 2 :1 ratio of RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution to Vehicle into 
2 treatment groups and treated for 42 days:  
• RVL -1201 Ophthalmic Solution  1 drop in each  eye QD in the morning (N = 104) 
• Vehicle (placebo) 1 drop in each  eye QD in the morning (N = 52) 
All efficacy variables will be compared between the RVL -1201 QD tr eatment regimen  and 
placebo.  
A biostatistician will perform statistical analyses as agreed with the Sponsor according to the 
Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) . Any additional or supplemental data analysis performed 
independently by [CONTACT_31472] s ubmitted to the Sponsor for review. 
A detailed SAP will be finalized prior to database lock.  The analysis of continuous and ordinal 
variables will use the applicable parametric methods (t -test, analysis of variance [ANOVA], and 
analysis  of covariance [ANCO VA]). Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize continuous 
outcomes (number of subjects [N], mean, standard deviation or standard error of the mean, median, maximum, and minimum) and categorical variables (frequency and percentage) at each assessmen t time point ( the time points at which data are collected are specified in the schedule of 
observations—see Table 2).  
Final analyses of efficacy will be conducted when all subjects complete Day 42 (Visit 4). 
11.1.1. Handlin g of Missing Data 
All efficacy analyses will be based on observed cases (without imputation). If more than 5% of 
data in any treatment group are missing, multiple imputation will be employed to analyze incomplete data sets under the assumption that the mec hanism responsible for the missing data is 
at worst characterized as missing at random (MAR). The reasons for missing data will be 
recorded and the impact of these reasons and any treatment group imbalance on the assumption 
of MAR will be evaluated. If 5% or fewer data are missing, an analysis with last observation 
carried forward ( LOCF ) for missing data will be conducted on the ITT population only. 
11.2. Determination of Sample Size  
A two -group t-test with a 0.[ADDRESS_30864] 90% power to detect a 
difference in LPFT means of 3.50, assuming that the common standard deviation is 6.0, when the 
sample sizes in the 2 groups are 94 and 47, respectively (a total sample size of 141). The planned 
total of 156 subjects will allow for a 10% drop-out rate.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_30865].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03  51 
   11.3. Analysis Populations  
Three populations will be used for analysis, as described below. 
11.3.1. Populations for Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at leas t 
one dose of the allocated study medication. The primary efficacy analysis of the LPFT endpoints 
at Day 1 Hour 6 and Day 14 Hour 2 will be conducted on the ITT population. [IP_ADDRESS]. Per-Protocol (PP) Population 
The per -protocol (PP) population consists of those subjects in the ITT population who had no 
major protocol deviations. Supportive efficacy analysis will be conducted on the PP population. 11.3.2. Safety Population  
The safety population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of the 
allocated study medication.  All safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. 
11.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Subject demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all analysis 
populations . Summary tables will be su pported with individual subject data listings. 
11.5. Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population for the primary efficacy variables. Analysis of the hierarchical efficacy variables will also be conducted with the PP population 
using only observed data. 
Efficacy data will be presented in tables of descriptive statistics and frequency distribution. All 
summary tables will be supported with individual subject data listings.  
The efficacy measures (LPFT and MRD) taken on Visit 2 ( Day 1 , Hour 0) prior to dosing will 
serve as baseline.  
11.5.1. Hypothesis Testing  
The primary efficacy endpoints will be tested sequentially in the order specified. For a claim of 
statistical significance, the null hypothesis being tested,  and all higher ordered null hypotheses 
must be rejected , i.e., the Day [ADDRESS_30866], and if P  < 0.05, the Day [ADDRESS_30867] placebo at a significance level 
of 0.05. It is important to note that if the Day 1 Hour 6 endpoint is statistically significant (at the 
0.05 level) but Day 14 Hour 2 is not statistically significant (at the 0.05 level), the study will st ill 
be considered positive.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_30868].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03  52 
   If both primary efficacy endpoints are significant at the 0.05 significance level, then the 
secondary efficacy endpoi nts (MRD) will also be tested sequentially. Testing will stop if a 
P value ≥ 0.05 for a comparison.  The order of testing is as follows:   
1. Day 1 Hour 2 
2. Day 14 Hour 2 
3. Day 1 Hour 6 
4. Day 14 Hour 6 
5. Day 1 Minute 15 
6. Day 14 Minute 15 
7. Day 1 Minute 5 
8. Day 14 Minute 5 
All other comparisons are considered exploratory. 
11.5.2. Primary  Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoints will be the mean change from Baseline (Day 1 , Hour 0 ) in the 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30869] at:  
1. Day 1 Hour 6 ( Visit 2 )  
2. Day 14  Hour 2 ( Visit 3 ) 
11.5.3. Primary Efficacy Analysis 
A summary of the efficacy endpoints will be prepared at each time point and will include an 
estimate of the mean change from baseline for each treatment group and o f the adjusted 
treatment difference and 95% confidence interval. The between -treatment comparison will 
employ ANCOVA with treatment as a fixed factor and baseline as a covariable. A t -test on least 
squares means will be used to compare RVL -[ADDRESS_30870] data in the RVL-1201 group versus the Vehicle group assessed at Day 1 (Visit 2), Day 14 
(Visit 3), and at Day 42 (Visit 4). 
11.5.5. Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The same analysis methods that are used for the primary efficacy endpoints will be utilized for 
the second ary efficacy endpoints.

are being protected, the reported data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct 
of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol, with ICH GCP, and with the applicable regulatory requirements.  
To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements, RevitaLid or its 
agent may conduct a quality assurance audit at any time during or after completion of a study. The Investigator  will be given adequate notice if he/she is selected for an audit. The audit will 
include but is not limited to: a review of all informed consent/assent  forms, medical records, and 
regulatory documentation; an assessment of study conduct and protocol compliance; and a review of the investigational drug product receipt, storage, and administration. At the conclusion 
of an audit, the auditor will conduct a brief meeting with the Investigator to review the findings 
of the audit. 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30873] (IRB)  
The IRB must review, approve, and provide continuing review of the clinical study protocol, 
protocol amendments, the informed consent documents, subject recruitment advertisements, and any other written information to be provided to the subjects. Initial IRB approval is an 
affirmative decision that the clinical study has been reviewed and may be conducted at the study site within the constraints set forth by [CONTACT_1201], the institution, GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. A copy of the IRB approval letter for the protocol, the informed consent, the 
intended advertising, and any written material to be provided to the subject must be submitted to Oculos prior to release of investigational supplies to the study site. Progress reports and notifications of serious adverse drug reactions will be provided to the IRB according to local 
regulations and guidelines. The IRB must be notified of completion or termination of the study. 
The study site must maintain an accurate and complete record of all reports, documents, and 
other submissions made to the IRB concerning this protocol.

It is the responsibility of the Investigator to inform each subject of the purpose of this clinical 
trial, including possible risks and benefits, and to document the informed consent process. Prior 
to undergoing any study-related procedures, the subject must read, sign, and date the current IRB-approved version of the informed consent form. For minor subjects, the assent form must be 
signed and dated per IRB guidelines. If subjects become [ADDRESS_30874] Confidentiality and Confidentiality of Data  
Data generated for the study should be stored in a limited- access file area and be accessible only 
to representatives of the study site, Oculos/ RevitaLid Inc. , the IRB, and FDA/relevant regulatory 
RVL -[ADDRESS_30875]’s participation in this study may be given 
to the subject’s personal physician or to the appropriate medical personnel responsible for the 
subject’s welfare. No information that can be related to a specific individual subject will be released or used in any fashion without the signed written consent of that subject. All reports and communications relating to study subjects will identify subjects only by [CONTACT_31477]. Complete subject identification will be kept by [CONTACT_31478]- term follow -up, if needed. This information will be treated with strict 
adherence to professional standards of confidentiality. 
13.5. Study Monitoring  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_31479]. to assure complianc e with the 
study protocol and the quality of the data collected. Monitoring visits may occur as required and could include a study initiation visit, interim monitoring visits, and a study close-out visit. 
Training will be provided for key investigative personnel in all aspects of study conduct. The 
Investigator will be responsible for making sure that clinical site personnel are provided adequate training on conducting their designated tasks. 
The sites  will record data directly into the eCRF in order to opt imize the eCRF source 
verification process with limited hand- written  source documentation. Monitors will review e-
source data and overall study data/consistency remotely and query discrepancies based upon 
eCRF entries (eCRF initial entry is the source). Du ring this monitoring, data are reviewed as 
entered by [CONTACT_779], and the monitors will flag any abnormalities, trends, or safety signals for 
Medical Monitor review and monitor follow-up onsite, if necessary.  
During visits to the clinical site, the monitor may review the source documents including but not limited to LPFT  tests , signed informed consent forms, study medication accountability and 
storage, and the reporting procedures for AEs and SAEs . All data generated during this study and 
the medical records/ documents from which they originated are subject to inspection by 
[CONTACT_31474]/ RevitaLid Inc. , the FDA, and other regulatory agencies. The Investigator  must notify 
Oculos promptly of any inspections scheduled by [CONTACT_12721].  
Upon completion of the study, the clinical monitor will conduct a final visit (closeout) to the site. The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports are complete, verify that the study medication  and other supplies have been accounted for, and ensure that the 
Investigator s are aware of their responsibilities once the study ends.  
The Investigator is responsible for permitting the Oculos direct access to any study documents for monitoring and auditing purposes, for providing adequate space for monitoring, and for 
addressing any questions or issues that might be raised by [CONTACT_31480] a timely 
basis.  
13.6. Case Report Forms and Study Records  
All data relating to study procedures will be entered  by [CONTACT_31481] e CRFs  provided by 
[CONTACT_31474]. The e CRF  is the first place the majority of the study data will be recorded  and therefore 
considered to be the source document. In general, paper source documents will not be created, but when generated, source documents (e.g., discharge summaries, etc.) will be retained at the study site.  
RVL -[ADDRESS_30876] be reported to Oculos upon discovery. A reportable protocol deviation is defined as nonadherence to the 
protocol that involves inclusion/exclusion criteria, affects subject safety, or has the potential to 
affect the integrity of the data . Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance 
with IRB guidelines . If there is any question as to whether the deviation is reportable, Oculo s and 
the IRB should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
All changes to the protocol will be made by [CONTACT_1034]/Oculos or designee as an approved 
amendment to the protocol, submitted to the FDA, and approved by [CONTACT_31482].  
13.8. Access to Source Documentation  
A trial-related monitoring audit, review by [CONTACT_1201], and/or regulatory inspection may be 
conducted at any time during or after completion of a study ( Section  12). The Investigator will 
be given adequate notice if h e/she is selected for an audit and must provide direct access to study 
documentation. The audit may include, but is not limited to, a review of all ICFs ; a review of 
medical records; a review of regulatory documentation; an assessment of study conduct and protocol compliance; and a review of the investigational drug product receipt, storage, and administration.  
13.9. Data Generation and Analysis  
Management of data and the production of the clinical study report will be the responsibility of Oculos or their design ee. 
During the course of the trial, data queries will be generated for data items that are potentially 
erroneous and require appropriate clarification or correction. Such clarifications and corrections 
will be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_31483]. Prior to database lock, data listings will be generated,  and anomalous values investigated. 
13.9.1. Retention of Data  
The Investigator must maintain essential study documents (protocol and amendments, source 
documentation corresponding to all information contained in the CRFs/eCRFs, signed ICFs, relevant correspondence, and all other supporting documentation) until at least [ADDRESS_30877].RVL -1201.RVL-1201-202.PR.A03  58

 Detailed  Protocol  for Feasibility  and Acceptability  of Digital  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_769375] (DigiPrEP ) 
IRB Protocol : 108773 3 
Version 11.1, November 5, 2019  
Principal  Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_3349]  R Chai MD MMS  
 
I. Background  and Significance  
Digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769376]-time verification  of medication  ingestion  events  and can be used  to monitor  medication  
adherence ; previous  studies  have  demonstrated  their acceptability  in real-world  patient  populations .1-[ADDRESS_1055771]  
demonstrated  pre-exposure  prophylaxis  (PrEP ) with once  daily Truvada  is efficacious  in preventing  HIV 
infection , protection  is highly  dependent  on adherence . There  is a clear  dose  response  relationship  between  PrEP  
adherence  and prevention  of HIV transmission .[ADDRESS_1055772]-hoc analyses  of the iPrEX  data (corroborated  by [CONTACT_769412] ) found  that individuals  whose  drug levels  were  consistent  with taking  4 or more  doses  of 
TDF/FTC a week  had a greater  than 90% level of protection  from HIV; but only 50% of MSM  in iPrEX  achieved  
consistent  adherence .2,4-6 Substance  use among  MSM  occurs  syndemically  in the context  of other  mental  health  
vulnerabilities  (most  notably  depression , sexual  trauma , and intimate  partner  violence7 that increase  their risk for 
condomless  anal sex and HIV infection ). Similarly , among  HIV-infected  MSM , the impact  of substance  use on ART 
adherence  and HIV treatment  outcomes  is also well established18, [ADDRESS_1055773]  already  identified  
substance  use as a significant  barrier  to optimal  PrEP  adherence  among  MSM .19, 21 
 
II. Specific  Aims

Due to the exploratory nature of  this proposal, we will enroll only MSM individuals ( cisgender male ) in this 
study with the intent of generating preliminary data on feasibility of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769378] . 
 
IV. Subject  Enrollment  
 
For all aims  of this study , we will publicize  the study  at Fenway  Health  primary  care provider  (PCP) meetings .  
 
Recruitment of Fenway Patients  
Aim 1:  We will advertise the study through monthly research meetings at The Fenway Institute, and we will 
ask Fenway Health primary care physicians and other Fenway Health clinicians to refer patients to us. 
Potential participants will also be screened during clinical appointments at Fenway Health by [CONTACT_464]. New 
patients at Fenway H ealth are given a Notice of Privacy Practices which informs them that their protected 
health information may be utilized for research when the research proposal is IRB -approved and conducted in 
accordance with HIPAA privacy and confidentiality rules. Furth er, under HIPAA, as employees of the covered 
entity (Fenway Health), the study staff may utilize medical records to identify potential participants. Potentially 
eligible patients will be identified using crystal reports. A study staff member will then work  with medical 
assistants and/or providers before approaching patients to assess interest. After entering the room and prior to 
screening, the study staff member will explain the study before asking permission to complete the screening 
questionnaire. Those who appear to be eligible will be invited to participate in the study after their appointment, 
or set up an appointment in the future. We will also post flyers and cards advertising the study at Fenway 
Health and throughout the greater [LOCATION_011] area, as well  as via social media platforms (Grindr, Scruff, Growler, 
and Facebook). Participants who are interested in the study will call the RA and undergo a phone screen to 
ensure they meet enrollment criteria prior to being scheduled for a study visit.  
 
Aim 2/3:  We will utilize chart review, as well as screening during clinical appointments at Fenway Health (as 
described above) to identify HIV negative MSM with a history of substance use disorder who have qualifying 
laboratory evidence and are prescribed PrEP at Fenway Health. We will also identify potential participants 
through posted flyers in the greater [LOCATION_011] area , email blasts from the Fenway Health recruitment team,  and 
social media advertisements. Email blasts from the Fenway Health recruitment team are re ceived by [CONTACT_769413], 
events and research studies. If applicable, we will inform their treating clinicians that their patient might be 
eligible for the  study. The clinician will tell the patient about the study and acquire permission from the patient 
for study staff to speak with them at their next regularly scheduled clinic appointment or provide them with 
contact [CONTACT_19292]. We othe rwise will utilize crystal reports using our HIPAA Waiver to 
 
Version 11.[ADDRESS_1055774] Health about 
their participation. Additionally, we will ask participants in Aim 1 if they would be willing to participate in Aims 
2/3. Participants who are interest ed in the study can respond to posted flyers , recruitment emails,  or social 
media advertisements will call the RA and undergo a phone screen to ensure they meet enrollment criteria 
prior to being scheduled for a study visit.  
 
Passive Recruitment  
We will al so post fl yers and cards advertising the study at Fenway  Health  and throughout the greater [LOCATION_011] 
area, and engage in recruitment via social media platforms (Grindr, Scruff, Growler, and Facebook) in order to 
extend our reach to as many  potentially eligible individuals as possible . Participants who are interested in the 
study will call or email the RA and undergo a  preliminary  phone screen to ensure they meet basic enrollment 
criteria prior to being scheduled for a study visit . 
 
Shared C ross -study Recruitment  
As potential participants are screened for DigiPrEP, they may additionally be eligible for a parallel study that is 
testing the use of the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769379] a smartphone behavioral intervention in MSM 
with mod erate to severe stimulant use disorder (PrEPSteps - IRB 1162312). While screening participants, if 
their schedules do not allow them to participate in DigiPrEP, but they indicate willingness to participate in other 
Fenway Studies, we will discuss the PrEPSt eps study with them as described in our cross study screener. 
Participants who would benefit from learning about their PrEP adherence would likely also benefit from 
interventions that boost adherence as studied in PrEPSteps. We therefore will share screene r data between 
the two studies in the case that participants also qualify for PrEPSteps and would like to participate. Both 
studies are conducted by [CONTACT_524036] [INVESTIGATOR_112902].  
 
V. Study  Procedures  
 
Aim 1:  In this aim, we will conduct  individual  interviews  (see uploaded  document  Aim 1 Interview ) of MSM  with 
self-reported substance  use currently  on or qualifying for PrEP . Study  participants  will sign informed  consent  
prior to the qualitative interview . An audio -recorded  individual  interview  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_769414] . We will explore  the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], acceptance  of the technology , willingness  to use technology  for 
PrEP  adherence  and willingness  to interact  with the technology  to reinforce  adherence  and address  influencers  
of adherence . Interviews  will be audio  recorded , transcribed , and analyzed  by [CONTACT_2362]  (see section  VI), 
after that audio recordings will be destroyed . Participants will also complete a brief self-report questionnaire 
(see uploaded document (DigiPrEP_selfreport_questionnaire ). At the end of the visit, the participant will be 
remunerated  via a $[ADDRESS_1055775] . 
 
Aim 2/3:  In Aims [ADDRESS_1055776]  DigiPrEP  daily. 
Participants will be prescreened via phone to assess initial eligibility for participation; if eligible, they will be 
scheduled for an in -person Screening Visit , where they will sign informed consent and full eligibility will be 
determined via rapid HIV test and review/conduct of necessary blood work . If determined to be eligible at the 
Screening Visit, participants will be scheduled for Study Visit 1; in the interim, a 90-day supply of digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769380].  At Study  Visit 1, participants  will be trained  in the use of the 
digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769381] a self-report questionnaire (same questionnaire  as in Aim 1) . At Study Visit 2, we will 
dispense  an additional [ADDRESS_1055777]  adherence  data from the study  visits  to the 
participant ’s Fenway  Health  PCP, if applicable . At Study Visit 4, the final visit, we will  review adherence data, 
 
Version 11.[ADDRESS_1055778] a 20 -minute semi -structured exit interview to assess participant s’ experience s in the study.  
 
Aim 2 – Prescreening:   Study participants prescreened on the phone  who do not have a PCP at Fenway 
Health  will be asked to bring their most recent copi[INVESTIGATOR_769382]-person  Screening Visit  
(chemistry or creatinine, evidence of hepatitis immunization status (within the past 6 months), sexually 
transmitted  infection screening (STI) and syphilis screening (within the past 3 months)).  If participants do not 
have qualifying laboratory tests , we will notify the participant that we will conduct any needed  laboratory testing 
at the Screening Visit . We will send participants an email with a list of labs they should bring as part of the 
reminder for the Screening Visit.  
 
Aim 2 – Screening Visit:   This is the first study visit. During this visit, the participant  will meet  the RAs and 
study  team . We will explain  the course  of the study , obtain  written  informed consent , and obtain a signed 
medical release  of information form  and completed locator form from participants.  During the informed consent 
process, we will ask if participants want us to relay adherence data from the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769383]; if they opt 
in, we will send monthly adherence information to their PCP. After obtaining consent, we will conduct  a rapid 
HIV test to ensure that participants are HIV negative. We will also review laboratory data  with participants; if 
they did not bring lab results with them (or grant us access to lab results via an online patient portal, following  
signing of  medical release  form), we will call their PCP and confirm  their eligibility for PrEP (see 
DigiPrEP_PCP_communication_script ). If participants are missing any required labs, they will receive those 
tests at this visit . If individuals screen positive for active hepatitis infecti on, or have creatinine clearance 
<60ml/min, they will be ineligible for the study and referred back to their PCP for continued medical care. 
Individuals who test positive for STI s will be referred to their PCP for treatment. If they do not have a PCP, they 
will be referred to HIV care or STI care at Fenway Health or Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Once we have 
reviewed all required laboratory work,  and confirmed HIV status as negative, we will schedule participan ts for 
Study Visit 1. Additionally, following this visit, and prior to Study Visit 1 , we will order  a 90-day supply of  digital 
PrEP for eligible participants (process detailed below following  description of study visit  procedure s). 
 
Aim 2 – Study  Visit 1:  During Study Visit [ADDRESS_1055779]  a short  training  around  operation  of the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_393851]  (i.e., d igital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
Reader device, and mobile app lication ) and instruct  participants  on basic  troubleshooting  of the technology . 
We will also help participants to download the mobile app lication  where their adherence data will be recorded 
and accessible , train them  on how to use the app, and register them on the collaborator interface s (iAssis t and 
Nomi) . Participants will be provided with a 30 -day supply of digital PrEP (Truvada) ; participants  will then ingest  
their first digital  PrEP  dose  during  the visit to demonstrate  their understanding  of how to operate  the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769384] . Participants will receive a brief reference guide 
(see refguide ) with key contact [CONTACT_769415][INVESTIGATOR_393852]. 
Participants  will be scheduled  for Study Visit 2, which will occur a maximum of 30 days  (i.e., 23 -30 days)  after 
Study Visit [ADDRESS_1055780]  study  participants  via text message  on days  1, 2, 5, and 7 to ensure  technology  is functioning . 
Additionally, b eginning one week after Study Visit 1, p articipants will receive brief weekly surveys  through the  
Nomi  interface asking them to self -report substance use and sexual activity  (see DigiPrEP Study 
Messages_Participant Only). At the end of Study Visit 1 , participants will be remunerated  via a $25 check .   
 
Aim 2 – Study  Visit 2:  We will contact  [CONTACT_769416]  23, [ADDRESS_1055781] user responses to 
 
Version 11.1    Page 6 of 13 
 each of these timeline followback events.  We will also dispense  an additional  30-day supply of  digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769385] . We will schedule  participants  for Study V isit 3 prior to discharge , which will occur a maximum of 
30 days (i.e., 23 -30 days) after Study Visit  2. Participants will be reminded that we will pass their adherence 
data along to their PCP; participants will have the option of opting out of this mechanism at each study visit.  At 
the end of Study Visit 2 , the participant will be remunerated  via a $25 check . 
 
Aim 2 – Study  Visit 3:  We will contact  [CONTACT_769416]  53, [ADDRESS_1055782]  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769386] , address  discordant  counts  and review reader activity  with the participants  and address any 
nonadherence events potentially linked to sexual activity or substance use . The p articipant  will receive  a final 
30 day refill of digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769387] a $50 check . 
 
Aims 2/3 – Study  Visit 4:  This is the final study  visit. We will contact  [CONTACT_769416]  83, [ADDRESS_1055783]  a 20-minute  semi -structured  
interview  (see Aim 3 Exit Interview ) to assess  participants’  experience  working  with DigiPrEP  and participating 
in the study . Participants will be encouraged to return to their PCP for continued PrEP prescribing.  If they do 
not have a provider who can continue to prescribe PrEP  following the end of the study , we will refer them to a 
provid er at Fenway Health or the Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_769388].  Participants will be 
remunerated a total of $150 at the end of this visit (i.e., the planned $75, as well as an additional $75 for 
assistance finding and troubleshooting bugs in the mobile app, and for completion of all study procedures ). 
 
Participant contact :  [CONTACT_769417]  (see 
DigiPrEP Study Messages_Participant Only ). Addi tionally, if participants do not respond to text messages 
(e.g., technology check -ins at days 1, 2, 5, 7), or to study appointment reminders, we will contact [CONTACT_84389] , text, and/or email. If we do not detect digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769389] 48 hours (2 doses) or if there are more 
than [ADDRESS_1055784] participants via phone, text, and/or email to understand if the re 
are issues with operating the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769390].  If we are 
unable to reach participants, we will leave phone or text messages, and call participants back the next 
business day . We will also communicate information about the study, including required lab work 
documentation for the Screening Visit, to participants via email.  
 
Drug procurement :  Digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769391] (our collaborating pharmacy). Once 
participants sign informed consent during the Screening Visit, and we have confirmed qualifying  laboratory 
work  and eligibility , we will secure ly email a Drug Order Form to Curant. This order form will  contain the 
following information , as required by [CONTACT_769418] : (1) participant’s  name ; (2) participant’s date of birth ; (3) participant 
study ID number; (4) participant’s anticipated start date; (5) target drug delivery date; and (6) delivery 
information for p harmacist at Fenway Pharmacy. Following receipt of the Drug Order Form, Curant will FedEx 
90 digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] ( three 30 -day supplies ) to the Fenway Pharmacy. Confirmation of shipment receipt will be 
documented in the DigiPrEP Pharmacy SOP binder. At Study Vis its 1, 2, and 3, we will complete a Prescription 
Card that study staff will bring to the Fenway Pharmacy , who will sign out drug to us.  If participants no -show 
during their study visit, we will return and sign back in drug to the Fenway Pharmacy.  In the event that a 
participant drops out of the study and we have remaining drug  assigned to them  in the  Fenway P harmacy, we 
will secure ly emai l a Cancel Order Form to Curant , along with a new D rug Order Form, requesting the required 
number of replacement bottles of drug , and/or new participant labels (as applicable) . Curant will mail new 
participant labels to place on existing bottles of drug, as well as any additional bottles  of drug, as needed . 
 
Study visit scheduling :  We will schedule study visits as close to [ADDRESS_1055785] scheduling conflicts, we will seek to schedule participants fo r study visits 2, 3 and 4 
within 7 days prior to  the 30 -day mark in order to prevent participants from running out of digital  PrEP  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. 
 
 
Version 11.1    Page 7 of 13 
 Participant messaging :  Participants will receive standard SMS text messages , as well as  notifications from the 
mobile application which receives their adherence data from the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Upon enrollment in Nomi and 
iAssist interfaces at Study Visit 1, participants will receive a welcome message , including a contact [CONTACT_769419]. Participants will receive three technology check -in messages during the first week 
using the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (on days 2, 5, and 7) ; these messages will prompt participants to respond with “0” for “I 
need help with something,” or “1” for “Everythin g’s OK!” If participants text back “0,” the study team will contact 
[CONTACT_769420]. Beginning one week after Study Visit 1, participant will also receive an 
anonymous  REDCap link to a brief weekly survey , asking them to self -report substance use and sexual activity 
for the past week. Participants will also receive text messages reminding them of upcoming study visits. 
Depending on messaging settings in the Nomi interface, participants may also receive app n otifications for 
ingestion confirmations, as well as messages related to Reader battery life and confirmations of manually 
recorded ingestions (see DigiPrEP Study Messages_Participant Only  for detailed content and timing of all 
participant messaging ).

 VI. Biostatistical  Analysis  
 
Aim 1: We will conduct  qualitative  analysis  on individual  interviews  in aim 1 to elucidate  themes  of technology  
acceptance , design , and optimal  timing  and delivery  of messaging .  
 
Aim 2: We will calculate  descriptive  statistics  regarding  the degree  of adherence  collected  from the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. 
We will also calculate  the accuracy  of the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769392]. Because  this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof -of-concept  study , we will not be powered  to 
determine  the degree  of adherence  the use of a digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769393] . 
 
VII. Risks  and Discomforts  
 
We anticipate  the major  risks due to DigiPrEP  are the potential  for exposure  to metal  components  in the digital  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], and retention  of the radiofrequency  emitter  portion  of the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Major  psychological  discomforts  could  
occur  during  study  interviews  when  participants  are asked  about  their adherence  patterns . 
Exposure  to Metal  Components  in Digital  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]: The Digital  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_769394] . The radiofrequency  tags contain  minimal  amounts  of silver , 
zinc and magnesium  that are significantly  less than the recommended  daily intake  of these  metals . In order  
to prevent  absorption  of these  metals , the radiofrequency  tag is coated  with an epoxy  and ethyl cellulose  
coating  in a technique  that is used  for other  ingestible  medical  devices .8,9 Extensive  experience  in the use of 
ingestible  small  bowel  endoscopy  cameras  has not reported  adverse  events  related  to the exposure  of 
electronic  components .10,11  
 
Digital  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_769395] : Study  participants  may experience  retention  of the 
radiofrequency  emitting  portion  of the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. A study  assessing  the efficacy  of the capsule  portion  of 
DigiPrEP  among  healthy  volunteers  documented  [ADDRESS_1055787]. Chai  has completed  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_769396]  96 ingestions  with the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769397] .2 Additional  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769398] 100 participants  who ingested  
radiofrequency  tagged  gelatin  capsules  revealed  no reports  of sensor  retention  (Personal  communication  
from Joris  VanDam , [COMPANY_001] ). An additional  investigation  to determine  the safety  of digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769399] .[ADDRESS_1055788] comparison  to the 
digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769400]. Over  a decade  of experience  
of capsule  endoscopy  has revealed  a capsule  retention  rate of less than 2%.10,[ADDRESS_1055789]  the capsule  removed  successfully  underwent  elective  partial  small  bowel  
resection  with pathologic  findings  including  mild bowel  stricture  or intimal  ulceration  from capsule  retention .13 
Complication  rates  among  patients  with Crohn ’s disease , bowel  neoplasm , radiation  enteritis , or stricture  were  
higher .14,[ADDRESS_1055790]. In order  to minimize  the risk of DigiPrEP  capsule  retention , we plan 
to exclude  patients  with underlying  bowel  disease  or surgical  intervention  to the bowel .  
 
Psychological  discomfort  of disclosing  adherence  patterns : Participants  may experience  psychological  
discomfort  in disclosing  and learning  of their adherence  data during  study  visits . As their Fenway  Health  PCP 
may be given  participant ’s adherence  data, participants  may also experience  the psychological  discomfort  
knowing  that their PCP knows  about  their adherence  to PrEP  during  the study  period . 
 
VIII. Potential  Benefits  
 
 
Version 11.1    Page 10 of 13 
 Participants  may indirectly  benefit  from participation  in the study  by [CONTACT_769421] . 
Interacting  and using  DigiPrEP  may confer  some  increased  adherence  among  study  participants .  
 
IX. Data Monitoring  and Quality  Assurance  
 
We will review  and monitor  data from DigiPrEP  for each  study  participant . At each  study  visit, participants  will 
undergo  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769401] , and calculate  the accuracy  of the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769402] . Any discrepancies  between  the digital  pi[INVESTIGATOR_769403] . For each  participant , we will also review  signaling  from the digital  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_769404]  (eTectRx ) to ensure  there  are no errors  in data transmission  
contribution  to missed  adherence  events . If errors  occur  as a result  of data transmission , we will annotate this 
on the ingestion data . 
 
The study  investigators  will conduct QA to review  data after half of the patients  (N=7) of Aim 2/[ADDRESS_1055791]  been  made . 
 
The principal investigator  ([CONTACT_393938])  will be responsible for monitoring advers e events during the study, but 
Drs. Mayer and O’Cleirigh  will assume this re sponsibility in the event that D r. Chai is unavailable.  The role of 
the responsible person is 1) to identify the concern, 2) develop and appropriate response that involves 
consultation whenever possible to alleviate or minimize any adverse event, and 3) to ensure that the adverse 
event is reported in a timely manner to the responsible authority.  
 
Participants will be monitored for occurrenc e of events defined as any undesirable experience or unanticipated 
benefit. Events may occur during recruitment, technology deployment, and qualitative interviewing. For 
example, a participant may become distressed when asked questions about substance abus e and its impact 
on PrEP adherence. Based upon previous research couched in technology among hidden populations, we 
anticipate that these effects will be minimal. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_769405] (adverse ev ent) and will record details of all adverse events (death, life threatening illness, 
new serious or permanent disability) that occur. Should such an event occur, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_769406] [ADDRESS_1055792] after the event if possible.  An estimate of the extent of injury, 
and prevention strategies will be rep orted. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_769407]:  
• Not related:  The event is clearly related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, not with the study 
protocol.  
• Remote : The event was mo st likely related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state, not with the 
study protocol.  
• Possible:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence associated with participating in the study 
and/or is consistent with events related to responding to queries about stress/drug craving but is 
possibly related to factors such as the subject’s clinical state.  
• Probable:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence associated with participating in the study 
and/or is consistent with events related to res ponding to DigiPrEP  or digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769408]’s clinical state.  
The severity of an adverse event in both groups is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree 
or intensity of an adverse event a s determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_48094]:  
• Mild:  No impact (in anyway) on the subjects.  
• Moderate:  Impacts on the subject but is not life -threatening or incapacitating.  
• Severe:  Fatal, life threatening, permanently disabling; severely incapacitat ing; requires/prolongs 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Version 11.[ADDRESS_1055793]; whether the event is re lated to the study’s 
protocols; the steps that have been taken to address the issue; whether the event provides emerging 
knowledge about the risks of the study that should be conveyed to respondents; and whether the consent 
form should be revised.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
[CONTACT_393938], will select three external investigators with expertise in PrEP, substance use disorder, technology 
security and behavioral interventions to participate on a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) for aim 2 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_769409]) of the research plan. The DSMB will convene annually during aim 2 of the 
research plan. Additionally, the DSMB will meet when N=10 study participants are enrolled in aim 2. They will 
review the data, and any potential study related a dverse events prior to approving the continuation of 
recruitment. The responsibilities of the DSMB will include:  
• Reviewing the research protocol, consent form, and plans for DSMB.  
• Evaluating the progress of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269]: recruitmen t, retention, data quality, site 
performance, adverse events.  
• Protection of participant safety  
• Making recommendations to [CONTACT_393938] and the Fenway Institute IRB regarding continuation, termination 
or modification of the study depending on benefits or adverse  events.  
• Ensuring the confidentiality of study data.  
• Reviewing adverse events.  
• Providing annual written reports to [CONTACT_393938], and [COMPANY_009] Sciences (study sponsor) required regarding 
safety concerns, continuation or modification of the research plan.  
 
Data Safety . The protection of data for this study includes the following: 1) Data are collected through a HIPAA 
compliant web server hosted by [CONTACT_769422], then securely relayed to a cloud -based program  (NOMI)  that drives 
smart interventions in DigiPrEP. The cloud -based database is hosted behind the secure firewall through 
eTectRx, and accessed through Fenway Health computers. 2) Study participants are identified by a unique 
numeric identification; their protected health information (PHI) is never linked to in gestion data captured by 
[CONTACT_769422], or the cloud -based program. 3) Study participant PHI is collected and stored on a secure Microsoft 
Excel worksheet which will be created on a secure, password protected desktop computer located at TFI where 
only [CONTACT_393938], his study mentors and a trained research assistant (RA) will have access. 4) All data (ingestion 
data on the cloud -based database and PHI) is stripped of all identifying information by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Chai prior to 
transmission to collaborators at BWH, MGH, BIDMC and Children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  We will also share deidentified 
data with our sponsor, [COMPANY_009] Sciences . 5) Deidentified ingestion data as well as demographic data will be 
securely stored on the TFI server; we will access this data for later investigations under a sep arate IRB protocol. 
6) At study completion, the link between the identifying information and their data is destroyed, as is contact 
[CONTACT_3031]. Two sets of the cleaned data set will be maintained —one working copy at Brigham and Women’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and one a t the Fenway Institute. This approach ensures that the data survives a failure of one storage 
location. 6) Finally, all study staff have completed the CITI Course in the Protection of Human Subjects online 
training in research ethics and good clinical prac tice to ensure that all staff are compliant with confidentiality 
training.  
Data Tracking : Data will be automatically logged into the web interface hosted by [CONTACT_769423] a date/time 
stamp to ensure accurate record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_393897]. All data will be securely accessed 
at Fenway Health.  
Data Entry Process : Protected health information, including study participant demographics, substance use 
disorder  history, and HIV risk factors will be collected by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Chai and the research assistant and entered into 
REDCap, a secure web application being used for data storage and management.  A separate spreadsheet of 
 
Version 11.[ADDRESS_1055794] information and a technology log including participant mobile phone number, 
electronic mail (email) address, identifiers of the Receiver , study smartphone and a log of dispensed digital 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_393898]. Chai and the RA. All logs will be stored behi nd TFI firewall and password 
protected. [CONTACT_393938] will also maintain a second copy of the logs as a backup in his secure office behind the 
BWH firewall Data loaded onto the interface cannot be edited. Each variable with missing data (such as an 
interruption  between smartphone and sensor) will be identified and a placeholder (“<< -99>>”) is entered to 
connote a missing value.  Data from the digital pi[INVESTIGATOR_769410] a HIPAA -compliant secure link to the a dherence interface (NOMI). Ingestion data may 
potentially require editing if there are transmission failures, errors from the reader device , or manually recorded 
data from study participants. All of these potential edits will be identified by [CONTACT_769424]. Edits to data will be agreed upon by [CONTACT_393934]. An audit trail of all 
potential edits will be maintained, one copy at eTectRx and one copy at TFI. We will additionally comply with 
Fenw ay regulations regarding reporting of adverse events and ensuring data quality.  Landmark Associates Inc, 
an external company,  will be contracted  to transcribed audio -taped interviews.  
 
Data storage:  Raw ingestion data, transcripts from this study and self-report questionnaires will not be made 
publicly available. Deidentified data may be shared with [COMPANY_009] Sciences who is funding the study, as well as 
industry collaborators eTectRx and NOMI. For future investigations that use deidentified  participant data, we 
will submit IRB protocols detailing the use of this data.  Partners Health  Dropbox is being used for file storage in 
the study .

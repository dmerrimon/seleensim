2.) Description of Study  
 
A.  Specific Aims    
 
1) Phase 3 : We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (n=40) of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643] (including people enrolled in a partial 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274567]) with a recent suicide attempt/plan who will receive treatment as usual (TAU) plus 
LifePlans  vs TAU only. We will examine LifePlans  feasi bility and acceptability (video viewing, engagement, 
satisfaction, recruitment/retention), treatment differences (within relevant confidence intervals) on outcomes (e.g., suicide behaviors), and change on potential mechanisms.  
 
B.  Background   
 
Suicide and attempted suicide are major public health issues in the U.S., accounting for almost 45,[ADDRESS_1285333] in need. Some treatments (e.g., cognitive behavior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) have been found to reduce rates of suicide attempts, but these interventions require substantial training and are lengthy and costly to administer. On the other hand, minimally intensive interventions (e.g., follow -up letters, postcards) have shown mixed 
results. More efficient and effective “middle ground” interventions developed to prevent suicidal behavior are clearly needed. We urgently need interventions based on evidence -based principles that decrease suicidal 
behavior and are feasible to deliver to large numbers of patients at times when their risk for suicide is high.  
Narrative communication is an alternative strategy for disseminating beha vior change principles that has 
shown efficacy for improving health behaviors. Our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_914636]. Narrative methods refer to people with lived experience talking about both their struggles and successful w ays of copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Narrative strategies are consistent with social learning theory: people learn by 
[CONTACT_277234]. An advantage of narrative communication that it is often viewed as more engaging by [CONTACT_1962] (than didactic communication) and , with the help of video, is easier to disseminate than 
traditional interventions delivered by [CONTACT_15098]. Narrative communication interventions can be designed to promote key principles from evidence -based psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
In this treatment development p roject, we propose to develop and test a narrative -based video intervention 
for people with suicidal behavior or plan ( with or without intent ) being discharged from psychiatric 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The period immediately following discharge, and the entire yea r after discharge, is a time of 
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285334] recently revised 3/22/2022 
Protocol Version 2.5  Page 2 of 14 substantially increased risk for suicidal behavior. In response to the need for treatment over this transition, we 
previously developed a psychosocial intervention, Copi[INVESTIGATOR_174153] (CLASP), in 
which clinicians deliver up to [ADDRESS_1285335] -discharge. CLASP targets risk factors associated with suicidal 
behavior (copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], socia l support, adherence, hopelessness) in order to reduce subsequent risk. Initial 
research on CLASP is promising, with a 40% reduction in suicide attempts compared to controls over [ADDRESS_1285336] of 5, 30 -min epi[INVESTIGATOR_277180]’ experiences consistent with the CLASP model. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_277181]: 1) developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
personalized “Life Plan” to stay safe and restrict means, 2) clarifying valued life domains and related goals to improve hopefulness, 3) using informal problem solving to cope better with illness, 4) improving communication with family/friends to increase social support, and 5) adhering to primary treatments including pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy to promote illness management. To aid in video content development 
and planning, we will also conduct qualitative interviews of clinical stakeholders regarding their perspectives on the video series . 
 
C.  Experimental Method  
 
C1.  Brief Description of Subjects  
 
  Phase 3: Participants currently psychiatrically hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277185] a partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277186] (with or without intent) or attempt ( n=40) will be randomized to receive TAU vs TAU + LifePlans 
starting during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277184].  
 
C2.  Study Design 
 
Screening Process and Recruitment  (phases 2 and 3) 
 
Our team has developed effective procedures for recruiting from the inpatient milieu  (during Phases 2 and 
3) as well as the partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277204] (only during Phase 3) . We will obtain a Protected Health Information (PHI) 
waiver for review preparatory to research. Then, we will screen electronic medical records at Butler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277225]. Patients meeting inclusion criteria that can be  assessed via chart review 
(i.e., criteria 1, 3, 5), and after obtaining attending physicians’ permission, will be approached by [CONTACT_3647]. Patients will be approached in-person on the units or if they are attending a partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277206], they will be contact[CONTACT_277240]. Staff will provide a description of the study and invite patients to participate in additional screening to determine study eligibility. Those consenting and meeting all inclusion  criteria will be invited to participate in the study.   
 
Research Assessments (phases 2 and 3)  
 
Assessments will be conducted: 1) to assess feasibility and acceptability, uptake, transportation, and 
understanding of key messages; 2) to assess inclusion criteria; or 3) to pi[INVESTIGATOR_914637]-scale RCT. See the table below for the purpose of each instrument and the 
assessment schedule. A trained research assistant will conduct all assessments.  After the baseline assessment, 
we will conduct assessments at 1- and [ADDRESS_1285337] -video 
surveys in order to assess completion and acceptability ratings.

IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285339] recently revised 3/22/2022 
Protocol Version 2.5  Page 3 of 14 feedback about interventions and research procedures, including whether there was any contamination 
between arms, with participants in LifePlans sharing videos or video content with participants in the t reatment 
as usual arm .  
We will ask participants to complete additional assessments reflecting the content of LifePlans. Participants 
will complete video completion surveys  of the time that they spend watching the video and the particular 
sections watched.  If they did not watch the videos, participants will answer questions on  any barriers that 
prevented them from watching. To assess transportation/engagement, we use a modified version of the Transportation Scale  
9 (11 items) we previously developed that is appropriate for watching a video.  Sample items 
include: “The [video about XX] affected me emotionally” or “I found my mind wandering while [watching the video about XX.]” Items are rated from 1 “not at all” to 7 “very much.” The total scale score is calculated by [CONTACT_914644] . In addition, participants will complete a Video Acceptability Scale, which is 
adapted from a 7 -item Likert -scale measure (1=not at all and 7=very much) designed for technology -assisted 
interventions by [CONTACT_277242].10 that assesses how participants feel about their experience: overall liking, 
interesting, ease of use, understandable, respectful, or annoying. To assess message understanding, we will use 
a Message Scale, which consists of questions designed to: 1) enhance the impact of the intervention; and 2) 
provide data to us about their reactions to the video. The questionnaire includes these questions: 1) What did 
you like about this video? What did you not like about this video?; 2) What was the main message that you got from watching this video?; 3) Does this video have any relevance to your life? What relevance does it have to your life?; and 4) What might you do differently as a result of watchi ng this video? We will use qualitative data 
analysis techniques to analyze participants’ responses.

Suicidal Behaviors. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) [ADDRESS_1285340] of: a) review of 
written materials, b) didactic instruction; c) practice interviews with review and feedback from senior staff; and 
4) continued practice, training and feedback until high agreement with established consensus ratings are met 
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285341] recently revised 3/22/2022 
Protocol Version 2.5  Page 4 of 14 (e.g. 3 consecutive C -SSRS ratings are within 2 points of our consensus ratings). We will assess interviewers’ 
reliability in an ongoing manner. Following initial training, interviewers and senior staff meet on a monthly basis  
to review tapes, address questions/issues, and monitor interrater reliability.  
 To ensure that we capture as much suicide-related data as possible, we will utilize procedures that have 
been developed for current ongoing large-scale suicide prevention clinical trials led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Miller (RO1 
MH101129) and [CONTACT_94791] (U01 MH106660). We obtain releases of information from patients at study start to conduct chart reviews throughout the study covering the two major healthcare systems in RI (CNE and Lifespan) and their corresponding EDs and inpatient units.  We also collect treatment utilization data via self -
report (THI) during follow -up assessments, and, at that point, we can ask participants for releases of information 
to request discharge summaries from additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277212]. Consistent with previous studies, we scrutinize all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277213]: evidence of self -injury, mental health concerns, ingestion/overdose, and traumatic injury. Staff then read the discharge 
summary to determine if there is any evidence of current or recent intentional self -harm ideation or behavior, 
including whether any injury is sustained. Staff also use carefully developed definitions of suicide ideation and 
suicide attempt (from C -SSRS criteria) to determine whether there is evidence of either event in the medical 
record.  
If the patient dies, staff record the death and whether there was any evidence of intentional self -injury 
leading to the death. As we have done in previous studies, if we are unable to locate a participant at follow-up, 
we will state or national death registries to ascertain whether he/ she died, and if so, cause of death. Thus, suicide outcomes will be determined using all data collected during the study from all possible sources, including follow-up assessments (C- SSRS), b) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_174175], c) and community clinician reports. Data from all 
sources will be reviewed by [CONTACT_277243].  Note that  we will obtain releases of 
information from patients at study start to conduct chart reviews throughout the study covering the two major healthcare systems in RI (CNE and Lifespan) and their corresponding EDs and inpatient units. Disagreements 
between raters will be reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_6283]. Gaudiano (MPI) and Arias (Co-I). All reports will be classified using C -SSRS criteria. In a larger -scale clinical trial, our primary outcome will be a composite: a) suicide 
attempts or b) suicides.  
Other Symptoms.  We will use the following self -report scales: the Modified Scale for Suicide Ideation 
(MSSI)13 which provid es a score indicating overall severity of suicide ideation; and the PROMIS -29, which 
assesses pain intensity on seven health domains (physical function, fatigue, pain interference, depressive 
symptoms, anxiety, ability to participate in social roles and activities, and sleep disturbance ). We will also have  
participants in both study conditions  complete the PROMIS Depression Short Form each week of the 
intervention to assess depressive symptoms. In addition, we also will assess the change in distress and 
perceived helpfulness during each week of the intervention for those assigned to LifePlans:  1) how distressed 
participants felt while watching the videos (5 point scale from “ more distressed” to “less distressed” ), 2) how 
distressed they felt after watching the videos (5 point scale from “more distressed” to “less distressed” ), and 3) 
how helpful they felt the videos were (5 point scale from “ very unhelpful ” to “very helpful ”). In order to 
ascertain inclusion criteria, we will use chart review and the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire31  to screen out 
people at baseline.  Finally, we will use the self-blame subscale on the Personal Suicide Stigma Questionnaire 
(PSSQ) which is a  self-report measure that has been found to be reliable and valid for assessing stigma in 
persons who have suicidal behaviors.  
Potential Mediators. Potential mechanisms will be assessed using the following self -report scales: the 
Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support   (MSPSS)21, which is a reliable and valid measure of 3 aspects 
of social support  (family, f riends, and significant o ther) ; the Brief Cope22, which assesses strategies used for 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_277214] ; and the Valuing  Questionnaire (VQ) which is a reliable and valid 
measure that assesses the extent to which a person lives by [CONTACT_277244]. 
Potential Moderators . We have identified several potential moderators of CLASP effects in our previous 
research that we believe may also be relevant to the proposed project, which we will consider testing in future, 
larger-scale studies. The manuscript describing these results is currently in preparation. The following factors 
were found to moderate the effects of CLASP in the previous ED -SAFE study (U01 MH088278) and are also 
potentially relevant to LifePlans:  marital status (CLASP more effective for those not married) and number of previous psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (CLASP more effective for those with more hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). We will also consider whether recent suicide attempt status and lifetime suicide attempt status moderates outcome.  
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285342] recently revised 3/22/[ADDRESS_1285343] ad apted a brief, structured Treatment History Interview (THI)[ADDRESS_1285344] information about other depression treatments such as inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] p sychotherapy, 
including any care that happens outside of the CNE system. We will combine this with information from the 
outpatient chart review (i.e., from the Providence Center) and inpatient chart review (from Butler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to gain a full pi[INVESTIGATOR_914638].  
Clinical stakeholder interviews. Basic demographic information will be collected from all participants using 
a short self -report measure. These data will include age, gender, ethno -racial background, education level, 
duration of employment in current position, and duration of employment in the field. Participants will complete a 30-minute  individual interview by [CONTACT_242466] . Prior to the interview, we will send 
participants a brief description of the video series  and sample content. This interview will be scheduled at the 
participant's convenience and will be audio  or video recorded. Stakeholder interview agendas will assess : : a) 
barriers to patients' medication/appointment adherence, b) how the field can use a video intervention to support aftercare, c) challenges patients face upon return to the community post -discharge, d) challenges faced 
by [CONTACT_15098]/organizations treating individuals with suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors. Questions will be 
delivered in an open- ended format to allow participants to share their opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153].  
 
Retention and Adherence  
 We will use several strategies to increase retention for assessments. Res earch staff will remind participants 
about appointments, maintain a list of locator contacts for each participant, reach out to contacts as needed, schedule assessments regardless of intervention participation, and have flexibility in when assessments are scheduled. Finally, we will provide transportation if needed for appointment s.  
 
Phase 3: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_277215] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (n=40), with participants randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU + 
LifePlans. We will enroll hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] a suicide plan/attempt prior to admission in the past month  
(see full inclusion criteria below) . Methods will be similar to those described in the open trial (see previous 
section for Phase 2), with only the differences noted below. We will continue to focus on acceptability and feasibility, including an evaluation of the proposed research design.   
Phase 3: Control condition description and rationale  
 The control condition will be TAU, which, as noted above, will include Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277216], followed by [CONTACT_277245] a CNE outpatient site. In choosing TAU as a control condition, we considered the nature of the LifePlans intervention. LifePlans is designed to be adjunctive to TAU and in fact to encourage adherence to outpatient treatment plans developed in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. We did not choose a more robust control condition because LifePlans is designed to be a lower -intensity intervention (thus 
increasing its potential reach) and not to replace existing treatments (but, in fact, to enhance them).  
 
Phase 3: Randomization  
 
Participants will be randomized using a 1:1 ratio to either TAU or TAU + LifePlans. Randomization will be 
stratified by: a) gender (male/ female/ non-binary) and b) suicide attempt vs. plan prior to admission. Treatment arm assignments will be blocked in blocks of 4 or 6 participants (randomly ordered). A staff member with no other study responsibilities will set up randomization tables in REDCap, and other research staff will not have access to the tables. Participants will be randomized following the baseline assessment using the randomize feature in REDCap. This ensures allocation concealment.  
 
C3.  Specific Procedures or Treatments  
 
See C2. Study Design.  
 
C4.  Data Analysis   
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285345] recently revised 3/22/[ADDRESS_1285346], we will examine acceptability and satisfaction  outcomes for LifePlans and for the overall 
study. When the outcome is no t met, the research team will investigate and discuss the issue, and depending 
on the perceived reasons for the discrepancy, may modify relevant research procedures to address the issue. For example, if uptake is low, we will try to modify instructions to participants in order to increase uptake.  
  
 
D.  Material Inducements  
 
Phase 3:  Similar to Phase 2, for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (n = 40),  we will pay participants for assessment interviews: $20 for 
baseline, and $40 for Month 1 and 6 assessments (up to $100). We will also pay participants $5 for each weekly survey 
they complete (up to $20 total). Therefore, they  may receive up to $[ADDRESS_1285347] undergone mandatory online education in human research participants’ protection.  
PIs and research assistants will have training in Good Clinical Practice via an online program.  All study staff will 
undergo specific training relevant to their study roles and responsibilities. Training will be documented via collection of training certificates.  
 
3)  Human Subjects  
 
A.  Subject Population   
 
  Phase 3: Participants  (n=40)  will be randomized to receive TAU vs TAU + LifePlans starting during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] a nd continuing after discharge.   
 Participants  must meet the following criteria  (same as Phase 2) :  
1. Current psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277222] (past month)  suicide plan (with or without  intent ), or a 
suicide attempt within 48 hours prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as indicated on the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914639] C -SSRS 
11. Specifically, on the C -SSRS, this is operationalized to a “yes” on item 3, 
4, OR 5, AND/OR a “yes” to suicide attempt/ interrupted attempt/ or aborted attempt.  
2. Ability to speak, read, and understand English well enough to complete the procedures of the study.  
3. Aged 18 or older.  
4. Regular access to a means of watching videos ( i.e., a smartphone, tablet, computer, or DVD player ) in 
the place they expect to live after discharge . 
5. No current psychotic symptoms (based on chart review and the Psychosis Screening Questionnaire)  
6. Plan to continue outpatient treatment.   
 No minors, prisoners, fetuses/neonates, or decisionally/ cognitively impaired individuals will be recruited.  
 
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285348] recently revised 3/22/2022 
Protocol Version 2.5  Page 7 of 14 B.  Recruitment and Consent Procedures  
 
Phase  3: With a HIPAA waiver (see below) we will screen medical records at Butler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914640]. Patients meeting inclusion criteria that can be assessed via chart review (i.e., 
criteria 1, 3, 5), and whose attending physici an does not mark as ineligible for research, will be approached by 
[CONTACT_3647]. Patients will be approached in- person on the units or if they are attending a partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914641], they will be contact[CONTACT_277240]. Staff will provide 
a description of the study and invite patients to participate in screening to determine study eligibility. Those 
consenting and meeting all inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.  
 
For the clinical stakeholder interview during Phase 2, we will consult with our investigator team to identify 
appropriate clinical stakeholders to approach about study participation. Once identified, Drs. Gaudiano or 
Uebelacker or another member of the research team will c ontact the stakeholder directly to introduce the 
study. If interested, the participant will be mailed or emailed (via REDCap link) a copy of the Stakeholders 
Informed Consent form  in addition to a brief description of the video series. The participant will  then  be 
consented over the phone or via videoconferencing . The consent process will be documented either through  
audio  or video  record ing or via electronic REDCap signature.  
 
 For Phase 3 , some patients attend the partial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277226]. With  the participant’s verbal permission (see attached “Verbal Consent (by [CONTACT_7626]) for Use of Email 
and Videoconferencing” ; answers to questions in script will be recorded in REDCap), we will send them a link 
for videoconferencing (i.e., video meeting on the HIPAA compliant online platform). In addition we will send a 
REDCap link that will bring them to a copy of the Phase [ADDRESS_1285349] monetary levels as used in similar studies. In Phases 2 and 3, we will obtain permission form the patient’s treating physician to ensure that approaching the patient for research participation is clinically appropriate.  
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285350] recently revised 3/22/2022 
Protocol Version 2.5  Page 8 of 14 Discomfort or increased distress due to study participation  
Description.   Some participants may find that they feel discomfort or distress in response to completing 
study assessments or interviews, or when watching LifePlans videos .  
Risk Level and Likelihood. Thi s may occur for some participants. Based on our previous experience with this 
population, we believe that any distress that occurs is likely to be minor and transient.  
Minimization. Du ring assessments, research staff will remind participants that they may refuse to answer 
any question or take a break at any time.  Participants will also be reminded that they can choose not to 
watch a vide o if they find it too distressing. We will encourage participants to inform research staff if a 
study procedure is distressing. Finally, we will also encourage participants to talk with their outpatient mental health providers if they find that they are ex periencing increased distress for any reason. We will 
provide referrals to outpatient providers if any participants would like them.  
Suicide ideation or behavior or psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_277227].   Participants may reveal active suicide ideation/ plan/ intent/ or behavior during the course of 
a research interview.  
Risk Level and Likelihood. Thes e events may occur in a portion of enrolled participants, particularly in 
Phases 2 and 3. However, it is ve ry unlikely that these events will be related to study participation.  
Minimization . S uicide ideation and behavior, and psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], will be monitored via 
assessment interviews and chart reviews. In assessments, study staff will inquire abo ut suicidal ideation 
and behavior using the C -SSRS.  If any patient reports suicidal ideation, plans, or behavior during the study 
assessments or other study contacts, the action we will take is dependent on whether the participant is 
inpatient  or he/ she is being treated as an outpatient. If the patient is inpatient, research staff will notify 
the treating clinician on the inpatient unit, so he/she is aware of the risk reported by [CONTACT_102]. If the patient is outpatient, at the time that suicidality and /or clinical deterioration is identified, a study clinician 
will immediately evaluate the participant. In such cases, research staff will immediately contact [CONTACT_522657], Drs. Uebelacker or Gaudiano, or one of the Co -Is, Drs. Miller or Weinstock.  All are 
licensed clinical psychologists; one of the MPIs or Co -Is will be on call at all times. The clinician will conduct 
a suicide risk assessment. Depending upon the specific situation, steps taken to ensure a participant’s safety may involve: (1) escorting the patient to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s ER for evaluation by [CONTACT_277251][INVESTIGATOR_059], (2) alerting inpatient staff to the patient’s level of risk, (3) notifying the 
patient’s outpatient clinician(s) at CNE for whom w e have releases of information, or (4) calling the 
appropriate police departments. We will follow the protocol outlined in the DSMP for reporting SAEs to the IRB and other monitoring entities.

2. Measures to Ensure Confidentiality  
 
 Throughout this protocol, we use the term “secure, CNE -compliant location” for storage of electronic files. 
This refers to the following options:   
• CNE research server  
• CNE instance of REDCap  
• CNE instance of HIPAA -compliant Box  
• CNE computer (i.e, password -protected)  
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285351] recently revised 3/22/2022 
Protocol Version 2.5  Page 9 of 14 • Password -protected, encrypted (128 AES bit or higher) storage device (e.g., audiorecorder , hard 
drive)  
 
Potential risks due to loss of confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_914645]. All information will be treated as confidential material and will be available only to research and clinical staff. All data collected will be kept in a CNE -compliant location. Patient identifying information will be stored in a separate database 
and will be password protected. Any paper files  with any identifying information  will be kept in a locked filing 
cabinet. No subject will be identified in any report of the project.  
 
In Ph ase 1b, which includes work with professional videographers, at the earliest possible time after capturing 
video and/or audio content concerning a research subject or subjects, we will move the content from the 
camera's memory, storage, SD Cards, etc. to a secure, CNE -compliant location .  Once moved, the content will 
be immediately deleted from the camera's memory, storage etc. This should usually occur within 48 hours of 
obtaining the content. Audiorecorders and videocameras will be kept in a locked location (e.g., drawer, filing cabine t) except when being used or transported.   
 
Audio/video recordings will be stored on a secure, CNE -compliant location as defined above. Video recordings  
collected by [CONTACT_277253] (consultants) in Phase [ADDRESS_1285352] protected  per CNE standards (128 bit AES encryption or higher) . Once the 
videographers  have completed their work, this storage device will be given to the study investigators. External 
consultants (videographers) will receive education in Human Subjects (e.g., CITI training) and will also sign a 
Business Associates Agreement . At the conclusion of the project, any video footage not used in the final 
product will be destroyed.  
 
Participants in Phase [ADDRESS_1285353] recently revised 3/22/[ADDRESS_1285354]. Arias will be responsible for monitoring and reporting adverse events. They 
will meet with staff weekly to review any adverse events.  
 
Definitions  
Serious Adverse Events. An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during participation in the clinical study or with use of the experimental agent being studied. A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening (places the subje ct at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; includes 
a suicide attempt or drug overdose)  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Resul ts in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80895], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
In this study, we will monitor and report on the following SAEs:  
• Suicide behavior  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648433]:  
o Suicide-related or  
o Psychiatric in nature or  
o Due to substance use or overdose 
• Death for any cause  
Unanticipated Problems (UPs).  The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285355] recently revised 3/22/[ADDRESS_1285356] serious adverse events to occur, including suicide attempts , non -suicidal drug overdoses, and 
psychiatric rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], . However, given the nature of the study, it is unlikely that SAEs will be related to 
the study procedures. If any of these adverse events occur, or any other unant icipated problems are identified, 
the following procedure will be activated: the research staff member who observes or is notified of an adverse 
event (e.g., suicide attempt) will notify the MPIs or their designee immediately. All study staff will be educa ted 
on the definition of SAEs and UPs so that they may report them to the MPIs as soon as possible after becoming 
aware of the occurrence of an SAE or UP. We will systematically assess for adverse events throughout the 
course of the trial (for Phase 2 and 3) via patient interview (C -SSRS, THI) and chart review at Baseline, Month 1, 
and Month 6. In addition, if a patient reports one of the above SAEs at any time, we will record and review it. 
The MPIs or their designee will complete an Adverse Event Form for  each event that will include a level of 
severity and determine attribution (intervention-related or not).  Reporting timeframes will vary by [CONTACT_254620].

Interim Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_914642].  
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the intervention; (2) difficulty in study recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to  evaluate the study endpoints; (3) any new information becomes available during the trial 
that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; or (4) other situations occur that might warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  
 
Safety Monitoring Committee  
IRB v. 2020.09.[ADDRESS_1285357] recently revised 3/22/2022 
Protocol Version 2.5  Page 12 of 14 We will appoint a Safety Moni toring Committee (SMC) for trial monitoring. This will be composed of three 
independent experts with relevant experience. They will receive reports and convene meetings for this study 
on a twice -yearly  basis. They will also receive reports per occurrence o f SAEs as described in the table above.  
E.  Potential Benefits  
 Phase  3:  For all participants in Phases [ADDRESS_1285358] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. If we identify risk for suicide at those assessments, we will work with participants to 
ensure that they receive appropriate treatment. Benefits to the participants receiving the LifePlans 
intervention may include education about and increased motivation for use of copi[INVESTIGATOR_277232]: identification of life values and implementing values -consistent behavior; problem-solving strategies; 
communication with family, friends, and treatment providers; treatment adherence and engagement; and safety planning and means restriction.   
All phases/ knowledge to be gained: This study will allow us to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087] a video -base d self -help 
intervention for use at the high-risk time period of transition from psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_914643]. We will assess acceptability, feasibility, and safety of this intervention. The proposed project, including the open trial and pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], will prepare us to conduct the next study in this line of research, i.e., a full -scale effectiveness study. Ultimately, we hope this will result in another tool to be used for suicide 
prevention in a high-risk clinical group.  
F.  Risk-Benefit Ratio  
 
Phase  3:  The risks to participants are judged to be acceptable relative to the anticipated benefits. Serious risks 
related to study participation are unlikely to occur. Benefits may include education if receiving the LifePlans interve ntion, and risk assessments and assistance obtaining appropriate treatment if needed at follow -up 
assessments.

 1.0 Background  & Rationale  
 
CRC Screening:   Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second -largest cancer killer in the U.S., and low 
screening rates leads to thousands of preventable deaths.  Each year, over 140,000 people are 
diagnosed with CRC and more than 50,000 die.1  Under 65% of eligible adults are  current with 
screening, a rate that pales in comparison to breast and cervical cancer screening .1-3 Raising the 
CRC screening rate to 80% by 2018, which was the Colorectal Cancer Roundtable’s goal, would 
have prevented over 20,000 deaths from CRC per year  and 203,000 deaths by 2030.4 
 
“Precision prevention” in this area is a promising way to motivate screening and help patients 
choose the best test for them.  Leading guidelines approve multiple testing strategies, including 
colonoscopy every 10 years, flex ible sigmoidoscopy every five years, annual stool testing with 
high -sensitivity fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), or stool 
testing for high risk DNA .3,5,[ADDRESS_17914] known. But it is an invasive procedure involving a lengthy 
preparation, IV sedation, and the need to take a day off. There are significant risks, including 
hemorrhage and perforation.5  
 
Stool (or fecal) blood testing is the second most commonly utilized approach, and many patients prefer stool testing to colonoscopy when they are informed about both tests.
9-15 We 
concentrate here on FIT since it is widely use d and available nationwide, and is recommended 
by [CONTACT_19046] .3,5,6 Stool blood testing may be done in the privacy of one’s 
home, is low cost, and requires no preparation.  The main limitations are that it must be done 
annually, it re quires the patient to handle stool, and all positive tests require evaluation with 
colonoscopy.  Newer forms of stool testing, such as Cologuard, which combines FIT with testing 
for high risk DNA, are being used relatively rarely, and they can be considere d similarly to FIT 
for this application, except that they may be performed every [ADDRESS_17915] colonoscopy for screening 
resulted in a 38% uptake, while recommending a stool test or offering a choic e between 
colonoscopy and stool test resulted in uptake of 67% and 69%, respectively.16   Multiple 
national organizations recommend that providers describe and explain the alternatives to colonoscopy.  A slogan used by [CONTACT_941] 80 by 2018 initiative declares that “The best CRC screening test is the one that gets done .”
17,18 
 
Precision prevention:   Guidelines recommend only colonoscopy for patients with particularly 
high risk for CRC, such as those with a significant family history, a genetic condition such as 
Lynch syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease.3,19  Approximately 90% of patients lack th ese 
risk factors and are considered “average risk,” so can choose any CRC screening test, according 
to guidelines. But even within this average risk group, people have varying chances of having an 
“advanced colorectal neoplasm” (ACN), i.e. a colorectal can cer or precancerous polyp.20,21   A 
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)   Page 5 of 19 
 polyp counts as “advanced” if it is greater than 1 cm or has high- risk pathology (villous histology 
or high -grade dysplasia) . 
 
An individual’s chance of currently having an ACN affects the comparative effectiveness of CR C 
screening tests, and, thus, is relevant information for making a screening test decision. Colonoscopy has higher effectiveness in patients who have a high probability of having a 
current ACN because of the larger chance that colonoscopy will identify a dangerous that 
should be removed.
20,22  Nearly all ACN are polyps rather than cancers (15:1 ratio in a recent 
study) ,[ADDRESS_17916] are approved 
for all average risk patients because they provide long -term risk reduction in colorectal cancer 
that rivals colonoscopy.24,25  Still, failing to identify a polyp or cancer in the colon is a negative 
outcome of screening (a “false negative”),[ADDRESS_17917]. Tom Imperiale, a member of the 
study team uses five variables (gender, age, CRC family history, waist circumference, and smoking history) and identifies a wide range of risk for current ACN among average risk patients. For patients with “high- average” risk (22%), personalized messages in our decision aid 
and provider notification highlight the advantage of colonoscopy because of the likelihood of finding and removing an ACN.  For patients at low risk for ACN (2% or 4%), personalized messages highlight the advantage of stool testing, due to the relatively low chance of failing to 
detect ACN.  
 Disclosin g information about a patient’s risk of having a current ACN has potential to increase 
uptake of screening.  Letting patients know that their chance of having an ACN is low can 
support decisions to choose and complete the FIT test.  Knowing that a patient who prefers FIT 
has low ACN risk may help providers overcome their hesitancy to order this test, by [CONTACT_19047]’s missing a cancer or dangerous polyp for this patient is low.  
Informing patients and providers that the patient has  a high -average risk for an ACN can 
motivate discussion of screening colonoscopy and completion of that test.   
 
At a system level, g uiding patients at high- average risk toward colonoscopy and those with low -
average risk to FIT could improve the efficiency  of screening .
20,26,27,[ADDRESS_17918] -
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)   Page 6 of 19 
 effective for those with higher chance of ACN.  If all eligible patients chose colonoscopy, 
endoscopy cent ers would be overwhelmed.29-31  Given that the recently validated rule found 
that over 50% of the population had low - or very -low risk of having an ACN, the impact on 
reducing over -use of colonoscopy and the cost of CRC screening could be substantial. (RQ -
3)(RQ- 4) 
 
Current clinical practice involves calculating patient risk in other areas.  More complicated 
calculators, such as the Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease risk estimator used to determine 
need for statins, are already in common use.  Calculating risk is  relatively easy using the short 
version of the Imperiale rule, since it relies on just five variables that are either recorded in the 
medical record (age, gender) or are easy to collect from patients and could be placed in the 
medical record (smoking hist ory, waist circumference, family history).   
 Decision Aids:  Informing patients about their options for CRC screening could produce higher 
quality decisions, improve the match between patient preferences and tests performed, and 
increase uptake of CRC scr eening.  Decision aids (DAs) are a promising tool for accomplishing 
this goal.  While DAs are not widely used in clinical medicine, a [ADDRESS_17919] tested a total of 7 
different DAs designed for CRC screening .33-39   
 A big challenge has been getting decision aids to patients; despi[INVESTIGATOR_19032], relatively few patients receive these aids.  Promising recent developments include incentivizing healthcare systems to provide decision aids, including  
reimbursement for patient use of approved decision aids.
40  Encouraging providers to 
“prescribe” decision aids to their patients also has promising results.41   
 COVID -19 Pandemic:  Since the COVID pandemic began in the [LOCATION_002] in March 2020, 
cancer screenings and other preventive services, such as Hgba1c and BP checks, have 
plummeted, and rates have remained depressed even with re -opening of clinical services.  
These challenges for s creening and prevention may continue for many reasons, including 
increased telemedicine, decreased patient willingness to come to health centers, severe work 
and living stress for patients, and changes in patient perceptions of health risks and prevention.    
 
Clinics are already trying to adapt, for instance by [CONTACT_19048], such as home stool testing for CRC screening and telephone outreach to provide 
social services, health reminders, and reassurance that infect ion risk at clinic is low.  These 
efforts have only begun and are poorly understood. Moreover, patient perceptions of disease 
risk and risk from COVID19 are unknown. If we fail to identify ways to effectively deliver 
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)   Page 7 of 19 
 screening and prevention during the COV ID19 pandemic, many patients will die unnecessarily 
from non -COVID19 conditions.  
 
Randomized Clinical Trial Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_19033]  (Indiana University IRB# [PHONE_309]) The study team is currently  
conducting a randomized clinical trial testing whether providing patients and their healthcare 
providers with personalized messages about ACN risk results in higher screening uptake and higher decision quality (i.e, informed cho ice and receipt of the preferred screening test), 
compared to an approach that does not utilize ACN risk.   In this clinical trial, all patient -
participants are view ing a decision aid that provides basic information about CRC screening. For 
half the patients, the decision aid  also include s their chance of currently having an ACN, the 
predicted frequency of ACN (icon chart), and implications for screening test effectiveness and choice. All healthcare provider- participants are being sent a message through thei r respective 
Electronic Health Record (EHR) system notifying them that their patient is due for CRC 
screening. For half the healthcare providers, the message also include s their patient’s chance of 
currently having an ACN and implications for screening tes t effectiveness and choice.  
 Engagement (PC -1), Dissemination, and Implementation:   
The trial also provides an opportunity to conduct observational and qualitative work to study 
the barriers and facilitators to implementing decision aids, provider notifications, and 
personalized risk analysis for colorectal cancer screening.  In addition, we have the opportunity 
to use qualitative and observational methods to assess the impa ct of the COVID pandemic on 
CRC screening and on other recommended, evidence- based screening , and to assess 
perspectives of leadership, providers, staff, and patients.  Finally, we can use similar 
observational and qualitative methods to identify responses  by [CONTACT_19049], and assess their impact and facilitators and barriers to their implementation.  
 We have worked closely with leadership, quality improvement, and information technology teams at both our partner healthcare i nstitutions to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_19034].  We are building on this engagement to identify effective 
methods for providing decision aids and provider messages through an EHR.  Staff and providers involved will pote ntially become champi[INVESTIGATOR_19035] “super users” for future 
implementation of decision aids and provider notifications in their clinics. (PC -4)  These efforts 
will be overseen by [CONTACT_3252] -investigator [CONTACT_19070], who has extensive experience performing 
stakeholder and  key informant formative and summative evaluations to understand the current 
state, existing barriers, and potential facilitators to overcome contextual barriers in 
implementation strategies .

 3.0 Aims  
 Aim 1: Identify facilitators and barriers to implementing decision aids , provider notifications , 
and personal risk calculation using an electronic health record  to promote colorectal cancer 
screening . 
 
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)   Page 9 of 19 
 Aim 2: Identify the challenges and facilitators of effective cancer screening and prevention in 
primary care during the COVID19 pandemic among leadership, providers, and staff at two 
healthcare systems.  
 
Aim 3: Identify patient knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs that influence decisions to engage in cancer screening and prevention at two healthcare organizations during the COVID19 
pandemic, and barriers to uptake . 
 
 4.0 Research Plan  
 
Decision Aid and Provider Notification Implementation (Aim 1 ):  
Leadership, providers, and staff at IU Health and Eskenazi Health have always worked closely 
with our research team on colorectal cancer screening projects due to our shared interest in 
increasing CRC screening up take  rate.  More recently, we have developed the proposal and 
currently conducting the randomized trial to provide decision aids through the patient portal of the EHR systems (Epic at Eskenazi, Cerner at IU Health).  Both institutions wish to use these portals more frequently in patient care. (PC -1)   
 
We will study the facilitators and barriers of delivering decision aids to patients, systems for carrying out 
risk assessment s and notifying providers, also through the EHR, by [CONTACT_19050], 
providers, and staff through interviews and surveys .  
 
Interviews  
We plan to meet with providers, staff, and leadership at our partner healthcare systems every 
3-[ADDRESS_17922] these interviews or meetings by [CONTACT_648], videoconferencing platform, or in -
person according to the participants’ preference and COVID -[ADDRESS_17923] the interviews to vary in length especially if they are conducted individually or in a 
group; however, we estimate the meetings will ta ke no longer than an hour.  
 
Participants will be given a $[ADDRESS_17924] after each interview or meeting.  
 
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)  Page 10 of 19 
  
Enrollment:  Our IU Health and Eskenazi Health provider, staff, and leadership stakeholders are 
scheduling times for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I’s to attend quality improvement  and population health 
meetings.  These meetings focus on identifying improvement goals for their practice, including 
increasing colorectal cancer screening rates. During the se meetings, we will briefly describe our 
study and ask if anyone is interested in learning more. Those individuals who express interest 
will be contact[CONTACT_426] a study team member by [CONTACT_19051]’ preference. We will email the study information sheet to the interested person  and follow -up 
by [CONTACT_19052], again based on the interested persons’ preference. We will answer all questions to the persons satisfaction. We will then obtain verbal consent at the first scheduled 
meeting prior to initiating the interview and recording . 
 We will also use a snowball approach to recruit additional participants by [CONTACT_19053]. A study team member will contact [CONTACT_19054] a brief description of the study  and instructions to respond within two week  if they do not 
wish to be further contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. After two weeks, we will follow up with the remaining potential participants to gauge their interest and availability in participating.  If the potential participant is 
interested, we will email them the study information sheet and follow- up by [CONTACT_19055]. Because the risk of this study is low, we will obtain verbal consent to 
participate at the first scheduled meeting prior to initiating the interview and recording.   
 
Throughout the study, we will confirm interest and continued willingness to participate at the 
end of each interview and meeting.   
 
Eligibility:  Individuals will be eligible if they are employed by [CONTACT_19056] (IU Health or Eskenazi Health)  
 
Data Collection:  We plan to record all meetings /interviews  as well as take detailed notes.  The 
research team will review the notes a fter each meeting and determine if the recordings need 
transcribing for more detailed review.  All recordings will be  transcribed and de-identifie d. A 
cross walk file will be kept password protected by [CONTACT_19057].  Recordings will 
be kep t on the study project folder.  
 
Surveys  
Our randomized clinical trial Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_19033] (Indiana University IRB# [PHONE_309])  enrolls providers to 
participate in the study . Half the providers are randomized to receive  a reminder that their 
patient is due for colorectal cancer screening , and their patient’s chance of currently having an 
ACN and implications for screening test effectiveness and choice.   We plan to invite providers 
who were sent at least one of these notifications to complete a  survey after  their completion in 
the randomized trial.  
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)  Page 11 of 19 
 The survey data will be collected by [CONTACT_19058] a link to complete the survey 
directly in a web- based, HIPAA- aligned data collection system (REDCap). Data will be collected 
with an investigator created measure to evaluate the notification. Satisfaction will be measure 
with an 11 -item scale using Likert -type response options whe re 4 = strongly agree to 1 = 
strongly disagree , and  usability will be measure with five multiple choice questions . At the end 
of these [ADDRESS_17925] the survey will take less than  3 minutes to complete, and the providers will be 
mailed a $[ADDRESS_17926] after completing the survey.  
 
Enrollment:   Study s taff working with the clinical trial monitor patient enrollment. When study 
staff determine that patients from a provider are no longer being recruited and enrolled, that provider’s participation in the trial will end. Within approximately 1 month of the provider 
coming off the clinical trial, study staff will send the provider the survey through REDCap. The 
body of the email containing  the survey link will inform the provider that they are being asked 
to complete a survey, the purpose of the survey, a statement regarding any potential risks and 
benefits, a statement that completing the survey is voluntary, and the Principal Investigator ’s 
name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031]. Clicking on the link to access the survey will confirm consent.  
 
Eligibility :  Providers who enrolled in the clinical trial Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_19037] (Indiana Uni versity IRB# [PHONE_309]) , and 
received at least one notification containing the  reminder that their patient is due for colorectal 
cancer screening, and their patient’s chance of currently having an ACN and implications for 
screening test effectiveness and choice . 
 Cancer screening and prevention in primary care during COVID19 (Aim 2):  
We will expand our planned Aim 1 interviews with leadership, providers, and staff to cover 
cancer screening beyond colorectal cancer  and cancer screening during the COVID- 19 
pandemic . While we will be interested in all health system participants’ comments, we 
anticipate that a subset of these participants will have more knowledge about the impact  COVID -[ADDRESS_17927] staff over 
the phone , video conferencing , or in -person according to the participants’ preference and 
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)   Page [ADDRESS_17928] staff will be located in a private area and the interviewees will be 
encour aged to locate in a private area as well.  The se interviews are planned to take an hour 
and will be audio recorded. All recordings will be transcribed  and de -identified. Participants will 
be mailed a $[ADDRESS_17929] to thank them for their time.  
 
Data analy sists from both our health system partners will query their respective EHRs’ for 
cancer screening rates, types of screening tests, and primary care visit volume and type of visits. This data will be shared with health system leadership, providers, and staf f to help them 
remember the time periods during the interviews and meetings.  
 
Patient engagement in cancer screening and prevention during COVID19 (Aim 3) : 
We will identify patients receiving primary care from two healthcare organizations: Eskenazi 
Health  and IU Health  who were due for cancer screening at the start of the COVID pandemic .   
 We will identify adults age eligible for screening  in the electronic health records from these two 
healthcare organizations who previously had either breast, cervical, or lung cancer screening 
and became eligible for repeat screening in April or May 2020. We will also identify patients  
who  were scheduled for a screening colonoscopy in April or May 2020 and had the procedure 
cancelled due to the COVID pandemic . We will identify some individuals who completed the 
cancer screening after May  2020 and some who did not complete indicated screening.  We will 
aim to enroll a convenience sample with diverse sex, race, ethnicity, and range of participation 
in cancer screening and prevention.  
 
Inclusion criteria:  
Patients will be eligib le if they:  
• completed cervical cancer screening in April or May 2017; completed breast cancer 
screening in April or May 2018; completed lung cancer screening in April or May 2019; or had a scheduled screening colonoscopy cancelled in April or May [ADDRESS_17930]  
• age 50 –  75 yea rs* for individuals screened for breast  cancer ; age 50 –  80 years* for 
individuals screened for lung cancer; age 25 –  75 years* for individuals screened  for 
cervical cancer; age 50 –  75 years * for individuals scheduled for screening colonoscopy  
in April/May 2020  
• Speaks English

 • Self-report they no longer receive primary care at either of our partner health systems  
(IU Health or Eskenazi Health)  
• Self-report that they completed the repeat screening prior to April/May 2020 and 
therefore, were not eligible to be screened again in April/May 2020  
• For patients identified as not having the repeat screening after May 2020, self -report 
that they did complete the indicated screening  
• Are unable to speak or read English  
• Previously participated in any research  projects conducted by [CONTACT_079] 
(Peter H. Schwartz, MD, PhD)  
 
Methods: We will mail potentially eligible patients an invitation letter to participate in a one -
time  interview. The invitation will include a phone number to call our research team if the 
patient does not wish to be further contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. After about [ADDRESS_17931] in our study participation. We will 
review the Study Information Sheet (SIS) and HIPAA authorization with the patient and email the participant both forms , arranging for a follow -up phone call as needed to further discuss 
and answer any participant questions.  After the patient verbally agrees to participate, we will schedule a one time, phone/virtual platform (Zoom) meeting to administer a semi- structured 
interview. Prior to starting the interview, w e will confirm  verbal consent to participate and to 
audiotape(telephone)/videotape (Virtual Platform) the interview. The interview will take 
approximately 45 minutes and will be transcribed and de -identified. Participants will be 
compensated with a $[ADDRESS_17932]  for completing an interview.  
 We will employ a semi- structured, telephone/virtual platform interview.  The interview guide 
will be developed based on materials such as the current US preventive task force guidelines, 
other relevant literature, and research on perceived risk and preventive behaviors.  We will continue interviews until we achieve content saturation.  
 
We will assess patients’ participation in screening and prevention and healthcare more generally during the COVID19 pandemic, planned future participation, perceived facilitators and barriers, risk perception, and sources of information.  In each area, we will ask participants for 
reflection on changes from before the pandemic.  
 
 
5.0 Data Analysis Plan  
 
Decision Aid and Provider Notification  Implementation (Aim 1):  
All interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and de -identified. We will first conduct rapid 
qualitative analysis using notes taken during the interviews to identify key themes. Next we will 
qualitatively code using Nvivo  software, with separate coding and analysis for the patient and 
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)   Page 14 of 19 
 the leadership/provider/ staff interviews.  The codebooks will include both apriori including 
planned constructs around risk communications, local context and adaptations and emergent 
codes from the stakeholders. We will run a series of planned matrices evaluating risk 
assessment barriers and facilitators by [CONTACT_19059] (IU and Eskenazi).   
 
Descriptive methods will be used to analyze the quantitative survey data. The satisfaction 
ques tions have Likert -type response options, and the usability items have multiple choice 
response options. We will calculate the counts and percentages of each response option for 
each question.   
 
Cancer screening and prevention in primary care during COVID19 (Aim 2) and  
Patient engagement in cancer screening and prevention during COVID19 (Aim 3):  
All interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and de -identified. We will first conduct rapid 
qualitative analysis using notes taken during the interviews to identify key themes. Next we will 
qualitatively code using Nvivo12 software, with separate coding and analysis for the patient and 
the leadership/provider/ staff interviews.  The codebooks will include both apriori including planned constructs around risk communications and referrals, clinical preventive services 
received or postponed, local context and adaptations and emergent codes from the 
stakeholders. We will run a series of planned matrices evaluating perceived risk and preventive services receiv ed by [CONTACT_19059], and by [CONTACT_19060]. 
Furthermore, we will explore contextual elements by [CONTACT_19061] [ADDRESS_17933] flow maps of the adapted CRC screening clinical processes amid 
the COVID19 pandemic.  
 
For each of the three aims, we will feedback the results to the key stakeholders  for their 
interpretations and perceptions including the healthcare or ganizations, our patient advisory 
panel, and our investigator/staff team.  
 6.0 Deliverables  
 
Decision Aid and Provider Notification Implementation (Aim 1):  
At the conclusion of our study, we will have extensive information regarding how best to 
provide decision aids through an EHR portal, with or without personalized information, and to 
deliver provider notifications, which can guide broader implementation.  We have worked 
closely with our patient and community partners, as well as the leadership, quality improvement, and IT teams at our health system partners to develop systems that can be implemented effectively and affordably in clinical care.  Beyond publication and presentation, 
this information and the decision aids and systems will be made available to all healthcare

Cancer screening and prevention in primary care during COVID19 (Aim 2) and  
Patient engagement in cancer screening and prevention during COVID19 (Aim 3):  
In addition to publications and presentations of findings, we aim to identify at least four 
initiatives that hold promise for responding to the challenges of prevention in the COVID19 
pandemic, including facilitators and barriers and patient factors.  Examples could includ e 
variations in settings to accommodate level of virus risk (surgical facility; clinic; community  
based (e.g.pharmacy), drive throughs, and home -based  systems. We will report these initiatives 
back to our leadership, provider, and staff participants for feedback and reflection.  These 
initiatives would be candidates for implementation and future compa rative effectiveness 
research.

8.0 Data Management Plan  
 
IRB#:  [PHONE_308]  
Version Date: 2a  (A001)  Page 16 of 19 
 Reportable Events :  If a participant experiences an adverse event that occurs in greater 
frequency or severity than previously known, this will be reported to the IRB either as a prompt 
report if it meets reporting criteria, or at time of study closure.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring :  [CONTACT_19071] H. Schwartz, principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_19038]. [CONTACT_19072] and his study team will engage in quality improvement practices beginn ing with development 
and then with ongoing review of study procedures. The Co -Investigators will be actively 
involved in quality assurance activities including monitoring of recruitment, adherence to study 
protocol, and adherence to any adverse event repor ting.  
 
Potential Risks :   A breach of confidentiality is always a risk with minimal risk studies. In 
addition, participating in a research study and answering questions may cause anxiety.  
 
Protecting against or Minimizing Potential Risks :  For both patient and healthcare system 
participants, all information required for recruitment and tracking will be stored in a HIPAA -
aligned database accessible only by [CONTACT_19062]. All team members will adhere to our institution’s HIPAA policy and use of protected health information. All data provided by [CONTACT_19063] a 
separate HIPAA -aligned database accessible only by [CONTACT_19062].  
Authorization to access both databases will be managed and overseen by [CONTACT_19064].   Audio recordings will be saved on a Department of Medicine 
servers. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_19039].  Processes and procedures have been documented and implemented to 
ensure the security and protection of the data within the computer operations centers, the servers, and the databases.  
 Participant s will be assigned  a unique identification number and using this number to identify 
the participant in all transcripts . We will keep all paper documents locked in lockable cabinets 
in a locked office suite.  
 All participants will be fully informed about the study prior to e nrollment and be given the 
opportunity to decline to answer any questions or to discuss any issues they find troubling. They will be told that they can terminate participation at any time for any reason.  
 Research team members will be trained in procedures  to allow participant to withdraw from 
the study. All study team members including those involved with the recruitment, informed consent process, and data collection will be adequately trained. Training will include passing of 
our institution’s required Co llaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) modules and 
ongoing study -specific training from study personnel.

 Protections for Research Data:  Most of the data will be entered directly into one of several 
instruments in the study's REDCap project,  a HIPAA aligned web environment. Privileges to the 
instruments will be granted or restricted by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_19040]. This could include no access, read only, or read and edit the data.  Audio fil es that are created during the course of the study will be saved on the Department's 
servers. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_19041]'s IT to control access to 
these folders.  
 
Protections for Participant Privacy :  Initial contact [CONTACT_19065] a quality or population health meeting, or by [CONTACT_6968]. Providers and staff generally are in a private area for these meetings. Providers and staff will choose their location for the 
follow -up emails or ph one calls. The study interviews and meetings will be held in private 
locations. The research team member will be in a private area to conduct a phone or 
videoconferencing interview or meeting . 
 Initial contact [CONTACT_19066] a recruitment letter mailed through the US Postal Service 
to the address provided by [CONTACT_19067]. The recruitment phone calls 
will be made from a private office to the phone number listed in the EHR and if additional 
phone calls are required, the recruiter will confirm with the potential participant their preferred contact [CONTACT_19068]; the study team will make arrangements to comply with the potential participant's wishes.   
 Research staff will encourage the patient- participants to be in a quiet, private area for the 
interview ; however, the participants ultimately will choose the location.  The research team 
member conducting the interview will be in a private location.

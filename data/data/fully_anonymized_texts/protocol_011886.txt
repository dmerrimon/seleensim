4. OBJECTIVES * 
The goal of the study is to conduct a crowdsourced testing to examine the effects of source and 
presentation of e -cigarette educational messages among young adults who currently vape and do 
not vape. The objectives are to examine young adults’ self -reported responses toward message 
source (expert vs. peer), message sidedness (one -sided vs. two -sided), and messages combining 
both (source x message sidedness) about anti -e-cigarette messages.  
Aim 1: To determine the optimal message source and presentation type for young adult vapers 
and non -vapers to increase acceptance of e -cigarette education messages and e -cigarette harm 
perceptions.   
 
H1. Vapers will report more optimal psychophysiological responses than peer and two -sided 
messages.

Please note that all procedures will be done with the appropriate personal protective equipment, 
which includes a mask and face shield for the researcher. Participants will be required to wear 
their mask for the entirety of the study.  
 
5. BACKGROUND * 
Young adults (18 -24-year-olds) in the U.S. have the highest rates of e -cigarette use (vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]),1 
with 16 -19% of this population identifying as current users, 44 -48% ever users, and 11 -16% 
susceptible never users.2 Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_366059]3–7 and is associated with cognitive and affective disorders among young adults.8 The 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has prioritized educating about the health harm of 
vapi[INVESTIGATOR_277563]. However, young adults may avoid9,10 or reject11 the current 
education messages, especially if they currently vape12–14 or perceive the messages as 
“controlling.”15 It is urgently needed to increase acceptance of e -cigarette education messages16 
to influence their e -cigarette harm perceptions and vapi[INVESTIGATOR_610].17–20 
Using a trusted source21–24 and presenting messages appropriately25,26 can increase message 
acceptance. According to persuasion theories, one’s tobacco use status may influence 
individuals’ response to a source and presentation of messages because vapers and non -vapers 
differ in their attitudes and personal relevance regardi ng tobacco use.25,27 –[ADDRESS_457708] of a message  source22,30 and presentation25,31,32 on young 
adults’ responses to e -cigarette education messages based on their vapi[INVESTIGATOR_21550]. Evidence from 
research with cigarette smokers suggests that vapers will respond defensively to e -cigarette 
education messages, but non -vapers will not.12,[ADDRESS_457709] a tobacco health information 
source with similar attributes (e.g., peer young adults)29,34 and accept messages with balanced 
perspectives that both present negative health effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_366060] (two -sided; e.g., “vapi[INVESTIGATOR_366061], but it can 
harm your health”).25,31,[ADDRESS_457710] a source with credentials 
(e.g., scientists) 36–38 and accept information -only messages (one -sided; e.g., “vapi[INVESTIGATOR_366062]”).13,35 Thus, it is critical to understand and use a trusted source and present messages 
that are appropriate for vapers and non -vapers to optimize vapi[INVESTIGATOR_366063], making it an important area of study to improve current messaging.  
The proposed research is guided by [CONTACT_366084],39,40 
psychology,15,41 and communication.42,43 By [CONTACT_366085],44 we 
will determine an optimal combination of message source and presentation type to increase 
message acceptance and e -cigarette harm perceptions. We will compare the effects of two 
sources (expert and peer) and two message presentation types (one -sided an d two -sided) for 
young adult vapers and non -vapers. We will use in-lab study for objective assessment of 
psychophysiological measures (heart rate, skin conductance, and eye -tracking) during message 
exposure (N=112) to determine optimal messaging. The goal of this study is to determine 
optimal message source and presentation for young adult vapers and non -vapers to increase 
message acceptance and harm perceptions using psychophysiology . 
 
6. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA * 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 
 Page 3 of 15 Template Revised 12/21/2020  We will recruit young adults (N=112; 18 -24 years) from the greater Worcester area, who identify 
as 1-a) vapers (n=56) or 1 -b) susceptible non -vapers (n=56) and fluent in English.  All 
participants will have confirmed 12+ hour abstinence from ingesting tobacco/cannabis  prior to 
beginning the study in the lab    
 
Those who are not fluent in English will not be included in the study. Prisoners will not be 
included in the study. Pregnant women may be in the study if they choose, but we will not seek 
pregnant people to be in the study.

9. STUDY TIMELINES * 
An individual’s participation in the study will be a  [ADDRESS_457711] participant.  
 
10. STUDY ENDPOINTS * 
The primary outcome measures include psychophysiological responses ( cognition, arousal, 
attention)  and self -reported measures of e -cigarette harm message  and source perception s 
(message acceptance, harm perceptions, reactance, message liking, source trust, attitudes, 
behavioral intentions ). 
 
11. PROCEDURES INVOLVED * 
After providing informed consent, participants will be randomized to one of four 
experimental conditions in a 2 (Source: expert and peer) x 2 (Presentation: one -sided and two -
sided) design. Data will be collected through iMotions, a psychophysiological dat a collection 
platform. We will track participants’ eye movements using an eye -tracking device. We will 
assess heart rate and skin conductance with a sensor by [CONTACT_366086] -strapped electrodes on 
the fingers of participant’s nondominant hand. When the s tudy begins, participants will complete 
pretest measures, view messages, during which they will be measured on their 
psychophysiological responses, and complete posttest measures. Messages (see Appendix -A) 
will be presented in a random order for at least 10 seconds. Between each message segment, a 
black screen and “get ready” screen will be presented for 10 seconds to return participants’ 
heartrate and skin conductance levels to baseline. This meets the esta blished amount of time (6 
seconds) to collect hear t rate and skin conductance.45 This procedure will be repeated 18 times 
for the 18 messages. Finally, participants will complete measures on demographics, attitudes, 
and behavioral intentions. The entire procedure will take approximately 45 minutes . After 
completion, participants will be thanked and compensated $[ADDRESS_457712] harm as a result of being shocked by [CONTACT_366087], room temperature will remain above 65 degrees when running participants as the colder,

 Page 4 of 15 Template Revised 12/21/2020  drier air is more likely to cause static shock. We will also follow all safety guidelines for the 
equipment. These include having participants wash their hands thoroughly, then use hand 
sanitizer, and then use an alcohol towelette to clean the finger the s ensor will be placed. In 
addition, participants will be instructed to try to keep their hand still during the study to ensure 
the sensor does not move.  
 
12. DATA AND SPECIMEN BANKING * 
NA 
 
13. Data Analysis and Management*  
Data will be collected through iMotions, a psychophysiological data collection platform. All data 
will be saved on a password protected computer on the UMass Chan Medical School server. 
Upon completion of data collection, all data will be de -identified and stored on the UMass Chan 
Medical School OneDrive.  
 
Visual inspection of heart rate will be performed prior to statistical analysis to determine if a 
monophasic pattern resembling a U -shaped pattern is present. Each participant will receive a 
change in beats per minute (BPM) score based on the second before  viewing (baseline) minus 
each second of the [ADDRESS_457713] visual attention for each message theme category. We will 
take the mean score for the self -report measures and rank the messages accordingly.  
 
14. PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS * 
The device is not intended to induce any shock to participants. There is an extremely low chance 
that participants may experience electrical shock as a result of having sensors directly applied to 
participants’ skin. This is similar to experiencing static shock from rubbing against the carpet. 
However, if they do, the severity is also extremely low. In order to minimize subject harm as a 
result of being shocked by [CONTACT_267620], room temperature will remain above 65 degrees when 
running participants as the co lder, drier air is more likely to cause static shock. We will also 
follow all safety guidelines for the equipment. These include having participants wash their 
hands thoroughly, then use hand sanitizer, and then use an alcohol towelette to clean the finger  
the sensor will be placed. In addition, participants will be instructed to try to keep their hand still 
during the study to ensure the sensor does not move.  
 
15. WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT * 
NA 
 
16. RISKS TO SUBJECTS * 
Risks to subjects involve experiencing a minor static shock as explained in #14 as well as being 
uncomfortable answering questions about tobacco use.  Participants will be advised that they are 
free to refuse to answer any question that makes them feel uncomfortable. All observed or 
volunteered adverse events will be recorded through the IRB.  Lastly, participants will be at

24. LOCAL RECRUITMENT METHODS  
We will recruit 112 young adults between the ages of 18  and 24. Participants will be recruited 
from the greater Worcester area using email  (See Appendix -C), flyers, and social media, 
advertising an opportunity to participate in a health messaging study. We will also send out the 
flyer to the following student list servs at UMass Chan : The Student Life Bulletin, The Graduate 
School of Nursing list serv, and School of Medicine list serv.  Participants from other studies will 
also be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Passive online screener  will be used to determine eligibility.  Potential 
participants will be directed to an online screener that will collect their contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
Those who meet the eligibility criteria will be contact[CONTACT_366089].  
 
$[ADDRESS_457716] participants’ email 
addresses and any other info required by [CONTACT_366090]. The gift cards will be sent from a umassmed.edu account within an hour after 
their visit. Then, the record of the participant’s email address and address will be destroyed by 
[CONTACT_978].   
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 
 Page 7 of 15 Template Revised 12/21/[ADDRESS_457717] method (e.g., email or phone), participants will be contact[CONTACT_366091]. There will be three attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_4317]. We will keep a list of those who say “no” (which include those who do not answer 
after the three attempts ) and those who say “yes.”  
 
25. LOCAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  
112 individuals will participate in the study.  
 
26. CONFIDENTIALITY  
Screener data will be stored on REDCap. REDCap is a secure web -based application for building 
and managing online surveys and databases. This application was developed at Vanderbilt 
University.  If participants consent, we will retain the identifying information (name, phone 
number, email) from the screener data for [ADDRESS_457718] 
subjects for future studies.  However, the responses will be de -identified at the conclusion of the 
participant enrollment period. Thus, participants’ contact [CONTACT_366092]. If participants do not consent to storing their contact [CONTACT_3031], we will 
destroy their contact [CONTACT_366093].   
 
UMass Chan deploys REDCap application for use by [CONTACT_366094]. Clinical study groups utilize REDCap functions via an intuitive interface to 
generate custom databases and/or surveys for data collection and study management including 
site and personnel management. REDCap provides audit trails for tracking data manipulation and 
export procedures, as well as seamless data downloads to common statistical packages and data 
import from non -REDCap data sources. UMass Chan REDCap is supported by [CONTACT_366095] 
& Technology Division of Information Technology (IT).  
 
The UMass Chan REDCap  application resides in a secure network environment based on ISO 
[ZIP_CODE] designed to support PHI data capture and storage.  
 
All study data are collected using the iMotions 6.4 Biometric Research Platform, a secure, 
computer -based data collection platform. No self -report or psychophysiological data collected 
are directly linked to participant identifying information: self -report  and psychophysiological 
data collected through iMotions are tracked using a unique, numeric study identifier that does not 
contain any personally identifying information. A monitor on the computer will track the 
participant’s eye movements and three  senso rs on the participant’s fingers will track heart rate 
and skin conductance. Each message will appear for ten seconds, which falls above the 
established amount of time needed (6 seconds) to collect heart rate and skin conductance levels 
for still messages . This will allow us to take into account baseline levels and time for heart rate 
and skin conductance to react. After each message , participants will answer the same measures 
included in the participant survey pertaining to responses toward the message and source, and 
INVESTIGATOR STUDY PLAN - REQUIRED  
 
 Page 8 of 15 Template Revised 12/21/2020  perceived message effectiveness . This process will be repeated 18 times  for each of the two 
message sidedness conditions , resulting in a total of 36 different messages seen by [CONTACT_4317]. 
After wards, participants will be asked to complete additional measures related to actual message 
effectiveness ( e-cigarette attitudes, risk beliefs, intentions to vape).  
 
Between each message  sidedness condition , individuals will see a blank black screen for 10 
seconds, then a black screen with the words “get ready” for five seconds followed by [CONTACT_366096] [ADDRESS_457719] (IRB) approval from UMass Chan . Participants will be appropriately consented. This will 
include a clear understanding of the study objectives and procedures, content of the survey 
protocols that will be administered, and ample opportunity to have their questions answered, and 
prior to the surveys. Participation will be on a voluntary basis , and we will obtain written consent 
from participants after the detailed explanation of the study and opportunity to ask questions. 
The consent process for participation in the study will occur in -person . All research personnel 
will be research personnel will be familiar with HRP -090: Informed Consent Process for 
Research .

1. Purpose/Specific Aims  
The purpose of the study is to better understand the mechanisms of lung injury from ozone 
exposure. Ozone is a ubiquitous urban air pollutant that causes adverse health effects in both 
healthy and susceptible individuals. The study will focus on the inflam matory mechanisms 
which follow ozone exposure. Specifically, the study will determine the role of different types of macrophages , proinflammatory M1 macrophages and anti -inflammatory reparative M2 
macrophages, in lung injury.   The study will incorporate a pi[INVESTIGATOR_680111] e novel soluble 
inflammatory markers in sputum supernatant including cytokine, chemokines, eicosanoids and 
prostaglandins following ozone exposure . Samples from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_680112].  
 
 1.1 Objectives  
1. The phenotype of macrophages responding to ozone exposure will be assessed (main study) . 
2. The objective of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_680113]. Additionally, the response of 
novel inflammatory markers to ozone exposure will be assessed .   
3. The response of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_680114]. 
 
 1.2 Hypotheses   
The hypothesis for the ma in study is that ozone toxicity is a result of cytotoxic proinflammatory 
macrophages overwhelming the activity of anti- inflammatory reparative macrophages.  
 
2. Background and Significance 
Ozone is a ubiquitous air pollutant and the main component of photochemical smog.  It remains 
one of the mos t problematic air pollutants to control because it is formed from intermediates 
that arise from multiple sources [ 1-3].  Inhaled ozone has been shown to irritate and damage 
the lung in both healthy and susceptible individuals, including children and the elderly [ 3, 4]. 
Ozone causes inflammation and constriction of the airways, reducing pulmonary 
function. Ozone also exacerbates asthma and suppresses nonspecific immunity increasing the susceptibility of exposed individuals to respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073] [ 5, 6].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_680115] U.S. have demonstrated that for every 10 ppb increase in peak ozone levels, the total death rate for the same day increases by 0.41% [ 4], while a more recent US/European study estimated 
0.56% [ 7]. Adverse effects of ozone are even greater in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_680116] U.S. with a concomitantly greater health burden.  
In this regard, despi[INVESTIGATOR_680117], daily maximum ozone concentrations have recently reached 128 ppb in Shanghai and 225 ppb in Mexico City [ 8, 9].

effects of ozone on the lung, but also indirectly to the actions of resident and infiltrating macrophages [10-12
]. These cells are activated to release a myriad of inflamm atory mediators 
that fight infection, protect against xenobiotics, activate adaptive immunity, and promote wound healing. These diverse activities of macrophages are thought to be mediated by [CONTACT_680135]. Two major subpopulations have been identified: classically activated M1 
macrophages  which release cytotoxic/proinflammatory mediators and alternatively activated 
M2 macrophages , which release mediators that suppress inflammation and initiate wound 
repair [ 13, 14] . 
 
Our overall goal is to analyze the distinct contributions of M1 and M2 macrophage subpopulations to ozone -induced lung injury.  Preliminary data demonstrate that both 
macrophage populations play a role in ozone toxicity. Whereas initially, classically activated M1 macrophages contribute to lung injury by [CONTACT_680136]/proinflammatory mediators, subsequent release of anti -inflammatory and mitogenic mediators by M2 macrophages 
promotes tissue repair.  We hypothesize  that ozone -induced injury and altered lung mechanics 
ensue when M1 macrophage proinflammatory/cytotoxic activity predominates over the antiinflammatory/reparative functions of M2 macrophages. To test this hypothesis, the 
phenotype of macrophages responding to ozone -induced injury will be analyzed in animals 
and humans. Additionally, mice with specific defects in M1 or M2 macrophages, or monocyte precursors, will be used to assess their contribution to toxicity. Lineage tracking strategies will be used to analyze the origin of macrophage subpopulations in the lung and mechanisms mediating their accumulation .  
 The hypothesis that inhaled ozone causes a sequential accu mulation of M1 and M2 
macrophages in humans and animals has not been previously tested. Findings that results in humans are comparable to mice would provide strong support for the relevance of our mouse models to human toxicity resulting from ozone exposur e. For translational human studies, we 
will use induced sputum as a source of macrophages [ 15-17]. The advantage of induced sputum 
is that it is a safe and non -invasive technique; additionally, induced sputum selectively samples 
the surfaces of the large conducting airways, a primary target for ozone effects in humans [ 15, 
18].  
 The supernatant from the induced sputum samples will be analyzed for markers of 
inflammation, including chemokines, cytokines, prostaglandins and eicosanoids. Eicosanoids, including 20-HETE and 15- HETE, have been shown to induce airway hyper -responsiveness 
and to be increased by [CONTACT_680137]  [19]. In addition to directly inducing 
inflammation, oxidants , such as ozone, can generate free rad  icals altering the 
oxidant/antioxidant balance within the respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y tract.  The release of ROS leads to 
transcription of pro- inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes, increased release of pro-
inflammatory mediators and up- regulation of adhesion molecules [ 20, 21].  Mononuclear cells

   isolated from induced sputum in subjects with asthma express IL -4 and IL -10 levels to a greater 
degree than cells from healthy controls, suggesting an enhanced immunologically m ediated 
inflammatory response [22].  Exhaled breath condensate samples , blood samples  and urine 
samples will also be analyzed for markers of inflammation. 
 The characterization of the lung microbiome is currently the focus of an ongoing study at 
Rutgers (Pro20140000953).  The study compares microbial communities in numerous samples from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] (including lung cells collected by [CONTACT_680138], induced sputum, oral wash, and oropharyngeal samples). Environmental exposures may alter the lung microb iome, affecting disease progression [ 23-25]. Samples will be collected by [CONTACT_680139].  The current USEPA standard for ozone is 0.[ADDRESS_920262] not only healthy individuals, but  those more sensitive to ozone’s effects such 
as infants, children, those with asthma, and those with other chronic lung conditions such as COPD.  The  proposed exposure  concentration  of ozone  (0.2 ppm,  3 hours) is  almost  twice  
maximal levels  reported  in the world’s  most  polluted cities  (i.e., Mexico  City); however,  this 
concentration  and higher  concentrations  (up to 0.4 ppm, 2 hours)  with exercise have been  used 
extensively for mechanistic  studies  at [LOCATION_002] Environmental Protection Agency 
(USEPA), the University of Southern [LOCATION_004] ( USC ), the University of [LOCATION_004], San 
Francisco ( UCSF), the University of [LOCATION_004], Davis (UC Davis), the University of 
[COMPANY_002]ster, and  other  institutions for over 40 years  with no adverse effects  in hundreds of 
subjects, including asthmatics, beyond transient and expected physiologic declines in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], reported  [26-34]. For instance, one recent study at University of [COMPANY_002]ster 
exposed healthy exercising subjects to 0.2 ppm of ozone for 3 hour, identical to our proposed 
protocol  [27]. 7-10%decline s in FEV1 were observed 0.5 hours after exposure had largely 
resolved by 4 hours following exposure .  Another study using the roughly equivalent 0.3 ppm 
ozone for 2 hours with exercise showed transient  FEV1 declines of 7- 15% [26]. Our exposures  
will be limited  to 3 hours  and will only occur  once.  Based  on published  studies,  subjects  are 
not expected  to experience  more  than transitory  effects  including  symptoms  of mucosal  
irritation, cough or headache,  but these  are expected  to be mild and dissipate  within  an hour 
after the exposure  is terminated.  
 
3. Research  Design and Methods  
The study is a single  blind randomized cross -over design. Subjects ( up to 68 healthy men and 
women)  will participate in the study  (48 non-smokers and 10 smokers in the main study and 
5-10 in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]) . Eligible subjects will have 5 clinic visits: one screening visit, [ADDRESS_920263] will participate in 
2 exposure sessions, one to clean air (ozone<5ppb) and one to 0.2 ppm ozone in the Controlled Exposure Facility (CEF) at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute (EOHSI). The order of the exposure sessions will be randomized. Up to 2 subjects may 
participate in each exposure session. Induced sputum samples will be collected at the baseline 
(during screening) then at one of three pre -selected time periods ( 24, 48 or 72 hours ) following 
each exposure sessio n. Breath, blood, oral washes, oropharyngeal swabs, and urine samples 
will be collected at each visit.

Protocol Version 19– 12/9/[ADDRESS_920264] ion period. Non-smokers will also be asked to avoid tobacco 
smoke.  Subjects will be consented then scheduled for a screening visit to determine eligibility. Subjects will be asked  to refrain from eating for 2 hours prior to the screening visit. On the day 
prior to the screening visit , subjects will be called /emailed/texted  to confirm their appointment . 
If the subject reports a respi[INVESTIGATOR_680118] , including active al lergies,  during the 
four prior weeks or if they have taken any medication for allergies or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375] , their 
visit will be rescheduled to a later date . The screening visit will include a complete medical 
history and physical examination  (including height, weight , and three  blood pressure 
measurement s), lab tests ( CBC with differential and platelet count, urinalysis, and standard 
metabolic screen ), spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], impulse oscillometry (IOS), and ECG. A pregnancy test (urine 
hCG) will be administered to females at enrollment and before each exposure session. E xhaled 
breath condensate (EBC) samples will also be collected  using an RTube™ (the condensate 
collection system manufactured by [CONTACT_130751][INVESTIGATOR_113175], Inc.)  or 
using the Jaeger EcoScreen . With 
the RTube
TM, each subject uses a 
new and separately packaged device to eliminate any risk of infection transmission.  The 
samples are collected by [CONTACT_680140] a one -
way valve in to a cooled condenser 
for 5 to 15 minutes.  As much as 
1 ml of condensed liquid can be collected in a 5- minute period.  There is virtually no risk and 
no spuriously induced inflammation in the lung from this procedure, and it may be serially repeated [35]. Subjects will be asked for permission to store excess EBC sample for future use 
by [CONTACT_30967].   Impulse os cillometry (IOS) is an additional  noninvasive and effort -independent technique to 
measure airway resistance and capacitance.  The airway resistance and capacitance, reflecting airway compressibility, is measured at normal tidal breathing.  This physiologic technique also 
allows measurement of peripheral and central airway resistance.   IOS waves are measured for 
[ADDRESS_920265] resistance.  
 Oral w ashes and oropharyngeal swabs will be collected  for microbiome analyses. For the oral 
wash (OW), participants will gargle  with 10 ml sterile 0.9% saline and expel the sample into a 
specimen container.  Oropharyngeal swabs (OS) will be collected using a new, sterile cotton

swab will be inserted into the back of the oral cavity.  The participan t will be asked to  say 
"aahh” to elevate the uvula and with a sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_680119].  By [CONTACT_2931] a little force a large quantities of mucosa  will be 
collected .  Care will be exercised to avoid swabbing the soft palate or  touching  the tongue with 
the swab tip.  The swab will immediately placed in a sterile tube and sto red with the other 
samples for transport.  
 In addition to the EBC , oral washes, and oropharyngeal swab samples, urine and blood 
(approximately 10 ml) samples will be collected at the screening visit. The urine samples will be analyzed  for eicosanoids and other markers of inflammation. The urine samples of the 
smokers will also be analyzed for cotinine to confirm their smoking status. The blood samples 
will be processed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Laumbach’s lab  at EOHSI. Plasma from the blood samples will be 
stored in the principal investigator’s private freezer for future analysis of markers of ozone 
response; no genetic analyses will be performed on these stored samples. Only study 
investigators will have access to these samples.  
 At screening, subjects w ill be ask ed to provide an induced sputum specimen (baseline sample), 
which will be immediately analyzed for the presence of plugs. Using the method described by [CONTACT_680141]. [36] and Alexis et al., [ 37] subjects inhale increasing concentrations  of saline (3% , 
4% and 5% ) for 3 consecutive 7- minute periods through a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_680120] a valve. To 
reduce the risk of bronchospasm, following the recommendations of the European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_680121] [38], albuterol (180 mc g; [ADDRESS_920266] metered inhaler) will be given to 
subjects [ADDRESS_920267] will be asked to breathe through hi s/her mouth during 
the induction. If the subject is observed to breathe through his/her nose, he/she will be asked to monitor his/her breathing and will be offered a nose clip to use during the induction. After 
each period of inhalation, an FEV -1 is measur ed for safety. If the FEV -1 decreases by 20% or 
more  from the post -dose FEV -1, the procedure is stopped. After rinsing the mouth, swallowing 
water and blowing the nose to minimize contamination by [CONTACT_680142], subjects will cough sputum into a sterile container.  Subjects unable to provide an adequate specimen (70-75 mg  of plugs ) will be excused from the study. In the main study, subjects will be assigned 
to a post -exposure sample collection time (24, 48, or 72 hours) to be used for both expos ure 
sessions. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_680122] , all subjects will be assigned to the [ADDRESS_920268] -
exposure sample collection. T he exposure sessions will be scheduled.  
 Subjects may be screened  (telephone and screening visits)  year-round. For the main study, the 
exposure visits will be scheduled between October and June , consistent with low ambient 
ozone months in New Jersey. For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], since only acut e responses  are examined (24 
hours of the exposure), the screening and exposure visits will take place year -round. If over 
six months have passed between the screening visit a nd scheduling the exposures, those  
subjects will be re -consented and the screening visit will be repeated.  
 Each exposure session will be [ADDRESS_920269] Kipen, MD, MPH  
 
 
Protocol Version 19–  12/9/[ADDRESS_920270]’s blood pressure, pulse, and  
temperature will be measured. IOS and s pi[INVESTIGATOR_680123]. Two questionnaires will also be administered before the exposure session: a 
stress questionnaire and a symptom questionnaire. If the subject reports the presence of any 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], the exposure session will be canceled. During the exposure, heart rate 
will be measured using a wireless monitor (H7; Polar [LOCATION_003]).  Subjects will be asked to alternate 
(every 15 minutes) rest and mild/moderate exerci se periods on a cycle ergometer to maintain 
an average heart rate of approximately 60% maximum heart rate (220 -age). The exercise  is 
necessary as healthy human subjects are relatively insensitive to ozone [ 39, 40]. The exercise 
schedule may be modified to maintain the ventilation rate  or for the  subject’s comfort . After 
the exposure session, the stress and symptom questionnaire s will be administered. An exposure 
type questionnaire will also be administered immediately after the exposure. If the subject 
reports any physical symptoms or has a 20% decrease in his/her FEV1 after the exposure 
session, the study physician will be consulted. Subjects will be given verbal and written 
instructions to contact [CONTACT_680143]. Subjects will inform the responding 
pulmonologist that he/she is a study subject. As an additional precaution, subjects will be given a rescue inhaler to use only if directed to do so by [CONTACT_680144]. Subjects will be shown how to use the inhaler  prior to leaving the EOHSI clinic . The pulmonologist will 
inform [CONTACT_680159] of any calls made to the pulmonologist and any treatment. The symptom questionnaire will be administered to each subject the day after exposure . For subjects 
returning at [ADDRESS_920271] if he/she  contact[CONTACT_680145] . If the subject reports the presence of any symptoms  or called the 
Pulmonary Division , the study physician will be consulted, prior to the collection of any 
samples .  
 Immediately before and  after each exposure session  EBC samples will be collected using the 
same methods as in the screening visits. In addition to the EBC samples, urine , oral washes, 
oropharyngeal swabs,  and blood samples will be collected before and  after each exposure 
session.  During the second exposure visits, an additional blood sample will be collected for 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_680124]. The urine samples will be analyzed for eicosanoids and 
other markers of inflammation. The blood samples will be processed by [CONTACT_40420]. La umbach’s

3.3 Sample Size Justification   
Calculations are based on published human exposure studies [41, 42] demonstrating
 2.3-fold 
and 1.6-fold increases  (SE=8%) in mean  fluorescence intensity  of sputum  leukocyte  expression  
of markers  of M1 (CD14) and M2 (CD16)  macrophages  following  ozone  exposure  at 24 h 
compared  to clean  air. The SDs  for changes  [the square  root of 2(1-rho)SD2] were  calculated  
where rho is the intra-person  correlation  (0.5)  between  measurements.  Based  on this, 16 
subjects/exposure  group are needed  to achieve 90% power  using 0.[ADDRESS_920275] populations will be studied: smokers ( n=10) and non- smokers ( n=70). The pi[INVESTIGATOR_680125] 10 people (non- smokers) and the main study will recruit 70 people (10

Additional Exclusion  Criteria for Non -smokers : history of smoking within the past [ADDRESS_920279] in the Controlled 
Exposure Facility at EOHSI. The  CEF consists  of three major components:  1) the  exposure  
chamber;  2) the  air pollutant  generation  system;  and 3) the  control  systems.  The CEF is a large  
stainless  steel room (7.3 ft. high x 13.5 ft.  wide  x 9 ft. deep;  volume=  887 cubic feet)  in which  
the air flow,  temperature  and humidity  can be varied  and well controlled. A divider  separates  
the chamber  into two compartments,  so that two subjects  can be exposed  simultaneously. There 
is a lavatory in the chamber for extended exposure studies.  For the clean  air exposure, ambient  
air that  supplies  the exposure  chamber  will be treated  using  a series  of processes,  which  include  
cooling/heating, humidification/dehumidification,  and filtration  through a carbon  filter,  a 
KMnO4  purifier,  and HEPA filters.  The clean  air enters  the CEF through two diffusers  located  
in the ceiling  and exits  through  the perforated  stainless  steel  floor without  recirculation.  
 
For ozone  exposure  sessions,  ozone  will be  generated  in situ by [CONTACT_680146]-generator (Ozone  
Research  & Equipment  Corporation, Phoenix, AZ), mixed  with the filtered  clean  air and  will 
enter the CEF through the two air diffusers.  The ozone  concentration  will be achieved  by 
[CONTACT_680147].  Based  on previous  
studies  [43], ozone  can be precisely  controlled  during  an exposure  session.  The ozone  
concentration  will be monitored in real time using an API [CONTACT_26159]  450 ozone  analyzer  (API,  
Inc., San Diego,  CA).  The sensitivity  of the instrument is 1 ppb, and response  time is less than 
20 sec.  Noise  is less than 0.7 ppb.  
 Additionally, during each exposure session, additional air pollutants will be monitored. CO  
concentration  will be measured  using a real-time Langan  T15 CO gas monitor.  NO/NO
2 
concentration  will be monitored  by a TEI Model  42C TL Trace Level  NO-NO 2-NOx  real-time 
Analyzer  (Thermo  Electron  Corporation, Franklin, MA).  PM 2.5 mass  concentration will be 
measured  using  a real-time personal  PM monitor (SidePak, TSI  Inc., MN).

   Induced sputum samples will be collected at the Environmental and Occupational Health 
Sciences clinic. The relative concentrations of M1 and M2 macrophages in the induced sputum 
sample will be assessed  in the Rutgers Universit y Flow Cytometry/Cell Sorting and Confocal 
Microscopy Core facility (http://www.flowcyt.rutgers.edu/) . Cells will be separated from 
mucus plugs, stained with fluorescent antibodies and then analyzed by [CONTACT_4133]. 
Leukocytes will initially be separated  from epi[INVESTIGATOR_680128]45 
expression, and macrophages identified by [CONTACT_44688] -DR expression [44]. Flow cytometry will also 
be used to assess macrophage phagocytosis and oxidative burst . To confirm their phenotype, 
sputum macrophage subpopulations will be sorted and expression of inflammatory proteins and additional M1/M2 macrophage markers not detectable by [CONTACT_680148] -PCR and immunocytochemistry.  
 Macrophage response may vary by [CONTACT_7631], specifically GST  polymorphisms. The

after the gen etic analyses will be destroyed.  
 
Supernatant  from the induced sputum sample, EBC , and urine  will be analyzed for cytokines, 
chemokines, prostaglandins and novel eicosanoids. The analysis will first be done in samples 
from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_680130]. All analyses will be 
done at the Rutgers Flow Cytometry Lab and in [CONTACT_680160]’s lab in EOHSI. Subjects will be asked for permission to store excess sample s for future use by [CONTACT_30967].  
 Oral washes and oropharyngeal swabs  as well as aliquots of induced sputum and EBC samples 
will be given to [CONTACT_680161] for microbiome analysis.  
 
Specimens (induced sputum, exhaled breath condensate, and blood samples) will be analyzed 
for oxidized and nitrosylated varia nts of surfactant protein D. All analyses will take place in 
the Rutgers Flow Cytometry Lab.  
 
Data from the stress questionnaires, collected before and after the exposure and before the follow -up sputum induction, will be examined as possible modifiers of the response. Subject 
fitness, calculated by [CONTACT_680149], will also be examined as a possible modifier.  
 
 
4.4 Risk s of Harm   
Ozone  exposure : The proposed  exposure  concentration of ozone  (0.2 ppm, 3 hours) is  almost 
twice  maximal levels  reported  in the world’s  most  polluted cities  (i.e., Mexico  City); however,  
this concentration and higher  concentrations  (up to 0.4 ppm, 2 hours)  with exercise have  been  
used extensively for mechanistic  studies  at EPA,  USC,  and other  institutions for over [ADDRESS_920281] Kipen, MD, MPH

   chamber exposures of smokers to ozone, it appears there is no increased risk of acute 
deterioration in pulmonary function, respi[INVESTIGATOR_3323], heart rate or symptomatology, even at ozone doses >3 times the concentration proposed in this protocol [45]. Thus, there does not 
appear to be an increased risk of harm by [CONTACT_680150].  Prior to the exposure, subjects will complete a symptom questionnaire. If subjects 
report the presence of any symptoms, the exposure session will be canceled. During the exposure sessions, the participants are continually observed through a window to assur e that 
they are not exhibiting any visual signs of physical problems and wear a sensor  for continuous 
monitoring of heart rate.  A physician with a code cart is on -call during the entire procedure to 
respond to any subject complaints or situations. If a subject  develops  any symptoms  of chest  
pain, dizziness,  or other  symptoms /signs  of concern  to the subject or the study technician, the  
physician will speak with and examine the subject and decide if the exposure session may 
continue. The covering  physician  will examine the subject,  including EKG  if indicated , and 
make an appropriate  triage  decision, including referral via ambulance to the emergency 
department. Regardless of the physician’s recommendation, the study subject may choose to end 
the session at an y time.  At the end of each exposure session, the subject will complete a 
symptom questionnaire. This  questionnaire  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_680151] a 
physician  to ensure that  the subject  is ready  to resume daily activities . The subject will also be 
asked to complete the symptom questionnaire the next day (by [CONTACT_48052]). If the subject reports any symptoms, he/she will be referred to the study physician. All subjects will be asked 
to return for their scheduled follow -up visit.  
 As a p recaution against delayed bronchospasm after an exposure session, after -hours response 
has been arranged with the pulmonary  division Robert Wood Johnson Medical School . After 
each exposure session, subjects will be given written and verbal instructions to call the 
pulmonary division for any delayed respi[INVESTIGATOR_66780]. A physician will be available 24 
hours a day/[ADDRESS_920282] will be asked 
to return for his/her scheduled follow up visit for the sputum collection. Since no further ozone exposure will occur, the subject will be permitted to continue with the study and participate in the clean air exposure, if not done previously. In the unlikely event that the subject experiences 
bronchospasm either during or after the clean air exposure and has not yet had the ozone 
exposure, the subject will be considered ineligible and his/her participation will stop. If the 
ozone exposure session has been completed, the subject will be asked to continue in the study 
and ret urn for a follow -up visit . 
 
Sputum  induction:  Sputum  induction with hypertonic  saline  may cause reversible  
bronchoconstriction  in some  individuals.  Bronchoconstriction  has been  observed  primarily in  
asthmatic  subjects  who have pre- existing  bronchial  hyperreactivity.   In order to reduce the risk

Albuterol: Albuterol , a short -acting bronchodialator, will  be admin istered  before induction  via 
a rescue inhaler to prevent bronchoconstriction and possibly  afterward to treat di fficulty 
breathing, w heezing or shortness of breath  due to bronchoconstriction. Temporary side effects 
from albuterol include tremor, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and headache.  These effects may last four to six 
hours.  
 
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: The selected assays currently have no immediate application to the diagnosis or 
treatment of any disease, but may relate to the inflammatory response.  The primary risk from 
the testing is the loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep the results 
confidential.  
 Venipuncture : Slight pain, some  bleeding, or bruising  may  occur when  blood is  drawn for the  
routine  laboratory  tests.  
 Oropharyngeal Swabs:  The swabbing will be performed by a clinic nurse  or medical assistant  
to reduce the possibility of a gag reflex.  Oral wash: No physical risk but subjects may experience a salty taste.  
 IOS:  Subjects may experience brief, temporary lightheadedness during the IOS measurement.

website and the flyers, interested candidates will be instructed to call the study coordinator. The 
study coordinator or a research assistant will call the subj ect to explain the study and answer 
any questions. If the candidate wishes to participate, a brief telephone screening questionnaire will be administered. The screening questionnaire will ascertain the presence of major exposure -
study exclusions such as HIV infection, cardiovascular disease, str oke, diabetes, or asthma. The 
recruiter will ask about the COVID -[ADDRESS_920287] of his/her  vitamins,  supplements, and herbal 
preparations  and their frequency of use . The supplements will be checked for antioxidant 
content and the candidate will be informed if he/she is eligible. If the candidate is not eligible, no identifying information will be recorded. If the candidate is eligible, contact [CONTACT_680153]. The candidate will be given, mailed or emailed (based on his/her preference) a copy of the consent form to review prior to  the screening visit . A copy of the medical history questionnaire will also be given to the 
subject . The subject will be asked to bring the completed questionnaire to the screening visit.  
The subject will also be asked to bring proof of vaccination to the screening visit – this can be 
their physical vaccine card or a photo of it. If the subject is a Rutgers student or employee, they may show their myRutgers Dashboard vaccine status .

baseline level as a covariate in the model, F -tests will test whether the means are significantly 
different following exposure to ozone or clean air at each follow -up time -point. The mean fold-  
changes (or log -fold-changes if necessary to meet normality assumptions) in M1 and M2 
macrophages will also be assessed at each time- point (24, 48 or 72 h) following ozone and

   All study procedures are conducted during regular business hours when a physician is available 
at the EOHSI clinic. All study staff are trained in study procedures by [CONTACT_458]. During inductions, lung function will be assessed using spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. A significant decrease in lung function (FEV -1<80% baseline) will be treated with albuterol. If lung function does not 
recover, the subject will be referred to clinical care and the adverse event will be reported to the IRB. The pulmonary fellow on call at RWJB UH is available for backup if needed.  During 
the exposure sessions, the participants are continually observed through a window to assure that they are not exhibiting any visual signs of physical problems and wear a heart rate sensor (Polar.com)  for continuous  monitoring of rate. Regular voice communication between the 
study staff and the subject is maintained through an intercom system. A physician  with a code 
cart is on -call during the entire procedure to respond to any subject complaints or situations. 
At the end of each exposur e session, the subject will complete a symptom questionnaire and a 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]. This questionnaire will be reviewed by [CONTACT_680157] a physician to ensure that the subject is ready to resume daily activities.  If a subject develops symptoms of  
chest pain, dizziness, or other symptoms of concern to the subject or the physician, the study will be terminated and the covering physician will examine the subject, perform an EKG, and make an appropriate triage decision, including referral to the emerg ency department.  In the 
case of a delayed reaction, subjects will be instruct ed to call the pulmonary division of RWJMS  
and be given a rescue inhaler. Any respi[INVESTIGATOR_680134] [ADDRESS_920294] significant findings on the blood tests, the physician  will send 
a letter to them  describing  the reason  for exclusion  and to make  diagnostic  or treatment  
recommendations  if needed.  The physician  will also be available to discuss findings  if needed.

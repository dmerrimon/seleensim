1 SYNOPSIS
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -blind Study of BMS- 986205 Combined with 
Nivolumab versus Nivolumab in Participants with Metastatic or Unresectable Melanoma 
that is Previously Untreated
Study Phase: 3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Population:
The study  populationconsists of adult (18 years of age, or ageof majority) participants with 
unresectable or metastati c melanoma that is previously untreated who have not received prior 
systemic therapy  for thei r disease. Enrollment in this study  was cl osed on 19 -Apr-2018. 
Key Inclusion Criteria:
Histologically confi rmed Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma, per the American 
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual (8th edition) 
Treatment -naïve participants (ie, no prior systemic anticancer therapy  for unresectable or 
metastati c melano ma). Note that prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant melano ma therapy is permitted 
in the setting of completely  resected disease if it was completed at least 6 months prior to 
rando mizat ion, and all related adverse events (AEs) have either returned to baseline or 
stabilized.
At least one measurable lesio n by [CONTACT_521126] ( CT)or magnetic resonance imager y 
(MRI )per Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in Solid Tum ors(RECIST) v1.1 criteria
Tumor tissue (biopsy or surgical specimen, where applicable) from an unresectable or 
metastati c site o f disease must be provided for bio marker analyses. In order to be rando mized, 
a participant must be classified as PD-L1 positive (1%tumor cell membrane staining) vs

PD-L1 negat ive(< 1%tumor cell membrane staining)/ PD-L1 indeterminate (tumor cell 
membrane scoring hampered by [CONTACT_802666]). If an 
insufficient amount of tumor tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site i s available prior to 
the start of the screening phase, then a fresh biopsy will be required during the screening p hase
for perform ance o f biomarker analyses.
Parti cipants must have known BRAF V600 mutation status or consent to BRAF V600 mutation 
testing pe r local institutional standards during the Screening Period and have results of BRAF 
testing available pri or to randomizati on.Participants wi th indeterminate BRAF status or wi th 
BRAF status not documented prior to randomization are not permitted to random izeto a 
treatm ent arm .
Prior radiotherapy  must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study treatm ent 
administration .
Parti cipants m ust be able to swallow pi[INVESTIGATOR_881741].
Key Exclusion Criteria:
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
Active brain metastases or leptom eningeal metastases .Parti cipants with brain metastases are 
eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnet ic resonance imagery ( MRI )evidence 
of progressi on for at l east [ADDRESS_1232700] 
dose of study  treatm ent administration. 
Uveal or ocular melano ma
Parti cipants wi th a condit ion requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (> 10 mg 
daily  prednisone equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications wi thin 14 days of  start 
of study  treatm ent.Inhaled or topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] , and adrenal replacement steroid doses > [ADDRESS_1232701] ive autoimmune disease.
Parti cipants with a personal or family (ie, in a first-degree relative) history  of cytochrom e b5 
reductase deficiency (previously called methemoglobin reductase deficiency) or other diseases 
that put them at risk of methem oglobinemia . All participants will be screened for 
methemoglo bin levels pri or to randomizat ion.
Parti cipants wi th a history  of glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD )deficiency or other 
congenital or autoimmune hemo lytic disorders. All participants will be screened for G6PD 
levels prior to randomizat ion.
Prior treatment with an ant i-PD-1 (except if given as adjuvant or neoadj uvant therapy  for 
melano ma), anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA -4 antibody  (except if given as adjuvant or 
neoadj uvant therapy  for melano ma), or any other ant ibody  or drug specifically targeting T -cell 
costim ulation or immune checkpo int pathways
Prior treatm ent wi th BMS -986205 or any  other IDO1 inhibitors

Overall Design:
This is a Phase 3, randomized, study  of BMS -986205 in combinat ion with nivolumab versus 
nivolumab monotherapy  in adult and adolescent participants with unresectable or metastatic 
melano mathat is previously  untreated . (This study was originally double blind with respect to 
BMS -986205 but was unblinded wit h Revised Protocol 01.)
A pre-treatm ent tum or sam ple to determine PD -L1 status i s requi red to be submi tted f rom all 
participants prior to randomizat ion. The sample must be obtained within 3 months prior to 
enrollment from a metastatic tumor lesion or from an unresectable primary tumor lesion; the 
tumor sam ple must be taken from a site of disease that has not been previously  irradi ated. In 
addition, no intervening treatm ent may have been administered between the time of
biopsy/surgery  and rando mizat ion.
Parti cipants m ust have a docum ented BRAF status prior to randomization. 
Depending on the treatm ent arm , the parti cipant will  receive BMS- 986205 pl us nivolumab or 
nivolumab monotherapy for up to 104 weeks (approximately 2years) of study treatment . 
Under Revised Protocol  01, BMS -[ADDRESS_1232702] the option of continuing on nivolumab monotherapy  in 
participants assigned to Arm A (nivolumab + BMS986205) . 
One cycle of treatment is defined as [ADDRESS_1232703] v1.1 criteria, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent/assent, or completion of [ADDRESS_1232704] igator -assessed clinical 
benefit, is tolerating study  treatm ent (see Secti ons 8.1.1 and 8.1.3 .2 of the protocol ), and has

5 STUDY DESIGN
See Secti on 3.1.1 for updates on Study  Desi gn as per Revised Protocol 01. 
5.1 Overall Design
The original  design was a Phase 3, rando mized, double -blind study  of BMS -986205 in 
combinat ion with nivolumab versus nivolumab monotherapy  in adult (18 years of age and ol der, 
or age of majority) participants with unresectable or metastati c melanoma that is previously 
untreat ed.As of 19 -Apr-2018, enrollment in the study  was cl osed (see Sect ion 3.1.1 ).
Parti cipants must have unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma, per the 8th edition of the 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual30(See Appendix 7), and m ust n ot 
have received prior systemic therapy  for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melano ma. 
Prior adj uvant or neoadj uvant therapy  in part icipants wi th previously  com pletely resected disease 
that has now recurred is permitted if this therapy  was completed at least 6 months prior to 
rando mizat ion.

7.2 Method of Treatment Assignment
As of 19 -Apr-2018, enrollment in the study  has been closed. 
All participants will be centrally randomized using an Interacti ve Response Techno logy (IRT). 
Before the study  is initiated, each user will receive log-in information and direct ions on how to 
access the IRT. After the participant’s initial eligibili ty is established and informed consent has 
been obtained, the participant must be enrolled into the study  by [CONTACT_881756]. Every  participant who signs the informed consent form must be assigned a 
participant number in IRT. The invest igator or designee will register the participant for enrollmen t 
by [CONTACT_104126]. The following informat ion is 
requi red for enrollment:
Date thatinformed consent was ob tained
Year of birth
Gender at birth
Once enro lled in IRT, enro lled participants who have met all eligibilit y criteria will be ready to be 
rando mized through the IRT. The fo llowing information is required for participant randomizat ion:
Parti cipant number 
Year of birth 
PD-L1 status (PD-L1 posit ive vs PD-L1 negat ive/indeterminate) entered by [CONTACT_92216] ; PD-L1 
expressio n will be determined using the Dako PD -L1 IHC 28- 8 pharmDx assay.
BRAF V600 m utational status
M Stage at screening (see Appendix 7)
Parti cipants meeting all eligibilit y criteria will be rando mized in a 1:1 ratio and stratified by [CONTACT_4002] -L1 
statu s, BRAF status, and AJCC M stage as described below:
PD-L1 status

7.3 Blinding
Per Revised Protocol 01, the study will be unblinded (see Section 3.1.1).
7.4 Dosage Modification
7.4.1 Nivolumab Dose Modifications
No dose m odificat ions for nivo lumab are permitted.
7.4.2 BMS -986205 Dose Modifications
A dose reduction of BMS -986205 is defined as a change fro m a 100 mg QD tablet to a 50 mg QD 
tablet. 
Doses of BMS -986205 should be reduced for the following AEs attributable to study  therapy  that 
do not otherwise meet criteria for discontinuation:
Grade 3 fat igue, nausea, vo miting, or anemia related to study treat ment
Methemoglobin 15%
Clinically significant elevat ions in methemoglo bin (generally 10%, with a normal hemoglo bin 
level51)with any associ ated Grade 3 AE (hypoxia, dyspnea ,confusio n, etc.) attributable to 
sustained elevat ions of methemoglo bin and not att ributable to another etio logy
QTcF > [ADDRESS_1232745] 60 msec above baseline (See 
Appendix 9)
Dose m odificat ion and interruption of BMS -986205 m ay occur in the setting of lower grade AEs 
and/or be more conservat ive than indicated above based on the clinical judgment of the 
investigator and in consultation with the BMS Medi cal Moni tor/desi gnee. For an AE requiring 
dose modificat ion, BMS -986205 should be delayed to allow improvement of the AE, even if the 
AE does not o therwise meet criteria for dose delay (Section 7.4.3 ).
Re-escalat ion of BMS-986205 will not be permitted once the dose of BMS-986205 h as been 
reduced for a participant.
Revised Protocol No.: 02
Date: 25-Oct-[ADDRESS_1232746] discontinue study  treatments if a 
subsequent dose reduction of BMS -986205 i s required (see Section 8.1.1 ).
7.4.3 Dose Delay (BMS -986205 and Nivolumab)
BMS -986205 and nivo lumab administration should be delayed for the fo llowing:
Grade 2 non -skin, drug -related AE, with the exceptio n of fatigue, nausea, vomit ing and anemia
Grade [ADDRESS_1232747], ALT and/or Total Bilirubin abnormalit ies
Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE
Grade 3 drug -related fat igue, nausea, vo miting, and anemia
Grade 3 drug -related laboratory abnormalit y, with the following except ions: 
Grade 3 lymphopenia or asymptomat ic amylase or lipase elevati ons do not require dose 
delay
Grade [ADDRESS_1232748], ALT, Total Bilirubin will require dose discont inuat ion (see Section8.1.1 )
Any AE, laboratory  abnorm ality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose o f study  medi cation
In addit ion, only BMS -986205 should be delayed for the fo llowing:
Methemoglobin 15%
Clinically significant elevations in methemoglo bin (generally 10% with a normal hemoglo bin 
level51) with any associ ated Grade 3 AE (hypoxia, dyspnea, confusi on, etc.) attributable to 
sustained elevat ions of methemoglo bin and not attributable to another etio logy
QTcF > 500msec confirmed by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1232749] 60 msec above baseline (See 
Appendix 9)
Appendix 14 presents the above criteria in tabular format. 
If nivo lumab dosing is delayed for reasons other than study drug toxicity (eg, administrative issues, 
holidays, etc), BMS -986205 dosing shoul d cont inue uninterrupted.
Parti cipants m ay continue to receive nivo lumab during dose delays of BMS -986205for elevat ions 
of methem oglobin and associ ated events, as well as QTcF prolongat ions.
For participants with methem oglobin elevat ions with associated Grade 3 AEs, if contributi on of 
nivolumab to the associ ated AE cannot be ruled out (eg, a participant with dyspnea in whom 
pneumo nitis has not yet been ruled out), nivolumab dosing shoul d be delayed as well. See 
Secti on7.7.4 for management of m ethem oglobinemia.
If BMS -986205 dosing is delayed, dose reduction may be necessary . See Secti on7.4.2 .
If dosing is resumed after a delay, BMS -986205 may  be resum ed as soon as the criteria to resume 
treatm ent are met (see Secti on7.4.4).Nivo lumab shoul d be resumed as soon as possible after 
criteria to resum e treatm ent are met, but may be resum ed later than BMS -986205 given the 
differences in each drug’s administration.

7.4.4 Criteria to Resume Treatment (BMS -986205 and Nivolumab)
Parti cipants may resum e treatment with study  treatm ents when the drug-related AE(s) resol ve to 
Grade1 or baseline value, with the fo llowing excepti ons:
Parti cipants may  resume treatm ent in the presence of Grade 2 fat igue.
Parti cipants who have not experi enced a Grade 3 drug -related skin AE may  resume treatm ent

7.4.6 Detection of Methemoglobinemia
BMS -986205 may produce a p -chloroaniline metabo lite. P-chloroaniline has been associated with 
the producti on of methem oglobin. Symptom s of methem oglobinemia are related to the lack of 
oxygen delivery  to tissues and are proporti onal to the fraction of methem oglobin, as described 
below for participants with normal hemoglo bin levels. 
Symptom s associ ated wi th elevat ions of methemo globin are as fo llows:
0% to 10% -Usually asymptomat ic
10% to 20% -Cyanosis without other sym ptoms
20% to 50% -Headache, dyspnea, lightheadedness (possibly syncope), weakness, confusio n, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], chest pain
50% to 70% -Coma, seizure s, arrhy thmias ; acidosis
> 70% -Usually death
Note that participants with anemia may experience symptoms at lower methemoglo bin percentages 
than listed above, depending on the degree of anemia. 
Increasing levels of methem oglobin may confound the resul tsof standard pulse oximeters, with 
values of around 85% reported consistent ly as methem oglobin levels increase, regardl ess of the 
true oxy gen saturati on.
When methemoglo binemia is suspected, part of the diagnosti c work -up includes evaluat ion for 
other disorders that can present with a similar clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], including cardiac and pulmo nary 
disease. A fresh peripheral  blood sam ple (either venous or arterial) shoul d be sent for evaluat ion 
of methem oglobin levels; methem oglobin levels may  vary with storage o f blood.  
In this study  methem oglobin testing will be perform ed at screening, at each cycle (for BMS -
986205 treated participants only), and as clinically indicated. For management of 
methemoglo binemia, see Section 7.7.4 .

favorable benefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study treatment, a discussio n between the 
investigator and the Sponsor or designee must occur.
Refer to the Schedule o f Activit ies for data to be collected at the time o f treatment discont inuat ion 
and fo llow-up and for any  further evaluat ions that can be co mpleted.
All part icipants who discont inue study treatment should comply wit h protocol specified fo llow-up 
procedures as outlined in Secti on2. The only excepti on to this requi rement is when a parti cipant 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the 
abilit y to consent freely  (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either 
a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
The assessment for discontinuation of nivolumab shoul d be made separately  from the assessment  
made for discont inuat ion of BMS-986205. Although there is overlap among the discont inuat ion 
criteria, if discontinuat ion criteria are met for BMS -[ADDRESS_1232757] also discont inue BMS -986205.
If a parti cipant receiving nivolumab/BMS -[ADDRESS_1232758] igator is unable to determine whethe r the event is rel ated to both or one study drug, the 
participant shoul d discont inue both nivolumab and BMS -986205 and be taken off the treatm ent 
phase of the study .
If study  treatm ent is di scontinued prior to the participant’s co mpletion of the study , the reason for 
the discont inuat ion must be docum ented in the participant’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate eCRF page.

[IP_ADDRESS] Criteria Required for Treatment Beyond Progression
Parti cipants will be permitted to continue study treatment beyond init ial RECIST v1.1 -defined PD 
(see Appendix 12), a ssessed by [CONTACT_3170], as long as they meet the fo llowing cri teria:
Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit
Tolerance of study  treatm ent
Stabl e performance status
Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases) .
Parti cipant provides written informed consent prior to receiving addit ional study treatm ent. All 
other elements of the main consent including descript ion of reasonably foreseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alternat ive treatment options will st ill apply.
A radiographic assessment/ scan shoul d be perform ed within [ADDRESS_1232766] ivities (Section 2).
For the participants who continue study therapy beyo nd progression, further progression is defined 
as an addit ional 10% increase in tumor burden with a minimum 5 mm abso lute increase from t ime 
of initial PD. This includes an increase in the sum of diameters of all target lesions and/ or the 
Revised Protocol No.: 02
Date: 25-Oct-[ADDRESS_1232767] 10 mm (except for pathologic al lymph nodes which must have a short axis of at least 
15mm). Any new lesio n considered non -measurable at the time of init ial progressio n may beco me 
measurable and therefore included in the tumor burden if the longest diameter increases to at least 
10 mm (except for pathol ogical lymph nodes which must have a short axi s of at least 15 mm). In 
situations where the relative increase in total tumor burden by 10% is solely due to inclusio n of 
new lesions which beco me measurable, these new lesions must dem onstr ate an absol ute increase 
of at least [ADDRESS_1232768] ion of 
outcom e and/or survival follow-up data as requi red and in line with Section2until death or th e

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Study  procedures and timing are summarized in the Schedule of Act ivities(Secti on2). 
Protocol  waivers or exempt ions are not allowed.
All immediate safet y concerns must be discusse d with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue 
treatm ent.
Adherence to the study  design requi rements, including those specified in the Schedule of 
Activities, is essential and requ ired for study  conduct.
All screening evaluat ions must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants m eet all eligibilit y criteria before randomizat ion. The invest igator will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confi rm eligibili ty or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood count) 
and obtained before signing of inform ed consent may be utilized forscreening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -defined criteria and has been performed 
within the t imeframe defined in the Schedule of Activit ies.
Addit ional measures, including non-study  required laboratory  tests, shoul d be performed as 
clinically indicated or to com ply with local regulati ons. Laboratory  toxicities (eg, suspected drug 
induced liver enzyme evaluat ions) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on si te/local 
labs until all study treatment -related toxicit iesresolve, return to baseline, or are deem ed 
irreversible.

If a participant shows pulmonary -related si gns (hypoxi a, fever) or symptoms (eg. dyspnea, cough, 
and fever) consistent with possible pulm onary AEs, the participant shoul d be immediately 
evaluated torule out pulmo nary toxicity, according to the suspected pulmonary  toxicity 
management algorithm in the BMS -936558 (Nivolumab) IB. In addit ion, blood methemoglo bin 
levels should be evaluated to rule out methemoglobinemia (see Section 7.4.6 ) and CBC measured 
to rul e out anemia in part icipants wi th dyspnea .
Some of the assessments referred to in this sect ion may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They 
are intended to be used as safet y monitoring by [CONTACT_173359]. Addit ional testing or 
assessments may be perform ed as clinically  necessary  or wh ere required by [CONTACT_186745].
This study  will consist of three phas es: screening, treatment, and fo llow-up.
Screening Phase:
Begins by [CONTACT_881764]’s initial eligibili ty and signing of the inform ed consent 
form (ICF).
Treatment Phase:
Begins with the rando mizat ion request to the IRT. The participant is randomly assigned to 
either the BMS -986205 + nivolumab arm or the BMS -986205 Plac ebo + nivolumab arm. (Per 
Revised Protocol 01, BMS -986205 Placebo will not be administered in this study. Participants 
in Arm B, may discont inue BMS -986205 and continue treatm ent with nivolumab 
monotherapy ). 
Ends when the part icipant is discontinued fro m study therapy or completes [ADDRESS_1232771] of reasons for treatment discont inuat ion, see Section 8.1.
Follow -Up Phase
Begins when the decisi on to discontinue a participant from study  therapy is made (no further 
treatm ent with study  therapy) or when [ADDRESS_1232772] been collected for all participant s (Secti on8.1.4 ).

9.2 Adverse Events
The definit ions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 3.
AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
participant's legally  authori zed representative). 
The invest igator and any designees are responsible for detecting, docum enting, and reporting 
events that mee t the definit ion of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that 
are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue before complet ing the study. 
Immune-mediated adverse event s (IMAEs) are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism or immune -mediated component for which non -inflammatory  etiologies (eg, infect ion 
or tum or progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an al ternate etiology 
which were exacerb ated by  [CONTACT_186756] y. Informat ion supporting the assessment 
will be co llected on the participant’s case report form.
Contacts for SAE are reporting specified in Appendix 3.
9.2.[ADDRESS_1232773] ivities (Section 2). Non -serious AE informat ion should 
also be collected from  the start of a pl acebo lead -in period or other observat ional period intended 
to establish a baseline status for the participants.
Secti on 5.6 in the IBs for BMS -986205 and nivolumab represents the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation to determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reporting. Following the 
participant’s written consent/assent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study treatm ent, must be collected, including those though t to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures.
All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period and within [ADDRESS_1232774] 
dose of study treatment, except in cases where a study participant has sta rted a new anti -neoplastic 
therapy . However, any SAE occurring after the start of a new treatm ent that is suspected to be 
related to study  treatm ent by  [CONTACT_507992].
Revised Protocol No.: 02
Date: 25-Oct-[ADDRESS_1232775] report any SAE that occurs af ter these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  treatm ent or protocol -specified procedure.
Medical occurre nces that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the appropriate section of the eCRF sect ion.
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as indicated 
in Appendi x 3. 
The invest igator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_1232776] igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant 
has been discharged fro m the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study 
treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the invest igator must prompt ly notify the sponsor.
The method of evaluat ing, and assessing causality  of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for 
completing and reporting/transmitt ing SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3.
9.2.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs
All nonserious adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) sho uld be co llected 
continuously during the treatm ent period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1232777] to whether it is considered 
immune -mediated. For events which are potenti ally immune -mediated, additional informat ion will 
be co llected on the participant’s case report form.
AEs can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, examinat ion, or 
evaluat ion of a  p articipant. (In order to prevent reporting bias, participants shoul d not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs).
9.2.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
Non-serious AEs should be fo llowed to resolut ion or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Appendix 3).
Follow-up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause interrupti on or discont inuat ion of 
study  treatm ent and for those present at the end of study  treatm ent as appropri ate.
 All identified non -serious AEs must be recorded and describe d on the non -serious AE page of 
the CRF (paper or electronic). Com pletion of supplemental  CRFs may be requested for AEs 
and/or laboratory  abnorm alities that are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
After the init ial AE/SAE report, the inves tigator i s requi red to proactively fo llow each parti cipant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non-serious AEs of special interest (as defined in

until the event is otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow-up (as defined in 
Secti on 8.3).
Further informat ion on fo llow-up procedures i s given in Appendix 3.
9.2.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prom pt notificat ion by [CONTACT_193217] y of participants and the safet y of a 
product under clinical investigation are met.
An invest igator who receives an invest igator safety report describing SAEs or other specific 
safet y information (eg, summary  or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will file it along with 
the Invest igator’s Brochure and will notify  the IRB/IEC, if appropri ate according to local 
requi rements.
Sponsor or designee will be reporting AEs to regul atory  authori ties and ethics committees 
according to local applicable laws including European Directive 2001/20/EC and FDA Title 21 
Code of Federal Regulat ions (CFR) Parts 312 and 320. A S[LOCATION_003]R (Suspected, Unexpected Serious 
Adverse React ion) is a su bset of SAEs and will b e reported to the appropriate regul atory  authori ties 
and invest igators following local and glo bal guidelines and requirements.
9.2.[ADDRESS_1232778] (AEOSI) have been defined for this protocol  which requi re 
expedited reporting by  [CONTACT_881765]. These are:
Hem ophagocy tic lymphohist iocytosis (HLH; also known as hist iocytosis haematophagi c)
Drug reaction wit h eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome
These AEOSI, whethe r related or not rel ated to study  drug, m ust be reported to BMS or desi gnee 
within 24 hours of  awareness of the event. These AEOSI are medically important events and are 
therefore considered SAEs. The reporting system for SAEs should be used (see Sect ion 9.2.4 and 
Appendix 3 ).  
As both HLH and DRESS syndrom e may both pose di agnost ic challenges due to varying clinical 
manifestations and signs and symptom s that may overlap with other clinical events.  To assist 
investigators in ident ifying constellat ions of clinical symptoms that may be consistent with one o f 
these diagnoses, standardized scoring criteria are provided in Appendix 15. Formal evaluat ion and 
docum entati onof diagnostic scores based on these system s is not requi red; investigators shoul d 
use their best clinical judgement as informed by [CONTACT_881766] a subject 
has experienced one of these AEOSI.

10.1 Sample S ize Determination 
Per Revised Protocol 01 this section is not applicable. 
The sample size is calculated in order to compare PFS between participants randomized to receive 
BMS -986205 with nivolumab vs nivolumab monotherapy . The number of events requi red is 
simulated based on resul ts from Study  CA209067; this simulat ion resul ted in a median PFS of 
6.9months for nivolumab monotherapy  and 11.8 months for BMS -986205 with nivolumab 
therapy , incorporating 35% of participants with durable response in the combin ed groups, and a 
non-proporti onal hazard resul ting in an effect ive hazard ratio (HR) of approximately 0.73.
Based on these assum ptions, the study  requires at least 365 PFS events to ensure approximately

The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the protocol . The protocol  and any amendme nts 
and the participant informed consent will receive approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n by [CONTACT_54016]/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) , and regul atory  authori ties according to 
applicable local regulat ionsprior to init iation of the study .
All potenti al serious breaches must be reported to Sponsor or designee immediately. A serious
breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connect ion with the study  or the 
protocol , which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the saf ety or physical or mental integrit y 
of the subjects of the study  or the sci entific value of the study.
Personnel involved in conducting this study  will be qualified by [CONTACT_54017], training, and 
experience to perform their respective tasks.
This study  will not use the services of study personnel where sancti ons have been invoked or where 
there has been scient ific misconduct or fraud ( e.g., loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD/INDEPENDENT ETHICS COMMITTEE
Before study  initiation, the invest igator must have written and dated approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n 
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form , participant recruit ment materials (e.g., 
advert isements), and any other written informat ion to be provi ded to subjects. The invest igator or 
BMS shoul d also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the Investigator Brochure or product labeling 
inform ation to be provided to subjects and any  updates. 
The invest igator, Sponsor or designee should provide the IRB/IEC with re ports, updates and other 
inform ation (e.g., expedited safet y reports, amendments, and administrative letters) according to 
regul atory  requi rements or i nstitution procedures.
Revised Protocol No.: 02
Date: 25-Oct-[ADDRESS_1232798] igator should not implement any deviati on or change to the protocol  without prior 
review and docum ented approval /favorabl e opi[INVESTIGATOR_53910]/IEC (and if 
applicable, also by [CONTACT_54018])except where necessary to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) t o study subjects. 
If a deviat ion or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) prior to 
obtaining relevant  approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n(s) the deviat ion or change will be submi tted, as 
soon as possible to:
IRB/IEC for 
Regulato ry Authori ty(ies), if applicable by  [CONTACT_54019] (per nat ional requirements)

If an amendment substant ially alters the study  design or increases the potential risk to the 
participant : (1) the consent form must be revised and submi tted to th e IRB(s)/IEC(s) for review 
and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n; (2) the revised form must be used to obtain consent from subjects 
currently enrolled in the study  if they are affected by [CONTACT_29991]; and (3) the new form must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects prior to enrollment.
If the revisio n is done via an administrative letter, investig ators must inform  their IRB(s)/IEC(s).
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
Invest igators and sub-Invest igators will provi de the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financia l 
inform ation in accordance with local regulati ons to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and 
accura te financial certification or disclosure statem ents to the appropriate healt h authori ties. 
Invest igators are responsible for provi ding information on financial interests during the course of 
the study  and f or [ADDRESS_1232799] ensure that subjects are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other crit ical issues regarding clinical studies in which they  volunteer to participate. 
In situat ions where consent cannot be g iven to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives (as 
per country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other 
critical issues regarding clinical studies in which the participant volunteers to participate. 
Sponsor or designee will provi de the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local) sample
inform ed consent form which will include all elem ents requi red by [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable
regul atory  requirements. The sample inform ed consent form will adhere to the ethical principles 
that have their origin in the Declaration o f Helsinki.
Revised Protocol No.: 02
Date: 25-Oct-[ADDRESS_1232800]:

APPENDIX 3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS : 
DEFINITIONS AND PROC EDURES FOR RECORDING , 
EVALUATING, FOLLOW U P AND REPORTING
ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse Event Definition:
An Adverse Event (AE) i s defined as any  new untoward m edical  occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condit ion in a c linical invest igation partici pant administered study  treatm ent
and that does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship wi th this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use o f study treatment, whether or 
not consi dered rel ated to the study  treatment.
Events Meeting the AE Definition
Any abnorm al laboratory  test results (hematol ogy, clinical chemistry , or urinalysis) or 
resul ts from other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radio logical scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, con sidered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Note that abnormal lab tests or 
other safet y assessments shoul d only be reported as AEs if the final diagnosis is not 
available. Once the final diagnosis is known, the reported term  should be updated to be the 
diagnosis .
Exacerbat ion of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condit ion including eit her an increase 
in frequency and/or intensit y of the condit ion.
New condit ions detected or diagnosed after study interven tion administration even though it 
may have been present before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  intervention 
or a conco mitant medicat ion. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported by [CONTACT_3170]), 
shoul d not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae and 
shoul d specify "intent ional overdose" as the verbatim term
Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy , appendectomy): the condi tion that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admissio n to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

reported).
EVALUATING AES AND S AES
Assessment of Causality
The invest igator i s obligated to assess the rel ationship between study  intervent ion and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.
A “reasonable possibilit y” of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
argum ents to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relat ionship cannot be rul ed out.
The invest igator will use clinical judgment to determine the relat ionship.
Alternat ive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy , and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relat ionship of the event to study interve ntion administratio n 
will be considered and invest igated.
The invest igator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Inform ation, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.
For each AE/SAE, the invest igator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causalit y.
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the invest igator has minima l 
inform ation to include in the init ial report to Sponsor. However, it is very  important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the initial 
transmissio n of the SAE data to Sponsor.
The invest igator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of causalit y in light of follow-up informat ion
and send a SAE fo llow-up report wi th the updated causalit y assessment.
The causalit y assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regul atory  reporting 
requi rements.

Follow -up of AEs and SAEs
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow-up reports are requi red. (Note: Foll ow-

to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitt ing the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilization.
REPORTING OF SAES TO SPONSOR OR DESIGNEE
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  treatment, and pregnancies must be reported 
to BMS (or designee) immediately wit hin 24 hours of awareness of the event.
SAEs m ust be recorded on the SAE Report Form.
The requi red m ethod for SAE data reporting is through the eCRF.

Intrauterine device (IUD)
Bilateral tubal occlusio n
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be u sed. 
Sexual abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to b e evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstine nce must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Section 2. 
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence

APPENDIX 12 RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID TUMORS 
GUIDELINES (VERSION 1.1) WITH BMS MODIFICATIONS
1 EVALUATION OF LESIONS
Solid tumors will be evaluated using Response Evaluat ion Criteria In Solid Tumors versio n 1.1 
(RECIST 1.1)guideline with BMS m odificati ons.1
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categori zed as measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimensi on (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
[ADDRESS_1232806]/MRI scan (scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), or 2x slice thickness if 
greater than 5mm.
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologi cally enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be [ADDRESS_1232807] /MRI scan (scan slice thickness reco mmended 
to be no greater than 5 mm).
Lymph nodes merit special ment ion since they are norm al anatomical structures which may be 
visible by [CONTACT_33490]. Pathol ogical  nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be ident ified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a  short axis of 
15mm by [CONTACT_4654] /MRI scan. Only  the short axi s of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
The short axis of the node is the diameter norm ally used by [CONTACT_48861] a node is 
involved by  [CONTACT_54037]. Nodal  size is norm ally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which 
the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of 
acquisit ion may be axial, sagi ttal or coronal ). The smaller of these measures is the short axi s. For 
example, an abdo minal node which is reported as being 20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis o f 20mm 
and qualifies as a malignant, m easurable node. In this example, 20 mm  should be recorded as the 
node measurement. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis 10 mm but < 15 mm) 
shoul d be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered 
non-patho logical and should not be recorded or fo llowed.
Note: Lesi ons on X -Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non -Target Lesions.
1.2 Non-Measurable
All other lesions are considered non-measurable, including small lesio ns (longest diameter 
<10mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to < 15 mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions. Lesio ns considered truly non-measurable include: leptomeningeal 
disease, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdo mina l 
masses/abdo minal organomegaly  identified by [CONTACT_54038].
Note: Lesi ons on X -Ray are not to be selected as Target or Non -Target Lesions.

1.3 Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
1.3.1 Bone lesions
Bone scan, PET scan and plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techni ques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesio ns. 
Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic-blast ic lesions, wit h identifiable softtissue components , that 
can be evaluated by  [CONTACT_198277] y 
described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.
1.4 Baseline Documentation Of ‘Target’ And ‘Non -Target’ Lesions
When more than one measurable lesio n is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum  of five 
lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all invo lved organs should 
be ident ified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline (this means in 
instances where patients have only one or two organ sites involved a maximum of two and four 
lesions respect ively will be recorded).
Note: A maximum o f two l esions can be selected per organ system . For example, a maximum o f 
two lung lesio ns can be selected (selected from one lung or one lesio n fro m each). A maximum o f 
two lymph nodes can be selected at baseline, as the lymphatic system is considered one organ.
Target l esionsshoul d be selected on the basis of their size (l esions wi th the longest di ameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in additi on shoul d be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated m easurem ents. It m ay be the case that, on occasi on, the largest lesio n does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which 
can be measured reproducibly should be selected.
A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal  lesions, short axis for nodal  lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axi s is added into the sum . The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as ref erence to f urthe r characteri ze any objective tum or regressi on in 
the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including patho logical lymph nodes shoul d be identified as 
non-target lesions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measure ments are not required and 
these lesions shoul d be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ 
(more details to foll ow). In addi tion, it is possible to record m ultiple non-target l esions involving 
the same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ 
or ‘m ultiple liver m etastases’).

2. RESPONSE CRITERIA
2.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance o f all target lesio ns. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether targ et or non -target) m ust have reduct ion in short axi s to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  diameters of target l esions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study ). In addi tion to the rel ative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an abso lute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
Not Evaluable (NE): If one or more target lesions cannot be measured or adequately assessed 
as either fully resolved or too sm all to measure (due to missing or poor quali ty images), and 
the sum of diameters of the remaining measured target lesions (if any) has not increased 
sufficient ly to meet Progressive Disease as defined above. 
2.1.1 Special Notes on the Assessment of Target Lesions
[IP_ADDRESS] Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes ident ified as target lesions shoul d always have the actual short axis measurement 
recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examinati on), even if the nodes 
regress to below 10 mm o n study. This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, 
the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if compl ete response criteriaare met, since a norm al 
lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < [ADDRESS_1232808] achieve a short axis < 10 mm . For PR, SD and 
PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesio ns.
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’
While on study , all lesions (nodal  and non-nodal )recorded at baseline shoul d have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluat ion, even when very small (eg,2 mm). 
However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline 
beco me so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact 
measure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important 
that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] o f the radio logist that the lesion 
has likely disappeared, the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm . If the lesi on is believed to 
be present and is faint ly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned
as the ref erence diameter. (Note: It is less likely tha t this rule will be used for lymph nodes since 
they usually  have a definable size when normal and are frequent ly surrounded by [CONTACT_104178]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too 
small to m easure, a def ault value of  5 mm shoul d be assigned in this circumstance as well). This 
Revised Protocol No.: 02
Date: 25-Oct-[ADDRESS_1232809] slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying 
CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potenti ally non-reproducible, therefore 
provi ding this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement 
error. To rei terate, however, if the radi ologist i s able to provi de an actual  measure, that shoul d be 
recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.
[IP_ADDRESS] Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment
When non-nodal  lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions shoul d be 
added together to calculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between 
them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each 
individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the 
vector of the longest diameter in this instance shoul d be the maximal longest diameter for the 
‘coal esced lesio n’.
2.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions
This section provides the defini tions of the criteria used to de termine the tumor response for the 
group of non -target lesio ns. While some non -target lesio ns may actually be measurable, they nee d 
not be measured and instead shoul d be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in 
the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target l esions. All lymph nodes must be 
non-patho logical in size (< 10mm short axis). 
Non-CR/Non- PD: Persistence of one or more non -target l esion(s)
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of exist ing non -target l esions.
2.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment of Progression of Non -Target Disease
The concept of progression of non -target di sease requi res addi tional explanati on as fo llows:
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient also has measurable disease
In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal progressi on’ on the basis of the non-target disease, there 
must be an overall level o f substant ial worsening in non -target di sease such that, even in presence 
of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion of therapy A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesio ns is 
usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal  progressi on status. Pleural  effusions, pericardial 
effusio ns and ascites will not be fo llowed as target or non -target l esions and will not contribute to 
response or progression. The designati on of overall progressi on solely on the basis of change in 
non-target di sease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
[IP_ADDRESS] When the patient has only non -measurable disease
This circumstance arises in so me trials when it is not a criterion of study entry to have measurable 
disease. The same general  concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is 
no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretati on of an increase in non -measurable 
disease burden. Because worsening in non -target disease canno t be easily quant ified (by [CONTACT_154020]:

if all lesio ns are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for 
unequivocal progressi on is to consider if the increase in overall  disease burden based on the change 
in non-measur able disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be requi red to 
declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden represent ing an addit ional 73% 
increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). 
Examples include, an increase in lymphangit ic disease from localized to widespread, or may be 
described as ‘sufficient to requi re a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal  progressi on’ is seen, the 
patient shoul d be considered to have had ove rall PD at that point. While it woul d be i deal to have 
objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it 
impossible to do so; therefore the increase must be substant ial.
2.2.2 New Lesions
The appearance of new malign ant lesions denotes di sease progressi on; therefore, some comments 
on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the identificat ion of 
new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: ie, not 
attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought 
to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesio ns may be simply 
healing or flare of pre -exist ing lesio ns). This is parti cularl y important when the pat ient’s baseline 
lesions show partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesio n may be reported 
on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cyst ic lesio n, which it is not.
NOTE: Fluid collect ions (pleural  effusio ns, pericardia l effusi ons, and ascites) will not be 
considered new lesio ns and will not contribute to response or progression. In the event a new fluid 
collect ion is seen on a post -baseline imaging exam, a comment m ay be made, but the appearance 
of a new fluid collect ion alone shoul d not resul t in an assessment of Progressive Di sease (PD). A 
lesion ident ified on a follow-up study  in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline 
is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the pat ient 
who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered which 
reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of PD even if 
he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline. A lesion ident ified on Chest X-Ray that was not 
present in prior CT can be considered a new lesio n and will result in Progressive Disease (PD).
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of it s small size, continued fo llow-up evaluat ion 
will clarify  if itrepresents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely  a  new 
lesion, then progressi on shoul d be declared using the date of the initial scan. While FDG -PET 
response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorpo rate the use of 
FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (parti cularly 
possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be ident ified according 
to the following algorithm:
1.Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesio n.
2.No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow-up: If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confi rmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive 
Revised Protocol No.: 02
Date: 25-Oct-[ADDRESS_1232810] scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that si te (if so, the 
date of  PD will be the date of  the initial abnorm al FDG-PET scan). If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow-up corresponds to a pre -exist ing site of disease on CT that i s not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
2.[ADDRESS_1232811] response recorded, taking into account any requirement for 
confirmat ionand censoring rules regarding subsequent therapy . The patient’s best overall response
assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the study 
and the protocol requirements, it may  also requi re confi rmatory measurement.

aNon-CR/no n-PD is preferred over SD for non -target disease since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for

2.3.[ADDRESS_1232813] response determination of complete or partial response requi res confirmation: Complete or 
partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point of 
4 weeks (28 days) later. In thi s circumstance, the best ov erall response can be interpreted as in 
Table 2.3.[ADDRESS_1232814] scheduled follow-up imaging visit is Week 6 (± 7 days) for a particular 
protocol , a Best Response of SD can only be made after the subject is on -study  for a minimum  of 
6 weeks (42 days) minus 7 days, for an absolute minimum time on-study  of 35 days from the 
reference start date (reference date is considered Day 1 on study).  If the subject is not on -study 
for at least this amount of time, any tumorassessment indicat ing stable disease before this time 
period will have a Best Response of NE unless PD is ident ified.
Special note on response assessment: When nodal disease is included in the sum o f target lesio ns 
and the nodes decrease to ‘norm al’ size (< 10 mm), they  may still have a measurement reported 
on scans. This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to 
overstate progression shoul d it be based on increase in size of the nodes. As noted earlier, this 
means tha t pati ents wi th CR m ay not have a total  sum  of ‘zero’ on the case report form (CRF).

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting P R 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best 
response would depend on w hether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed 
when subsequent scans suggest s mall lesions were likely still present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the 
first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR .
2.3.4 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: To be assi gned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor m easurements 
must be confi rmed by [CONTACT_54042] [ADDRESS_1232815] met. Subsequent documentation of a CR 
may pro vide confirmation o f apreviously ident ified CR even wit h an intervening NE or PR (e.g., 
CR NE CRor CR PR CR). Subsequent documentati on of a PR may provi de confirmati on of a
previously ident ified PR even with an intervening NE or SD (e.g., PRNE PR or PR SD PR). 
However, only one (1) intervening time point will be allowed between PR /CRs for confirmat ion.
Verification of Progression :Progressi on of disease should be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal. If repeat scans confirm PD, t hen progressio n should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan. If repeat scans do not confirm PD, then the subject is considered to not have 
progressive disease.

STUDY DESIGN:  This is a prospective, randomized, vehicle -controlled, double -blind, 3 -arm 
parallel assignment study assessing the 
safety, tolerability, and efficacy of B244 
delivere d as an intranasal spray for 
preventive treatment in subjects with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730].  
This study will enroll 303 subjects.  
Enrolled subjects will undergo a 28 day 
baseline period to establish baseline 
headache frequency and characteristics.  
Subjects will be randomized at the end of 
the baseline period.  Randomization will 
be 1:1:1 so that equal number of subjects 
will be trea ted in each Arm of the study.   
Subjects will be trained for in -home 
treatment/assessment  on the use of the 
nasal spray, and apply  their first dose of 
treatment under the supervision of study 
personnel on site. Subjects will remain 
under observation at the  study site for [ADDRESS_337811] dosing. Subjects will then be 
dispensed study medication for 12 weeks  
of at home dosing  (either 1x109 cell/ml; 
4x109 cells/ml; or vehicle) . While at 
home, subjects will dose twice daily (am 
and pm)  for 12 weeks  during the 
preven tion treatment phase . Subjects will 
be asked to visit the site every 4 weeks 
during the 12 week treatment period and 4 
week follow -up.   
Daily assessments will be made during the 12 week double-blind treatment period for

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  Sample Size: Group sample sizes of 88 per arm achieve 80% power  to reject the 
null hypothesis of equal means when the 
population mean difference is μ 1 - μ2 = -
3.8 - -2.3 = -1.5, where μ 1 = -3.8 is the 
mean reduction in migraine headache days 
for an active treatment arm and μ 2 = -2.[ADDRESS_337822]

comparison of each active trea tment arm 
versus vehicle .  
Safety : The analysis of safety will be 
based on the safety population, which is 
defined as all subjects receiving at least 1 
dose of B244 or Vehicle. Adverse events 
(AEs) will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA®) for purposes of 
summarization. All AEs occurring during 
the study will be included in by -subject 
data listings and tabulated. Events leading 
to death, serious AEs, and events resulting 
in study discontinuation will be 
summarized using standard descriptive 
statistics, and presented by [CONTACT_2939]. 
Exposure to study drug and reasons for 
discontinuation of study treatment will be 
tabulated. Shift tables relative to the 
normal range will be provided for 
laboratory parameters.  Additional 
analyses will be performed, if warranted, 
upon review of the data.  
Efficacy : Efficacy analyses will be 
performed on the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population, which consists of all 
randomized subjects  who receive  at least 
1 dose of study medication , and on the per 
protocol (PP) population, which consists 
of subjects who complete their Week 12 
visit and ha ve percent compliance ≥  50% 
(based on the weight of IP used).  For the 
continuous endpoints of the change in 
migraine days, the change in migraine 
attacks, the change in days using rescue 
medication, the change in headache days, 
the change in headache hours, and the 
change in MIDAS , HIT -6, MSQL , and 
CGI scores, a one -sided two -sample 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
MGB244 -001 Amendment 2  (22Jun 2018). AOBiome, LLC  Page [ADDRESS_337824] will be used to compare treatment group means.  Fisher ’s 
Exact test will be used to make treatment 
group comparisons on efficacy outcomes 
including  the following binary outcomes:  
• Proportion of subjects 
experiencing a ≥50%, ≥75%, and 
100% reduction in monthly 
migraine days from baseline to 12 
weeks of treatmen t. 
Exploratory : Exploratory endpoints will 
be analyzed using the same method as for 
continuous efficacy endpoints. The 
analyses will be performed on the ITT and 
PP population.

2.1 Background 
Migraine is a chronic, recurrent disorder affecting an estimated 37 million Americans.   Migraine 
is marked by [CONTACT_276930] 
4-72 hours, typi[INVESTIGATOR_276895] , is often accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], vomiting, and 
sensitivity to light or sound, and is sometimes preceded by [CONTACT_276931].  Around 12% of adults have epi[INVESTIGATOR_17730] (headaches on less than 15 days per 
month) [ 3], while around 1% of the adult popul ation suffers from migraine and headaches on 
more days than not [ 4], a condition te rmed chronic migraine.  In addition, during a migraine 
attack, individuals experience impaired health -related quality of life and c onsiderable disability 
[5, 6].  
The treatment of migraine con sists of acute/abortive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_276896].  The 
acute treatment of migraine includes most commonly, migraine -specific medications such as 
triptans and ergotamines which, while effective in a majority of cases may be limited by [CONTACT_276932], the development of medication overuse/rebound and some contraindications including 
cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease and hypertension.  P reventive 
treatments include four medications approved by [CONTACT_276933]: anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_276897]; and beta-adrenergic blockers propranolol and 
timolol.  These drugs are not disease-specific and are plagued by a plethora of tolerance issues 
including cognitive side effects, weight loss or weight gain, depression, hypotension, etc., and 
therefore adherence t o therapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_276898].   Botulinum Toxin A is approved for the narrow 
indication of chronic migraine prevention but is expensive and requires multiple injections in the 
face, scalp and neck.  In addition,  nearly half of individuals with epi[INVESTIGATOR_276899] [ 7].  
 
Current models for the etiology of migraine headaches support the role of cortical spreading 
depression (CSD) and activation of the trigeminovascular system and its constituent 
neuropeptides, as well as about the importance of neuronal and glial ion channels and 
transporters that contribute to the putative cortical excitatory/inhibitory imbalance that renders 
migrain eurs susceptible to an attack [ 8].  It is our hypothesis that under conditions of stress, 
cortical and trigeminovascular cells have reduced  cellular ATP levels as a result of ischemic 
preconditioning.  Intranasal administration of ammonia oxidizing bacteria ( AOB ) delivers 
physiologic levels of nitric oxid e (NO) to these tissues through the oxidation of mucosal 
ammo nia.  It has been demonstrated [ 9] that increases in NO result in corresponding increases in 
cellular ATP levels though a soluble Guanylyl Cyclase (sGC) intermediate.  Increased cellular 
ATP availa bility supports Na+/K+ ATPase function necessary to maintain membrane electrical 
stability, reducing the risk of excitatory/inhibitory imbalance and subsequent cortical spreading 
depression [ 10].   
It is believed that intranasal AOB will restore physiologic levels of NO which reduce or reset the 
effects of stress induced ischemic preconditioning and subsequent cortical spreading d epression 
associated with migraine s. NO is also believed to modulate pain involving nociceptor inhibition 
and central sensitization. M igraine is an inflammatory state as observed by [CONTACT_276934], degranulation of mast cells, and

AOBs  are essential for the initial step in environmental nitrification processes, specifically the 
oxidation of amm onia (NH 3) to nitrite (NO 2-). Nitrosomonas  are Gram -negative 
chemolithoautotrophic betaproteobacteria that obtain energy solely from NH 3 oxidation, while 
fixing CO 2 for their carbon needs [11]. Oxidation of NH 3 proceeds in two steps ( Figure 1 ) 
leading to sequential generation of hydroxylamine (NH 2OH) and NO 2- that require two enzyme 
complexes: the membrane -bound ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) comprised of subunits 
AmoA, AmoB and AmoC; and the periplasmic NH 2OH oxidoreductase (HAO). In addition to 
high NO 2- levels, NH 3 oxidation leads to nitric oxide (NO) and N 2O production through two 
independent pathways downstream of NH 2OH production: nitrifier denitrification and NH 2OH 
oxidation [12]. 
 
B244 is a purified a strain of Nitrosomonas eutropha , designated D23, originally isolated from 
soil samples. S equencing of the B244 genome revealed a distinct genetic profile from that of 
other published Nitros omonas  strains and AOB genomes. Based on in vitro  co-culture studies, 
B244 was able to reduce survival of pathogenic bacteria. Nitrite generation from ammonia 
concurrently with medium acidification by B244 led to strong antibacterial effects and a marked 
reduction (~100- fold) in viable counts of methicillin -resistant Staphylcoccus aureus and 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa , two pathogens frequently isolated from infected skin and wound sites. 
In contrast, control cultures with B244 in the absence of ammonium or with heat-killed B244 
supplemented with ammonium, had no antibacterial effects. The unique metabolic and 
antimicrobial activity of Nitrosomonas , in combination with their lack of virulence render these 
bacteria as attractive candidates for topi[INVESTIGATOR_276900]. 
NO-releasing drugs or NO donors have also shown activity against Propi[INVESTIGATOR_276901], anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibition of lipogenesis by [CONTACT_134755]-
stimulated immortal sebocytes  [13-15].  
To date, ther e have been no reported infections or health risks associated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_276902].  The absence of any illnesses attributed to these bacteria 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_276903] a minimal health risk, if any at all.  
Infection or tissue damage by [CONTACT_276935], because the sequenced genomes of 
several Nitrosomonas  and other AOB lack genes encoding cytotoxins, or other known bacterial 
virulence factors.  Further, AOB are slow growing, as compared to most heterotrophic bacteria,

limited by [CONTACT_276936] 27 moles NH 3/mole CO 2 fixed.  
Due to their dependence on ammonia for their growth, the numbers of Nitrosomonas  on the skin 
will be necessarily limited and naturally regulated by [CONTACT_276937] o f ammonia produced in sweat. 
This would ensure that the amount of nitrite and NO generated would be relatively low, without 
any adverse effects.  
Currently, Nitrosomonas eutropha  D23 in buffer at a concentration of 1x109 cells/mL  is 
available as a cosmetic product for  topi[INVESTIGATOR_276904] a natural source of AOB and NO/NO 2

diluted in storage solution (50 mM Na 2HPO 4 and 2 mM MgCl 2, pH 7.6)  at defined doses to be 
provided as an intranasal spray (B244)  for therapeutic applications . 
B244 is being developed under IND #[ZIP_CODE] as a ‘live topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’ to provide a natural source of 
AOB and NO/NO 2 to the human skin.   Under IND #[ZIP_CODE], a phase 1b/[ADDRESS_337835] (IP) over [ADDRESS_337836] been no attributable drug related SAEs

[CONTACT_276943]. The study  will be explained with 
the opportunity for the participant to ask questions. If a participant wishes to e nter the study, a 
consent form will be completed and signed.  
7.2 Screening for Eligibility   
Informed consent will be obtained  prior to any scree ning assessments.  Screening assess ments 
(Visit 1; V1) will be performed within 2 weeks ( -14 days) prior to the Basel ine visit (V2) and 
will include: medical history and medication use , complete physical examinati on including 
height, weight, vital signs , and [ADDRESS_337847] be completed and reviewed to 
confirm that partici pants meet all eligibility criteria before entering baseline period on Day -28. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed at Screening (V1) , Baseline visit (V2) , and 
Randomi zation visit (V3)  to make sure nothing changed.   Enrolled s ubject s will be asked to 
undergo a 4 week  (Day -28 to 0) baseline  period .   
 
Eligible subjects  will return to clinic on Day -28 (V2) for baseline assessments and will be sent 
home to record their migraine events  and acute migraine medication use  over the 28 day baseline 
period  using a diary . Subjects will return to clinic on Day 0 (V3) for randomization  upon 
confirming continued eligibility .  Subjects are randomized at V3 upon confirming the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and the entry criteria of 4 -14 migraine headache days and 80% diary 
compliance during the baseline period . 
 
For subjects who do not meet the 80% daily diary compliance but otherwise meet the 4 -14 
migraine days requirement d uring the baseline period , they can be provided additional 
opportunities  to meet the 80% diary compliance requirement to enable continued eligibility for 
randomization .  The following allowances can be made per investigator judgement on a case by 
[CONTACT_276944] s: 
• If the anticipated diary compliance is slightly less than 80%  or short by 4 daily 
diary entries by [CONTACT_276945], subjects can enter up to 4 
additional days of diary entries (over the ±3 day visit window specified in the 
schedule of events in the protocol) as part of the baseline period and reschedule 
the randomization visit immediately after this period.  This provides up to 7 
additional days of dia ry entries  to fulfill compliance.  Twenty -eight  days prior to 
the new rando mization visit day can be re -evaluated for the baseline period.   
• If the anticipated diary compliance is short by [CONTACT_726]  4 daily diary entries by 
[CONTACT_276945], the investigator has the option to  shift the 
baseline period (i.e.,  reset) to a randomization visit date that allows subjects to 
record the additional days of diary entries that fulfills 80% compliance and resets 
the baseline period 4 weeks back from the new randomization visit day.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
MGB244 -001 Amendment 2  (22Jun 2018). AOBiome, LLC  Page 31 of 85 • The investigator has the option to request subjects to repeat the baseline period

A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of t he Investigator.  
 
Reasons for withdrawal (participants who refuse to complete any remaining study visits) or 
discontinuation (participants who prematurely stop the application) at any time during the study 
may include, but are not limited, to the following: 
 
● For safety reasons, either at the discretion of the Investigator or at the participant’s 
request  
● For protocol violations at the discretion of AOBiome 
● Due to concomitant therapy that could interfere with the results of the study (the

The Investigator m ay unblind a participant’s treatment assignment only in the case of emergency 
or in the event of a serious medical condition when knowledge of the study treatment is essential 
for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant, as determ ined by [CONTACT_3786]. It is preferred (but not required) that the Investigator first contacts the medical 
monitor to discuss options before unblinding the participant’s treatment assignment. The 
Investigator must notify the Sponsor as soon as possible when a participant’s treatment 
assignment is unblinded without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded participant 
unless that information is deemed important for the safety of participants currently in the study. 
The date and reason for the un blinding must be documented in the participant’s study record.  
 
The Medical Monitor  may unblind the treatment  assignment for any participant  with an SAE. If 
the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory  report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, 
a copy of the report, identifying the  participant ’s treatment assig nment, may be sent to clinical 
Investigators in accordance with  local regulations and/or sponsor  policy.

11 METHODS OF ASSESSMENTS  
11.1 Blood Pressure Measurement  
Blood pressure readings will be obtained at every visit as described in Appendix A  (schedule of 
events)  preferably during standardized times across sites (e.g., mornings). Subject should be 
asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of cuff placement. The individual should be 
comfortably seated  in the chair, with the legs uncrossed, and the back and arm supported, such 
that the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium (the mid -point of 
the sternum). Neither the patient nor the observer should talk during the measurement. After 5 
minutes sitting, serial clinic BP measurements and heart (x3) rate will be performed, using the 
non-dominant arm with a calibrated electronic sphygmomanometer. The average of the second 
and third readings will be documented. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (number of breaths per minute) will also 
be recorded.  
11.2 Brief P hysical Examinations  
Brief physical examination will be performed at Screening  (V1), Baseline (beginning of 4 week 
baseline period; V2), Randomization (end of 4 week baseline period; V3), Prevention Treatment

Up Week 16 (End of Study; V7), and a t Unanticipated /Early Termination  Visit should one occur. 
The physical examination includes an assessment of general appearance and a review of systems 
(dermatologic, head, eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
cardiovascu lar, gastrointestinal, extremities, musculoskeletal, neurologic systems).  
11.3 Neurological Examinations  
As part of the physical examination at each visit , a neurological examination will be performed 
for assessment of sensory neuron and motor responses, especially reflexes, to determine whether 
the nervous system is impaired.  
11.4 Blood Collection for Biomarkers 
In addition to the blood drawn for the safety laboratory assessments, additional whole blood will 
be collected for the biomarker analysis at Randomization (end of 4 week baseline period; V3), 
Prevention Treatment Week 4 (V4), Prevention Treatment Week 8 (V5), Prevention Treatment 
Week 12 (V6), and Follow-Up Week 16 (End of Study; V7) according to Appendix A .  Samples 
will also be collected in  the event of an Unanticipated /Early Termination  Visit.  
 
Appr oximately [ADDRESS_337873] 8 hrs before blood for biomarkers is drawn. 
 
Samples will be processed to se rum and plasma  on site and stored at -80 ○C until shipment to a 
designated central lab for biostorage and may be evaluated for select biomarkers that may 
include several of the following as well as others : 
 
1. Inflammatory cytokines/chemokines/ immune cell markers /neuropeptides : IL-1beta, IL-2, 
IL-4, IL -5, IL -6, IL -8, IL-9, IL-10, IL -12p40, IL -12p70 , IL-13, IL-15, IL -16, IL-17, IL-

beta-tryptase, histamine, C3a/C4a/C5a, LTC4, MMP9, CGRP  
11.5 12-Lead ECG  
12-lead ECG will be taken at Screening (V1), Randomization  (end of 4 week baseline period; 
V3), and Prevention Treatment Week 12 (V6).  Standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed 
accor ding to the site SOPs. ECGs should be performed after the subject has been resting supi[INVESTIGATOR_243332] ≥ [ADDRESS_337874] leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the 
bottom of the tracing. The ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The following 
ECG parameters will be collected: PR interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc interval 
(QTcB; Bazett‟s correction). All ECGs must be evaluated by a qualified physician for the 
presence of abnormalities.

panel, complete blood count (CBC) , clinical chemistry , lipid panel, and liver fun ction test .  
Approximately 15 ml of whole blood will be drawn.  Urinalysis will be performed as part of 
safety labs.  Laboratory assessments will be made at Screening (V1), Randomization  (end of 4 
week baseline period; V3), Prevention Treatment Week 12 (V6 ), and at Unanticipated /Early 
Termination  Visit should one occur. 
 
Blood samples should be taken using standard venipuncture techniques. Blood sampling will be 
performed according to the site SOPs. 
 
The following laboratory variables will be determined:  Fasting glucose, Uric acid, BUN (blood 
urea nitrogen), Creatinine, BUN/creatinine ratio, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtr ation rate), 
Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Calcium, Total protein, Bicarbonate, Albumin, Bilirubin,  Alkaline 
phosphatase, AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine transaminase), total cholesterol, 
HDL, LDL, triglycerides, CBC  (standard panel including RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
platelets , and WBC, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils), and 
proteinurea.  
 
Any value outside the normal range (except those affected by [CONTACT_276951]) will be flagged for the 
attention of the Investigator or designee at the site. The Investigator or designee will indicate 
whether or not the value is of clinical significance. If the result of the clinical chemistry test from 
the samples taken during the screening phase is indicated as clinically significant, the study 
subject will NOT be allowed into the study.  
11.[ADDRESS_337877]  urine pregnancy testing will be performed on WOCBP as part of screening. 
11.9 Nasal Fluid  Samples  for Biomarkers  
Nasosorption with synthetic absorptive matrices (SAM) have been used to sample nasal mucosal 
lining fluid  [16].  This technique can be considered as “precision mucosal sampling”, since it 
samples directly from the respi[INVESTIGATOR_276910], and is free from the salivary contamination that 
occurs in breath and sputum sampling. Nasosorption sampling involves manipulating the 
synthetic absorptive matrix (SAM) up the lumen of the nasal cavity, and then holding it in 
position against the mucosa by [CONTACT_276952]. This is more comfortable and less 
invasive than using a conventional swab, where rotation against the m ucosal surface is generally 
required.  
Nasosorption will be performed by [CONTACT_276953] a hydrophilic polyester absorptive matrix

may be placed back in to its container and frozen at −80°C until shipment to a designated central 
lab for biostorage, elution, and testing.  After shipment to a designated lab, SAM strips will be 
washed in PBS buffer pH 7.4 (100 μl) containing BSA (1%) and Triton X 100 (1%) within the 
cup of a spin filter insert (Costar® Spin-X®). Mucosal lining fluid will be then eluted from the 
SAM by [CONTACT_276954] (5 min at 16,000G at 4 °C), left and right nostril samples 
combined, and aliquots tested for biomarkers to evaluate the immune response. 
Nasal fluid for biomarkers will be collected at Randomization  (end of 4 week baseline period; 
V3), Prevention Treatment Week 4 (V4), Prevention Treatment Week 8 (V5), Prevention 
Treatment Week 12 (V6), and Follow-Up Week 16 (End of Study; V7) according to Appe ndix 
A.  Samples will also be collected in the event of an Unanticipated /Early Termination  Visit. 
 
Samp les may be evaluated for select biomarkers that may include several of the following as

Optionally, samples may be evaluated for nasal microbiome (e.g., PCR) to confirm p resence of 
B244. 
11.10  Study Diary  
Subjects will be asked to fill out a daily migraine -history diary from screening to treatment with 
study drug and a migraine-treatment diary from treatment through the remainder of the follow-up 
period.  Study diary will be  electronic using an electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) 
device.  
 
Study diary entries will be daily and will include recording of migraine frequency, duration, and 
severity  that includes information on migraine days (experiencing migraine with or without aura

include, but are not limited, to the following: 
 
● For safety reasons, either at the discretion of the Investigator or at the subject’s request 
● For protocol violations at the discretion of AOBiome 
● Due to concomitant therapy that could interfere with the results of the study (the 
Investigator will report all such information on the CRFs and decide, in accordance with 
AOBiome, whether the subject is to be withdrawn).  
All premature discontinuations and their causes must be carefully documented by [CONTACT_276958].   
 
If, for any reason, a subject is withdrawn before completing the final visit, the reason for 
termination will be entered on the CRF.  All data gathered on the subject prior to termination will 
be made available to AOBiome. Subjects not completing the entire study should be fully 
evaluated when possible.  The appropriate CRFs should be completed. 
 
If the subject chooses to withdraw before completing the study, the subject should notify the

14 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Sample Size  
Approximately 303 subjects will be enrolled in order to achieve a target sample size of 264 (i.e., 
88 subjects per arm), allowing for a 10 -15% drop -out rate.   
 
Group  sample sizes of 88 per arm achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of equal 
means when the populatio n mean difference is μ 1 - μ2 = -3.8 - -2.3 = -1.5, where μ 1 = -3.8 is the 
mean reduction in migraine headache days for an active treatment arm and μ 2 = -2.[ADDRESS_337889] 
deviation for both groups of 4.0 and a Bonferroni adjusted significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_337890].  Testing each active treatment arm versus 
vehicle at an adjusted significance level of 0.05 maintains an overall error rate of 0.10.

The Investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and SAEs 
during scheduled safety evaluations and whenever such information is brought to their attention. 
This section of the protoc ol provides definitions and detailed procedures to be followed.  
15.[ADDRESS_337898].  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an abnormal 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated), whether or not related to the investigational product 
(IP).   
 
Examples of an AE include:  
● Exacerbation of a pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or 
intensity of the condition.  
● New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
● Signs, symptoms of a drug interaction.  
● Signs, symptoms of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concurrent 
medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE/SAE).  
AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events t hat occur as a result of protocol -mandated 
procedures (i.e., modification of participant’s previous therapeutic regimen).

(a) results in death.  
(b) is life -threatenin g. 
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more se vere.

NOTE:  Th e term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor 
medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions

appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10913].  These should also be considered serious.  Examples 
of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room

documented.  Changes in intensity or frequency of AEs should be recorded as sepa rate events 
(i.e., a new record started).  
 
The recording of AEs and SAEs are described in Section 15.4  (“Recording of AEs and SAEs”). 
15.4 Recording of AEs and SAEs 
All clinical events, including either observed or volunteered problems, complaints or symptoms 
are to be recorded on the Adverse Events page(s) of the CRF.  The need to capture this 
information is not dependent upon whether the clinical event is associated with study treatment. 
Adverse clinical events resulting from concurrent illnesses or reactions to concurrent 
medications are also to be recorded.  In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions, the AE should be recorded in standard medical terminology rather than the 
participant’s own words. 
 
Each adverse clinical event is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, and whether the event may 
be associated with the investigational product (IP) or other causes.  Start and stop dates, 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
MGB244 -001 Amendment 2  (22Jun 2018). AOBiome, LLC  Page [ADDRESS_337901] (IP), medical management, and alternative causality of 
event must be recorded in the Adverse Events section of the CRF.  AEs believed to be possibly 
related to investigational product (IP) must be followed until resolution. 
15.5 Evaluating AEs and SAEs  
15.5.1  Severity Rating  
The severity of an adverse event (AE and SAE) is to be scored according to the following 
scale:  Mild Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated Moderate Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity  
 Potentially Life 
Threatening  
 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  Fatal Death related to AE  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE.  An event is defined as 
‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre-defined outcomes as described in Section 15.2  
“Definition of a SAE”.  
15.5.[ADDRESS_337902] (IP)  
SAEs will be classified as “definitely not related ”, “unlikely related ”, “possibly related ”, 
“probably related ”, or “definitely related ” (including unknown).  
 
For AEs , the relationship to study treatment is to be assessed according to the following 
definitions: 
 
Definitely not related:  The AE is definitely not related to the drug.  This designation 
should be reserved for those events which occur prior to study treatment or for those 
events which cannot be even remotely related to study participation (e.g., injuries 
sustained in an automobile accident). 
Unlikely related:  There is no reasonable association between the study treatment and the 
suspected event and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_2299] 's clinical state 
or other modes of therapy administered to the participant. 
CONFIDENTIAL  
MGB244 -001 Amendment 2  (22Jun 2018). AOBiome, LLC  Page 60 of 85 Possibly related:   The suspected adverse event may or may not follow a reasonable 
temporal sequence from study treatment administration but seems to be the type of 
reaction that cannot be dismissed as unlikely.  The event could have been produced or 
mimicked by [CONTACT_2299]  's clinical state or by [CONTACT_276961].  
Probably related:  The suspected adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from study treatment administrati on, abates upon discontinuation of the treatment, and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_82977] 's clinical 
state.  
Definitely related : This designation should be reserved for those events which have no

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 7 of 117 Confidential  Safety Endpoints:  
• Incidence and severity of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Change from baseline in vital signs measurements, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram 
results  
• Number and incidence of rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (posttransplant participants only)  
• Number and incidence of graft loss  (posttransplant participants only)  
• Incidence of death, stratified by [CONTACT_651510]: 
Methodology:  
This is a phase 3, randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blinded, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of twice -weekly SC infusions of pegcetacoplan in patients diagnosed with primary C3G or IC -MPGN. 
The planned duration of participation in the study for each participant is a maximum of approximately [ADDRESS_874335] of 4 parts:  
• Part 1: 10- week screening period  
• Part 2: 26- week randomized controlled period (RCP)  
• Part 3: 26- week open -label period 
• Part 4: 8-week follow -up period (only for participants who do not roll into a  long- term extension study)  
Informed consent (and assent if applicable) will be obtained prior to the conduct of any study- related procedures.  
Part 1: Screening Period (10  Week s) 
• Participants will be screened to confirm that eligibility criteria are met.  
• One 24-hour urine sample and [ADDRESS_874336] -morning spot urine (FMU) samples (first- morning  
void collected on 3  consecutive days) will be collected to determine eligibility and establish a 
baseline uPCR . 
• For adult participants , a renal biopsy will be performed to confirm diagnosis and eligibility and to serve 
as the baseline renal biopsy. A historic  renal biopsy done within [ADDRESS_874337] an adequate 
previous renal biopsy to establish the diagnosis, even if the previous biopsy is more than 28 weeks prior 
to randomization.   
• Retrospective data for a period of up to 3 years prior to study entry will be collected to calculate 
historical eGFR (using the Chronic Kidney Disease– Epi[INVESTIGATOR_651479]).  
• Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitidis  (types A, C, W, Y, and B), 
and Haemophilus influenzae  (type B) are mandatory unless documented evidence exists that participants 
have received the recommended vaccinations or are nonresponders to vaccination. If  required, 
vaccination series should be initiated at least 14  days prior to randomization.  
Part 2: Randomized Controlled Period (26 Week s) 
Approximately 80 to 100 participants who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will 
be randomly assigned in a 1:[ADDRESS_874338] 
stratification factor examines participants with posttransplant recurrence versus nontransplant participants ; 
the second stratification factor examines participants with baseline  renal biopsies (either collected during 
screening or a historic biopsy collected within 28 weeks prior to randomization) versus participants without 
baseline renal biopsies.  
• Pegcetacoplan group:  Participants  will receive SC pegcetacoplan  twice  weekly.  
• Placebo  group : Participants  will receive SC  placebo twice weekly.  
• Every effort will be made to minimize changes to medications related to C3G/IC- MPGN disease.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 8 of 117 Confidential  • Triplicate first -morning spot urines will be collected at each visit, and an additional triplicate 
first-morning sample will be collected during week 25.  
• Safety and efficacy will be assessed.  
• At the end of the RCP, there will be a renal biopsy, which is required for adult participants to advance to 
the open -label period (Part  3). Participants younger than 18 years are not required to provide renal 
biopsies and may advance to the open- label period upon completion of all assessments for weeks 24 
through 26 other than the renal biopsy.  
Part 3: Open -Label P eriod (26  Weeks)  
• All participants will be treated with pegcetacoplan  twice weekly to assess durability of response and 
long- term safety and efficacy. Open -label dosing will begin at the first visit after the week  26 renal 
biopsy for adults and any adolescents providing renal biopsies. Open- label dosing for adolescents not 
providing renal biopsies should start at the week 26 visit. 
• At the end of the open- label period, there will be an optional renal biopsy.  
Part 4: Follow -up Pe riod (8 Weeks)  
• Participants  who would benefit from continuing to receive pegcetacoplan, as per the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may roll over into a long- term extension study after completion of the open- label period.  
• Participants  who do not enter a  long- term extension study will discontinue pegcetacoplan treatment 
and complete the 8 -week follow -up period.  
Number of Participants (Planned) and Sample Size Justification:   
Approximately [ADDRESS_874339] -transplant, will be 
randomized 1:1 to pegcetacoplan or placebo with 40 to 50 participants per arm.  
Based on preliminary data from Study APL2 -201, a reduction of 60% in uPCR in the pegcetacoplan group at 
week 26 is assumed vs a reduction of 20% in uPCR in the placebo arm, which corresponds to mean log ratio to 
baseline of −0.92 vs −0.[ADDRESS_874340] deviation of 0.88 (on log- scale). Based on this assumption, 
a sample size of [ADDRESS_874341] 90% power at 1 -sided significance level of 0.025. 
Considering a 10% attrition to account for potential missing assessments a nd impact by [CONTACT_4113]- 19, it is expected 
that at least 78 participants with native kidney disease should be enrolled.  
A minimum of 63 participants with C3G in native kidneys will be enrolled, which is approximately 80% of the enrolled participants with native kidney disease.

Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 11 of 117 Confidential  Duration of Participation:  
Total participation will be 70  weeks (screening: 10  weeks; RCP: 26  weeks; open -label period: 26  weeks; 
follow -up: 8 weeks). Depending on treatment assignment, treatment with pegcetacoplan will be for a maximum of 
52 weeks (RCP: 26  weeks; open- label period: 26 weeks).  
Statistical Methodology:  
Efficacy: 
Primary Efficacy:  
The targeted treatment regimen to be used for this study is pegcetacoplan or placebo plus stable regimen for 
C3G/IC -MPGN treatment. The primary estimand on the treatment effect of pegcetacoplan is for the participant 
population as defined through the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, with the primary endpoint based on the log-transformed ratio of uPCR (sampled from first -morning urine collections) at week 26 compared to baseline 
using an equal -weighted average over weeks 24, 25, and 26. Intercurrent events (ICEs) will  be addressed as 
defined in Table 8.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). The  model 
will include fixed categorical effects for treatment group, visit, stratification factors, disease type (C3G vs IC-MPGN), and the visit -by-treatment group interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline 
log-transformed uPCR. Initi ally, an unstructured covariance matrix will be investigated. If this analysis fails to 
converge, other covariance structures will be used; details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. The difference between treatment groups will be estimated with its 95% CI and corresponding P value.  
Key Secondary Efficacy:  
To preserve the overall type I error among the primary endpoint and key and additional secondary endpoints, a fixed -sequence testing strategy will be used; hence, statistical significance of the first secondary endpoint will be 
evaluated only if statistical significance is achieved with the primary analysis of the primary endpoint.  
The remaining secondary endpoints will also adhere to this testing strategy, and their order will match the order in 
which they are presented in Section  5.2.1.  
• The numbers and proportion of participants who meet the criteria for achieving a composite renal endpoint at week 26 will be tabulated by [CONTACT_36718] a logistic regression model with treatment group as the independent variable and ad justed for baseline eGFR values, baseline 
log-transformed uPCR values, disease type, and stratification factors. The P value and odds ratio of 
being a responder for the pegcetacoplan group to being a responder for the placebo group and associated 95% CI wi ll be provided.  
• The numbers and proportion of participants who achieve uPCR response at week  26 (defined as a 
reduction from baseline in uPCR of at least 50% sampled from triplicate first -morning urine collections) 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_651514] a logistic regression model similar to that for the composite renal endpoint. The odds ratio of being a responder for the pegcetacoplan group to being a responder for the placebo group with associated 95% CI and P value will be provided.  
• For participants with evaluable renal biopsies, evaluation of the change from baseline to week  26 in the 
activity score in the C3G histologic index will use analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment as a fixed effect, adjusted for baseline C3G histologic index activity score, disease type, 
and stratification factors. P value and least -square (LS) means will be presented for each treatment 
group, along with the between- treatment difference and 95% confidence interval.  
• For participants with evaluable renal biopsies, the numbers and proportion of participants showing decreases in C3c staining on renal biopsy from baseline to week 26 will be tabulated by [CONTACT_651515] a logistic regression model similar to that for the composite renal endpoint. The odds ratio of being a responder for the pegcetacoplan group to being a responder for the placebo 
group and associated 95% CI and P value  will be provided.  
• Change from baseline in eGFR at week 26 will be analyzed using a MMRM model similar to that for the primary endpoint. The difference between treatment groups will be estimated with its 95% CI and 
corresponding P value.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 21 of 117 Confidential  4. INTRODUCTION  
Two similar diseases, C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and immune- complex membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (IC -MPGN), will be studied in this protocol. This study will include patients 
with native kidney disease or with posttransplant disease recurrence and will exclude patients 
whose C3G or IC-MPGN is secondary to an underlying condition (eg, infection, monoclonal 
gammopathy, malignancy, or medication). 
4.1. C3G and IC -MPGN and Unmet Medical Need  
C3G is a disease in which the complement system, specifically the alternative pathway (AP), is indiscriminately overactive, leading to excessive deposition of C3 breakdown products in the 
glomeruli of the kidney, and damage to the renal parenchyma. The underlying AP hyperactivity 
can be due to various factors, most commonly, an acquired autoantibody which stabilizes the 
AP C3 or C5 convertase (C3 or C5 nephritic factor). AP hyperactivity leads to uncontrolled 
C3 activation, resulting in an excess of C3 breakdown products that are deposited in the 
glomerular basement membrane and mesangium. This stimulates a brisk inflammatory response, 
disrupting the normal glomerular architecture.  
There are 2 subtypes of C3G: dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN), 
which are distinguishable only by [CONTACT_530215]. The clinical presentation, features, and disease 
course are similar between the 2 subtypes, but with some distinctions. DDD tends to present 
earlier in life than C3GN (median ages of diagnosis for DDD and C3GN are 12 and 26 years old, respectively), and DDD is also associated with extrarenal manifestations, such as acquired partial 
lipodystrophy and macular degeneration. The incidence of C3GN is about 3- fold greater than 
that of DDD (Medjeral -Thomas et al. 2014; Servais et al. 2012; Lu et al. 2012).  
Although IC -MPGN is typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a distinct pathologic entity from C3G, the underlying 
pathophysiology and clinical course of the 2 primary diseases are remarkably similar  
(Noris et al. 2019 ; Holle et al. 2018 ). As in C3G, patients with primary IC -MPGN often have 
evidence of AP hyperactivity, including the presence of genetic or acquired causes of AP dysregulation. In these patients, uncontrolled C3 activation and glomerular deposition of C3 
breakdown products is also observed, similar to C3G. The only pathologic distinction from C3G is 
that the glomerular C3 deposition in IC -MPGN is accompanied by [CONTACT_651516]. 
The common clinical manifestations of primary IC -MPGN are the same as those of C3G and other 
glomerulonephritides – proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension, and reduced glomerular filtration rate.  
4.2. Study Rationale  
There are no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_651484] C3G or IC -MPGN. 
Similar to other glomerular diseases, disease management includes nonspecific measures to manage proteinuria, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], edema, and other facets of glomerular and 
chronic kidney disease. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_651485], the prognosis of C3G and IC- MPGN is 
poor as pa tients steadily progress to end- stage renal disease (ESRD) ( Smith et al. 2019 ; 
Regunathan-Shenk et al. 2019; Medjeral -Thomas et al. 2014 ; Zhang et al. 2014; 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_651486]. 2013; Lu et al. 2012 ; Okpechi et al. 2014).  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874363], but the incidence of disease 
recurrence is high, with up to 50% of patients losing their renal allografts because of disease 
recurrence ( Medjeral -Thomas et al. 2014 ; Zhang et al. 2014 ; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_116281]. 2013; Lu et al. 2012 ). 
Therefore, a therapy that can protect the kidneys, native or transplanted, from ongoing damage due to 
complement hyperactivity is an unmet need. 
As an inhibitor of C3 and its fragment, C3b, pegcetacoplan has the potential to address the 
underlying disease pathophysiology of complement hyperactivity in C3G and IC- MPGN. 
Specifically, by [CONTACT_61670] C3, it is expected that pegcetacoplan will halt the inappropriate and 
excessive C3 activation that characterizes these diseases. Additionally, by [CONTACT_61670] C3b, 
pegcetacoplan inhibits the activity of the AP C3 convertase (whether it is stabilized by [CONTACT_651517]) through a second complementary mechanism of action in addition to the inhibition 
of C3 as a substrate in the complement cascade. These 2 complementary mechanisms are 
expected to prevent further deposition of C3 breakdown products in the glomeruli, affording the opportunity for the kidney to recover by [CONTACT_651518]. 
This renal recovery would be expected, initially, to yield a reduction in proteinuria, and 
ultimately, to result in prolonged renal survival. Therefore, pegcetacoplan is a potentially life-altering therapy for C3G and IC -MPGN.  
4.2.1. Justification of Study Population  
Based on the mechanism of action of pegcetacoplan, Apellis aims to study patients with glomerular 
disease driven by [CONTACT_651519] -activation and as such, will include patients with either C3G or 
IC-MPGN, as both are characterized by [CONTACT_651520] t o excessive deposition of 
C3 breakdown products in glomeruli ( Iatropoulos et al. 2018 ; Cook 2018; Servais et al. 2012 ). 
Because the same underlying pathophysiology of complement dysregulation that leads to C3G/IC- MPGN in the native kidney also leads to disease recurrence posttransplant, and the clinical 
course for both is characterized by [CONTACT_651521], the trial includes patients with posttransplant disease recurrence, in addition to nontransplant patients. Finally,  the trial includes adolescents (ages 12– 17), as the disease features in adolescents are similar 
to those of adults.  
4.2.2. Justification of Study Design  
A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial design was selected in order to evaluate 
the treatment effect of pegcetacoplan on proteinuria and renal function in patients with C3G or 
IC-MPGN in a robust and minimally biased fashion. The placebo control enables identification 
of potential study effects that are not related to the study drug and provides data on the course of 
the disease in the absence of study treatment. Given that participants must have had stable or 
worsening disease for the preceding [ADDRESS_874364] improved (or worsened) compliance with nonstudy medications related to study participation. These types 
of study effects are expected to occur in the first [ADDRESS_874365] should be evident and stable by [CONTACT_5875] 26.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874366] the o pportunity to receive 
pegcetacoplan in a reasonable time frame while still establishing the placebo response rate.  
4.2.3. Justification of Dose  
The dosing regimen for adults will be 1080 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly. 
This dosing regimen is intended to result in systemic exposures of pegcetacoplan similar to those 
seen in the ongoing phase 2 study in patients with complement- mediated glomerulopathies, 
Study APL2 -201, and the phase 3 studies in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria 
(PNH), Study APL2 -302 and Study APL2 -308, in which pegcetacoplan has been generally safe 
and well tolerated.  
The dosing regimens for adolescents are intended to yield similar exposures as 1080  mg twice 
weekly in adults. Modeling -based simulations were performed for adolescents on the basis of an 
adult population PK model incorporating pegcetacoplan serum concentration- time data from 
10 clinical studies (five phase  1 studies in healthy volunteers, one special population study in adults 
with severe renal impairment, three phase  1b/2a studies in adult PNH patients, and one  phase  3 study 
[Study APL2 -302; data up to we ek 16] in adult PNH patients). The results of these model analyses 
were used to select the dosing regimens for adolescents, as summarized below:  
• In adolescents aged [ADDRESS_874367] 50 kg, a dose regimen of 1080 mg twice weekly is expected to result in exposure similar to that seen in adults at the same dosage.  
• In adolescents aged 12 to 17 years with body weights of 35 to 49 kg, a 648- mg initial 
dose followed by 810 mg twice weekly is anticipated to result in exposures at weeks 1, 2, and 16 (steady- state) that are similar to those of the adult dosage of 
1080 mg twice weekly.  
• In adolescents aged [ADDRESS_874368] 2 doses will be 540 mg, and following doses will be 648 mg twice weekly. This regimen is 
anticipated to result in exposures at weeks 1, 2, and 16 (steady- state) that are similar 
to those of the adult dosage of 1080 mg twice weekly.  
Modeling of exposure in high body weight participants (those weighing >100 kg) results in 
predicted exposures at least 15% lower than those for a reference 70- kg participant; participants 
with body weights of >100 kg will therefore be excluded from the study.  
4.3. Summary of Clinical Experience With Pegcetacoplan  
Pegcetacoplan is being studied in APL2-201, an ongoing phase 2 study that includes patients 
with 1 of 4 glomerular diseases: C3G, immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy, primary membranous nephropathy, or lupus nephritis. Preliminary data from the 8 C3G participants in 
this study indicate that pegcetacoplan is able to target the complement hyperactivity of C3G, 
as well as reduce proteinuria in patients with C3G.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 24 of 117 Confidential  Clinical data is also available from 5 studies with pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH 
(phase  1b: Studies APL -CP0514 and APL2- CP-PNH -204; phase  2a: Study  APL2 -202; 
phase  3: Studies  APL2 -302 and APL2- 308). Results from these studies indicate that pegcetacoplan is 
effective in providing broad control of intravascular and extravascular hemolysis, as evidenced by [CONTACT_716]: increased and stable hemoglobin levels, normalization of lac tate dehydrogenase levels, 
normalization of absolute reticulocyte count, no rmalization of total bilirubin levels, reduction in C3 
fragment opsonization, and increased numbers of PNH red blood cells.

risk/benefit assessment and the most current information regarding the drug metabolism, 
pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy, and safety of pegcetacoplan. 
4.4. Clinical Risks/Benefits of Pegcetacoplan  
Pegcetacoplan has the potential to address the underlying disease pathophysiology of complement hyperactivity in C3G and IC-MPGN, and, therefore, to provide benefit in these 
diseases with a high unmet medical need.  
The safety of SC pegcetacoplan administration has been studied in multiple phase 2 and 3 studies for 
C3G, PNH, and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, with an acceptable safety profile to date. 
Nonetheless, a number of safety monitoring practices are being employ ed by [CONTACT_651522], including physical examination, vital signs monitoring, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), hematology (including coagulation), serum chemistry, urinalysis at specified intervals, 
as well as prompt reporting of adve rse events (AEs).  
Infusion site/pump safety will be assessed during clinical visits, and any significant finding from 
the assessment will be recorded as an AE (see Section  11.2.2). The volume of blood planned for 
collection from each participant over the course of the study will be minimized to limit the 
impact on the overall health of these anemic participants.  
Systemic complement inhibition might predispose individuals to infections caused by [CONTACT_651523], including Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria meningitidis , and Haemophilus 
influenzae . Vaccinations against these organisms according to the most current Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for patients with complement deficiencies will be required to minimize potential risk of infection. Vaccinations will b e initiated at least [ADDRESS_874370] dose  of pegcetacoplan; therefore, prophylactic antibiotic use is not 
required. Body temperature and vital signs will be monitored periodically, and relevant blood parameters monitored regularly throughout the study to assess for signs of infection. Participant s will 
be counseled regarding this potential risk for infection and given a participant safety wallet card in 
the event of an emergency. The investigator should be contact[CONTACT_63280] a 
suspected infection for guidance on appropriate action to be taken.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 25 of 117 Confidential  4.4.1. COVID- 19 Risk Mitigation Measures  
Apellis is not currently aware of any evidence associating pegcetacoplan use with specific risks or 
complications of COVID -19. Apellis recognizes the need to consider the public health risks of the 
COVID- 19 pandemic within the context of conducting a clini cal trial. Because these risks may 
change as the pandemic evolves and may vary on the basis of geographic location, Apellis will continue to evaluate the risk/benefit around study conduct on an ongoing and 
participant -by-participant basis.  
In the event that an investigative site is closed or a participant is unable or unwilling to travel 
because of the COVID -19 pandemic, and if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_651487]’s best interest to continue in the study, the following  mitigation measures may be 
implemented for the study and used if deemed necessary and authorized by [CONTACT_456], including but not limited to:  
• Collection of AEs or serious adverse events (SAEs) should be done over the phone and documented in the source documents. 
• A minimized schedule of activities is presented in  Table  A1 of Appendix 3.  
• Any activities not performed because of COVID-19–related restrictions will be identified in the participant source document.  
• Any change in COVID-19 status (serology or antigen), if available, will be captured 
in the participant's source document.  
• Where applicable, relevant study documentation will be updated and communicated 
to health authorities and/or institutional review boards (IRBs) or independent ethics 
committees (IECs) as required.  
Apellis is currently not aware of any contraindications to vaccination (of any modality) 
and concurrent treatment with pegcetacoplan. In the absence of data, Apellis currently 
recommends that the decision to vaccinate study participants against COVID -[ADDRESS_874371] COVID -19 is not 
mandatory for continued study participation. 
These measures are described in more detail  Appendix 3.

APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874374] 10 adolescent participants (aged 12- 17 years) will be enrolled; adolescent 
participants may be either patients with native kidney disease or posttransplant disease recurrence . 
Participants initially screened as adolescents will follow adolescent procedures and requirements 
through the duration of their participation in study, even if they pass their 18th birthday while 
enrolled in the study.  
The planned length of participation in the study for each participant is a maximum of 
approximately [ADDRESS_874375] of 4 parts: 
• Part 1: 10- week screening period  
• Part 2: 26-week randomized controlled period (RCP) 
• Part 3: 26-week open-label period 
• Part 4: 8-week follow-up period (only for participants who do not roll into a long- term 
extension study) 
Informed consent (and assent, when applicable) will be obtained prior to any study- related 
procedures being conducted. The screening period will start once informed consent has 
been  obtained.  
See Figure 1  for the study schematic, and Table  2 for the schedule of activities.  
6.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a placebo -controlled, double-blinded, phase 3 study in patients with clinical and 
pathologic evidence of primary C3G or IC-MPGN. Participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 
to either the pegcetacoplan group (pegcetacoplan treatment throughout the RCP and open- label 
period) or the placebo group (placebo treatment during the RCP and pegcetacoplan treatment 
during the open- label period). The visit schedule will be the same, regardl ess of randomization.  
The study includes renal biopsies, one during screening and a second at the end of the RCP (week  26). An optional third biopsy may be collected at the end of the open-label period 
(week  52). The biopsy requirements are discussed in Section  10.5, including additional 
information on biopsies for participants under the age of 18.  
After completion of the RCP and open -label period, any participant who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], is experiencing clinical benefit from pegcetacoplan administration will be invited 
to participate in a planned long-term extension study to continue to receive treatment with 
pegcetacoplan until it is commercially available for the treatment of C3G and/or IC -MPGN 
and accessible in their countries, or the development program for C3G and/or IC -MPGN is 
terminated, in compliance with all applicable nation al and local laws and regulations.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 33 of 117 Confidential  6.1.1. Part 1: Screening Period (10 Weeks)  
Participants will be screened to confirm that the selection criteria for the study have been met. 
The screening period will occur in 2 stages, and all assessments described in the schedule of 
activities (Table  2) at screening visit 1 should occur before those in screening visit 2. This ensures 
that the more invasive procedures (vaccinations and renal biopsy) do not occur unless the participants 
meet all other eligibility criteria.  
• One 24- hour urine sample and [ADDRESS_874376]- morning spot urine (FMU) samples 
(first- morning void collected on 3 consecutive days) will be collected to determine eligibility 
and establish a baseline uPCR. Collection of urine samples is discussed in more detail in 
Section  10.2 and Section  10.3. Calculation of baseline uPCR is discussed in Section  12.3.1  
and Section  12.3.2.  
• For adult participants, a renal biopsy will be performed to confirm diagnosis and eligibility and to serve as the baseline renal biopsy. The baseline renal biopsy may be conducted at any 
time during screening once eligibility is confirmed by [CONTACT_651525]  1. 
All biopsies will be evaluated by [CONTACT_308645]. Renal biopsies are 
discussed in more detail in Section  10.5. 
o A historic renal biopsy done within 28  weeks of randomization may be used for 
eligibility confirmation and serve as the baseline biopsy if it is confirmed as adequate 
by [CONTACT_651526]/or images.  
o Participants under the age of [ADDRESS_874377] an 
adequate previous renal biopsy to establish the diagnosis, even if the previous biopsy 
is more than 28  weeks prior to randomization.  
• Retrospective data for a period of up to 3  years prior to study entry will be collected to 
calculate historical eGFR using the Chronic Kidney Disease –Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444] 
[CKD- EPI] creatinine equation for adults and the Bedside Schwartz equation  
(eGFR = 0.413 × [height (in centimeters)]  / serum creatinine) for adolescents.  
Retrospective  data for eGFR are discussed in more detail in Section  10.1. 
• The participant’s medical history and screening data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_093], in collaboration with the medical monitor, to confirm the diagnosis of primary C3G or 
IC-MPGN. The investigator and medical monitor will consider all available historical, 
laboratory, and pathology data. For an adolescent in whom a renal biopsy within 28  weeks of 
day 1 is not available, the investigator and medical monitor will consider alternative evidence 
for active renal disease as described in Section  7.1.  
• Vaccinations against S pneumoniae , N meningitidis  (types A, C, W, Y, and B), 
and H influenzae  (type B) are mandatory unless documented evidence exists that participants 
are nonresponders to vaccination. If required, vaccination series should be initiated at least 
14 days prior to randomization. Vaccinations are discussed in more detail in Section  8.2.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 34 of 117 Confidential  Individuals who consent to participate in the study but who do not initially meet all the 
requirements as outlined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria are not able to be enrolled; 
however, these individuals may be held in the screening period until suc h time that they meet 
inclusion requirements and are able to be enrolled. In this case, additional screening visits and/or 
repeat screening assessments may be conducted, as needed, to establish eligibility. The medical 
monitor will contact [CONTACT_651527].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Rescreening  
In the event that rescreening occurs and the participant has not remained in the screening period (ie, is a screening failure), the individual is required to reconsent and must be assigned a new 
identification number. For rescreened participants, the historic biopsy (within 28 weeks before 
randomization), chest radiography, vaccination, ophthalmologic evaluations, and measured GFR in 
the previous screening period may be considered as validated testing for rescreening.  
6.1.2.  Part 2: Randomized Controlled Period (26 Weeks)  
Approximately 80 to 100 participants who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either pegcetacoplan or placebo. 
Randomization will be performed as described in Section  8.5.1 .  
• Pegcetacoplan group : Participants will receive SC pegcetacoplan twice  weekly.  
• Placebo group : Participants will receive SC  placebo infusions twice weekly .  
• Every effort will be made in both groups to minimize changes to medications related to 
C3G/IC- MPGN disease.  
• Triplicate FMU samples will be collected at each visit, and an additional triplicate FMU 
uPCR sample will be collected during week  25.  
• Safety and efficacy will be assessed.  
• At the end of the RCP, there will be a renal biopsy, which is required for participants aged 18 years and older to advance to the open- label period (Part  3). Participants younger than 
18 years are not required to provide renal biopsies and may advance to the open -label period 
upon completion of all assessments for weeks 24 through 26 other than the renal biopsy. Biopsy requirements are discussed in more detail in Section  10.5.  
6.1.3.  Part 3: Open -Label Period (26 Weeks)  
At the end of the RCP, participants from both groups will proceed to the 26- week open -label period, 
in which all participants will be treated with pegcetacoplan twice weekly. Open -label dosing will 
begin at the first visit after the week  [ADDRESS_874378] a biopsy at 
the end of the open- label period. Upon completion of the open -label period, participants will enter 
the follow -up period (Part 4) unless they enter a long -term extension study.

After completion of the open -label period, participants who would benefit from continuing to 
receive pegcetacoplan, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], may roll over into a long -term extension 
study. Participants who do not enter a long-term extension study will discontinue pegcetacoplan

NOTE : When multiple assessments/procedures occur at the same visit, order should be: vital signs, ECGs, blood collection/sampling, study drug dosing.  
a. All visit 2 assessments need not occur in a single visit and visit 2 can be split into multiple visits (eg, visit  2a, visit  2b). 
b. Vaccinations, baseline renal biopsy, and screening chest radiography can occur any time during screening after confirmation of eligibility based on visit [ADDRESS_874379] 14 days prior to randomization; additional vaccines may be required at visit 6. Please see Section  8.2 for more details on vaccination 
requirements. Vaccination serum samples will be collected on the day of vaccination before receiving vaccinations on that visit. These samples will be analyzed to evaluate response 
to vaccinations in the event that the participant has a positive infection for Streptococcus  pneumoniae , Neisseria  meningitidis , or Haemophilus  influenzae .  
e. A full physical examination is required at visits 1, 3 (week  1), 10 (week  26), and 16 (week  52). A full physical examination should also be conducted on the first day of open- label 
dosing, if that is not at the week  26 visit. Brief physical examinations, including weight (kg) and assessment of edema, will be conducted at all other visits noted. A symptom -driven 
physical examination may be performed at any time, at the investigator’s discretion. Body height (cm) will b e measured only during screening for adu lts but will be measured at 
screening and every 12 weeks throughout the study for adolescents; weight (kg) will be measured throughout study, during brie f and full physical examinations for all participants. 
Both body weight and height will be assessed wit hout shoes on; height will be measured using a calibrated stadiometer. Edema should be assessed at every visit.  
f. Renal biopsies will not be required for participants younger than [ADDRESS_874380] visit of the open- label period at week 28. Participants younger than 18  years are not required to provide renal 
biopsies and may advance to the open -label period upon completion of all assessments for weeks 24 through 26 other than the renal biopsy.  
h. The week  52 renal biopsy is optional for all participants. If performed it should be after collection of the week  48 24- hour urine and FMU samples, and not more than 8 weeks after 
the week  52 visit. In the event that a participant has a renal biopsy as part of their clinical management within this window, it may serve as the week  52 biopsy provided that it 
includes the required components for this study.  
i. Study drug will be self -administered by [CONTACT_651528], after receiving appropriate training and sign -off by a research nurse (or other qualified 
personnel) in their first treatment week, as described in Section  9.5. Once qualified, the participant or caregiver should administer study drug at site visits (as done at home) on those 
days when a clinic visit occurs on a dosing day. If a home nurse is administering study drug on nonvisit days, the site staff  may administ er study drug on days of site visits.  
j. Between site visits, participants will be instructed to report any infusion site reactions to the study staff. Pump use safety will be reviewed by [CONTACT_651529] 
(eg, investigator or nurse) for each study drug administration at clinic visits and during at -home qualification.  
k. Vital signs should be measured a maximum of [ADDRESS_874381] day of open- label dosing (week  26 or week  28, depending on whether a 
week  26 renal biopsy is required and when it is performed), vital signs should also be measured approximately [ADDRESS_874382] 
5 minutes, except when they are supi[INVESTIGATOR_651488]/or AEs, or if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_34462].  
l. FACIT -Fatigue, EQ -5D-5L, KDQOL, PGIC, and WPAI. 
m. The screening 24 -hour urine collection may be done any time between screening visit 1 and screening visit 2. After week  1, collections should be within ±1 week of the visit 
(except  for the week 24 collection, which cannot be earlier than week  24). Courier arrangements can be made to pi[INVESTIGATOR_651489], or the

the next clinic visit.  
o. The day [ADDRESS_874384] dose of study drug (eg, day –2, day –1, and before dosing on day 1).  
p. Serum complement profile includes AH50, CH50, and C3NeF; C3NeF will only be assayed in samples collected at the baseline (scr eening) visits. Plasma complement profile 
includes C3a, C3b/iC3b, C5a, and sC5b- 9. See laboratory assessments ( Table  4) for more details.  
q. The day [ADDRESS_874385] ADA samples collected approximately every 6 months until the antibody 
levels revert to baseline.  
r. eGFR will be calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease –Epi[INVESTIGATOR_651491]. For each 
participant, eGFR will be calculated using the same formula for the duration of the study; the choice of formula will be determined by [CONTACT_2299]’s age at study entry.  
s. Serum FSH (to be measured in female participants only), hepatitis B panel, hepatitis C panel, HIV antibodies, SPEP (adult participants only), ANA, and ANCA (see Table 4  
and laboratory manual for more details).  
t. Ophthalmologic evaluations are optional and will be performed at selected sites. If evaluations are performed, each participant should have a baseline ophthalmologic evaluation, including a basic ophthalmologic examination, SD -OCT, and color fundus photogr aphy, at an approved ophthalmologic clinical site at any time during the screening period. 
For participants who have drusen before pegcetacoplan administration, a follow -up ophthalmologic evaluation, including an SD -OCT and color fundus photography, should occur at 
a convenient time between weeks 42 and 52.  
u. Measured GFR is an optional assessment that, if performed, should occur at 3 time points: once on day [ADDRESS_874386] time between 
week  42 and week  52, inclusive. Measured GFR should only be done at sites where it is routinely performed, as per the site’s standard protocol .

7.3. Discontinuations and Participants Lost to Follow -up  
7.3.1. Early Treatment Discontinuation and Study Withdrawal  
A participant may discontinue study treatment or withdraw from the study at any time, for any 
reason, without prejudice to his/her future medical care. The investigator or sponsor may 
discontinue study treatment or withdraw the participant from the study a t any time (eg, in the 
interest of the participant’s safety). If a participant discontinues study treatment or is withdrawn 
from the study for any reason, the study site must immediately notify the medical monitor.  
Once withdrawn from the study, the participant may not reenter the study.  
Participants who discontinue study treatment prior to the end of the RCP should be encouraged to complete the remaining visits for the RCP. If discontinuing study treatment after week  18, 
participants should also complete the activities described for the exit visit in the schedule of 
activities ( Table  2) approximately [ADDRESS_874400] dose of study drug. If the participant is 
unwilling or unable to complete the exit visit activities, they should be encouraged to complete the other follow -up visits and procedures described in the schedule of activities ( Table  2). 
Participants who discontinue study treatment during the open-label period should enter the 
follow -up period of the study, including all follow-up visits and procedures through study 
completion, unless unwilling, unable, or consent has been withdrawn. Participants who wish to 
fully withdraw from the study during the open- label period but prior to the week  52 visit and are 
unwilling or unable to complete the follow-up visits and procedures should complete the activities described for the exit visit in the schedule of activities (Table  2) at their last visit.  
7.3.2. Reasons for Discontinuation of Treatment or Withdrawal From the Study  
The date of and reason for treatment discontinuation must be determined by [CONTACT_458640]’s medical record. If it is determined that there was more than one reason 
for the discontinuation, each reason should be recorded in the source document and the most 
clinically relevant reason, as determined by [CONTACT_093], should be noted. Treatment will be 
discontinued if any of the following occur:  
• Any SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition (including infections) or circumstance that 
indicates to the investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of 
the pa rticipant.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 45 of 117 Confidential  • Participant withdrawal of consent: at any time, a participant’s participation in the 
study may be terminated at his or her request or on the basis of the investigator’s 
clinical judgment. The reason for participant withdrawal will be noted in the 
participa nt’s source document.  
• Participant fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance, 
failure to return for defined number of visits, failure to meet randomization criteria), 
such that continued participation in the study is not in the best interest of the participant (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]) or compromises the ability of the 
sponsor to appropriately analyze the data from the study.  
• Participant is lost to follow -up: the participant stopped coming for visits, and study 
personnel were unable to contact [CONTACT_2299].  
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_433677].  
• Pregnancy, as indicated in Section 11.2.4.  
Any participant who discontinues treatment early, or is withdrawn from the study early, because 
of a TEAE, whether serious or nonserious, will be followed until the TEAE resolves (returns to 
normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged b y the investigator to no longer be 
clinically significant.  
Participants for whom study treatment is discontinued should be encouraged to complete additional activities as described in Section  7.3.1, unless unwilling, unable, or consent has been 
withdrawn. If consent is withdrawn, no further study evaluations are to be performed and no 
attempts are to be made to collect additional data.  
Additionally, the sponsor may stop the study at any time for safety, regulatory, legal, or other 
reasons aligned with Good Clinical Practice (GCP). This study may be terminated at the 
discretion of the sponsor or any regulatory agency. An investigator may elect to discontinue or 
stop the study at his/her study site for any reason, including safety or low enrollment. 
7.3.3. Lost to Follow -up Prior to Last Scheduled Visit  
A minimum of [ADDRESS_874401] (office visit or telephone contact). At least [ADDRESS_874402] include a written communication sent to the participant’s last 
known address via courier or mail (with an acknowledgment of receipt request) asking that 
he/she return to the site for final sa fety evaluations and to return any study drug. 
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study.  
7.3.4. Replacement of Participants  
Participants who discontinue the study will not be replaced.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 46 of 117 Confidential  8. TREATMENT OF PARTICIPANTS 
8.1. Study Interventions 
All participants will receive SC infusions of pegcetacoplan or matching volumes of placebo 
twice weekly. The planned dosing regimens for pegcetacoplan and the matching volume of placebo are presented in Table  3. All adult participants (regardless of weight), and adolescent 
participants who weigh at least [ADDRESS_874403] 35 kg but less than 50 kg will receive a reduced infusion volume ([ADDRESS_874404] infusion and 15 mL for each infusion thereafter). Adolescent participants who weigh at 
least 30  kg but less than 35 kg will receive a further reduced infusion volume ([ADDRESS_874405] 
2 infusions and 12 mL twice weekly thereafter). As described in Section  11.1.3, participant 
weight will be assessed at each visit; if an adolescent participant’s weight has changed, the dose 
and infusion volume should be adjusted accordingly. 
Table  3: Planned Dosing Regimens (Pegcetacoplan and Placebo)  
Weight  First dose  
(infusion volume) Second dose  
(infusion volume) Maintenance dosing regimen  
(infusion volume) 
All adult participants, 
adolescent participants 
≥50 kg 1080 mg (20  mL) 1080 mg (20  mL) 1080 mg twice weekly (20  mL) 
Adolescent participants 
35 to <50 kg 648 mg (12 mL) 810 mg (15 mL) 810 mg twice weekly (15  mL) 
Adolescent participants 30 to <35 kg 540 mg (10 mL) 540 mg (10 mL) 648 mg twice weekly (12  mL) 
Participants and/or their caregivers will be trained to administer the infusions, as described in 
Section  9.5.  
If a participant misses any regularly scheduled doses for any reason, all efforts should be made to 
restart dosing as soon as possible to reach and maintain therapeutic steady -state concentrations of 
pegcetacoplan. A single missed dose should be administer ed as soon as possible, regardless of 
whether the missed dose is administered on a regularly scheduled dosing day. Dosing should then continue twice weekly at the prescribed dose level (see Table  3 above) according to the 
original dosing schedule, even if this results in an interval of less than 3 days between 2 doses. 
If multiple doses are missed, dosing should resume as soon as possible at the prescribed dose 
level (see Table  3 above) according to the original dosing schedule. The medical monitor should 
be notified of any gaps in dosing.  
8.2. Vaccinations  
To receive study drug, participants will be required to be vaccinated as follows on the basis of 
ACIP recommendations for adults or children with complement deficiencies (available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html) or other similar local guidelines.  
• N meningitidis types A, C, W, and Y: First dose at least 14 days prior to randomization with a second dose 2 months later, and then boosters every 5 years.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 47 of 117 Confidential  • N meningitidis  type B: First dose at least [ADDRESS_874406] booster dose 1 year later, and then additional 
booster doses every 2 to 3 years.  
• S pneumoniae : pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20, depending 
on participant age and vaccine availability) and/or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
23 (PPSV23). Adults who have not previously received any pneumococcal vaccine may 
receive PCV20, if the site is able to procure it, and a subsequent dose of PPSV23 would not be required. Multiple scenarios exist depending on previous vaccination history and 
investigators should consult ACIP guidelines for adults or children with complement 
deficiencies or other similar local guidelines.  
• H influenzae  type B: Documentation of childhood vaccination or one dose at least 
[ADDRESS_874407] this documented evidence, the required missing vaccination(s) wil l be administered  as 
needed to bring participants up to date. The investigator will discuss with the medical monitor 
any individual participant circumstances relevant to the vaccination requirements that would 
make the above schedule not possible or reason able, of if the investigator has any questions or 
concerns about the vaccination requirements . If local or national guidelines for immunizations 
differ from the ACIP recommendations, the differences should be discussed with the medical 
monitor to determine an appropriate course of vaccinations. On an ongoing basis, including upon 
entry into a long- term extension , participants should be reevaluated for the need for any 
additional vaccinations or boosters on the basis of ACIP recommendations.  
Vaccination serum samples will be collected on the day of vaccination before receiving 
vaccinations on that visit. These samples will be analyzed to evaluate response to vaccinations if 
the participant tests positive for infection with S pneumoniae , N meningitidis , or H influenzae .  
8.2.1. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_651493], vital signs, and relevant blood parameters will be monitored regularly throughout the study to assess for signs of infection. The investigator should be contact[CONTACT_63280] a suspected infection for guidance on appropriate action to be taken. 
Action to be taken may include empi[INVESTIGATOR_651494] a broad- spectrum antibiotic to cover 
possible serious infections, such as meningococcus.  
8.3. Concomitant Medications  
All medications administered (including over the counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or 
herbal supplements) and all procedures performed within 12 weeks of screening will be collected as prior medications and procedures. Medications administered and procedures performed from the 
time of informed consent through the final visit (the week  60 exit visit, an exit visit following early 
discontinuation as described in Section  7.3.1, or the final visit before transition to the long -term 
extension study, as applicable) are regarded as concomitant and will be documented.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874408] 
12 weeks prior to randomization, as described in Section 7.1. During the screening period and 
the RCP, changes to the baseline treatment regimens for C3G/IC -MPGN (including medications, 
dietary restrictions, and lifestyle modifications) should be minimized to the extent possible and 
made only when required for the well -being of the participant (with the exception of 
posttransplant immunosuppression—see below). During the open- label period, if the investigator 
plans to make changes to the baseline treatment regimen, these should be approved by [CONTACT_3599]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Posttransplant Immunosuppression  
If the participant is in a posttransplant time frame in which immunosuppression or other 
transplant -related medication adjustments are anticipated, these adjustments should still occur, 
adhering to the center’s standard protocol for posttransplant care. For all posttransplant 
participants, the plan for posttransplant immunosuppression for the duration of the study should 
be documented prior to randomization. Any deviation during the study from the prespecified plan should be documented with a justification for the change.  
Posttransplant participants with evidence of rejection on the baseline biopsy collected during 
screening that requires treatment will need to undergo their antirejection treatment, and then can be reconsidered for pegcetacoplan dosing, but will need to mee t all other study eligibility criteria, 
including a repeat biopsy to serve as the baseline (refer to Section  10.5 fo r further details). 
Participants with evidence of subclinical rejection on the biopsy collected during screening may proceed with pegcetacoplan treatment, at the discretion of the investigator, provided no treatment 
is initiated for the rejection.  
8.3.2. Rescue Therapy  
In the event of an increase in serum creatinine to at least 2× the baseline level that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_651495] C3G/IC- MPGN disease, rescue therapy may be 
considered, such as high-dose corticosteroids and/or C5 inhibitor treatment.  
If the participant receives rescue therapy that is not a prohibited concomitant medication, then they will be allowed to remain on study drug. If a participant receives rescue therapy that is a prohibited 
concomitant medication, they will be discontinued f rom study drug, as described in Section 8.3.3 . 
8.3.3. Prohibited Medications  
The u se of rituximab, belimumab, or any approved or investigational anticomplement therapy other 
than pegcetacoplan (including, but not limited to, eculizumab and/or ravulizumab) is prohibited within [ADDRESS_874409] prior to screening and for the duration of the study.  
If a participant receives a prohibited concomitant medication, they will be discontinued from 
study drug and the procedures described in Section 7.3 s hould be followed. 
Analysis of results from participants receiving prohibited medications is described in  Table  8 
and Table  9.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874410] be instructed to bring their empty/unused study drug packaging and diaries to 
every visit. The pharmacist/nominated person will record drug accountability information in the 
interactive response technology. 
8.5. Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment Assignment 
8.5.1. Randomization  
Participants will be randomized to receive pegcetacoplan or placebo in a ratio of 1:[ADDRESS_874411] stratification factor examines participants with posttransplant recurrence versus nontransplant participants; at least 78  participants with C3G or IC -MPGN in a native kidney will be 
enrolled. This  is followed by [CONTACT_651533], which examines participants with 
baseline renal biopsies (either collected during screening or a historic biopsy collected within 28 weeks prior to randomization) versus participants without baseline renal biopsies. 
The stratification will ensure balance between treatment groups for the stratification factors.  
8.5.2. Blinding  
Dosing will be double-blinded in the RCP; the open- label period is not blinded. All central 
evaluations (including evaluation of renal biopsies by [CONTACT_104808]) will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
Participants, the sponsor, investigators, and all study site personnel conducting study -related 
activities (including carrying out study procedures, evaluating participants, and entering and/or evaluating study data) will remain blinded to treatment alloca tions during the RCP at least until all 
participants have completed the week  26 assessments and the RCP portion of the database has been 
locked. Although treatment in the open -label period is not blinded, investigators, study site 
personnel, and participan ts will remain blinded to the RCP treatment assignment until the blind has 
been broken. Only the drug supply distributor/logistics personnel who are not site personnel will be unblinded to study treatment. These individuals are not allowed to discuss treat ment and/or 
participant outcome with blinded study staff, including the evaluating physician. Active and placebo 
product labels will not include any information which would unblind the treatment assignment 
during the RCP, as described in Section 9.2.2 .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Unblinding  
Except as noted below, investigators shall not break the study blind. If knowledge of the participant’s 
treatment assignment is necessary for clinical management, the investigator should first attempt to 
contact [CONTACT_651534] t he need for unblinding to occur. The medical 
monitor or designee will be available at all times for such discussions. If the investigator is unable to 
reach the medical monitor or designee, or in the case of a medical emergency, the investigator should 
use their best judgment based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and if necessary 
may proceed with unblinding without having successfully contact[CONTACT_651535]. 
If a participant’s treatment assignment is unblinded under these circumstances, the medical monitor 
and study coordinator must be notified within 24 hours.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 50 of 117 Confidential  Information describing the unblinding (eg,  date and time of the call to the medical monitor by [CONTACT_1275], reason for unblinding, and  date and time of unblinding) must be clearly recorded in the 
participant’s study file. In addition, the investigator should consider whether the clinical event 
prompting unblinding should be considered an AE or an SAE according to the definitions in Sectio n 11.2.1; if so, such events must be recorded and reported as described in Section  11.2.2  
and Section  11.2.3. 
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874412] is pegcetacoplan (APL -2). The study drug may be pegcetacoplan or 
placebo during the RCP, depending on the treatment assignment. The study drug will be 
pegcetacoplan during the OLP.  
Pegcetacoplan will be provided as a sterile solution in single -use glass vials. Each vial contains an 
isotonic sterile solution of pegcetacoplan 1080 mg/20  mL (54  mg/mL) in 10  mM acetate buffer, 
pH 5.0, containing 4.1% sorbitol. Additional information is provided in the pegcetacoplan  IB.  
Placebo will be provided as a sterile solution of 10 mM acetate buffer, pH  5.0, containing 4.1% 
sorbitol supplied in single -use glass vials.  
9.2. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
9.2.1. Packaging  
Both pegcetacoplan and placebo will be supplied in [ADDRESS_874413] (pegcetacoplan drug product or placebo) is labeled with a minimum 
of the following items: protocol number, dosage form (including product name [CONTACT_38933]), route of administration, directions for use, storage conditions, batch number and/or 
packaging reference, statements required per local regulations (eg, “For clinical trial use only”), 
and name [CONTACT_3619]. 
Space is allocated on the label so that the site representative can record a unique participant 
identifier and date dispensed by [CONTACT_365135]. 
Additional labels may, on a case-by-case basis, be applied to the investigational product to 
satisfy national, local, or institutional requirements but must not contradict the clinical study 
label, obscure the clinical study label, unblind the treatment assignment during the RCP, 
or identify the participant by [CONTACT_2300].  
Additional labels may not be added without the sponsor’s prior full agreement.  
9.3. Study Drug Storage 
The study drug should be stored refrigerated at 2 -8 °C, both at home and in the clinic. Temperature 
monitoring is required at the investigator site (or documented storage location) to ensure that the 
study drug is maintained within an established temperature range.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 52 of 117 Confidential  The investigator or appropriately qualified site staff will be responsible for the following: 
• ensuring that the study drug is stored in a secure, limited -access location at the site  
o limited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or member of the study 
team, but this delegation must be documented 
• ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that 
records are maintained  
A pharmacist or appropriately qualified designated person will be responsible for the following: 
• storing the study drug appropriately 
• dispensing the vials of study drug to the participant 
• entering the unique participant identifier on the study drug bottle/carton labels as they are 
distributed 
When the participant receives the study drug from the site, it should be transported in a sponsor -approved bag or box, containing previously temperature -conditioned cold plates to ensure 
that the storage temperature (2 -8 °C) is maintained. Temperature monitoring will not be required 
during transport or at the participant’s residence, but a log will be kept for every infusion to ensure that all study drug was kept refrigerated.  
With sponsor prior approval, investigational product and/or ancillary supplies may be shipped from 
the study site to a participant’s designated location. Such shipments will only be implemented at sites 
where this activity is approved by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC and he alth authority (if required). Participant consent 
will be required prior to any participant information being provided to a courier. The responsibility to 
return both empty vials and any unused investigational product as described in Section 8.4 shall 
remain unchanged.  
9.4. Infusion Supplies  
The sponsor will supply syringes, vial adapters, infusion sets, and ambulatory syringe infusion 
pumps, as required. Refer to the pharmacy manual for further details. 
9.5. Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be administered as an SC infusion. The infusion volume depends on the dose received, as described in Section  8.1.  
The preferred site of infusion will be the anterior abdominal wall. If administration into the 
abdomen is not feasible, alternative appropriate sites are acceptable. Alternative sites include the 
anterior aspects of the thighs or upper arms (see Study Medi cation Administration Instructions —
Participant’s Guide for more details). It is advisable to change infusion site after each drug 
administration in order to avoid skin irritation. Research nurses or other appropriately qualified 
research personnel will adm inister the SC infusions (as needed) and will qualify and supervise 
the self -administration. Study drug administration may also be conducted by a caregiver or a 
member of the participant’s household, etc, who will undergo the same training (training is not intended to be restricted to the participant).  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 53 of 117 Confidential  These qualified personnel will be made available for a minimum of 6  days on treatment (2 doses) 
to ensure the participant or caregiver has been qualified to conduct administration, but duration 
could be shortened if qualification happens sooner or extended if the participant or caregiver 
requires further training. During  qualification, the participant or caregiver must demonstrate to 
the research personnel their ability to safely and effectively administer study drug using the 
infusion pump. Following admin istration qualification, the participant or caregiver may 
administer the SC infusions without supervision. Once qualified, the participant or caregiver will 
continue to administer infusions at the clinic on those days when a clinic visit occurs on a dosing 
day and at an off- site location convenient to the participant on all other days. Self -administration 
or caregiver administration conducted at the clinic will be supervised to ensure that the 
participant or caregiver continues to remain compliant with the administration guidelines.  
9.6. Study Drug Accountability  
Accountability for the study drug at the study center is the responsibility of the investigator. The investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this protocol. 
Where allowed, the investigator may choose to delegate drug accountability responsibilities to a pharmacist or other appropriate individual.  
Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the study drug to carry out this protocol for 
the agreed number of participants. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the 
investigational product and placebo, documenting shipmen t content and condition. Accurate  records 
of all study drug dispensed, used, returned, and/or destroyed must be maintained. Accountability 
records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), 
and participant numbers. The sponsor or its designee will review study drug accountability at the 
study center on an ongoing basis during monitoring visits.  
Study drug must not be used for any purpose other than the present study. Study drug that has been dispensed to a participant and returned unused must not be redispensed to a different participant.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the retrieval of all returnable study supplies from 
participants.  
9.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
All unused and used study drug vials should be retained at the center until they are inventoried by [CONTACT_11200]. All used, unused, or expi[INVESTIGATOR_651496], or if authorized, disposed of at the study center per the center’s standard operating procedures and documented.

APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 54 of 117 Confidential  10. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
10.1. Retrospective Data Collection for eGFR and Measured Glomerular 
Filtration Rate  
Retrospective data will be collected on glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to calculate historical 
eGFR for up to 3 years prior to study entry, depending on the date of diagnosis (for renal 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], this refers to diagnosis of recurrent disease, not diagnosis of the original 
disease in native kidneys). Three years of retrospective data will be collected to  calculate eGFR 
for those diagnosed at least 3 years prior to randomization. Retrospective data for the period 
between randomization and diagnosis will be collected for those diagnosed less than 3  years 
prior to randomization. For historical eGFR calculations, data will be collected to enable 
calculation of eGFR by [CONTACT_9289]- EPI (with serum creatinine) in adults and by [CONTACT_651536]. Specifically, age, sex, race, height (adolescents only), serum creatinine, serum blood urea nitrogen (adolescents only), and serum cystatin C (if available) will be collected. For each participant, eGFR will be calculated using the same formu la for the duration 
of the study; the choice of formula will be determined by [CONTACT_2299]’s age at study entry. 
If a participant has historical data on measured GFR, then this data, including the method used to 
measure GFR, should also be collected (in addition to the data required to calculate eGFR in that 
participant) for the same timeframe.  
10.2. 24-Hour Urine Collection 
A [ADDRESS_874414] urinary output for the day, and then continue for a 24-hour period. Samples should be collected within ±1 week of the clinic visit (except for the 
week  24 collection, which cannot be earlier than week  24).  
In brief, the first urine (on the day of collection) must be discarded (as this is urine made prior to 
the start of the collection date/time). The time and date of this discarded void must be recorded, 
as it represents the start of the collection. The participant should then collect all urine over the next [ADDRESS_874415] collected 
void should be recorded, as it represents the end of the 24 -hour urine collection.  
There will be six 24 -hour urine collections , at the visits outlined in the schedule of activities 
(Table  2):  
• screening (between week  –8 and week –4 and before the renal biopsy)  
• week 12  
• week 24 (before the week 26 renal biopsy) 
• week 36  
• week 48 (before the week 52 renal biopsy, if performed)  
• week 60 
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 55 of 117 Confidential  If menses are occurring at the scheduled time of a 24 -hour urine collection, then the collection 
should be delayed until completion of menses, with this information recorded in the participant’s 
source document. Urine must be stored at 2 to 8 °C (ie, in refrigerator). Courier arrangements 
can be made by [CONTACT_651537][INVESTIGATOR_651489]’s home and return it to the site, or the participant may return it directly to the site. Total urine volume, total protein 
concentration, tot al albumin concentration, total β -2 microglobulin, and total creatinine 
concentration will be measured on the 24- hour urine collections, with calculation of total protein 
excretion, total albumin excretion, total creatinine excretion, total β -2 microglobulin excretion, 
uPCR, urinary albumin- to-creatinine ratio (uACR), and urinary β2- microglobulin –to-creatinine 
ratio (uBCR) based on the 24-hour collection.  
10.3. Triplicate FMU Collections 
Triplicate FMU collection is defined as a collection of first -morning urine on 3 consecutive 
mornings, with each morning urine sample collected into a separate container. Samples should 
be collected within ±1 week of the clinic visit (except for weeks 24 to 26, when sample 
collection should be within ±3 days of the clinic visit).  
It is important that each of these collections represent the first urinary output upon awakening, 
after an extended period of rest. The date and time of each collected sample should be recorded. 
In the event that a participant has an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_469719]/wake schedule, the appropriate timing for 
these spot urine collections may not be morning. In this case, the timing of the collection should be adjusted to ensure collection of the first urinary output after an extended period of rest 
(eg, at  least 6  hours), and the alternate timing should be documented in the source document. 
If menses are repeatedly occurring at the scheduled times of a triplicate FMU collection, 
the collection dates should be adjusted to avoid collection during menses to the extent possible, 
with this information recorded in the participant’s source document.  
After FMU collection, the urine samples must be stored at 2 -8 °C (ie, in a refrigerator). 
Courier arrangements can be made by [CONTACT_651537][INVESTIGATOR_651490], or the participant may return them directly to the site. Urine protein, albumin, β -2 
microglobulin, and creatinine concentrations should be measured on all spot urine samples, 
with calculation of uPCR, uACR, and uBCR values. 
Triplicate FMU collections should be before each clinic visit (ie, approximately every 4 weeks), with an additional triplicate to be collected at week  25. At each scheduled clinic visit, the site 
will dispense the number of spot urine containers needed before the next scheduled visit 
(dispense 3 containers at each visit except week  24, when 6 containers should be dispensed); 
participants will return the triplicate spot urine collections at their next visit.  
10.4. Random Spot Urine Collection  
At each clinic visit, participants will be asked to submit a urine sample. As this sample will not 
necessarily reflect a specific time of day, it is considered a “random” spot urine sample, so as to distinguish it from the first- morning spot collections. A fter collection, the urine samples must be 
stored at 2 to 8  °C (ie, in a refrigerator). Urine protein, albumin, β -2 microglobulin, and creatinine 
concentrations should be measured on all spot urine samples, with calculation of uPCR, uACR, and uBCR values.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874416] practices at the 
site, including use of anesthesia/sedation, pre-procedure evaluation (eg, laboratory testing prior 
to renal biopsy), and post-procedure observation and monitoring. The renal biopsy must include adequate material for light microscopy (7 or more glomeruli), immunofluorescence microscopy 
(3 or more glomeruli) and electron microscopy (2 or more glomeruli). Renal biopsy samples 
should be handled and processed as per the pathology manual. All renal pathology will be reviewed by [CONTACT_651538], which will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
If a coagulation panel is performed for any reason, including as a prebiopsy assessment, the use of silica reagents for this test should be avoided in participants participating in this study because of the potential for interference with pegcetacoplan.  
10.5.1. Renal Biopsies in Adults  
For adult participants, a percutaneous biopsy will be performed at the visits indicated in the schedule of activities ( Table  2).  
A renal biopsy will be performed during screening to confirm diagnosis and eligibility, and to 
serve as the baseline renal biopsy. Once participant eligibility has been confirmed on the basis of 
the assessments from screening visit 1 and the initial 24 -hour urine collection is complete as 
described in Section  10.2 , the baseline renal biopsy may be conducted at any time during 
screening. A prior renal biopsy done within 28 weeks of randomization may be used for eligibility confirmation and serve as the baseline biopsy, if confirmed as adequate per central pathology review. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_651497]. If a prior renal biopsy is used to establish eligibility and/or will serve as the baseline biopsy, images and/or slides from that biopsy will also be required. Tissue blocks and/or unstained slides may also be requested for staining at the central pathology laboratory.  
Follow- up renal biopsies will be performed at week  [ADDRESS_874417] visit of the open -label period at 
week  28. The week 52 biopsy is optional. If performed it should be after collection of the 
week  48 24-hour urine and not more than 8 wee ks after the week  52 visit. 
In the event that a participant has a renal biopsy as part of their clinical management, biopsy samples should be reviewed by [CONTACT_651539], if possible. If this biopsy includes t he required components for this study 
and is collected within the window defined above, it may serve as the week  52 biopsy. 
10.5.2. Renal Biopsies in Adolescents  
Participants younger than 18 years will be requested to provide renal biopsies in countries and at sites where permitted but are not required to do so, and refusal of a participant younger than 18 years to 
provide any or all renal biopsies will not be considered noncompliance. Renal biopsies will not be collected for research purposes from adolescent participants in the US or from adolescent participants at sites where not permitted by [CONTACT_651540] l ocal regulations.

administration, a followup - ophthalmologic evaluation, including a basic ophthalmologic 
examination, SD -OCT, and color fundus photography, is requested to occur at a convenient 
time between week  [ADDRESS_874419] procedure for measured GFR (and document the procedure within the participant’s source document) once prior to the first 
pegcetacoplan dose (but no more than [ADDRESS_874420] dose), again at week 26, and a third 
time between week 42 and week 52, inclusive. In the event that retrospective measured GFR data are available, these should be collected for the same time frame as retrospective data for calculation of 
eGFR (see Section  10.1).

Health -related quality of life (HRQoL) assessments will be completed during clinic visits as 
outlined in the schedule of activities ( Table  2). 
10.8.1. Functional Assessment of Illness Therapy –Fatigue Scale  
The FACIT -Fatigue scale is a [ADDRESS_874421] 7  days. The 5 possible responses are “Not at all” (0), “A little bit” (1), 
“Somewhat” (2), “Quite a bit” (3) and “Very much” (4). With 13 statements the total score has a 
range of 0 to 52. Before calculating the total score, some responses are reversed to en sure that 
the higher score corresponds to a higher quality of life.  
10.8.2. 5-Level EuroQol -5 Dimension  
The EQ -5D- 5L assessment is a standardized measure of health status developed to assess 
HRQoL by [CONTACT_651541]. The questionnaire consists of a descriptive system and a visual 
analog scale. The descriptive system contains 5  dimensions (mobility, self- care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) with 5 levels in each dimension.  
10.8.3. Kidney Disease Quality of Life  
The KDQOL survey is a kidney disease- specific measure of HRQoL developed by [CONTACT_651542], which is self- administered by [CONTACT_4317]. It includes a generic chronic disease 
core, and additional items relevant to patients with kidney disease, such as symptoms, burden of 
illness, social interaction, staff encouragement, and patient satisfaction. Scores are reported 
separately for each of 5 subscales.   
10.8.4. Patient Global Impression of Change  
The Patient Global Impression of Change is a 1 -item questionnaire that measures the 
participant’s impression of the change in their health and assesses whether there has been an improvement or decline in clinical status since the start of the study.  
10.8.5. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health 
Problem  
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem 
(WPAI:SHP) is a patient -reported quantitative assessment of the amount of absenteeism, 
presenteeism, and daily activity impairment attributable to a specific health proble m for working 
patients. It includes 6 questions assessing health -related work productivity loss over the previous 
7 days.

11.1. Safety Parameters  
11.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Medical history will be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the occurrence, signs, 
and symptoms of the participant’s preexisting conditions, including all prior significant illnesses, up to and including [ADDRESS_874422] to disease indication (C3G or IC -MPGN) will be 
requested, and will include prior surgeries, renal biopsies, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], dialysis, transplantation, laboratory data, and extrarenal manifestations of the disease. A vailable disease 
medical history for the 3  years preceding screening will be requested. Submission of additional 
historical data is encouraged, when available. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_651499]. If a prior renal biopsy is used for 
eligibility and/or will serve as the baseline biopsy, images and/or slides from that biopsy will 
also be required. Tissue blocks or unstained slides may also be requested for staining at the 
central pathology labo ratory.  
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be documented as AEs in accordance with Section  11.2.2. 
Additionally, demographic data will be collected for all participants, as allowed per applicable 
regulations.  
11.1.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs (body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure measurements) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the schedule of activities (Table  2). All vital signs will be measured after the participant has been resting in a sitting 
position for at least 5 minutes, except when they are supi[INVESTIGATOR_651488]/or AEs, or if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093]. Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study.  
Vital signs measurements will be repeated, if clinically significant or if machine/equipment 
errors occur. Out-of- range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], or heart rate measurements will be 
repeated, at the investigator’s discretion. Any confirmed, clinical ly significant vital signs 
measurements must be recorded as AEs.  
When pegcetacoplan is administered at the study site, vital signs will be measured within [ADDRESS_874423] day of open-label dosing 
(week  26 or week 28, depending on whether a week 26 renal biopsy is required and when it is 
performed), vital signs will also be measured approximately 30  minutes to 1  hour after dosing.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 60 of 117 Confidential  11.1.3. Weight and Height  
Body weight will be recorded at each visit. Height will be recorded at screening for adults and 
every 12 weeks throughout the study for adolescents. Height will be measured using a calibrated 
stadiometer. Both body weight and height will be assessed without shoes on.  
11.1.4. Physical Examination  
All full physical examinations, performed by [CONTACT_1719], will include, at a 
minimum, assessment of the following: general, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, dentition, thyroid 
(endocrine), heart, chest, lungs, abdomen, skin, extremities, back/neck, musculoskeletal, 
and lymph nodes.  
Brief physical examinations will include general appearance, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, 
and are to be performed at all visits where a full physical examination does not occur.  
Edema will be assessed at each visit.  Additional symptom- driven physical examinations may be performed at any time, as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_093].  See the schedule of activities ( Table  2) for the details regarding which type of physical 
examination should be given at each visit. 
11.1.5. Menses  
For WOCBP, the start and stop date of each menstrual period will be recorded in the 
participant’s source document for the duration of the study. 
11.1.6. Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be measured once, prior to dosing, at the visits outlined in the schedule of 
activities ( Table  2). The ECG will be taken following resting in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 
10 minutes in a quiet environment and prior to any blood sampling procedures. 
The ECGs will be classified as normal, having a not clinically significant abnormality, or having 
a clinically significant abnormality. In addition, ECG parameters of ventricular rate, PR interval, 
QRS duration, and QT internal (uncorrected and corrected using Fridericia’s method [QTcF]) will be reviewed for eligibility and ongoing safety. 
11.1.7. Chest Radiography 
Chest radiography will be performed prior to dosing at the visits outlined in the schedule of 
activities ( Table  2). Posterior- anterior and lateral views of the chest will be recorded via chest 
radiography; both views are required. The actual chest radiography technical procedure should 
be performed according to the site’s standard protocol. The radiographs will be classified as 
normal, having a not clinically significant abnormality, or having a clinically significant abnormality per radiology report, and this classification should be included in the source 
documentation.

11.1.13. Antidrug Antibody Assessment  
Blood samples for assessment of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) will be collected at the visits indicated 
in the schedule of activities ( Table  2). Samples will be assayed for both antibodies against 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) (anti -PEG antibodies) and antibodies against the peptide moiety of 
pegcetacoplan (anti –pegcetacoplan peptide antibodies).  
The proposed ADA sampling schedule was established to capture the ADA signal at baseline, any 
potential early onset antibody formation, and the dynamic profile (transient or persistent) of antibody 
formation while minimizing pegcetacoplan level in the samp le.  
Participants who have a treatment- emergent or treatment- boosted antidrug antibody response at any 
time will have ADA samples collected approximately every 6  months until resolution (participants 
with a treatment -boosted response will be followed until the titer returns to within four -fold of 
baseline and participants with a treatment -emergent response will be followed until there is a 
negative sample). Antibody titers will be determined for any samples that are confirmed to be positive for anti –pegcetacopla n peptide or anti -PEG antibodies, and any samples that are confirmed 
to be positive for anti –pegcetacoplan peptide antibodies will be further characterized with a 
neutralizing antibody assay.

If a participant has been tested for COVID -19, the results, if available, will be documented in the 
participant’s source document.  
11.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
11.2.1.  Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or 
not it is considered drug- related. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding , symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not it is considered related to the investigational product. TEAEs are defined as AEs that develop or worsen after the first dose of 
study medication.  
AEs can be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_4538]/or in response to an open question from the 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_651544]. All identified AEs must be recorded and descr ibed in the participant’s source 
document. Fluctuating or nonsignificant changes in laboratory values do not necessarily qualify for 
AE reporting. If these changes in laboratory values are assessed as clinically significant and/or lead 
to discontinuation of administration of investigational product, they should be reported as an AE. 
If these laboratory values are linked to a diagnosis, only the diagnosis should be reported as an AE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any AE or suspected adverse reaction that, in the view of the investigator, results in death, 
is life -threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Important medical events that may 
not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of important medical events include allergic bronchospasm requ iring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Life-threatening is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction, which, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, places the participant at immediate risk of death as it occurred. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death.  
All SAEs (irrespective of causality) must be reported to Apellis Safety immediately, no later than 
24 hours of the investigator or their representative becoming aware of the event, as described in 
Section  11.2.3.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 66 of 117 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS]. Unexpected AEs  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the reference 
safety information section of the IB that is in effect at the time of event onset.  
11.2.2. Recording and Reporting AEs  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the exit visit.  
SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level is reached, or until the 
SAE is considered by [CONTACT_651545], as appropriate.  
All SAEs that are suspected of being related to study treatment must be reported immediately to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, regardless of the time since the 
completion of the clinical trial.  
Any events that occur prior to the start of dosing will be categorized as pretreatment events; events 
occurring after the start of dosing and up to [ADDRESS_874427] dose of study medication will be 
recorded as TEAEs.  
For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset date (and time, if applicable), 
resolution date (and time, if applicable), intensity, causality, action taken, seriousness criteria met 
(if applicable), and whether or not the participant discontinued the study as a result of the event. AEs 
characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. 
If possible, the outcome of any AE resulting in permanent discontinuation or that was present at the 
end of the s tudy should be reported. AEs resulting in interruption or discontinuation of study drug or 
that are present at the exit visit should receive follow -up as appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to study drug treatment 
(not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or definitely related). The date and time of onset, 
time relationship to drug dosing, duration, severity, action taken, and outcome (recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, recovering/resolving, no t recovered/not 
resolved, fatal, or unknown) of each event will be noted. 
Table  6 should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs/SAEs to study treatment. 
Table  6: Definitions of Adverse Event Relatedness  
Classification Definition 
Definitely related  Strong evidence of a causal relationship; the influence of other factors is unlikely 
Possibly related  Some evidence of a causal relationship, but other factors may have caused or contributed 
to the event (eg, another illness or concomitant treatment)  
Unlikely related  A causal relationship is not a reasonable possibility, but it cannot be completely ruled out with the available evidence.  
Not related  No evidence of a causal relationship

APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 67 of 117 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS]. Severity of Events  
The investigator will review each event and assess its severity. Note that severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540]  [IP_ADDRESS] . An AE can be of 
severe intensity but not be considered serious.  
Table  7 presents the definitions that should be considered when evaluating the severity of AEs 
and SAEs.  
Table  7: Severity of Events  
Severity  Definition/description 
Mild  Event results in mild or transient discomfort, not requiring intervention or treatment; does not limit or 
interfere with daily activities (eg, insomnia, mild headache)  
Moderate  Event is sufficiently discomforting so as to limit or interfere with daily activities; may require 
interventional treatment (eg, febrile illness requiring oral medication)  
Severe  Event results in significant symptoms that prevents normal daily activities; may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006] (eg, anemia resulting in blood transfusion) 
11.2.3. Reporting AEs  
All SAEs must be reported to Apellis Safety by [CONTACT_651546] 24  hours of the 
investigator or their representative becoming aware of the event, whether or not the event is

A formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to locking the 
database. The full details of data presentations and analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
Additional statistical analyses other than those described in this sect ion may be performed if 
deemed appropriate and included in the SAP. Any deviations from the final SAP or from what is 
outlined in the protocol will be discussed in the final study report.  
12.1. Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately [ADDRESS_874430]-transplant, will be randomized 1:1 to pegcetacoplan or placebo with 40 to 50 participants 
per arm.  
Based on preliminary data from Study APL2 -201, a reduction of 60% in uPCR in the pegcetacoplan 
group at week 26 is assumed vs a reduction of 20% in uPCR in the placebo arm, which corresponds 
to mean log ratio to baseline of −0.92 vs −0.[ADDRESS_874431] deviation of 0.88 (on log-scale). Based on this assumption, a sample size of [ADDRESS_874432] 
90% power at 1 -sided significance level of 0.025. Considering a 10% attrition to account for 
potential missing assessments a nd impact by [CONTACT_4113] -19, it is expected that at least 78 participants 
with native kidney disease should be enrolled.  
A minimum of 63 participants with C3G in native kidneys will be enrolled, which is approximately 80% of the enrolled participants with native kidney disease. 
12.2. Analysis Set  
12.2.1. Screened Set  
The screened set  will include all participants who provide written informed consent. This set will 
be used only for the purpose of describing participant disposition. 
12.2.2. Safety Set  
The safety set  will include all participants who receive at least 1 dose of study drug in the RCP. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment they received.  
12.2.3. Intent -to-Treat Set  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) set will include all randomized participants. Participants will be 
analyzed according to their assigned treatment, regardless of the treatment actually received. 
All efficacy analyses will be performed with the ITT set.  
12.2.4. Per-Protocol Set  
The per- protocol (PP) set will include all participants in the ITT set who have not violated any 
inclusion or exclusion criteria and/or deviated from the protocol in a way that could influence their efficacy assessment. Decisions concerning the exclusion o f participants from the PP 
analysis set will be made and documented prior to database lock.

APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874433] been verified, coded, and entered into the database, a review will be 
performed to check the quality of the data, identify any outliers, and make decisions on how to 
deal with any data issues (eg, missing values, withdrawals, protoc ol deviations). After this 
review, resolution of all issues, and documentation of all decisions, the database will be locked.  
12.3. Efficacy Analysis  
12.3.1. Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The targeted treatment regimen to be used for this study is pegcetacoplan or placebo plus stable regimen for C3G/IC -MPGN treatment. The primary estimand on the treatment effect of 
pegcetacoplan is for the participant population as defined through the study inclusion/exclusion criteria, with the primary endpoint based on the log- transformed ratio of uPCR (sampled from 
first-morning urine collections) at week 26 compared to baseline using an equal-weighted 
average over weeks 24, 25, and 26.  
Population level summary is the treatment difference in the mean change from baseline in 
log-transformed ratio to baseline in uPCR of pegcetacoplan over placebo.  
A hypothetical strategy will be used for addressing the intercurrent events (ICEs) that are listed in 
ICE categories 1 and 2 in  Table  8. In the hypothetical strategy, uPCR data collected at visits after the 
occurrence of ICEs will be set as missing and will be imputed using different approaches  as 
described in Table  8. A treatment policy strategy will be used for ICEs of premature discontinuation 
of treatment (ICE category 3). In the treatment policy strategy, any measured value will be used as is.  
The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed effect model for repeated measures (MMRM). 
The model will include fixed categorical effects for treatment group, visit, disease type  
(C3G vs IC-MPGN) , stratification factors, and the visit- by-treatment group interaction, as well as the 
continuous, fixed covariate of baseline log -transformed uPCR. Initially, an unstructured covariance 
matrix will be investigated . If this analysis fails to converge, other covariance structures will be used ; 
details will be p rovided in the statistical analysis plan. The difference between treatment groups 
using a composite contrast of equal -weighted average over weeks 24, 25, and 26 will be estimated 
with its 95% CI and corresponding P value . The model will be applied to each multiply imputed data 
set, and results from each imputed data set will be combined using Rubin’s rule  (Rubin 1976).  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted using the ITT set. Supplemental analysis based on alternative estimands, analysis using the PP set, and sensitivity analyses for assessing the 
robustness of the primary analysis results will be performed and prespecified in the SAP.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2)

Abbreviations: ICE  = intercurrent event.  
12.3.2. Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
To preserve the overall type I error among the primary endpoint and key and additional secondary 
endpoints, a fixed -sequence testing strategy will be used; hence, statistical significance of the first 
secondary endpoint will be evaluated only if statistical significance is achieved with the primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint. The remaining secondary endpoint s will also adhere to this testing 
strategy, and their order will match the order in which they are presented in Section  5.2.1 .  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  
• The numbers and proportion of participants who meet the criteria for achieving a composite renal endpoint at week 26 will be tabulated by [CONTACT_36718] a logistic 
regression model with treatment group as the independent variable and adjusted for baseline 
eGFR values, baseline log -transformed uPCR values, disease type, and stratification factors. 
The P  value and odds ratio of being a responder for the pegcetacoplan group to being a 
responder for the placebo group with associated 95% CI w ill be provided.  
A participant meets the requirements of the composite renal endpoint if he/she satisfies: (1) a stable or improved eGFR compared to baseline (≤15% reduction in eGFR), 
and (2) a ≥50% reduction in uPCR compared to baseline.  
A composite strategy will be used for addressing the ICEs listed in  Table  9. In the composite 
strategy, the composite renal endpoint status at or after the occurrence of any of these ICEs below will be regarded as non-responder.

from at least 6 of the 9 FMU samples collected between the start of screening and 
day 1, inclusive. The uPCR values used to calculate baseline should include those 
from the samp les collected on day –2, day –1, and before dosing on day 1.  
2. Week  [ADDRESS_874434] 50%.

index activity score, disease type, and stratification factors. Least -square (LS) means w ill be 
presented for each treatment group, along with the between- treatment difference, 
95% confidence interval, and P value. The strategies to handle intercurrent events are the 
same as those for the primary endpoint. This endpoint will be evaluated based on adult

Country- specific modifications to this protocol are listed below.  
Additions to the protocol are marked by [CONTACT_651560], and deletions of existing protocol text 
are marked by [CONTACT_651561]. 
Canada  
Rationale for Modifications  
These modifications to the APL2- C3G-310 protocol are being implemented in Canada to support 
the Investigational Testing Authorization for the Crono Super PID infusion pump and CRN 
Crono 20-mL syringe reservoir. 
Summary of Changes  
Changes in the sections noted below will be enacted by [CONTACT_651562]. 
9.4  Infusion Supplies  
The sponsor will provide infusion supplies  supply syringes, vial adapters, infusion sets, and 
ambulatory syringe infusion pumps, as required. Refer to the pharmacy manual for further details.  
The Crono Super PID infusion pump and the CRN Crono 20 -mL syringe reservoir, which will be 
used during the clinical study to deliver each dose of the isotonic sterile solution of pegcetacoplan 
1080  mg/20 mL (54  mg/mL) transferred from the vial to the syringe, do not have a medical device 
license authorizing their commercial sale in Canada and are therefore considered investigational 
medical devices. The infusion pump and reservoir will be used in conjunction with  the Neria multi 
infusion set (MDL #[ZIP_CODE]; Unomedical Devices SA de CV, Aaholmvej 1- 3, Osted, 4320 Lejre, 
Denma rk) and the vial adaptor (MDL #[ZIP_CODE]; West Pharmaceutical Services IL, Ltd, [ADDRESS_874472], 
Ra’Anana, Israel, 4366411), which are approved for use in Canada. 
9.4.1. Investigational Medical Devices: Crono Super PID Infusion Pump and CRN Crono 
20-mL Reservoir  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Descriptions of the Investigational Medical Devices  
The Crono Super PID infusion pump is an electromechanical, software- controlled, reusable 
infusion pump manufactured by [CONTACT_651563]è SpA Medical Technology (Via Cuorgnè 42/a, [ZIP_CODE] 
Rivoli, Cascine Vica [TO], Italy) that is supplied to the participant and used throu ghout the 
duration of the study. The CRN Crono 20 -mL syringe reservoirs are sterile, nonpyrogenic, 
single-use syringes specifically for use with the Crono pumps and are supplied in individual 
sterile packaging. A new syringe reservoir is filled from the drug vial with the transfer set, 
used for one dose of pegcetacoplan, and then disposed of. During the study, infusion site/pump 
safety will be assessed during clinical visits, and any significant finding from the assessment 
will be recorded.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 98 of 117 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS]. Justification for the Use of the Investigational Medical Devices  
Apellis assessed the potential hazards associated with the delivery of the drug product in relation 
to the uses for which the pump carries a CE mark in the EU. The hazards evaluated were related 
to the required critical performance attributes, the user profile, and the use environment relevant 
to use with the drug product in the clinical trial. This assessment included testing to confirm 
performance to  the required delivery requirements and the delivery process and evaluation of the 
user population in compa rison with those for which these devices are already CE -marked for use.  
The assessment concluded that the Crono Super PID infusion pump could meet the delivery 
requirements of Study APL2 -C3G-310, does not present any unique usability issues to the user 
groups in Study APL2 -C3G-310, and does not introduce any additional or residual risks. 
The use of the investigational devices in human participants is justified on the basis of the design 
and intended uses of the device constituent parts (Canè Crono Super PID Infusion Pump and 
CRN Crono 20 -mL syringe reservoir), which are appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Anticipated Exposure to the Investigational Medical Devices  
The anticipated exposure to the investigational device is approximately 30 minutes per infusion 
twice weekly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Anticipated Adverse Device Effects 
The anticipated adverse device effects are discussed in Section  9.4.2.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Number of Investigational Devices to be Used  
The sponsor plans to open 3 sites in Canada and expects to assign to treatment 2 participants 
across the sites in Canada. Each participant assigned to treatment will receive a primary pump, 
a backup pump, and enough infusion sets for 52 weeks of biweekly infusions. Sites will be 
provided with additional pumps and infusion supplies (approximately 20% overage, rounded up). 
Actual need will depend on enrollment, but [ADDRESS_874473] complete the complaints form and email it to [EMAIL_12368] immediately, within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874474] or other appropriate individual.  
Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the investigational medical devices to 
carry out this protocol for the agreed number of participants. The investigator or designee will 
acknowledge receipt of the investigational medical devices, documenting shipment content and 
condition. Accurate records of all the investigational medical devices provided, used, returned, 
and/or destroyed must be maintained. Accountability records will include dates, quantities, 
batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and participant numbers. The sponsor or its 
designee will review the investigational medical device accountability at the study center on an 
ongoing basis during monitoring visits. 
The investigational medical devices must not be used for any purpose other than the present 
study. The investigational medical devices that have been provided to a participant and returned 
unused must not be provided to a different participant. 
9.4.5. Investigational Medical Device Handling  
All used and unused investigational medical devices should be retained at the study center until 
they are inventoried by [CONTACT_11200]. All used, unused, or expi[INVESTIGATOR_651505]. Disposition will be 
documented, or if authorized disposed of at the study center according to the center’s standard 
operating procedures and documented.

Summary of Changes  
Enrollment of Adolescent Participants  
As described in Section  7.1, Inclusion Criteria, adolescents (aged 12 -17 years)  may be enrolled 
where approved. The enrollment of adolescent participants is not approved in the Czech Republic , 
and therefore only adult participants, aged 18 years or older, will be enrolled in this country.

prior to randomization. Vaccination is mandatory unless documented evidence exists that 
participants are nonresponders to vaccination.  
Vaccinations: Section 8.2 
8.2. Vacci
nations  
To receive study drug, participants will be required to be vaccinated as follows on the basis of 
ACIP recommendations for adults or children with complement deficiencies (available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html) or other similar local guidelines.  
• N meningitidis types A, C, W, and Y: First dose at least 14 days prior to 
randomization with a second dose 2 months later, and then boosters every 5 years.  
• N meningitidis  typ e B: First dose at least [ADDRESS_874482] booster dose 1 year later, and then additional 
booster doses every 2 to 3 years.  
• S pneumoniae : pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, PCV15, or PCV20, depending 
on participant age and vaccine availability) and/or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 (PPSV23). Adults who have not previously received any pneumococcal vaccine may 
receive PCV20, if the site is able to procure it, and a subsequent dose of PPSV23 would not be required. Multiple scenarios exist depending on previous vaccination history and investigators should consult ACIP guidelines for adults or children with complement 
deficiencies or other similar local guidelines.  
• H influenzae  type B
 : Documentation of childhood vaccination or one dose at least 
[ADDRESS_874483] this documented evidence, the required missing vaccination(s) wil l be administered  as 
needed to bring participants up to date. The investigator will discuss with the medical monitor any individual participant circumstances relevant to the vaccination requirements that would 
make the above schedule not possible or reason able, or if the investigator has any questions or 
concerns about the vaccination requirements. If local or national guidelines for immunizations differ from the ACIP recommendations, the differences should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine  an appropriate course of vaccinations . On an ongoing basis, including upon 
entry into a long- term extension , participants should be reevaluated for the need for any 
additional vaccinations or boosters on the basis of ACIP recommendations.  
Vaccination serum samples will be collected on the day of vaccination before receiving vaccinations 
on that visit. These samples will be analyzed to evaluate response to vaccinations if the participant 
tests positive for infection with S pneumoniae , N meningitidis , or H influenzae .

Switzerland  
Ration
ale for Modifications  
These modifications to the APL2- C3G-310 protocol are being implemented in Switzerland to 
support the Investigational Testing Authorization for the Crono Super PID infusion pump 
(version 2).  
Summary of Changes  
Changes in the sections noted below will be enacted by [CONTACT_651562]. 
Section  9.4, Infusion Supplies  
The sponsor will provide  infusion supplies  supply syringes, vial adapters, infusion sets, and 
ambulatory syringe infusion pumps, as required. Refer to the pharmacy manual for further details.  
This clinical study is a combined trial with medical devices. The Crono Super PID infusion 
pump (version 2) is an electromechanical, software-controlled, reusable infusion pump 
manufactured by [CONTACT_651565]È S.p.A. Medical Technology (Via Cuorgnè 42/a, [ZIP_CODE] RIVOLI - 
Cascine [TO] – Italy) that is supplied to the participant and used throughout the duration of the 
study. The CRN Crono 20 mL syringe reservoirs are sterile, nonpyrogenic, single-use syringes, 
specifically for use with Crono infusion pumps. Since the init iation of this clinical study, CANÈ 
S.p.A. Medical Technology has modified the intended use of the Crono Super PID infusion 
pump, and it is no longer licensed for administration of immunoglobulins and drugs in general, 
but only for the administration of immunoglobulins. Given this change, the use of the Crono 
Super PID infusion pump in this study is considered to be investigational.  
The infusion pump and syringe reservoirs will be used in conjunction with the Neria multi -infusion 
set (Unomedical Devices S.A de C.V, Aaholmvej 1- 3, Osted, 4320 Lejre Denmark). A nd the vial 
adaptor (West Pharma. Services IL, Ltd., [ADDRESS_874484]., Ra'Anana, Israel, 4366411), which are 
conformité européenne (CE)- marked and approved for use in Switzerland. 
9.4.1 Investigational Medical Devices: Crono Super PID Infusion Pump and CRN Crono 
20 mL Syringe Reservoir  
[IP_ADDRESS] Justification for the Use of the Investigational Medical Devices  
The Crono Super PID infusion pump was selected for use in this trial as it is the only available 
subcutaneous infusion pump that enables blinded administration of pegcetacoplan or the placebo 
used in this study by [CONTACT_651566][INVESTIGATOR_651506].  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -[ADDRESS_874485] in the clinical trial. This assessment included 
testing to confirm performance to the required delivery requirements and the delivery process 
and evaluation of the user population compared with those for which these devices are already 
CE-marked for use.  
The assessment concluded that the Crono Super PID infusion pump could meet the delivery 
requirements of Study APL2‑C3G‑310, does not present any unique usability issues to the user 
groups in Study APL2‑C3G‑310, and does not introduce any additional or resi dual risks. 
The use of the investigational devices in human participants is justified based on the design and 
intended uses of the device constituent parts (Crono Super PID infusion pump and CRN Crono 
20 mL syringe reservoir), which are appropriate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of Investigational Medical Devices  
The use of this delivery system with this drug in this clinical trial does not create any risks 
additional to the residual risk inherent with the current use of these devices. There is a possibility 
that participants could experience redness, swelling, and  pain or tenderness at the site of 
infusion. There is also a slight possibility of infection. In addition, as pegcetacoplan is to be 
administered by [CONTACT_493458], participants may feel some discomfort from the infusion. 
None of these risks are affected by [CONTACT_651567].  
9.4.[ADDRESS_874486] complete the complaints form and email it to [EMAIL_12369] immediately, 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. 
The sponsor is responsible for submitting reports of device deficiencies and serious adverse 
events related to the use of investigational medical devices, as described in according to Art. 33 
para. 1 of the ClinO- MD, to SwissMedic and the device manufactur er within 72 hours of 
becoming aware of the issue. The device manufacturer will then further assess the incident per 
the timelines in the guidance and report their findings accordingly.

each clinical investigative site after written approval from the sponsor.  
A.3.1.2. Minimum Study Requirements  
A.[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Assessments  
When feasible, the full list of protocol assessments should be conducted; however, the following are the minimum study safety requirements for Study APL2‑C3G-310: 
1. Maintain dosing schedules and management per protocol guidelines 
2. Obtain key safety laboratory assessments:  
a. All laboratory assessments will be drawn at the frequency required by [CONTACT_651569] (see  Table  A1), at a minimum. Collection of more than the 
minimum activities described in  Table  A1 should continue to the extent possible, 
and investigators should resume following the full schedule of activities as 
soon as possible.  
b. In the event that the clinical investigative site is closed and/or participants are unable or unwilling to travel, participants will be referred to a certified local laboratory that can perform the required safety testing specified in  Table  A1. 
Alternatively, a home health care provider may be sent to the participant’s home to draw samples for the minimum laboratory tests required for safety testing (see Section  A.3.1.5), which may then be sent to the central laboratory or to a 
local laboratory. Use of the central laboratory is preferable whenever feasible. In the event that a local laboratory is used, the investigator will collect the local 
laboratory reports, which must be redacted in accordance with local privacy 
requirements. The laboratory results, reference ranges, units of measure, 
and format of laboratory values are to be filed with the study records.  
3. Perform minimal medical safety assessments:  
a. If the participant is unable to have an in -person assessment, the investigator 
(or delegated site staff) will have a telephone and/or video contact [CONTACT_651570] (at minimum) to solicit adverse events (including  serious 
adverse events) and concomitant medications. The appropriate forms in the electronic case report form will be completed.  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 109 of 117 Confidential  b. Serious adverse event reporting requirements are unchanged, and all serious 
adverse events are still required to be reported to Apellis within 24  hours of 
the investigator or their representative becoming aware of the event(s) .  
4. Document appropriate contact [CONTACT_6635]:  
a. At least [ADDRESS_874491] to follow -up. 
b. All communication with the participant (including failed attempts at contact) 
must be documented in the study records. 
A.[IP_ADDRESS]. Efficacy Assessments  
The participants must be able to complete the following assessments to continue in the trial:  
• Renal biopsies during screening and at week 26 (adult participants only) 
• Triplicate first -morning urine collection during screening and at weeks 26 and 52 
• Serum chemistry and hematology during screening and at weeks 26 and 52 
A.3.1.3. Screening  
A.[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Screening  
A participant cannot be considered for screening using the minimum study requirements. The screening and baseline assessments must remain unchanged and must be completed in their 
entirety. The sponsor may decide to pause screening at any point because of the COVID-19 
pandemic, at which point sites will be notified and should not attempt to screen new participants. 
For sites continuing at full capacity (and not using the minimum study requirements),  
the investigator should assess and appropriately document the risk/benefit of participants 
continuing to come to the clinic for visits. These sites may continue to screen new participants 
using the protocol-outlined procedures.  
A.[IP_ADDRESS]. Institutional Screening for Public Health or Clinical Purposes  
A.[IP_ADDRESS].1. Mandatory Clinical Screening Procedures  
According to local guidance, if an institution implements mandatory public health screening 
procedures related to a public health emergency (eg, COVID -19, measles, etc) for all individuals 
coming into that institution, inclusive of research participants, IRB approval is not required 
before screening procedures ar e implemented. Additionally, because these screening procedures 
are not research procedures, the institution does not require IRB approval to share results with a 
public health authority or research participants, although adherence to other permissions or 
notice restrictions remain under applicable law and/or policy (see Section A.3.1.12).  
Pegcetacoplan (APL -2) 
APL2‑C3G -310 Protocol Amendment 4  25 April  2024 
Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 110 of 117 Confidential  A.[IP_ADDRESS].2. Excluded Public Health Surveillance Activities  
Some types of public health surveillance activities, including collection and testing of 
information or biospecimens, conducted, supported, requested, ordered, required, or authorized 
by a public health authority, may be conducted per local, regional, and national regulation and guidance as applicable (see Section  A.3.1.12).  
If a public health authority authorizes general screening for COVID -[ADDRESS_874492] positive for COVID -19. 
If a research participant tests positive for COVID -19 
1. Follow the clinical recommendations of the study site and public health authorities to manage the infection.  
2. Follow the notification requirements of the study site and public health authorities. 
Investigators should inform the participant of the required reporting of 
results.  Note:  The results of the COVID -[ADDRESS_874493] result meets criteria for withdrawal from the study, or for reporting as a serious adverse event by [CONTACT_651571]/ethics 
committees and/or health authorities as required per local guidelines.  
A.3.1.5. COVID- [ADDRESS_874494] COVID -19 should be made by [CONTACT_444244], with consideration of 
local and national vaccination recommendations and a benef it-risk assessment. Vaccination is not 
mandatory for continued study participation.  
Apellis is currently not aware of any contraindications to vaccination (of any modality) and concurrent treatment with pegcetacoplan. Precaution should be taken when vaccinating 
participants with any concurrent illnesses that may affect the efficacy or safety of vaccination (eg, complement -activating condition) and as indicated by [CONTACT_651572].  
All vaccinations (including boosters) should be recorded as concomitant medications. 
The information should include the type of COVID -[ADDRESS_874495] 
medical events related to vaccination should be captured in the participants source document and 
should include the timing in relation to the vaccine. Any questions shou ld be directed to the medical 
monitor or study team.

Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc Page 111 of 117 Confidential  A.3.1.6. Home Health Care Provider  
In the event that the clinical investigative site is closed and/or participants are unable or unwilling to 
travel, home health care providers (HHCPs) may be used to perform study activities, such as the 
below, with participants’ consent:  
• Blood draw  
• Investigational product administration  
• Investigational product accountability 
• Study assessments 
HHCPs will be required to follow all safety precautions set by [CONTACT_651573]/regulations prior to and after contact [CONTACT_46144](s). HHCPs will summarize the activities completed, including any reported AEs, at the visit in a home visit report, which will be provided to the clinical investigative 
site for review and to file in the study records.  
A.3.1.7.  Monitoring  
Remote monitoring measures may be implemented with participants’ consent in accordance with local and institutional guidelines. Methods to review and perform remote monitoring will be outlined 
in the sponsor’s clinical monitoring plan.  
A.3.1.8.  Investigational Product  
To ensure that participants can continue treatment during the COVID -19 public health emergency 
and the associated changes with these clinical trials, additional study drug may need to be dispensed 
to participants or shipped to their homes. Additional dispe nsation of study drug and/or direct 
shipment of study drug to participants’ homes will only be implemented if permitted by [CONTACT_427], in conjunction with participant consent and corresponding ethics committee and competent authority approval, as re quired. Participants are to return all study drug to the investigator 
site once on -site visits are permitted to enable full study drug accountability.  
A.3.1.9.  Regulatory Considerations  
Actions taken as a result of the COVID -19 public health emergency (protocol deviations, urgent 
safety measures, etc) that fall outside of standard clinical trial conduct guidance and regulations should be documented as appropriate in the study file. Ensure  compliance with all local, regional, 
and national regulation and guidance, as applicable. 
A.3.1.10.  Statistical Considerations  
In accordance with the local, regional, and national guidelines, the SAP for the study might need to 
be updated on the basis of the guidance provided by [CONTACT_651574] -19

NOTE : When multiple assessments/procedures occur at the same visit, order should be: vital signs, ECGs, blood collection/sampling, study drug dosing.  
a) All visit 2 assessments need not occur in a single visit and visit 2 can be split into multiple visits (eg, visit  2a, visit  2b). 
b) Vaccinations, baseline renal biopsy, and screening chest radiography can occur any time during screening after confirmation of eligibility based on visit 1 data.  
c) For transplant participants only. Must be documented prior to randomization.  
d) Vaccine series should be initiated at least 14 days prior to randomization; additional vaccines may be required at visit 6. P lease see Section  8.2 for more details on 
vaccination requirements. Vaccination serum samples will be collected on the day of vaccination prior to receiving vaccinations on that visit. These samples will be 
analyzed to evaluate response to vaccinations in the event that the participant has a positive infection for Streptococcus pneumoniae , Neisseria  meningitidis , 
or Haemophilus influenzae .  
e) A full physical examination is required at visits 1, 3 (week  1), 10 (week 26), and 16 (week  52). A full physical examination should also be conducted on the first day of 
open-label dosing, if that not at the week  26 visit. Brief physical examinations, including weight (kg) and assessment of edema, will be conducted at all other visits n oted. 
A symptom -driven physical examination may be performed at any time, at the investigator’s discretion. Body height (cm) will be measured only during screening for 
adults but will be measured at screening as well as every 12 weeks throughout the study for adolescents; weight (kg) will be measured throughout study, during brief and 
full physical examinations for all participants. Both body weight and height will be assessed without shoes on; height will be measured using a calibrated stadiometer. 
Edema should be assessed at every visit.  
f) Renal biopsies will not be required for participants under the age of 18, provided they have an adequate prior renal biopsy to establish the diagnosis as per the central 
pathology laboratory.  
g) The week  [ADDRESS_874496] visit of the open- label period at week  28. Participants younger than 18  years are not required to 
provide renal biopsies and may advance to the open-label period upon completion of all assessments for weeks 24 through 26 other than the renal biopsy.  
h) The week  52 renal biopsy is optional for all participants. If performed it should be after collection of the week  48 24-hour urine and FMU samples and not more than 
8 weeks after the week  52 visit, In the event that a participant has a renal biopsy as part of their clinical management within this window, it may serve as the week  52 
biopsy provided that it includes the required components for this study.   
i) Study drug will be self- administered by [CONTACT_651528], after receiving appropriate training and sign-off by a research nurse (or other 
qualified personnel) in their first treatment week, as described in Section 9.5. Once qualified, the participant or caregiver should administer study drug at site visits 
(as done at home) on those days when a clinic visit occurs on a dosing day. In the event that a home nurse is administering study  drug on nonvisit days, then the site staff 
may administer study drug on days of site visits.  
j) Between site visits, participants will be instructed to report any infusion site reaction to the study staff. Pump use safety will be reviewed by [CONTACT_651577] (ie, investigator or nurse) for each study drug administration at clinic visits and during at -home qualification.  
k) Vital signs should be measured a maximum of [ADDRESS_874497] day of open-label dosing (week  26 or week 28, depending on 
whether a week  26 renal biopsy is required and when it is performed), vital signs should also be measured approximately [ADDRESS_874498] 5 minutes, except when they are supi[INVESTIGATOR_651488]/or AEs, or if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].

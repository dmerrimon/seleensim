For these reasons, it has become the preferred method of anesthesia for cesarean delivery.1–3  A spi[INVESTIGATOR_100113] a one-time injection of numbing medicine (local anesthetic) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_100114].  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_100115] a limited duration.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_100116] a duration of one to two hours.  Currently, if that duration is exceeded patients must have general endotracheal anesthesia.  Suboptimal surgical anesthesia is not uncommon with neuraxial anesthesia. In a prospective observational study of 3568 cesarean deliveries, Rukuwe et al found a 9% incidence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_100117].4 The rate of required conversion from regional to general anesthesia was found to be 2% for elective cesarean sections,5 and 5% when a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_100118]6.

In 1975 Ranney et al described using intraperitoneal local anesthetic (IPLA) instillation in 218 patients that underwent cesarean section under local field block alone.9  Patients were administered up to 100 ml of 1% procaine.  Some of this was injected into the skin and fascia, and the remainder was diluted to 0.5% and “spi[INVESTIGATOR_54073]” into the peritoneum.[ADDRESS_110298] surfaced showing that IPLA can treat intraoperative pain, prevent postoperative nausea, decrease early postoperative pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499], and shorten hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. 10–[ADDRESS_110299] study evaluating 2-chloroprocaine (3%) as an effective agent for IPLA administration.  Chloroprocaine is advantageous due to its short plasma half-life (11 to 21 seconds) and the possibility of significant vascular uptake when poured into a surgical wound that may have open venous channels.17    Our long-term goal is for intraperitoneal chloroprocaine to be used as an alternative option to avoid general anesthesia during cesarean sections, to alleviate women’s discomfort from surgical pain, reduce complications, and improve the birth experience.  To achieve our goal, we need to accomplish the following aims: (1) Determine the amount of chloroprocaine that is absorbed into the blood after intraperitoneal administration to ensure that blood levels are low and do not raise safety concerns, (2) define a safe dose of chloroprocaine for intraperitoneal administration and (3) Demonstrate that intraperitoneal chloroprocaine decreases intraoperative pain, decreases the use of rescue sedatives and opi[INVESTIGATOR_100119], and can be used as a safe alternative to help women avoid general anesthesia.  Aim 3 will be pursued after the completion of Aim 1 and Aim 2. This protocol only addresses Aim 1 and Aim 2.

There is no generally agreed upon threshold for the upper limit of “low” chloroprocaine plasma concentrations.  In mice studies the median lethal dose of chloroprocaine with intravenous administration is 97 mg/kg and the median lethal dose with subcutaneous administration is 950 mg/kg18.   The lowest concentration of intravascular chloroprocaine that has been reported to cause symptoms of systemic toxicity in humans is 2.8 mg/kg19.  For purposes of this study, low plasma concentration will be defined as less than 0.97 mg/kg or 1/100 of the median lethal dose in mice.  Aim 2: Primary Objective   To define a safe concentration of chloroprocaine for intraperitoneal administration using a parallel dose comparison study.    STUDY OVERVIEW  Aims 1 & 2 Study Design: Phase I Safety and Dose Finding Trial Phase  Design:  Open label, uncontrolled, single center, parallel group, multiple dose escalation study  Intervention: Three level doses are planned for administration after delivery of the baby [CONTACT_4490] [ADDRESS_110300] per dose level: (Dose level 1) 40 ml of preservative-free 1% chloroprocaine; (Dose level 2) 40 ml of preservative-free 2% chloroprocaine; and (Dose level 3) 40 ml of preservative-free 3% chloroprocaine.  The planned dose escalation scheme may be altered based upon emerging pharmacokinetic and tolerability results.  Enrollment of each dose cohort will not occur until data analysis is complete for the previous dose cohort.  Number of Subjects: 15 subjects will be enrolled with 5 subjects per dose level.  Research Integrity: The study will be assessed for initial approval by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) at OHSU, Portland, OR, [LOCATION_003], and given a unique identifier for ongoing review.  Study Location: Single center study performed at OHSU in Portland, OR, [LOCATION_003].  Subjects will be called at home prior to the date of their scheduled surgery to assess interest.  Subjects will be enrolled and consented at a preoperative visit or on the labor and delivery unit (OHSU Floor 12C) on the day of their scheduled surgery.  All study interventions will occur in the preoperative area for 12C, the operating rooms on 12C, or in the Post-Anesthesia Care Unit on 12C.  Data collection will occur in the operating room and in the PACU.      Timeline: In a review of scheduled cesarean sections from 9/1/17 to 3/31/18, a total of 99 cases were found.  Assuming 25% enrollment we should be able to enroll the necessary [ADDRESS_110301] per week.

First, the research coordinator will review the electronic medical record to screen for vulnerable population status.  Second, the research coordinator will consult with the labor and delivery nurse caring for the patient to ensure that the patient is not included in a vulnerable population.     Due to the nature of the study, pregnant subjects will have to be enrolled to obtain the medical knowledge that we seek.  We have attempted to minimize risk by [CONTACT_100148].  A very small quantity of drug may possibly be transferred to the fetus through breast milk, but we believe the risk to the fetus is not greater than minimal.  Chloroprocaine has a long history of safe use in pregnant women and the maternal half-life is very short (mean 11.2 seconds, SD 2.8 seconds).  In this manner, the drug concentration can be considered to be negligible after 45 seconds (4 half-lives), which is long before first latch.

To accomplish aims 1 and 2, we propose a safety trial in which 15 healthy patients scheduled for elective cesarean sections under spi[INVESTIGATOR_100124].    Before starting the cesarean section, the following baseline demographic data will be collected: • Maternal age • Height • Weight at time of cesarean delivery • Body mass index at time of cesarean delivery • Gestational age • Parity • History of previous cesarean delivery • History of previous abdominal surgery  All subjects will receive a spi[INVESTIGATOR_100125] a standardized solution containing 1.6 mL of hyperbaric 0.75% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 15 mcg fentanyl, and 150 mcg preservative-free morphine.  Subjects will receive a 1 liter co-load of crystalloid (Ringer’s Lactate or Normal Saline) solution during spi[INVESTIGATOR_100126].  The patient will then be positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_100127] a bump under their right hip to maintain left lateral tilt position.  Non-invasive blood pressures will be obtained every 2 minutes after spi[INVESTIGATOR_100128] a phenylephrine infusion will be started at 0.4 mcg/kg/min and titrated to maintain maternal blood pressure within 20% of baseline.  In accordance with standard practice all patients will have telemetry monitoring during surgery and during PACU recovery.  After obtaining spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227], an intravenous line will be placed into the subject’s lower extremity for study purposes.  The subject’s lower extremity will be numb at this time, which should help to minimize discomfort.  Immediately after the intravenous line is placed [ADDRESS_110305]’s dibucaine number.  This blood will be placed in a purple top tube and kept by [CONTACT_100150].  No special temperature control is necessary. The purple top tube will then be walked to the clinical core lab.  The core lab will send the sample to the ARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City for analysis. The official title of the Dibucaine number test is “Pseudocholinesterase, Dibucaine Inhibition,” lab order LAB00576 in EPIC. The turnaround time for the lab is 2-6 business days. The dibucaine number will be used to differentiate subjects with decreased butyrylcholinesterase (plasma cholinesterase) enzyme function.  Butyrylcholinesterase is the enzyme responsible for metabolizing chloroprocaine. Dibucaine is an amide local anesthetic that inhibits normal butyrylcholinesterase. In normal individuals, dibucaine will inhibit 80% of enzyme activity, which corresponds to a dibucaine number of 80. Dibucaine numbers less than 70 are associated with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_100129]. Around 1.3% of the population is known to have atypi[INVESTIGATOR_100130]. Prior to skin incision the study drug will be transferred to a sterile receptacle on the surgical scrub field.

The uterus, parietal peritoneum and fascia will be closed according to obstetrician preference.    After receiving intraperitoneal chloroprocaine a small volume of blood will be taken from the lower extremity venous line (the lower extremity will be numb from spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227]) at 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after chloroprocaine instillation. Plasma samples will be mixed with a cholinesterase inhibitor to prevent hydrolysis after blood collection. A custom assay for measuring plasma concentrations of chloroprocaine and its major metabolite, chloroaminobenzoic acid, has been established in the Bioanalytical Shared Resource/Pharmacokinetics Core Lab showing good sensitivity and accuracy (see accompanying document “Chloroprocaine stability, sensitivity, and accuracy curves). This was accomplished by [CONTACT_100152]. PK study will allow us to determine the plasma concentration-time profile after intraperitoneal chloroprocaine administration.  A research coordinator will be with the patient throughout their time in the operating room and the PACU.  Active, non-standard of care, monitoring for the following signs and symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity will occur in the operating room and PACU at the following time intervals after chloroprocaine administration: 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, upon PACU arrival and upon discharge from the PACU: • seizures • tinnitus • metallic taste • anxiety • agitation • muscle twitching • sedation • respi[INVESTIGATOR_100131] (sat < 88%) • dizziness • nausea • vomiting • vision changes • paresthesias • perioral numbness • hypotension (drop in MAP > 20% within 5 minutes of chloroprocaine administration) • arrhythmias Manifestations of significant systemic local anesthetic toxicity will prompt saline lavage of the abdomen with 60 ml of 0.9% normal saline followed by [CONTACT_100153].  For purposes of this study, significant clinical manifestations will include the following: seizures, respi[INVESTIGATOR_100131] (sat < 88%), hypotension (drop in MAP > 20%), any arrhythmias associated with hypotension, and cardiac arrest.

The investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authorities access to the patient’s original medical records, including medical history, laboratory studies, and medication administrations, for verification of data gathered and to audit the data collection process. This information will be accessed for the duration of the research study, including the follow-up period, for the purpose of data reconciliation. The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_4913].  PROVISIONS TO MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF SUBJECTS DSMP submitted as a separate document.  A finding of plasma chloroprocaine concentrations > 0.97 mg/kg will halt the study and we will immediately (within two working days) report the finding to the IRB.  In addition, the exposed patient will be notified and the medical team will be notified.  Due to the short plasma half-life of chloroprocaine patients will have cleared the drug long before any data on plasma concentrations can be obtained. Significant clinical manifestations of local anesthetic systemic toxicity will similarly halt the study and prompt immediate (within two working days) notification of the IRB.  In addition, all medical teams involved in the patient’s care will be notified and the patient will receive a detailed summary of the event upon resolution of the event.  In the scenario that the patient lacks the ability to comprehend the adverse event the patient’s family will be notified.  For purposes of this study significant clinical manifestations will include the following: • Seizures • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_100135] (sat < 88%) • Hypotension defined as a greater then 20% drop in mean arterial pressure within 5 minutes of receiving chloroprocaine • Any arrhythmias associated with hypotension • Cardiac Arrest  RISKS AND BENEFITS Risks to Subjects As with all studies, breach of confidentiality is a common risk.  In addition, there is the possibility of slightly increased anxiety on the day of surgery for patients approached for inclusion in the study.  There is also likely to be a loss of free time in the preoperative area as consent and study education will likely take 20 minutes to complete. As data collection will continue to occur throughout the patient’s surgery and postoperative care, inconvenience is possible.  Chloroprocaine has a long history of safe use and is assumed to have a low potential for systemic toxicity because of its very short maternal (mean 11.2 seconds, SD 2.8)20 and fetal plasma half-life (mean 15.4 seconds, SD 5.2)20 and relatively high maximum recommended dosage (11 mg/kg without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]).

In a review of reported cases of local anesthetic systemic toxicity published in 2015 there were no cases of local anesthetic systemic toxicity attributed to chloroprocaine.21  A search of PubMed and Google revealed 3 articles that describe systemic toxicity from chloroprocaine19,23,24.  Cladis et al24 described a 30 second self-limited wide complex bradycardia after a 30 mg/kg inadvertent vascular injection through a caudal catheter in a 2 month old infant.  Hernandez et al23 described a 40 second self-limited seizure after a 28.7 mg/kg inadvertent vascular injection through a paravertebral catheter in a [ADDRESS_110311] intravenous injection of 200 to 400 mg of chloroprocaine into patients with an average weight of 70 kg (2.8-5.7 mg/kg).  Symptoms lasted 3 to 11 minutes and included the following: dizziness (34 patients), tinnitus (13 patients), metallic taste (10 patients), nausea or vomiting (4 patients), and slight bradycardia (2 patients).  None of the patients described in any of the 3 articles had any long term morbidity or mortality19,23,24.   Chloroprocaine has been touted as the preferred local anesthetic for providing epi[INVESTIGATOR_100136] a decompensating fetus because it does not participate in ion trappi[INVESTIGATOR_100137]. Local anesthetics are weak bases which become ionized when exposed to acidotic environments.  Ion trappi[INVESTIGATOR_100138]-ionized local anesthetics cross the placenta and become ionized by [CONTACT_100155], compared to maternal blood pH.  After local anesthetics become ionized they cannot cross back into maternal circulation.  Accumulating local anesthetic causes the fetus to become more acidotic which results in more ion trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Placental transfer of chloroprocaine has not been shown to be influenced by [CONTACT_100156].25  Literature describing chloroprocaine instillation into the intraperitoneal space is sparse.  Accordingly, there is a possibility of local anesthetic systemic toxicity in this study.  To this extent adverse experience reporting will include monitoring for and publishing the occurrence of any of the following adverse events associated with chloroprocaine instillation:  • Seizures • Tinnitus • Metallic taste • Anxiety • Agitation • Muscle twitching • Sedation • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_100135] (sat < 88%) • Dizziness • Nausea • Vomiting • vision changes • paresthesias

Potential Benefits to Subjects We are performing this study because the incidence of intraoperative pain during cesarean sections is high and standard practice in developed countries is to induce general endotracheal anesthesia when spi[INVESTIGATOR_100139].  General endotracheal anesthesia in the pregnant population is associated with an increased incidence of pulmonary and airway complications, compared to neuraxial anesthesia.   Furthermore, general anesthesia hinders early maternal-baby [CONTACT_100157].  Whether intraperitoneal chloroprocaine can safely and effectively treat intraoperative pain is unknown.  We anticipate that patients that receive intraperitoneal chloroprocaine will have less intraoperative pain, require less systemic narcotics, and have less nausea.  Intraperitoneal chloroprocaine may also decrease the need to convert to general endotracheal anesthesia during cesarean sections.  While the purpose of this study is not to assess intraoperative pain, narcotic usage, and nausea, patients may still receive these benefits.  DRUGS  Chloroprocaine is an ester type local anesthetic that decreases pain by [CONTACT_100158].  It is available as a 1%, 2% and a 3% solution.  On labor and delivery at OHSU we stock 20 ml vials of 2-chloroprocaine (3%).  There are case reports of neurologic complications after chloroprocaine injection into the intrathecal space.  There are now thought to be related to the preservative sodium bisulfate.26  Consequently, the chloroprocaine stocked at OHSU is preservative free.  Chloroprocaine is FDA approved as well as approved for OHSU use by [CONTACT_100159]. FDA indications include infiltration, nerve block, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], epi[INVESTIGATOR_100140].  Chloroprocaine is not FDA approved for intraperitoneal lavage. It was introduced into anesthetic practice decades ago and has been used safely to provide rapid and reliable epi[INVESTIGATOR_100141]. The mean in vitro half-life of chloroprocaine in maternal and fetal plasma is 11.2 seconds (SD 2.8) and 15.4 seconds (SD 5.2), respectively.20  Placental transfer of chloroprocaine is minimal because of the drug’s high rate of metabolism.  The chloroprocaine available in the anesthesia cart will be used for intraperitoneal administration.  A researcher involved in the study will dilute chloroprocaine to the desired concentration with sterile saline.    Each patient will be administered all 40 ml of study solution.  There will not be residual medication after patient administration that requires disposal.  Any unused study drugs at the conclusion of the study will be destroyed at OHSU in a manner consistent with ICH/GCP guidelines, city of Portland regulations, state of Oregon regulations, federal policy, and OHSU institutional policy.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1  Study Disease  
 
 2.1.1  Colon Cancer Background and Treatment Options  
Colorectal cancer  (CRC)  is the third most common cancer in the [LOCATION_002] with an 
estimated 136,830 new cases and 50,310 deaths in 2014  [1].  Approximately  20-25% of CRC 
patients will have distant metastatic disease  at the time of diagnosis, and a n additional  40-
50% of patients will eventually develop  CRC liver metastases ( CRCLM ) [2].  While treatment 
of early stage disease is highly successful with 5 -year survival rates over 70%, this rate drops 
to approximately 10% in the metastatic setting.  Front -line treatment options for metastatic 
[ADDRESS_712840] line setting , regorafenib and TAS -102,  but 
these are typi[INVESTIGATOR_544990] a re of limited benefit.  
 
 2.1.2  Colorectal c ancer and Immune function  
Significant progress has been made in the characterization of colorectal tumor micro -
environment, and there is evidence that CRC is an immune sensitive malignancy. Regulatory 
T cells accu mulate in CRC and as a consequence suppress cytotoxic and helper T -cell activity 
[Svensson 2012] . More importantly, there is strong evidence that the presence of immune 
cells in CRC is predictive of patient outcomes. Intratumoral density of T cells includi ng 
cytotoxic (CD8+) and memory (CD45RO+) has been shown to negatively correlate with risk 
of recurrence in early stage CRC [Pages 2009] . In any stage of disease, decreased density of 
CD8+ lymphocytic infiltrate is associated with primary tumor grow th and metastatic 
progression [Mlecnik 2011, Pages 2005] . Efforts by [CONTACT_545029] T -cell infiltration significantly predicts disease -free and overall 
survival. Further, T -cell infiltration of liver metastases i s common, and positiv ely correlates 
with survival [Katz 2013] . Improved survival is significantly associated with number of CD4+ 
and a higher proportion of CD8+ T -cells, while worse outcomes are seen with greater 
proportions of Treg cells. There is a stron g association between the presence of a cytotoxic 
infiltrate and disease control at any stage and at metastatic sites of disease.  
 
 2.1.[ADDRESS_712841] study of PD -1 blockade with the antibody 
pembrolizumab report excellent diseas e control in this population [Le 2015] . 78% of 
patients demonstrated immune -related progression free survival and 40% had an immune -
related objective response. Within the same study, all patients with microsatellite stable 
disease progressed on therapy. This suggests that the re are important difference between 
the MSI and MSS populations, and that checkpoint blockade monother apy is likely to be 
insufficient to generate a response in the majority of MSS patients.

 4 2.2.1  Durvalumab  Background  
Durvalumab  is a human immunoglobulin G (IgG)[ADDRESS_712842] human  
PD-L1. Durvalumab  is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and has an overall molecular  
weight of approximately 149 kDa. Durvalumab  selectively binds with high affinity to human 
PD-L1 and blocks its ability to bind to the PD-1 and CD80  receptors, respectively . The 
fragm ent crystallizable (Fc) domain of durvalumab  contains a triple mutation in the 
constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement 
component C1q and the Fc gamma receptors responsible for mediating antibody -
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [38]. 
 
2.2.2  Durvalumab  Pre-Clinical Experience  
Programmed cell death 1 (CD279) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of  
molecules involved in regulation of T -cell activation. It is found on T cells, B cells,  
macrophages, NK cells, dendritic cells, and mast cells. It has  also been described on  
peripheral tissues including cardiac endothelium, lung, small intestine, keratinocytes, islet  
cells of the pancreas, and syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta as well as a variety of tumor  
cell types [39-45]. Programmed  cell death ligand 1 (CD274, B7 -H1) is constitutively 
expressed on many hematopoietic cells, but may be upregulated in hematopoietic a nd non -
hematopoietic cells. Regulation of PD -L1 is mediated, in part, by [CONTACT_24975] I and type II interferon 
(IFN). Programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2; B7 -DC) was identified in 2001 [43, 46] . Its 
expression is far more restricted and is confined to hematopoietic cells. Engagement of PD -
1 on T cells inhibits activation with downstream effec ts on cytokine production, 
proliferation, cell survival, and transcription factors associated with effector T -cell function 
[47-52]. 
 
Durvalumab  has shown the following activity as an anti -PD-L1 molecule:  
• Durvalumab  binds to PD -L1 and blocks its interaction with PD -1 and CD80.  
• Durvalumab  can relieve PD -L1-mediated suppression of human T -cell activation in vitro.  
• Durvalumab  inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model via a T -cell-dependent  
mechanism.  
• A surrogate an ti-mouse PD -L1 antibody resulted in improved survival in a syngeneic  tumor 
model as monotherapy and resulted in complete tumor regression in > 50% of  treated 
mice when given in combination with chemotherapy.  
• In the same study, anti -mouse PD -L1 antibody -treated mice were completely tumor free  3 
months after tumor implantation and demonstrated long -term immunity during  re-
challenge.  
• In a subsequent study in the same syngeneic model, the combination of an anti -mouse  
PD-L1 antibody and anti -CTLA -4 antibody resulted in complete tumor regression in all  
mice treated.

 5 • Prevalence of PD -L1 expression on the surface of human tumors, ranging from  
approximately 0% to 35%, was demonstrated in a broad survey of samples derived from  
tumor types of interest.  
 
The cynom olgus monkey is considered to be the only relevant nonclinical species for  
evaluation of local and systemic toxicities of Durvalumab . In addition, in vivo in cynomolgus  
monkeys, Durvalumab  suppresses soluble programmed cell death ligand 1 (sPD -L1) in serum  
and fully occupi[INVESTIGATOR_544991] -L1 on various leukocyte subsets at doses equal to or more  
than 0.1 mg/kg (lowest dose tested) with a dose -related duration of suppression and  
occupancy.  
 
In general, there were no Durvalumab -related adverse effects in toxicology studies 
conducted  in cynomolgus monkeys with Durvalumab  that were of relevance to humans. 
Adverse findings  in the non -Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) pharmacokinetic 
(PK)/pharmacodyn amic and  dose range -finding study (4 doses over 5 weeks), and a GLP 4 -
week repeat -dose toxicity  study were consistent with antidrug antibody (ADA) -associated 
morbidity and mortality in  individual animals. The spectrum of findings, especially the 
clinical s igns and microscopic  pathology, in a single animal in the GLP, 4 -week, repeat -dose 
study was also consistent with  ADA immune complex deposition, and ADA: Durvalumab  
immune complexes were identified  in a subsequent non -GLP, investigative 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC) study. Similar  observations have been reported by 
[CONTACT_545030] . 
Given that immunogenicity of human mAbs in  nonclinical species is not generally predictive 
of responses in humans, the  ADA -associated  morbidity and mortality were not taken into 
consideration for the determination of the  no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of 
Durvalumab . Interim audited data from the  dosing phase of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 3 -month GLP 
toxicity study with Durvalu mab  in cynomolgus  monkeys showed that subchronic dosing of 
Durvalumab  was not associated with any adverse  effects. Therefore, the NOAEL of 
Durvalumab  in all the general toxicity studies was  considered to be  100 mg/kg, the highest 
dose tested in these studies. In addition to the in vivo  toxicology data, no unexpected 
membrane binding of Durvalumab  to human or cynomolgus  monkey tissues was observed 
in GLP tissue cross -reactivity studies using normal human and  cynomolgus monkey tissues. 
Finally, in vitro cytokine release studies showed that  Durvalumab  did not induce cytokine  
release in blood from any donor.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_712843] been 
exposed to 1 or more doses of durvalumab in ESR/IITs. Estimates of overall cumulative 
patient  exposure based on actual exposure data from any completed clinical trials  and the  
enrolment/randomisation schemes for ongoing open label and blinded trials are:  [ADDRESS_712844] -
marketing exposure to durvalumab from May 2017 to the 12 July 2017  was estimated to be 
approximately 1.46 patient -years.  
 
Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108: NSCLC: As of 24 October  2016,  304 NSCLC patients had  
received durvalumab monotherapy  of whom 272 comprised the full analysis set (FAS, 
defined as all patients who  had measurable disease at baseline per blinded independent 
central review [BICR] and who had  an opportunity to be followed for at least 24 weeks by 
[CONTACT_941] D CO date of the 24 October 2016. The objective response rate ( ORR ), was 22.6 % and 
4.6% in PD -L1 positive  (defined as having tumour cells [TX ] ≥25%)  and negative patients,  
respectively. The 12 -month OS rate was 55.8% an d 38.8% in PD -L1 positive and negative  
patients, respectively. HNSCC : As of 29 April 2016, 62 patients with recurrent/metastatic  
SCCHN had received durvalumab monotherapy. Among seven responders, six patients had a  
DOR for ≥[ADDRESS_712845] DOR being  19.8 months. Six and 12 month OS is 62% and  
42%, respectively. Urothelial Carcinoma: As of DCO on 24 October 2016 , 191 patients had  
been enrolled into the urothelial cell cohort.  The ORR was numerically higher  in the PD -L1 
high (TC ≥25% or IC ≥25%) subgro up (27.6%) compared with the PD -L1 low/negative (TC 
<25% and IC <25%) subgroup (5.1%); and 17.8% overall regardless of PDL1  expression. The 
median TTR was 1.41 months (range 1.2 to 7.2); the median DOR has not  yet been reached 
(range 0.9+ to 19.9+). At the  DCO, 26 of 34 responders (76.5%) had an  ongoing response; 17 
patients had a DOR  ≥ 6 months and 10 patients had a DOR ≥9 months.  The disease control 
rate (DCR, defined as any complete response (CR)/partial response (PR) or  stable disease 
(SD) >6 weeks) by [CONTACT_545031] 36.6% (95% CI: 29.8, 43.9). The  median PFS by [CONTACT_545032] 1.5 months (95% CI: 1.4, 1.9). The PFS rate at 6 months  was 21.7% (95% CI: 
15.8, 28.3). The median OS was 18.2 months (95% CI: 8.1, not  estimable); the OS rate at 6, 9 
and 12 months was 64.0% (95% CI: 56.2, 70.9), 57.5% (95% CI:  47.2, 66.5), and 55.0% (95% 
CI: 43.9, 64.7), respectively. Results for all efficacy endpoints  were similar between the UC 
cohort (As -treated Population) and the 2L+ post -platinum UC  subgr oup (As -treated 
Population).  HCC: Of the 970 patients in the total 10 mg/kg group, [ADDRESS_712846] v1.1 was 10% (95% CI: 2.8, 23.7). Th e median PFS was 2.7 
months (95%  CI: 1.4, 5.3). The PFS rate at 12 months was 20.7% (95% CI: 9.2, 35.3). The 
median OS was  13.2 months (95% CI: 6.3, 21.1); the OS rate at 6, 9 and 12 months was 
76.5% (95% CI: 59.6,  87.0), 62.3% (95% CI: 44.7, 75.8) and 56. 1% (95% CI: 38.4, 70.5), 
respectively. Other indications: In PD -L1 unselected patients, the ORR, based on investigator 
assessment per RECIST v1.1, ranged from  0% in uveal melanoma to 17.4% in advanced 
cutaneous melanoma, and DCR -24w ranged from  4.2% in TNB C to 39.1% in advanced 
cutaneous melanoma. Across the PD -L1 high tumours,  ORR was >10% for advanced 
cutaneous melanoma (33.3%). In the PD -L1 positive subset, DCR -24w was >10% in advanced 
cutaneous melanoma (66.7%).  
 
Study D4190C00007: As of the DCO of [ADDRESS_712847] overall responses were mCR in 13 patients (32.5%); 
SD in  6 patients (15.0%); and PD in 12 patients (30.0%). The remaining 9 patients (22.5%) 
did not  meet the criteria for complet e remission, mCR, partial remission, SD, or PD at the 
date of  assessment.  
 
ATLANTIC: A total of 444 patients were enrolled and treated in ATLANTIC (111 in Cohort 1  
[EGFR/ALK+], 265 in Cohort 2 [ERK/ALK wild type] and 68 in Cohort 3 [ERK/ALK wild  
type] [TC ≥90%]). Of these 444 patients, 28 (6.3%) patients were still on treatment at the 
time  of the 03 June 2016 DCO, and 78 (17.6%) patients had completed [ADDRESS_712848] 2 prior systemic treatment 
regimens  across various subgroups. In the PD -L1 unselected patients (ie, pre -enrichment) in 
the EGFR/ALK wild type/unknown Cohort 2, the ORR was 10.4% (95% CI: 6.2, 16. 2). The  
response rate in Cohort 2 was numerically higher in the PD -L1 high (TC ≥25%) patients  
compared with PD -L1 low/negative patients (16.4%, 95% CI: 10.8, 23.5; versus 7.5%, 95% CI:  
3.1, 14.9). In all cohorts, the response rate was similar between the n on-squamous patients 
and the full population with the same PD -L1 expression cut off. The response rate was 
numerically  higher with the higher PD -L1 cut off (TC ≥90%): 30.9% (95% CI: 20.2, 43.3) in 
Cohort 3 (TC  ≥90%) and 23.2% (95% CI: 16.4, 31.1) in the co mbined Cohorts 2 and 3 with 
PD-L1 TC ≥90%.  Responses were observed in the EGFR/ALK+ Cohort 1, but the rate was 
generally lower than  the other cohorts (12.2%, 95% CI: 5.7, 21.8 for the PD -L1 high [TC 
≥25%] group; 3.6%, 95%  CI: 0.1, 18.3 for the PD -L1 low/ne gative group). Good durability 
was seen across responders.  For patients who responded, the response was durable across 
various subgroups (median DOR  in Cohort 2, which had 12 months of follow up: not reached 
for the PD -L1 unselected group;  12.3 months in t he PD -L1 high [TC ≥25%] group; and not

 8 reached for the PD -L1 low/negative  group). However, the data were limited by [CONTACT_545033] -up for Cohort 1 (EGFR/ALK+)  and Cohort 3 (TC ≥90%), which had at least [ADDRESS_712849]  in the PD -L1 high (TC ≥25%) patients with the OS rate 
at 6 and 12 months of 67.4%  and 47.7%, respectively, in Cohort 2. For the PD -L1 unselected 
patients, the OS rate at 6 and  12 months was 58.4% and 37.9%, respectively. For the PD -L1 
low/negative patient s, the OS  rate at 6 and 12 months was 60.3% and 34.5%, respectively.  
 
PACIFIC: As of the DCO, 13 February 2017, 476 and 237 patients with NSCLC were  
randomized  to the durvalumab and placebo arms respectively. The median PFS by [CONTACT_545034] (16.8 months [95% CI: 13.0, 18.1]) 
compared  with placebo (5.6 months [95% CI: 4.6, 7.8]); stratified hazard ratio for disease 
progression or  death, 0.52; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.65; p<0.001. The 12 month PFS rate was 55.9% 
(95% CI: 51.0,  60.4) with durvalumab vs 35.3% (95% CI: 29.0, 41.7) with placebo and the 18 
month PFS rate  was 44.2% (95% CI: 37.7, 50.5) with durvalumab vs 27.0% (95% CI: 19.9, 
34.5) with placebo.  PFS improvement with durvalumab was demonstrated across all pre -
specified  subgroups and  irrespective of pre -cCRT PD -L1 expression (hazard ratios, 0.59; 95% 
CI: 0.43, 0.82 for  TC <25%, and 0.41; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.65 for TC ≥25%).  
 
ORR was 28.4% (126/443 patients; 95% CI: 24.3, 32.9) in the durvalumab group compared  
with 16.0% (34/213 patients; 95% CI: 11.3, 21.6) in the placebo group. OS data were  
considered immature at the time of analysis.  
 
The median DOR was longer in the durvalumab group; 72.8% vs 46.8% of patients had  
ongoing response at 18 months compared with placebo. Th e median time to death or 
distant  metastasis was longer with durvalumab than with placebo (23.2 months vs 14.6 
months;  P<0.001).  
 
HAWK: As of the DCO, 31 March 2017, 111 patients with HNSCC were treated with  
durvalumab, had measurable disease at baseline a nd were evaluable. Durvalumab  
demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumour activity in patients with PD -L1 high (≥25% 
TC) HNSCC. ORR, based on BICR assessment using RECIST v1.1 was 16.2% (95% CI: 9.90,  
24.41). The median duration of treatment was 3.45 mon ths (range 0.3 to 12.2 months) and 
the median time to onset of response was 2.0 months (range 1.64 to 9.20 months). 
Responses  appeared durable with 55% of patients having ongoing responses at the DCO. 
The median PFS  was 2.1 months (95% CI: 1.9, 3.7). The m edian OS was  7.1 months (95% CI: 
4.9, 9.9); the OS  rate at 12 months was 33.6% (95% CI: 24.8, 42.7).

melanoma  treated with the combination of durvalumab and BRAFi/MEKi, 65 patie nts were 
evaluable for  response (DCO [ADDRESS_712850] 2015). A total of 37 patients (54.4%) had a best 
overall response of  confirmed or unconfirmed CR and PR. The confirmed DCR (CR + PR + SD) 
for ≥12 weeks  was 73.5%.  
 
All [ADDRESS_712851] 1 AE  
(Table 34). Overall, the most frequently reported (>10% patients) AEs (all grades, regardless  
of causality) in order of decreasing frequency were diarrhea  (58.2%); fatigue (47.8%); 
pyrexia  (41.8%); vomiting (37.3%); chills and nausea (32.8% each); decreased appetite 
(31.3%);  arthralgia and rash (28.4% each); pruritus (26.9%); asthenia and edema  peripheral 
(25.4%  each); constipation, cough and headache (23.9% each); dry mouth (22.4%); 
dyspnoea (20.9%);  anemia , blood cr eatine phosphokinase increased and dermatitis 
acneiform (19.4% each);  abdominal pain and rash maculo -papular (17.9% each); AST 
increased, folliculitis and myalgia  (16.4% each); ALT increased, hyperhidrosis and insomnia 
(14.9% each); dizziness and pain in  extremity (13.4%); back pain, influenza -like symptoms 
and night sweats (11.9%); and alopecia  and hypertension (10.4%).  
 
Thirty -four of 67 treated patients (50.7%) reported SAEs. SAEs occurring in >1 patient by

Ten patients (14.9%) permanently discontinued treatment with investigational products due 
to AEs. These events included choroidal effusion, GGT increased, infusion -related reaction, 
ILD, liver function test increased, platelet count dec reased, oedema, paraesthesia,  
tubulointerstitial  nephritis and transaminases increased (1 patient each).  Three deaths have 
been reported in this study. One death from Cohort A resulted from an event  of metastases 
to meninges, [ADDRESS_712852].  A total of 61 patients (91.0%) treated with 
study drugs experienced at lea st 1 AESI (Table 35).  The most common AESI was (grouped 
term) diarrhea  (39 patients [58.2%]). Other common  AESIs (grouped term) were: rash (35 
patients [52.2%]); dermatitis (28 patients [41.8%]); select  hepatic events (16 patients 
[23.9%]); and select rena l events (9 patients [13.4%]). There was an  increased incidence of 
[ADDRESS_712853] renal events  categories compared to the 
durvalumab monotherapy pool.  
 
The PK profiles of durvalumab as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab are  
described based on data from key studies.  Based on population PK  
modelling, the estimated half -life of durvalumab is approximately 17 days following 10 
mg/kg  Q2W dose. Durvalumab monotherapy (Study CD -ON-MEDI4736 -1108): As of [ADDRESS_712854] been treated with 
durvalumab 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or  15 mg/kg Q3W (dose escalation), 10 mg/kg Q2W 
(dose -expansion), and 20 mg/kg Q4W  (dose -exploration) durvalumab administered as an iv 
infusion over [ADDRESS_712855] iv dose, durvalumab exhibited nonlinear PK at 
doses <3 mg/kg Q2W likely due to  saturable target -mediated CL and exhibited linear PK at 
doses ≥3 mg/kg Q2W. The  AUC0 -14 increased dose -proportionally at doses of 3 to 20 mg/kg 
and more than dose proportionally at  doses of <3 mg/kg, likely due to saturable target -
mediated CL. Cmax increased in a  dose -proportional manner within the dose range 
examined. The steady sta te was achieved at  approximately Week 16. Accumulation of 
durvalumab was observed following repeated  dosing. Mean AR ranged from 0.64 to 1.87 
and 3. 16 to 4.93 for Cmax and Ctrough, respectively.  
 
The ADA profiles of durvalumab as monotherapy and in combina tion with tremelimumab 
are described based on data from key studies.  Durvalumab monotherapy (Study CD -ON-
MEDI4736 -1108): As of 24 October  2016, a total of  835 patients provided samples for ADA 
analysis. Only 26 of 835 patients ( 3.1% ) were ADA positive. Thr ee patients were nAb 
positive.  Based on population PK covariate analysis, ADA positive status was  not associated 
with a clinically relevant reduction of exposure to durvalumab. At the 10 mg/kg  Q2W dose, 
sPD-L1 suppression in ADA positive patients was simil ar to that observed in ADA  negative 
patients. The relevance of ADA on safety and efficacy is unknown given the small  number of 
ADA positive patients.  Details on the safety and efficacy profile of durvalumab monotherapy 
and in combination with BRAF/MEKi  are listed above. Refer to the current durvalumab 
Investigator’s Brochure  (v11) for a complete summary of non -clinical and clinical 
information including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics.  
 
 
2.2.4  Trametinib background  
Trametinib ([COMPANY_004]/NOVARTIS1120212) is a selective MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitor with selective 
activity towards BRAF and RAS mutant cancer cell lines and hematopoietic cancer cells from 
AML and CML origins.  Trametinib inhibited the proliferation of most of the BR AF mutant 
2017 -0514

Page 11 
 
 11 melanoma cell lines tested (22 of 25), and it effectively inhibited the growth of BRAF mutant 
melanoma xenografts in vivo alone or in combination with dabrafenib.  It causes inhibition 
of ERK phosphorylation leading to G1 cell cycle arrest and tu mor xenograft growth 
inhibition in vivo following oral dosing.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Biochemical characterization  
The in vitro activity of trametinib was evaluated using recombinant kinase domains of 
various kinases to determine the potency and selectivity of the compound.  Trametinib was 
shown to be a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/M EK2).  In 
a 3 protein coupled -enzyme system using BRAFV600E or truncated c -RAF and inactive MEK1 
or MEK2 and inactive ERK, trametinib strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK (IC50s 
3.5 to 11 nM). Further investigations demonstrated the ability of tra metinib to block BRAF 
catalyzed MEK1/MEK2 activation by [CONTACT_545036]1/MEK2 (IC50 
=0.7 and 0.9 nM, respectively) as well as its ability to inhibit the kinase activity of 
phosphorylated MEK1/MEK2 (IC50=13.2 and 10.7 nM, respectively).  Additional studies 
showed that trametinib strongly bound to the unphosphorylated MEK1 and had a very slow 
off-rate.  Phospho -mappi[INVESTIGATOR_544992] (LC -MS) 
identified that trametinib blocks phosphorylation of Ser218 and no t Ser222 on MEK1 by 
[CONTACT_545037]600E.  Inhibition by [CONTACT_545038].   
 
Trametinib was evaluated to see if it had any direct action on molecules up -stream of 
MEK1/MEK2 in the MAP kinase pathway.  Trametinib did not inhibit BRAF or CRAF kin ase 
activity, as it did not affect the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) mediated by 
[CONTACT_545039] [ADDRESS_712856] 44 other kinases screened at [COMPANY_004]/NOVARTIS (IC50>10 
 M) 
and against [ADDRESS_712857] at a single concentra tion (inhibition <50% at 10 μM). It did not affect specific 
ligand bindings to [ADDRESS_712858] that trametinib is a non -ATP competitive, 
allosteric binding inhibitor, and hence does not share the promiscuity observed with ATP -
competitive kinase inhibitors.  Therefore, trametinib is highly specific for the MEK1 and  
MEK2 kinases (Section [IP_ADDRESS].2) and is unlikely to have any significant off -target 
pharmacological activity.  
 
In summary, trametinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2 kinase 
activity.

2.2.5  Trametinib Pre-Clinical Experience  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Safety Pharmacology  
In an exploratory modified neurobehavioral screen, a single oral dose of 100 mg/kg 
trametinib was administered to male rats.  Subsequent studies showed that this dose leads 
to morbidity and mortality.  Inhibition of body weight gain, diarrhea, prone positi on, 
blepharoptosis, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2657], reduced spontaneous locomotion and mydriasis, were 
observed between [ADDRESS_712859] any significant 
effects on general behavior, physiologic function or acute neurotoxicity.  
 
No significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_544993] 0.125 mg/kg 
trametinib as assessed by [CONTACT_545040].  A 
dose of 0.125 mg/kg produced a mild, transient decrease in body temperature (up to 0.8 °C) 
at [ADDRESS_712860] dose, which by [CONTACT_545041].  
However, this dose was not tolerated in repeat dose studies in rats due to significant dermal 
toxicity.   
 
Trametinib inhibited hERG channel repolarization in HEK293 cells with an IC 50 of 1.54 μM 
(950 ng/mL).  To determine the pot ential effect of hERG inhibition, a rabbit left ventricular 
wedge assay was performed, which demonstrated that trametinib had no significant effect 
on QT interval at concentrations up to 30 μM ([ZIP_CODE] ng/mL; limit of solubility).  However, 
significant decre ases in isometric contractile force occurred at concentrations of 10 μM 
(6150 ng/mL) and 30 μM. Trametinib also decreased the Tp -e interval at a concentration of 
30 μM.  These effects occurred at concentrations which far exceed clinical exposures (Cmax 
of 22 ng/mL) at the therapeutic dose of 2 mg/day.  
 
In an exploratory assessment of potential effects of trametinib on cardiovascular function, a 
single intravenous infusion of trametinib in dogs at 1 mg/kg (a dose that when given orally 
produced acute, severe  morbidity) over 10 minutes (Cmax of 2.5 μM or 1500 ng/mL) 
produced no changes in electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, blood pressure or heart rate 
during the 30 minute measurement period.  In the definitive oral cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study in dogs, single oral doses up to 0.075 mg/kg in dogs (a dose that 
produced morbidity following repeat dosing) produced no changes in arterial blood 
pressure, heart rate, body temperature or ECG intervals, including QTc.  
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 13 
 
 13  
In summary, while trametinib demonstra ted effects on cardiac electrophysiology in vitro, 
the concentrations at which these effects were observed far exceed the free fraction 
concentrations of tolerated exposures in repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs and 
steady state exposures in sub jects at the proposed clinical dose of 2 mg/day.  To date, there 
have been few significant clinical QTc or ECG effects observed in subjects taking trametinib.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism in Animals  
The nonclinical pharmacokinetics of trametinib were similar across the species (mouse, rat, 
dog and monkey).  Low plasma clearance relative to liver blood flow and generally long half -
lives likely contribute to the accumulation upon repeat dosing which is consistent with 
observations in huma ns.  Upon achieving steady -state, by 7 days for mice and by 3 weeks 
for rats and dogs (based on sparse sampling study design), the exposure of trametinib 
generally increased dose proportionally, which is consistent with observations in humans 
(steady state  appeared to be achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 15).  
 
The volume of distribution of trametinib was generally greater than total body water for all 
species, consistent with the observed wide distribution to tissues in the rat. There was no 
selective association of drug -related material with melanin containing tissues. Plasma 
protein binding was high in nonclinical species and humans (>95%).  In vitro blood cell 
association in humans was concentration dependent with a high blood to plasma ratio 
(ranged from 3 to 8) at the c linically relevant trametinib concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/mL.  
Nonclinical species, including rats and dogs, showed protracted elimination of DRM (Drug 
Related Material) consistent with a high volume of distribution, long half -life, and the PK 
data of tr ametinib in subjects with solid tumors.  
 
Absorption and systemic availability in nonclinical species and humans was moderate to 
high (>40% to approximately 100%).  After absorption, the fecal route of elimination was 
the major excretory pathway in humans, rats and dogs.  In humans, trametinib is eliminated 
predominantly by [CONTACT_545042], either deacetylation alone (M5) or in 
combination with mono -oxygenation (M7). The enzymes involved are likely hydrolytic 
enzymes, such as esterases or amidases t hat are not generally associated with drug 
interaction risks.   
 
For the nonclinical species, trametinib was the major circulating component (> 60% of DRM) 
in plasma at all sampling time points.  In humans, trametinib partitions in red blood cells 
and the majority of the circulating radioactivity is present as trametinib in blood (78 -95% of 
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 14 
 
 14 DRM). Three minor metabolites M5, M6 and M7 were identified with the deacetylated 
metabolite (M5), which was shown to have similar in vitro pharmacological activity as 
parent, accounting for ≤11% of plasma (rat and dog) or blood DRM (human).  In an earlier 
investigation of plasma metabolites in humans following repeat dosing, the metabolites do 
not appear to accumulate to the same degree as parent.  Qualitatively, all of the major 
metabolites of trametinib observed in humans have been detected in the nonclinical 
species.  
 
Based on in vitro studies, trametinib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2D6 
and CYP3A4.  Although trametinib was found to be an in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C8, CYP2C9 
and 2C19, inducer of CYP3A4 and inhibitor of the transporters (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, Pgp and 
BCRP), its low efficacious dose, and low clinical systemic concentration (22.2 ng/mL or 0.04 
μM at 2 mg) relative to the in vitro inhibitio n/induction potency suggests an overall low 
potential for drug -drug interactions.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicology findings associated with trametinib administration to mice, rats 
and dogs are consistent with pharmacologically mediated changes as a result of 
MEK1/MEK2 inhibition and disruption of MAPK signaling pathways.  Trametinib caused 
adverse effects in a variety of tissues and systems (skin, gastrointestinal tract, phosphate 
homeostasis, liver, ovary, bone and hematological tissues) mainly at doses ≥0.03 
mg/kg/day.  The majority of the findings in mice and dogs appeared to be related to effects 
within the gastrointestinal tract, where in mice, effects were observed at or above clinical 
exposures and primarily consisted of perforation of the colon with secondary peritonitis and 
degeneration/necrosis of the glandular mucosa of the stomach, and in dogs presented 
clinically as decreased body weight, decreased food consumption and/or fecal 
abnormalities and occurred at subclinical exposures. In rats, tolerability was more 
dependent on changes occurring in skin over time and its effect on impair ed barrier 
function.  These findings may be related to those seen in the clinic in the form of skin rashes 
and diarrhea.  Rats were more sensitive to trametinib with liver, phosphate homeostasis, 
soft tissue mineralization, bone, hematopoietic and ovary ef fects occurring at ≥0.016 
mg/kg/day.  Hepatic toxicity in rats given trametinib consisted of increased serum 
transaminases and, in mice and rats at higher doses, hepatocellular necrosis.  
Hyperphosphatemia and physeal thickening occurred in rats given tram etinib and is likely 
caused by [CONTACT_545043] -dependent FGF signaling in kidney and bone, respectively.  
Hematological changes consisted of decreased bone marrow cellularity and, at higher 
doses, hematopoietic cell necrosis.  While minor hematology chan ges have been observed 
[ADDRESS_712861] not demonstrated increased serum 
phosphorus.  
 
In 13 week  studies, systemic exposures (AUC) at the MTD in rats or NOAEL in dogs, which 
was also the MTD, were 0.3 - and 0.4 -times clinical steady state AUC, respectively.  In the 26 
week mouse study, the MTD was 0.1 mg/kg/day which was 1.0 -times clinical steady stat e 
AUC.  
 
Trametinib may impair female fertility in humans based on the reduction of corpora lutea in 
rats (0.3 -times clinical steady state AUC).  There were no effects on male reproductive 
organs in toxicology studies in rats or dogs, indicating that tramet inib is unlikely to affect 
male fertility.  In embryofetal development studies, maternal toxicity and developmental 
toxicity, including total loss of pregnancy and post -implantation loss, were observed in rats 
and/or rabbits given trametinib (0.3 - and 0.1 -times clinical steady state AUC, respectively).  
These effects are consistent with literature reports that inhibition of MEK1/MEK2 activity 
impacts granulosa cell survival and folliculogenesis, while genetic ablation of MEK1, ERK2 or 
skin-restricted MEK1/M EK2 has been shown to cause embryolethality and decreased 
progeny size.  Taken together, trametinib treatment may result in adverse effects on 
pregnancy.  There are no adequate and well -controlled studies of trametinib in pregnant 
women.  Women of childbea ring potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant 
while receiving treatment with trametinib. It is not known if trametinib is excreted in milk.  
 
The principal effects of trametinib in juvenile rats were on growth (body weight and long 
bone length ) and in bone, phosphate homeostasis, eye, skin, liver, heart and female 
reproductive system effects, consisting of a delay in a physical landmark of sexual maturity 
and mammary gland development, lower corpora lutea and lower ovarian weights.  All of 
the female reproductive effects were reversible.  With the exception of corneal 
mineralization/dystrophy and increased heart weight, similar effects have been observed in 
adult animals given trametinib.   
 
The genotoxicity assessments conducted indicate that t rametinib does not present a 
genotoxic hazard to humans. The requirement for male patients taking trametinib to use 
contraception with female partners of child bearing potential is not recommended based on 
absence of genotoxicity, no effects on male reprod uctive tissues in nonclinical toxicity 
studies, and the minimal potential for trametinib  exposure of females via semen.   
 
Although the concentration of trametinib in semen is unknown in humans and animals, 
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 16 
 
 16 trametinib was non -genotoxic in preclinical in v ivo and in vitro genotoxicity studies 
suggesting that the human risk to induce transmissible genetic damage via sperm from male 
subjects to female partners is low.   The risk for exposure to a female partner of a man 
receiving trametinib therapy is also co nsidered to be low based of the following assessment.   
At a daily dose of 2 mg, the estimated Cmax is 22 ng/mL.  Assuming a similar disposition into 
semen, the estimated daily dose of trametinib to a pregnant partner via semen (assuming 2 
ejaculations/day  and 5 mL/ejaculation) would be 220 ng.  The mean trametinib Cmax 
following an IV microtracer dose of 5 ug in humans was determined to be 0.105 ng/mL 
[Study MEK115064: Determination of the Absolute Bioavailability of Trametinib Following a 
Single Oral Dose  Co-Administered with an Intravenous Radiolabelled Microdose of 
Trametinib in Subjects with Solid Tumors].  Assuming dose -exposure proportionality via 
intravenous administration, an intravenous dose of 220 ng would result in a Cmax of 
0.[ZIP_CODE] ng/mL.  In pr egnant rats, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for embryo 
fetal development effects was 0.016 mg/kg/day (mean AUC of 52.3 ng.h/mL and Cmax of 
2.79 ng/mL), however in pregnant rabbits a NOAEL was not determined with the lowest 
observed adverse ef fect level (LOAEL) for maternal and embryo fetal development effects 
being 0.039 mg/kg/day (mean AUC of 31.9 ng.h/mL and Cmax of 2.10 ng/mL).  Based on 
these data and assuming 100% absorption of trametinib from semen, the estimated 
exposure via semen would  be approximately 1/450th the oral exposure (0.[ZIP_CODE] ng/mL/ 
2.10 ng/mL) achieved at the LOAEL dose for rabbit maternal and embryofetal toxicity and 
approximately 1/600th the oral exposure (0.[ZIP_CODE] ng/mL/ 2.79 ng/mL) achieved at the 
NOAEL dose in pregnant r ats.  Taken together, this would suggest that the risk of 
embryofetal developmental toxicity as a consequence of exposure to female pregnant 
partners is very low.  
 
In conclusion, the toxic potential of trametinib has been characterized in a comprehensive 
battery of preclinical studies.  The effects observed in preclinical studies were generally, 
either directly or indirectly, associated with the pharmacologic inhibition of MEK1/MEK2 by 
[CONTACT_545044].  The 
data from these preclinical studies support the clinical use of trametinib under the proposed 
dose regimen.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_712862] of trametinib in subjects with a variety of refractory cancers is currently under 
evaluation in 9 clinical studies which are ongoing and 13 completed studies as of the IB 
cutoff date.  Trametinib has been administered as monotherapy in 12 of the se studies, and 
as combination therapy in the other 10 studies.  Two additional ongoing studies are part of 
2017 -0514

Trametinib pharmacokinetics were determined after single - and repeat -dose oral 
administration of trametinib tablets i n subjects with solid tumors.  Trametinib is absorbed 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_544994] 1.50 hours after single oral administration of 
trametinib under fasting conditions.  The absolute oral bioavailability of a single trametinib 
2.0 mg tablet i s moderate to high (72%) relative to a co -administered IV microdose. Single -
dose administration of trametinib with a high -fat, high -calorie meal resulted in a 70% 
decrease in maximum observed concentration (Cmax), a 24% decrease in area under the 
concentra tion-time curve from time zero (pre -dose) to last time point (AUC(0 -t)) and a 10% 
decrease in AUC extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0 -τ)) compared to fasted conditions.  
 
Following repeat -dosing the mean area under the curve (AUC0 -τ) and maximum 
concentrations (Cmax) increased in an approximately dose proportional manner.  
Trametinib accumulates with repeat dosing with a mean accumulation ratio at the 
recommended dose of 2 mg once daily of 5.97 and a terminal half -life of 5.3 days 
determined after single dose ad ministration.  Steady state appears to be achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 
15, with little difference in pre -dose (trough) concentration at the end of the dosing interval 
(Cτ), Cmax and area under the concentration -time curve from time zero (pre -dose) to 24 hrs 
(AUC(0 -24)) between Days 15 and 21.   
 
Trametinib is a low extraction ratio drug based on plasma IV clearance of 3.21 L/hr, which 
represents approximately 1% of liver blood flow.  Trametinib has a high volume of 
distribution (Vd) of 1060 L determined following an IV microdose.   
 
Fecal excretion is the major route of elimination after [14C] trametinib oral dose, accounting 
for >80% of excreted radioactivity recovered (or 39.2 and 35.0% of the radioactive dose in 2 
subjects) while urinary excretion accounted for <19% of excreted radioactivity recovered 
(<10% of the radioactive dose).  Following a single dose of [14C]-trametinib, approximately 
50% of circulating radioactivity is represented as the parent compound. However, based on 
metabolite profiling after repeat  dosing of trametinib, ≥75% of drug -related material in 
plasma is the parent compound.  
 
In vitro  and in vivo data suggest that trametinib is unlikely to affect the PK of other drugs 
and that the PK of trametinib is unlikely to be affected by [CONTACT_351508].  Trametinib is 
metabolized predominantly via deacetylation which is likely mediated by [CONTACT_545045], nor is it a substrate 
2017 -0514

 18 of P-gp or BCRP.  
 
Based on the adverse events (AEs) observed in the dose escalation phase of the first -time -
in-human (FTIH) study MEK111054, the maximum tolerated dose was established at 3.0 mg 
once daily, and the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of trametinib was identified as 2.0 
mg once daily.  
 
In the 12 monotherapy  studies of trametinib for which data are available, all studies except 
one had AEs. In the studies with AEs, 50% to 100% of all subjects in any dose group had at 
least 1 AE, and 0% to 70% of all subjects in any dose group had at least 1 SAE.  Of the studi es 
with discontinuations or withdrawals, 3% to 26% of subjects receiving trametinib 
permanently discontinued study treatment or withdrew due to AEs.  
 
Of the >700 subjects (including crossover subjects) in the 2.0 mg dose group, in 8 
monotherapy studies with AEs, 50% to 100% of subjects had at least 1 AE, and 0% to 70% of 
all subjects had SAEs.  Of the studies with discontinuations or withdrawals, 3% to 24% in the 
2.[ADDRESS_712863] common AEs 
had were rash, diarrhea, fatigue, peripheral edema, nausea, acneiform dermatitis, vomiting, 
constipation, anemia, pruritus, alopecia, hypertension, decre ased appetite, dyspnea and dry 
skin.  
 
Of the >700 subjects in the 10 combination therapy studies of trametinib, 97% to 100% of 
subjects in any trametinib dose group had at least 1 AE, and 33% to 53% of subjects in any 
trametinib dose group had at least 1 SAE, and 5% to 26% permanently discontinued study 
treatment or withdrew due to AEs. In the combination trials for which data are available, 
the most common AEs had were fatigue, diarrhea, mucosal inflammation, 
thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, rash, pyre xia, neutropenia, decreased appetite, 
acneiform dermatitis, anemia, peripheral edema, constipation, and stomatitis.  
 
Table 1.3: Selected Adverse Reactions Occurring in >10% of Patients Receiving Trametinib. 
Patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation -positi ve metastatic melanoma received either 
2 mg trametinib orally once daily or chemotherapy with either dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 
every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. In this study, 9% of patients receiving 
trametinib experienced adverse reaction s resulting in permanent discontinuation of trial 
[ADDRESS_712864] common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of 
trametinib were decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), pneumonitis, renal 
failure, diarrhea, and rash. A dverse reactions led to dose reductions in 27% of patients 
treated with trametinib. Rash and decreased LVEF were the most common reasons cited for 
dose reductions of trametinib.

2.3  Rationale  
We hypothesize that the efficacy of immune -checkpoint inhibitors in microsatellite stable 
(MSS) CRC can be enhanced by [CONTACT_545046] T -cell activation of the intratumoral 
environment. We believe that combining systemic administration of MEK inhibition  with an 
anti PD -L1 antibody will augment this T -cell activation in metastatic, MSS CRC.  
Tregs accumulate in CRC and, as a consequence, suppress cytotox ic and helper T -cell activity . 
Improved survival is significantly associated with number of CD4+ and a h igher proportion of 
CD8+ T -cells, while worse outcomes are seen with greater proportions of Treg cells. 
Importantly, while CRC has a relatively high degree of mutational heterogeneity [4], TCGA 
[ADDRESS_712865] ed [5]. These findings suggest 
that immune stimulation in combination with checkpoint blockade inhibition may be more 
effective than checkpoint blockade monotherapy.  
To activate the immune response in MSS disease, a different strategy is needed. G enetic 
differences between mismatch repair proficient and deficient patients correlate with 
differences in the tumor immune microenvironment that impact sensitivity to checkpoint 
blockade t herapy. Llosa and colleagues [Llosa 2015]  interrogated the immune 
microenvironment between a subset of CRC primary tumors that were either micro -satellite 
high or stable. They convincingly demonstrate that tumor immune microenvironment is 
distinct between these populations. Specifically, relative to MSS disease, MSI-high CRC is 
characterized by [CONTACT_545047] T -cells with both cytotoxic and Th1 phenotypes, 
but also expression of high levels of inhibitory immune surface marke rs such as PD -1, PD -L1,

MEK inhibition has been shown to alter the immune microe nvironment in tumors. In pre -
clinical models, Trametinib has been shown to have anti -tumor effects on the CT26 tumor 
model. This murine colorectal tumor cell line contains homozygous KRAS  G12D mutation 
and MAPK1/MET amplifications [Castle 2014]. Liu et al showed that while Trametinib has 
modest suppression of tumors in vivo , this effect is enhanced by [CONTACT_545048] -1 or 
PD-L1 blockade [Liu 2015]. Survival was also improved with combination therapy over either 
agent in monotherapy. Further, when timed with a 1 -week lead in with Trametinib, a 
significant improvement in survival was observed.  
 
A preliminary phase 1 study  (n=20)  utilizing a different PD1 and MEK inhibitor  demonstrated 
efficacy of this combination with a 20%  response rate in KRAS mutant CRC (all partial 
responses)  [Bendall et al, 2016 ASCO Annual Meeting] . An additional 20% of patients 
experienced stable disease (lasting >6 months in 3 patients).  No DLTs were observed. 
Further, these agents in combination had  no therapy related grade 4 AEs and a 35% rate of 
grade 3 AEs, including diarrhea (9%), fatigue (4%), rash (4%), nausea (4%), maculopapular 
rash (4%), AST increase (4%), and vomiting. These were mostly attributable to the MEKi, 
with a 17% discontinuation r ate for the MEKi. The most common AEs included diarrhea 
(70%), fatigue (52%), dermatitis acneiform (44%), rash (35%), nausea (26%), maculopapular 
rash (26%), pruritis (26%), AST increase (22%), creatinine increase (22%), peripheral edema 
(17%), stomatitis (17%), and vomiting (17%).

 21 We believe that the combination of Durvalumab (a PD -L1 antibody) with Trametinib (MEK 
inhibitor) will be effective and safe in patients with metastatic MSS colorectal cancer . 
 
Rationale for fixed dosing  
 
A population PK model wa s developed for durvalumab using monotherapy data from a 
Phase I study (study 1108; N=292; doses= 0.1 to 10 mg/kg Q2W or 15 mg/kg Q3W; solid 
tumors). Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body weight (WT) on the PK 
of durvalumab (coefficien t of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body WT -based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and 
fixed dosing (750 mg Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_545049] (5th, median and 95th percentiles) using the population PK model. 
A fixed dose of 750 mg  was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body WT 
of ~75 kg). A total of 1000 subjects were simulated using body WT distribution of 40 –[ADDRESS_712866] been reported by [CONTACT_2312] ( 32-35). Wang and colleagues investigated 12 
monoclonal antibodies and found that fixed and body s ize-based dosing perform similarly, 
with fixed dosing being better for 7 of 12 antibodies ( 34)]. In addition, they investigated [ADDRESS_712867] variability in pharmacokinetic/  
pharmacodynamics parameters ( 36).  
 
A fixed dosing approach is preferred by [CONTACT_27645]. Given expectation of similar pharmacokinetic exposure and 
variabili ty, we considered it feasible to switch to fixed dosing regimens. Based on average 
body WT of 75 kg, a fixed dose of 1500 mg Q4W durvalumab (equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W) 
is included in the current study.

database online at https://clinicaltrials.gov/  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.[ADDRESS_712884] 
patients will be enrolled at the target doses for the combination durvalum ab and trametinib 
identified in earlier melanoma trials  as safe and well tolerated ; durvalumab at 1500mg q4w 
with trametinib 2mg PO daily. De -escalation doses will be available if this dose proves toxic 
in the colon population (figure 1). After study initiation, u p to 6 patients will be enrolled and 
if the number of DLTs <2, this will be considered the MTD of the combination. If the number 
of DLTs>/=2, additional 6 patients will be treated at the lower dose level. The dose level 
with <2 DLTs out of 6 p atients will be deemed as the MTD for the combination.  
 
 
Figure 1: Dose Levels  
 
After the MTD of the doublet is confirmed, additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD, 
with a maximum of 44 patients at that dose (including the 6 patients treated durin g safety 
lead -in). After the MTD is confirmed, patients will be eligible for trametinib dose reductions 
as described in section 6. As described below, early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_544996]. Usin g a Simon’s 2 -stage design 
(figure 2), we will enroll [ADDRESS_712885] stage is justified  
because an existing PD -L1/MEK trial has shown ef ficacy (as described in rationale) in a 
similar mCRC population.

Figure 2: Study design  
 
We will have a lead in period with trametinib alone for 1 weeks (figure 3) for the dual 
purpose of 1) providing a window to identify toxicities that are related to this agent in 
monotherapy, and 2) to provide a priming effect before the addition of checkpoint 
blockade. As described in the background, there is preclinical evidence that better tumor 
control  and survival  is achieved with a 1 week trametinib lead in.  
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: Study dosing schedule  
 
In all patients pre- and on -treatment biopsies will be optional and may become mandatory 
in order to ensure [ADDRESS_712886] paired biopsies . Additionally, peripheral blood 
will be collected at baseline, day 0, and then approximately every 4 weeks on treatment to 
examine changes in peripheral immune cells and cytokines.  These correlative studies are 
fundamentally important to identify immunologic changes associated with treatme nt. A 
deeper understanding of the cellular and immunologic changes with this combination 
ther apy offers the 1) ability to correlate pre -existing tumor features with response to 
therapy; 2) ability to quantify changes in the tumor microenvironment with trea tment; and 
3) opportunity to identify therapeutically relevant difference between patients that may

5.4  Restrictions for Patients on Study  
The following restrictions apply while the patient is receiving study treatment and 
for the specified times before and after:

Female patient of child -bearing potential : 
─ Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a non -sterilized 
male partner must use at least 1 highly  effective method of contraception (Table  5.) 
from the time of screening and must agree to continue using such precautions for 
[ADDRESS_712902] dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or 
[ADDRESS_712903] use male condom plus spermicide throughout this 
period. Cessation of birt h control after this point should be discussed with a 
responsible physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total duration of the 
drug treatment and the drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, 
periodic  abstinence, the rhythm method , and the withdrawal method are not 
acceptable methods of birth control. Female subjects should also refrain from 
breastfeeding throughout this period.  
Male subjects with a female partner of childbearing potential : 
─ Non -sterilized males who are sexually a ctive with a female partner of childbearing 
potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 180  days 
after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or 
90 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalum ab monotherapy. Not engaging in 
sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, occasional abstinence, the rhythm 
method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Male subjects should refrain from sperm donation throughout this period.  
─ Female partners (of childbearing potential) of male subjects must also use a highly 
effective method of contraception throughout this period ( Table  5.).  
Females of childbearing potential are defined as those who are not surgically sterile 
(ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or 
post -menopausal.  
Women will be considered post -menopaus al if they have been amenorrheic for 12 
months without an alternative medical cause. The following age -specific 
requirements apply:  
Women <[ADDRESS_712904] -men opausal range for the institution or underwent surgical 
sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).  
Women ≥[ADDRESS_712905] menses >[ADDRESS_712906] menses >1 year ago, or underwent 
surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_83729]).  
Highly effective methods of contraception, defined as one that results in a low 
failure rate (ie, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly are 
described in Table  5.. Note that some contraception methods are not considered 
highly effective (eg male or female condom with or without spermicide; female cap, 
diaphragm, or sponge with or without spermicide; non -copper containing 
intrauterine  device; progestogen -only oral hormonal contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_178508] [excluding 
Cerazette/desogestrel which is considered highly effective]; and triphasic combined 
oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]).

• Barrier/Intrauterine methods  • Hormonal Methods  
• Copper T intrauterine device  
• Levonorgestrel -releasing 
intrauterine system (eg,

• Injection: Medroxyprogesterone injection: 
e.g. Depo -Provera®   
• Combined Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]: Normal and low dose 
combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]  
• Patch: Norelgestromin/ethinylestradiol -

• Minipi[INVESTIGATOR_178509]: Progesterone based oral 
contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_72908]: 
Cerazette® is currently the only highly 
effective progesterone based  
a This is also considered a hormonal method  
 
Blood donation  
Subjects should not donate blood whil e participating in this study , or for at least [ADDRESS_712907] infusion of durvalumab or tremelimumab or 90  days after 
receipt of the final dose of  durvalumab .

 39 5.5  Duration of Therapy  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue  
until one of the following criteria applies:  disease progression, intercurrent illness 
that prevents further administration of therapy, unacceptable adverse events, 
patient decides to withdraw from study, or general or specific changes in the 
patient’s condition that render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the 
judgement of the investigator.

unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the 
adverse event.  
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Adjustments for Durvalumab and Trametinib will follow the guidelines and 
recommendations noted below. Based on the mechanism of action of Durvalumab  and 
Trametinib  leading to T -cell activation and proliferation, the occurrence of irAEs that are 
either overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_544999] . Adjustments can be made to both drugs or each drug 
independently if a to xicity is felt to be specifically related to one of the drugs.  For specific 
non-immune related toxicities that are expected with trametinib alone, trametinib 
modification should follow table 6.3.  If one study agent is discontinued due to toxicity then 
the patient may continue on protocol with the other agent if it is felt in the patients best 
interest by [CONTACT_1963].  The decision to dose adjustment should be based upon 
investigator determined attribution as at least possibly related to trameti nib.  
 
Potential irAEs may include [29, 32, 33, 57] : 
 
• Gastrointestinal events including colitis, intestinal perforation, abdominal  
pain, dehydration, nausea and vomiting, and decreased appetite (anorexia)  
• Dermatitis including urticaria, skin exfoliation, and dry skin  
• Endocrinopathies including hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, and hyper and  
hypothyroidism  
• Hepatitis including autoimmune hepatitis, and increased serum alanine  
aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase  
• Pancreatitis including autoimmune pancreatitis, and lipase and amylase  
elevation  
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 40 
 
 40 • Respi[INVESTIGATOR_545000]  
• Nervous system events including encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory  
neuropathies, Gu illain -Barre and myasthenia gravis (the latter reported with  
combination of tremelimumab and Durvalumab ) 
• Cytopenias including thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia  
• Infusion -related reactions, anaphylaxis, and serious allergic reactions  
• Headache, f atigue, and pyrexia  
• Serious infections  
•Immune complex disease.  
 
 
Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs. In the absence of an 
alternate etiology (eg, infection or PD), an immune -related etiology should be considered 
for signs or sy mptoms of enterocolitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, neuropathy, and 
endocrinopathy. In addition to the treatment modifications shown in Table 6.4/6.5 it is 
recommended that management of irAEs follow the guidelines outlined for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] [58]. 
These guidelines recommend the following:  
1. Subjects should be evaluated to identify any alternative etiology.  
2. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all events of an inflammatory nature 
should be considered to be immune -related.  
3. Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_62613] -grade events.  
4. Systemic corticosteroids should be considered for a persistent low -grade event or for 
a severe event.  
5. More potent immunosuppressives should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroids (eg, infliximab, mycophenolate, etc).  
 
All toxic ities will be graded according to NCI CTCAEv4.03. In case of doubt, the investigator 
should c onsult with the [COMPANY_008] / MedImmune .If the investigator has any question in 
regards to an AE being an irAE, the investigator should immediately contact [CONTACT_545053] 
/ MedImmune . Treatment modifications will not be required for AEs that are clearly not 
attributed to Durvalumab  or Trametinib  (such as an accident) or for laboratory 
abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically significant.  
 
Dose reductions of Durvalumab  are not permitted.  Dose reductions of trametinib are 
permitted as in table 6.2  
 
Treatment modifications may be required for Durvalumab  and Trametinib  in the event of 
treatment -related toxicity. General guidelines regarding treatment modification are 
provided in the following tables.

Dose Modifications  Toxicity Management  
Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen will be made to 
manage potential immune -related AEs based on severity of treatment -emergent 
toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE v4.03.  
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study 
regim en based on CTC grade/severity (table below), permanently discontinue 
study drug/study regimen for the following conditions:  
• Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10  mg of prednisone per 
day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_712916] dose of stu dy drug/study 
regimen  
• Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -related AE 
following resumption of dosing  
Grade 1  No dose modification  
Grade 2  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until Grade 2 resolution to 
Grade ≤1.  
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or Grade 4.  
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once event stabilizes to 
Grade ≤1 after completion of steroid taper.  
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreat ed with study 
drug/study regimen on the following conditions:  
1. The event stabilizes and is controlled.  
2. The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treating 
physician’s clinical judgement.  
3. Doses of prednisone are at ≤10  mg/day or equivalent.  
Grad e 3 Depending on the individual toxicity, study drug/study regimen may 
be permanently discontinued. Please refer to guidelines below.  
Grade 4  Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen.  It is recommended that management of immune -mediated adverse events (imAEs)  
follows the guide lines presented in this table:  
− It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune mediated 
mechanism could occur in nearly all organs, some of them not noted 
specifically in these guidelines.  
− Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or laborator y indicators of 
such events) are noted specifically in these guidelines or not, patients should 
be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology  
− (e.g., disease progression, concomitant medications, and infections).) to a 
possible immune -mediat ed event. In the absence of a clear alternative 
etiology, all such events should be managed as if they were immune related. 
General recommendations follow.  
− Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_62613] -grade (Grade 
1 or 2, unless otherwise s pecified) events.  
− For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe (Grade ≥3) 
events, promptly start prednisone 1 to 2  mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent.  
− Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality – e.g., myo -
carditis, or other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the 
guidelines – should progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27550] 
(methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_27551]/or there has been c linical confirmation. Discuss 
these eventsConsider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician, and 
promptly pursue subspecialisty consultation.  
− If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28  days of 
taper), increase the corticostero id dose (prednisone dose [eg, up to 2 to 
4 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until stabilization or improvement of 
symptoms, then resume corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28  days of 
taper).

Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels, hold study drug/study 
regimen, and if complete work up shows no evidence of pancreatitis, study 
drug/study regimen may be continued or resumed.  
 
Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinued in Grade 3 
events with high likelihood for mo rbidity and/or mortality – e.g., myocarditis, or 
other similar events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines. Similarly, 
consider whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently discontinued

Note: There are some exceptions to permanent discontinuation of study drug for 
Grade 4 events (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus).  
 − More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors (eg,  infliximab) 
(also refer to the individual sections of the irAE for specific type of 
immunosuppressive) should be considered for events not responding to 
systemic steroids.  
− Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for Grad e 
3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumo r response 
(eg, inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease and lymph nodes). 
Continuation of study drug/study regimen in this situation should be based

 49 Pediatric Considerations  
Dose Modifications  Toxicity Management  
The criteria for permanent discontinuation of study drug/study regimen based on 
CTC grade/severity is the same for pediatric patients as it is for adult patients, as 
well as to permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen if unable to reduce 
corticoste roid ≤  a dose equivalent to that required for corticosteroid replacement 
therapy within [ADDRESS_712917] dose of study drug/study regimen  − All recommendations for specialist consultation should occur with a 
pediatric specialist in the specialty recommend ed. 
− The recommendations for dosing of steroids (i.e., mg/kg/day) and for IV IG 
and plasmapheresis that are provided for adult patients should also be used 
for pediatric patients.  
− The infliximab 5 mg/kg IV dose recommended for adults is the same as 
recommen ded for pediatric patients ≥ [ADDRESS_712918].  
− For pediatric dosing of mycophenolate mofetil, consult with a pediatric 
specialist.  
− With long -term steroid and other immunosupp ressive use, consider need for 
PJP prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.

Pneumonitis/ Interstitial 
Lung Disease ( ILD) Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or 
ILD (new onset or worsening shortness of breath or cough). 
Patients should be evaluated with imaging and pulmona ry 
function tests, including other diagnostic procedures as 
described below.  
− Initial work -up may include clinical evaluation, monitoring of

indicated)  No dose modification s required. 
However, consider holding study 
drug/study regimen dose as clinically 
appropriate and during diagnostic work -
up for other etiologie s. For Grade 1 (radiographic changes only) : 
− Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
laboratory work -up and then as clinically indicated.  
− Consider pulmonary and infectious disease consul t. 
Grade 2  
(symptomatic; medical 
intervention indicated; 
limiting instrumental 
ADL)  Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.  
• If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4.  
• If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, then 
the decision to reinitiate study 
drug/study regimen will be based

Peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes  
(such as Guillain -Barre 
and myasthenia gravis)  Any Grade  General Guidance  For Any Grade:  
− The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is important, since certain patients 
may unpredictably experience acute decompensations that 
can result in substantial morbidity or in the worst case, death. 
Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms 
that may predict a more severe outcome, such as prominent 
dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27567], and signs of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_83741].  
− Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (eg, disease prog ression, infections, metabolic 
syndromes or medications). It should be noted that the 
diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes can be particularly challenging in patients with 
underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding  
effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis. 
Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is 
essential to have a low threshold to obtain a neurological 
consult.  
− Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (eg,  electromyogram and 
nerve conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if 
myasthenia is suspected) are routinely indicated upon 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_62620] a neurology consultation.  
− It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the 
primary treatment of Guillain -Barre is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_118394]. Patients requiring treatment should be started with 
IV IG and followed by [CONTACT_545056].

− The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated myocarditis is 
important, particularly in patients with baseline 
cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac function.  
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician.  
− Monitor patients for signs and symp toms of myocarditis (new 
onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, 
peripheral edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung 
toxicities, simultaneously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary 
toxicity as well as other causes (e.g., pulmon ary embolism, 
congestive heart failure, malignant pericardial effusion). A 
Cardiology consultation should be obtained early, with prompt 
assessment of whether and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, 
including any other diagnostic procedures.  
− Initial work -up should include clinical evaluation, BNP, 
cardiac enzymes, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), monitoring 
of oxygenation via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and 
additional laboratory work -up as indicated. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_545007].

7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
 7.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
 The International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice  
 (GCP) E6(R1) defines an AE as:  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended  sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory find ing), symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the  medicinal product.  
 
An AE includes but is not limited to any clinically significant worsening of a subject’s pre -
existing conditio n. An abnormal laboratory finding (including ECG finding) that requires  
medical intervention by [CONTACT_093], or a finding judged by [CONTACT_169974]. If clinical sequelae are associated with a labor atory 
abnormality, the diagnosis or medical condition should be reported (eg, renal failure, 
hematuria) not the laboratory abnormality (eg, elevated creatinine, urine red blood cells 
increased). Abnormal laboratory values that are not, in the investigator’ s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], medically 
significant and do not require intervention should not be reported as AEs.  
 
Adverse events may be treatment emergent (ie, occurring after initial receipt of 
investigational product) or nontreatment emergent. A nontreatment -emergent AE is any 
new sign or symptom, disease, or other untoward medical event that begins after written 
informed consent has been obtained but before the subject has received investigational 
product. Elective treatment or surgery or preplanned treatment or surgery (that was 
scheduled prior to the subject being enrolled into the study) for a documented pre -existing 
condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE (serious or nonserious). 
An untoward medical event occurring during the prescheduled e lective procedure or 
routinely scheduled treatment  (i.e. a research tumor biopsy)  should be recorded as an AE or 
SAE.  
 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.   A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meet s any of the following criteria:  
·           Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
·           Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
·           Results in a medical intervent ion (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 99 
 
 99 or a change in concomitant therapy  
·           Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
Certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events.  It is the investigator’s 
responsibility  to review all laboratory findings.   Medical and scientific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an 
adverse event.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_712951] (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Investigational Product and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_093] .. An AESI may be serious or non -serious. The rapid 
reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order to characterize and 
understand them in association with the use of this investigational product.  
 
 
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an event being an imAE, the Investigator 
should promptly contact [CONTACT_9525] . 
 
AESIs observed with durvalumab ± tremelimumab include:  
• Pneumonitis / ILD  
• hepatitis / transaminase increases  
• Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (e.g. Guillain -Barré, and myasthenia  gravis)  
• Endocrinopathies (i.e. events of hypophysitis, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_545017], diabetes insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562], hyper - and hypothyroidism and type I diabetes 
mellitus)  
• Rash / Dermatitis  
• Nephritis / Blood creatinine increases  
• Pancreatitis /serum lipase an d amylases increases  
• Other inflammatory responses that are rare with a potential immune -mediated 
aetiology include, but are not limited to, myocarditis, pericarditis, and uveitis  and 
other events involving the eye, skin, haematological and rheumatological events . 
 
In addition, infusion -related reactions and hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions with a 
different underlying pharmacological aetiology are also considered AESIs.  
 
Further information on these risks (e.g. presenting symptoms) can be found in the  current 
version of the durvalumab and tremelimumab Investigator’s Brochures. More specific 
guidelines for their evaluation and treatment are described in detail in the Dosing 
Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines (see Section 6 ). These guideline s have 
been prepared by [CONTACT_545060] ([COMPANY_008]) and [COMPANY_001]  to assist the Investigator in 
the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities.  These guidelines 
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 100 
 
 100 apply to AEs considered causally related to the study drug/stu dy regimen by [CONTACT_80582].  
 
Further information on these risks (eg.  presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the durvalumab Investigator Brochure.  
 
If new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea) or radiological abnormality 
suggestive of pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease is observed, toxicit y management as 
described in detail in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines will be 
applied. It is strongly recommended to perform a full diagnostic workup, to exclude 
alternative causes such as lymphangitic carcinomatosis, infection,  allergy, cardiogenic edema, 
or pulmonary hemorrhage.  
 
 In the presence of confirmatory HRCT scans where other causes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_545018], a diagnosis of pneumonitis (ILD) should be considered and the Dosing 
Modification and Toxicit y Management Guidelines should be followed.  
 
Pneumonitis (ILD) investigation  
The following assessments, and additional assessments if required, will be performed to 
enhance the investigation and diagnosis of potential cases of pneumonitis. The results of the 
assessment will be collected.  
• Physical examination  
− Signs and symptoms (cough,  shortness of breath and pyrexia, etc.) including 
auscultation for lung field will be assessed.  
• SpO2  
− Saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2)  
• Other items  
− When pneumonitis (ILD) is suspected during study treatment, the following 
markers should be measured where possible:  
(i) ILD Markers (KL -6, SP -D) and β -D-glucan  
(ii) Tumour markers: Particular tumour markers which are related to 
disease progression.   
Additional Clinica l chemistry: CRP, LDH  
 
 
 7.2.1 Hepatic Function Abnormality  
Hepatic function abnormality meeting the definition of Hy’s law (ie, any increase in ALT or  
AST to greater than 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in total bilirubin to be greater than  
2 × ULN) is co nsidered an AESI. Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single  
blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each other. Follow -up 
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 101 
 
 101 investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_471392]/or whether there is objective 
evidence that clearly supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct 
obstruction with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product. 
Guid elines for management of subjects with hepatic function abnormality are outlined in  
table 6.[ADDRESS_712952], as pneumonitis has been observed with 
anti-PD-1 mAbs (but not with anti -PD-L1 mAbs). Initial work -up should  
include high -resolution CT scan, ruling out infection, and pulse oximetry. Pulmonary 
consultatio n is highly recommended. Guidelines for management of subjects with 
pneumonitis are outlined i n Section 7.7 . 
 
7.2.3 Infusion Reactions  
Adverse events of infusion reactions (also termed infusion -related reactions) are of special  
interest and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring from the start 
of the study treatment infusion up to [ADDRESS_712953] been reported with  
anti-PD-L1 and anti -PD-1 therapy  [33]. As with the administration of any  foreign protein 
and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of mAbs can be  caused by 
[CONTACT_62535], including acute anaphylactic (immunoglobulin E -mediated)  and 
anaphylactoid reactions against the mAb, and serum sickness. Acute allergic reactions  
may occur, may be severe, and may result in death. Acute allergic reactions may include  
hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi [INVESTIGATOR_1399], urticaria, pruritus, angioedema,  
hypotonia, urticaria, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache,  
hypertension, myalgia, vomiting and unresponsiveness.  Guidelines for management of 
subjects with hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic  reaction) and infusion -related 
reactions are outlined in Section 7.7 . 
 
7.2.5 Gastrointestinal Disorders  
Diarrhea/colitis is the most commonly observed treatment emergent SAE. In rare cases 
colon  perforation may occur that requires s urgery (colectomy) or can lead to a fatal 
outcome if not  properly managed. Diarrhea/colitis in subjects receiving durvalumab should 
be managed as outlined in Section 7.7.  
 
7.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 102 
 
 102 AEs and SAEs will be collected from the time of the patient signing the informed consent 
form until the follow -up period is completed ([ADDRESS_712954] dose of durvalumab 
±tremelimumab).   If an event that starts post the defined safety follow up period noted 
above is considered to be due to a late  onset toxicity to study drug then it should be 
reported as an AE or SAE as applicable.  
 
During the course of  the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each 
patient for as long as the event is ongoing.  Every effort should be made to obtain a 
resolution for all events, even if the events continue after the patient has discontinued 
study dr ug or the study has completed.  
 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_149798], but without further recording in the eCRF

[COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
 
See Section 7.2 for the definition of SAEs . If an AE evolves i nto a condition that meets the 
regulatory definition of “serious,” it will be reported on the SAE Report Form. Infusion of 
biological products is commonly associated with infusion -related reactions.  
 
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date when the AE started and stopped  
• The maximum CTCAE grade reported  
• Changes in CTCAE grade  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Investigator causality rating against the IPs (yes or no)  
• Action taken with regard to IPs  
• Adminis tration of treatment for the AE  
• Outcome  
 
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
• Date the AE met criteria for SAE  
• Date the Investigator became aware of the SAE  
• Seriousness criteria fulfilled  
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death  
• Whether an autopsy was performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s)

• Description of the SAE  
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be utilized for all events 
with an assigned CTCAE grading. For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, the 
recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate, and severe eve nts into 
CTCAE grades should be used. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from 
the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program website (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
 
Anaphylaxis and infusion -related reactions have some common manifestations and may be  
difficult to distinguish from each other. Infusion -related reactions are commonly observed  
during or shortly after the first time exposure to therapeutic mAbs delivered through  
intravenous infusion. These reactions are less common following subsequent exposur es. 
Unlike infusion -related reactions, anaphylaxis is a rare event, usually occurring after  
subsequent exposure to an antigen, and it is most commonly accompanied by [CONTACT_545061]/or mucosal reactions. The investigator is advised to carefully ex amine 
symptoms of  adverse reactions observed during or shortly after exposure to Durvalumab  
and Trametinib , and consider the above mentioned facts prior to making a final diagnosis.  
Reactions occurring at the time of or shortly after subsequent infusions o f investigational  
product are to be judged by [CONTACT_327039]/her own discretion. For the Investigator’s  
convenience and in order to facilitate consistency in judgments a copy of the National  
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and  Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis  
Network (FAAN) guidance for anaphylaxis diagnosis is provided in Appendix  2. 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_712955]’s last AE assessment or other assessment/visit as 
appropriate in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_545062], but  without further recording in the eCRF. MedImmune  retain s the right to 
request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the 
study, if judged necessary. After [ADDRESS_712956] -related 
SAEs will continue to be followed for safety.  
 
 
7.4 Investigator Communications with [COMPANY_008]/Medimmune  
All SAEs will be reported,  whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product, or to the study procedure(s) . The reporting period for SAEs is the period 
[ADDRESS_712957] do se of durvalumab or until the initiation of alternative anticancer therapy. 
The investig ator is  responsible for informing the Ethics Committee and/or the Regulatory 
Authority of the SAE as per local requirements.  
 
The investigator will forward all SAE repo rts to Medimmune/[COMPANY_008]. A copy of the SAE 
report must be emailed to Medimmune/ [COMPANY_008] at the time the event is reported.  
* A cover page  should accompany the SAE report  form indicating the following:  
“Notification from an Investigator Inititated  Study”  
The investigator’s name [CONTACT_119020]/title and [COMPANY_008] ISS reference n umber (ESR -16-[ZIP_CODE] ) 
* MD Anderson  must also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the causality  
of events in relation to all study medications  and if the SAE is related to disease 
progression , as determined by [CONTACT_458].  
* Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by [CONTACT_62675]’s 
designated mailbox:   [EMAIL_661]  
 
If a non -serious AE becomes serious, this and other relevant follow -up information must 
also be provided to Medimmune/ [COMPANY_008].  
 
Serious adverse events  that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA still need to be 
reported to Medimmine/ [COMPANY_008] using the MD Anderson SAE report form. This 
information should be reported on a mo nthly basis and under no circumstance less 
frequently than quarterly.

Investigators should not wait to collect additional information to full document the event 
before notifying MedImmune Patient Safety of an SAE. When additional  information 
becomes available, investigators should submit a follow -up SAE Repo rt Form (separate from 
the initial report form) with the new information. Any follow -up information to an SAE also 
needs to be provided to MedImmune Pa tient Safety within [ADDRESS_712958] be reported to [COMPANY_008] as follows:  
Death that is clearly the result of disease progression should be documented but 
shoul d not be reported as an SAE.  
Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under 
study, the AE causing the death must be reported to [COMPANY_008] as a SAE within 
24 hours  (see Section 10.3.2 for further details). The report shoul d contain a 
comment regarding the co -involvement of progression of disease, if appropriate, 
and should assign main and contributory causes of death.  
Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE.  
 
Deaths that occur following the protocol -defined [ADDRESS_712959] has been permanently withdrawn from study, and he/she considers there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event is related to study treatment, the inves tigator should 
notify the study [COMPANY_008]/MedImmune Drug Safety.  
Reporting to [COMPANY_001]  
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the 
patient has provided the main informed consent and until at least [ADDRESS_712960] be reported as follow -up to the original 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE 
occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.  
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the f orm must be completed in order to provide a clinically 
thorough report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each 
specific study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report 
Form in Engli sh, and send the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_87109] 24 hours to the oncology 
[COMPANY_001] Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department - Fax: (877 -778-9739). The 
original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the 
case  report form documentation at the study site.  
[ADDRESS_712961](s) to whom the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously 
reported SAE and giving the dat e of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or 
progression of the original event should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless 
of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved 
or conti nues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether 
the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is t hought to be related to the [COMPANY_001] study treatment, an oncology 
[COMPANY_001] Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) department associate may urgently require 
further information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need 
to issue an  Investigator Notification (IN), to inform all investigators involved in any study with 
the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and r elevant 
ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory 
requirements in participating countries.  
Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study treatment 
must be reported  to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy 
should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnorma lities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_36926][INVESTIGATOR_066] (DS&E). 
Pregnancy follow -up should be record ed on the same form and should include an assessment 
of the possible relationship to the study treatment any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE 
experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
Warnings and precautions  
Additional safety informa tion collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form 
of Investigator Notifications. This information will be included in the patient informed 
consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed

Any overdose of a study subject with the investigational product, with or without associated  
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to 
MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety Fax  Notification Form (see Section 7.[ADDRESS_712963] information). If the overdose results in an AE,  the AE must also be recorded on the 
AE eCRF . Overdose does not  automatically make an AE serious, but if the consequences of 
the overdose are serious, for  example death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is serious and 
must be reported as an SAE (see  Section 7.4 and Section 7.5). MedImmune does not 
recommend specific treatment for an  overdose. The investigator will use clinical judgment 
to treat any overdose.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_712964] to the  MedImmune 
([COMPANY_008]) and [COMPANY_001]  are defined as any increase in ALT or AST to greater than 3 × 
ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin to greater than 2 × ULN (ie, Hy’s law cases). 
Concurrent findings are those that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood 
draws taken within 8 days of each other. In the event of hepatic function abnormality where 
the etiology is unknown, timely follow -up investigations and inquiries should be initiated by 
[CONTACT_2727], based on medical judgment, to make an informed decision 
regarding the etiology of the event.  
 
If the underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality is known (includ ing 
progression of pre -existing disease such as primary or metastatic malignancy), the diagnosis  
should be recorded as an AE/SAE. If the underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function 
abnormality remains unknown, the term “hepatic function abnormal” should be used to 
report the AE/SAE. Hepatic function abnormality of unknown etiology, or which is 
considered attributable to investigational product, is required to be reported as “hepatic 
function abnormal” within  24 hours of knowledge of the event to MedImmune  Patient 
Safety using the SAE Report Form, even if the event is considered to be non -serious (see 
Section 7.[ADDRESS_712965] information). The investigator will review the data with the 
[COMPANY_008] / MedImmune . The investigator should then use clinical judgment to establish 
the cause based on local standard of care and follow the subject by [CONTACT_545063].  
 
If, after appropriate workup, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the underlying diagnosis  
for the abnormality r emains unexplained, or is considered attributable to investigational  
product, permanent discontinuation of dosing for the study subject should be considered.  
Each reported event of hepatic function abnormality will be followed by [CONTACT_093]. If 
the etiology of the event remains unconfirmed and/or is  considered related to 
investigational product, a prompt cumulative review  of safety data and the circumstances 
of the event in question will be conducted and assessed by [CONTACT_545064] / MedImmune 
safety review committee (or equivalent) to determine whether continued dosing of current 
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 108 
 
 108 study subjects and/or study entry should be interrupted, whether the protocol will be 
modified, or whether the study will be discontinued permanently. R eview and approval by 
[CONTACT_545065] (or equivalent) is required for resumption of 
subject dosing or study entry in the event that the study is interrupted. Where applicable, 
regulatory authorities IRBs/IECs will be notified of any a ctions taken with the study.  
 
7.5.[ADDRESS_712966] is required to be  
reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to [COMPANY_008] / MedImmune  Patient 
Safety using the MD Anderson SAE form  (see Section 7.[ADDRESS_712967] information). Subjects 
who become pregnant during the study period must not receive additional doses of 
investigational product but will not be withdrawn from the study. The pregna ncy will be 
followed for outcome of the mother and child (including any premature terminations) and 
should be reported to MedImmune Patient Safety after outcome. Should the investigator 
become aware of a pregnancy in the partner of a male study subject who  has received 
investigational product this should be reported within 24 hours of  knowledge of the event 
to MedImmune Patient Safety using the Safety Fax Notification Form (see Section 7.[ADDRESS_712968] information). The investigator will endeavor to collect follow -up information on 
such pregnancies provided the partner of the study subject provides consent.  
 
Maternal exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the IPs should be 
discontinued immediately.  
 
Pregnancy itself is not reg arded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_178517] a contraceptive medication. Congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elec tive abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and 
documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study.  
 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site 
personnel should inform the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within [ADDRESS_712969] dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or [ADDRESS_712970] dose of durvalumab monotherapy, whichever is the longer time period.  
 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. However, the outcome of 
all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormality) occurring from the date of the f irst dose until [ADDRESS_712971] dose of durvalumab + any drug combination therapy or [ADDRESS_712972] obtain the consent of the patient’s partner. Therefore, the 
local study team should adopt the generic ICF template in line with local procedures and 
submit it to the relevant Ethics Committees (ECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) prior to 
use. 
 
7.5.4 Pneumonitis  
Adverse events of pneumonitis are required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the event to MedImmune  Patient Safety using the  MD Anderson SAE form  (see Section 
7.[ADDRESS_712973] information).

iron oxide as colorant, as applicable).  
 
Trametinib will be dosage in tablets with unit dose strengths of 0.[ADDRESS_712977] should skip 
the dose and resume dosing the next day at the regular time.   
 
Trametinib tablets are packaged into a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle that 
contains desiccant with a child -resistant closure that includes an induction seal liner.  The 
HDPE bottle is enclosed in a paperboard carton.  
 
8.1.3  Dose Preparation Steps  
 
Durvalumab  
Total time from needle puncture of the durvalumab vial to the start of administration 
should not exceed:  
• 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  
• [ADDRESS_712978] be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature prior to 
commencement of administration.  
 
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV diluent equal to the priming volume of the 
infusion set used after the contents of th e IV bag are fully administered, or complete the 
infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and 
document if the line was not flushed.  
 
In the event that there are interruptions during infusion, the total allowed time  should not 
exceed 8 hours at room temperature.  
  
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 112 
 
 112 A dose of 1500mg will be administered using an IV bag containing 0.9% (w/v) saline or 5% 
(w/v) dextrose, with a final durvalumab (MEDI4736) concentration ranging from 1 to 20 
mg/mL, and delivered through an  IV administration set with a 0.2 - or 0.22 -μm in -line filter.  
Add 30.0 mL of durvalumab (MEDI4736) (ie, 1500mg of durvalumab [MEDI4736]) to the IV 
bag. The IV bag size should be selected such that the final concentration is within 1 to 20 
mg/mL. Mix the b ag by [CONTACT_62656].  
 
Durvalumab will be administered at room temperature (approximately 25°C) by [CONTACT_545066] a peripheral or central vein. Following preparation of durvalumab, the entire 
conten ts of the IV bag should be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 
minutes (±5 minutes). Less than [ADDRESS_712979] be 
prepared from new vials.  Durvalumab (MEDI4736) does not contain preservatives, and any 
unused portion must be discarded.  
 
  
 8.1.[ADDRESS_712980] day of  durvalumab  dosing is considered Day 1.  
 
Durvalumab  should be administered using the following guidelines:  
 
1. Investigational product  must be administered at room temperature by [CONTACT_545067] a peripheral vein or central line. Prior to the start of  the i nfusion, ensure that the bag 
contents are at room temperature to avoid an infusion  reaction due to the administration 
of the solution at low temperatures.  
 
2. A physician must be present at the site or imm ediately available to respond to 
emergencies during  all administrations of investigational product(s). Fully functional  
resuscitation facilities should be available. Investigational product(s) must not be  
administered via IV push or bolus but as an IV infusion. The entire content of each IV  bag 
will be infused using an infusion pump.  
 
3. The infusion lines should be attached only at time of use. Lines used for infusion during  
dose administration will need to be equipped with 0.[ADDRESS_712981] has been  administered to flush the line. The infusion rate 
2017 -0514  
December 19, 2017  
Page 113 
 
 113 should not be changed unless necessary  to manage acute reactions. Document if the line 
was not flushed.  
 
 8.1.5  Monitoring of  Dose Administration  
Subjects will be monitored prior to, during, and after infusion of Durvalumab . Vital signs  
(temperature, BP, pulse rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) will be  measured on treatment days 
within 30 minutes prior to the start of  Durvalumab  admini stration, every 30 minutes (± 5 
minutes) during  Durvalumab administration, at the end of Durvalumab infusion (+ 5 
minutes), and at 30 and 60 minutes (± 5 minutes) post end of infusion of  Durvalumab . For 
Dose 1, an additional 2 -hour (± 15 min utes) observati on period will be  required after the 60 
minutes (± 5 minutes) post end of infusion of Durvalumab  vital sign  assessment. The 
additional [ADDRESS_712982] experiences an infusion reaction.  
 
In the event of Grade ≤ 2 infusion -related reaction, the infusion rate of Durvalumab  may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to  4 hours) and re -
initiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion. In subjects  experiencing 
Grade ≤ 2 infusion -related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered  at 50% of 
the initial rate.  
 
Primary prophylaxis against infusion -related reactions is not permitted during this study in  
order to avoid obscur ing a potential safety signal and enable a future assessment regarding  
whether premedications should be required for all subjects in future studies. However, at 
the discretion of the investigator, secondary prophylaxis (ie, prevention of infusion -related  
reaction following initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) is appropriate and will be permitted. Acetaminophen  
and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional  
standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. If the infu sion-related  
reaction is Grade [ADDRESS_712983] will be prepared in accordance with Good  
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory guidelines. Label text will be translated  
into local languages, as required.  
 
8.1.9   Storage  
 
Store Durvalumab  at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not freeze.  
 
Store Trametinib refrigerate d at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Do not freeze. Dispense in original 
bottle. Do not  remove desiccant. Protect from moisture and light. Do not place medication 
in pi[INVESTIGATOR_16582].  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_712984] is administered by [CONTACT_26271], who will monitor  
compliance.  
 
8.1.11  Accountability  
 
The investigator’s or site’s designated investigational product manager is required to  
maintain accurate investigational product accountability records. Upon completion of the  
study, copi[INVESTIGATOR_545021] .

9.[ADDRESS_712985] operative procedures 
will be listed in a laboratory manual. We will be attempting to uncover biomarkers associated 
with safety and relapse -free survival  by [CONTACT_234216]:  
1. Pre- and post -immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy effect on T -effector cell populations; 
CD4 subsets; T -regulatory populations; B cell populations; dendritic and macrophage 
populations.  
2. Pre- and post -immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy on functional assays related to Teff

treatment.  
4. Immunologic markers obtained in peripheral blood versus those obtained at the tissue 
level.     
5. Immunologic biomarkers obtained in the tissue and peripheral blood correlated with 
safety, feasibility, and progr ession free survival.  
 
These will be reported via:  
1. Graphical displays will be used to display all biomarker data a baseline and follow -up.  
Transformation will be used as needed prior to hypothesis testing and estimating 
summary statistics. We will use a  paired t test to determine if there is a difference in 
pre- and post -immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in T -effector cell populations; T -
regulatory populations; CD4 subsets; B cell populations; dendritic and macrophage 
populations.  
2. We will use scatterplot s to demonstrate correlation between immunologic markers 
obtained in peripheral blood versus those obtained at the tissue level.  A Pearson 
correlation will be estimated to describe the level of association.

Immune related response criteria (irRC) described by [CONTACT_79374].  will be used to identify 
measurable disease on baseline CT scans.  Further imaging will be performed according to 
the study outline in section [ADDRESS_712990] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) 
as >[ADDRESS_712991] be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or 
might not be considered measurable.

 118 Non -measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small 
lesions (<[ADDRESS_712992] scan ), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory brea st disease, abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ 
and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be i dentified 
as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and 
their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_545068] c linically).  A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions 
will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will 
be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].  
 
Non -target lesions .  All o ther lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 10 target lesions should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence o r absence of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
11.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using guidelines proposed by 
[CONTACT_545069] (irRC).  
  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers. All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of  treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_712993] of a treatment.  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS] irRC: Measurable Disease  
 
  Index lesions: Must be accurately measured in two dimensions, with a minimum size 
of ≥5 x 5mm (two largest perpendicular diameters) by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice 
thickness no greater than 5 mm) or 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] 
(lesions which cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as 
non-measurable).

 119  [IP_ADDRESS] irRC: Index and non -Index Lesions:  
  For the irRC , only index and measurable new lesions are taken into account (in 
contrast to conventional WHO criteria, which do not require the measurement of 
new lesions, nor do they include new lesion measurements in the characterization 
of evolving tumor burden). At  the baseline tumor assessment, the sum of the 
products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all index lesions (five 
lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions and five cutaneous index lesions) is 
calculated. At each subsequent tumor asses sment, the SPD of the index lesions and 
of new, measurable lesions (≥5 x 5 mm; up to 5 new lesions per organ: 5 new 
cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) are added together to provide the total 
tumor burden.  
 
11.1.4  Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Related Response Criteria (irRC)  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Response in new patients will be conducted using the Immune Related Response 
Criteria (irRC), as described by [CONTACT_218008], et al 60. “For irRC, only index and 
measurable new lesions are taken into a ccount. At the baseline tumor assessment, 
the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of all 
index lesions (five lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions and five cutaneous 
index lesions) is calculated. At each subsequent t umor assessment, the SPD of the 
index lesions and of new, measurable lesions (≥5 x 5mm; up to 5 new lesions per 
organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) are added together to 
provide the total tumor burden:”  
Tumor Burden=SPDindex  lesions + SPDnew, measurable lesions  
Complete Response (irCR) : irCR, complete disappearance of all lesions (whether 
measurable or not, and no new lesions) confirmation by a repeat, consecutive 
assessment no less than [ADDRESS_712994] documented.  
Partial Response (irPR ): irPR, decrease in tumor burden ≥50% relative  to baseline 
confirmed by a consecutive assessment at least [ADDRESS_712995] documentation.  
Progressive Disease (irPD) : irPD, increase in tumor burden ≥25% relative to nadir 
(minimum recorded tumor burden) confirmation by a repeat, consecutive 
assessment n o less than [ADDRESS_712996] -baseline tumor assessment, then 
confirmation of irPD by a second scan in the absence of rapid clinical deterioration is 
required. The definition of confir mation of progression represents an increase in 
tumor burden ≥25% compared with the nadir at two consecutive time points at least

 120 4 wk apart. It is recommended that this be done at the discretion of the investigator 
because follow -up with observation alone  may not be appropriate for patients with 
a rapid decline in performance status.  
 
Stable Disease (irSD) : irSD, not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD.

to [ADDRESS_713000] to enroll between 4 -6 patients per month on this protocol, 
requiring a total of approximately 10 -12 months to complete enrollment. The Simon’s 
two-stage minimax design will be implemented based on a null hypothesis of 5% 
response rate and an alternative hypothesis of 15% response rate. In the first stage, we 
will enroll 29 patients; if [ADDRESS_713001] patient. The design has a one -sided type I error rate of 0.10 and 80% power.  
The probability of early termination is 57% under the null hypothesis. Patient 
enrollment will be temporarily suspended when the enrollment for the first stage is 
completed yet not enough responders have been observed to trigger the start of the 
second stage.    
Additionally, toxicities (defined as any treatment related Grade 3 or higher toxicities) 
will be monitored using the Bayesian method of Thall, Simon and Estey. The toxicity

[ADDRESS_713004] response (CR/PR) rate will be estimated along with the exact 95% confidence 
interval. Patients who drop out of the study prior to the assessment of response will be counted 
as non -responders for the primary analysis. Safety data will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics. Time -to-event outcomes, including time to treatment failure (i.e., death, progression 
or treatment related toxicities are counted as events), or progression -free survival (i.e., death 
or progression are counted as events) wil l be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
The immunological and molecular biomarker changes (such as CD4 and CD8 T -cell) will 
be summarized over time using descriptive statistics and graphical display. A paired t -test will 
be used to determine if ther e is a statistically significant change between pre - and post -
treatment.  The correlation between change in CD8+ T -cell density from pre -treatment to on -
treatment  biopsy tumor tissue will be conducted based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient and 
Spearman’ s rank correlation coefficient.  With 15 paired biopsy samp les, assuming normally 
distributed data and two -sided 0.05% alpha , we will have 80% power to detect a 0.723*s 
(where “s” is the within group standard deviation)  or greater  effect size, represented by [CONTACT_545070].

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network 
guidance for Anaphylaxis Diagnosis  
 
The NIAID and FAAN define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset  
and may cause death [64]. They recognize 3 categories of anaphylaxis, with  
criteria designated to capture from 80% of cases (category 1) to > 95% of all cases of  
anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories).  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin,  
muc osal tissue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips , tongue , 
uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak  
expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia)  
b. Reduc ed BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia  
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
 
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for  
that patient (minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of t he skin -mucosal tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen

b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF,  
hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope,  
incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
 
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours):  
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in  
systolic BP  
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that

in 2017.3A major cause of death in these patients is disease progression and incurable metastasis. 
The SEER database estimates that ~40,[ADDRESS_8860] cancer patients a year either present at diagnosis 
(n=13,900) with metastatic disease or exhibit progression with metastatic disease, sometimes many 
years after completing therapy for early stage disease (n=36,000).[ADDRESS_8861] estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers.4 Hence, patients with ER+ metastatic breast 
cancer (MBC) represent a majority of breast cancer who die of their disease, the vast majority due to 
metastatic progression. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_8862] cancer 
In early stage estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, the use of adjuvant endocrine 
therapy (tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors) lowers the relative risk of recurrence at 10 years by 45 to 
50% and that of mortality by [CONTACT_9512] 30%.[ADDRESS_8863] compared endocrine therapy to no endocrine therapy in the absence of chemotherapy since 
treatment induces clear palliation.  More recent trials comparing single-agent to combination 
endocrine therapy agents (e.g. aromatase inhibitors plus the ER down regulator fulvestrant) have 
yielded mixed results.6, [ADDRESS_8864] on overall 
survival - although these trials were not designed with the statistical power to survival differences, 
with disease-free survival designated as the primary endpoint.  The addition of the mTOR inhibitor 
everolimus doubled median disease-free survival from 4.1 to 10.6 months when added to the 
aromatase inhibitor exemestane as second-line therapy and was approved by [CONTACT_9513] (median survival of 31.0 vs. 26.6 
months).8, 9 Other biological agents such as PI3 kinase inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and 
cyclin-dependent kinase CDK) inhibitors are being actively tested in first, second and later lines of 
therapy - so far CDK 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib has been approved by [CONTACT_9514].  
In summary, this is a novel investigator initiated study funded by [CONTACT_9515] (phase I) of adding HCQ to continuous low dose palbociclib and 
letrozole in metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer and thereafter determine whether the inhibition of 
autophagy with HCQ can decrease proliferation index in a window study (Phase II) in 
postmenopausal women with stage I-III HR+/HER2- breast cancer.  The scientific rationale is based 
on preclinical work that has been done by [CONTACT_9516]. Further the trial has been vetted through our departmental HR positive working group as 
plinary team of collaborators are involved 
and it is well funded. Finally, we have had success with accrual demonstrated to other window trials, 
with several such studies ongoing without any concerns of low accrual. As noted in the trial 
prioritization, this is #3 of 5 trials in the HR+, HER2- patient population but the other ongoing or 
planned trials are expected to have little if any overlap with the activation of protocol 2017-0071.  
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8865] cancer 
Palbociclib is a potent and specific cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor and anti-
proliferative agent that induces G1 arrest and prevents breast cancer cell growth, most notably in 
ER+ cell lines and other preclinical models, which led to the clinical development of this class of 
inhibitors in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.11-[ADDRESS_8866] and second-line settings 
for ER+/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC).14-[ADDRESS_8867]-line Phase III trial, 
progression-free survival (primary endpoint) was improved from 14.[ADDRESS_8868] line setting, 66% of patients on the palbociclib experienced grade 3 and 4 
neutropenia, and adverse events necessitate a palbociclib dose reduction in 36% and discontinuation 
in 7.4% of patients.[ADDRESS_8869] response and/or resistance to palbociclib  many patients do not 
respond to therapy, and most importantly, virtually all eventually develop resistance.  Biomarkers that 
may influence response to endocrine therapy and CDK inhibitors including estrogen receptor-alpha 
(ESR1) and PIK3CA mutations, loss of the retinoblastoma protein function, proliferative antigen Ki67 
expression, cyclin D1  gene amplification or loss of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16 have not 
shown to be related to palbociclib-associated response or time to progression.13, 17, [ADDRESS_8870] not been well characterized, 
there are several mechanisms of resistance to conventional endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_9463], which include activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways 
(notably the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway), activation mutations in ESR1 and other more general 
alterations such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_9464]/STAT.20 As described earlier, mTOR and CDK4/[ADDRESS_8871] survival, and clinical resistance still emerges with all 
available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8872] shown that at low concentrations of the palbociclib, ER+ 
breast cancer cells arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but this arrest is reversible due to the 
activation of autophagy. However, at high concentrations of palbociclib, the cells are arrested 
irreversibly in G1, do not undergo autophagy and instead undergo senescence. The low 
concentration of palbociclib are on-target and are specific for inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6, as shown 
with siRNA assays where CDK4 and CDK6 where knocked down.  The high concentrations of 
palbociclib, induce senescence, but these are off target effects of the drug. We also demonstrated 
that if we combine palbociclib with an autophagy inhibitor such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we can 
achieve senescence at a much lower (i.e. on- target) and continuous dosing of palbociclib, in both in 
vitro and in vivo models. Moreover, concomitant treatment with HCQ and palbociclib can mediate a 
synergistic response in ER+ xenograft (MCF7) mouse tumor volume and weight compared to 
palbociclib alone. More strikingly, the tumor volumes with combination treatment did not increase 
even after the treatment was stopped, while the tumor volumes with either palbociclib or HCQ alone 
continuously increased during both the treatment and recovery phases of the experiment. 
Combination treatment showed the desired and expected impairment in autophagic flux. Decrease in 
Rb phosphorylation, a direct readout of CDK 
4/[ADDRESS_8873] that 
autophagy inhibition significantly improves the 
efficacy of low dose (on target) palbociclib in 
vivo and facilitates the induction of an 
irreversible tumor growth inhibition. We 
propose that palbociclib activates the 
autophagy pathway to protect ER+ breast 
cancer cells from palbociclib-induced 
senescence and inhibition of autophagy 
sensitizes cells to lower doses of palbociclib 
in vitro and in vivo (Figure 1).  
 
We therefore propose using HCQ to 
inhibit autophagy in patients treated with low 
dose (on target) palbociclib and letrozole to 
demonstrate enhanced anti-proliferative effect.  An anti-proliferative effect of endocrine therapy using 
quantification of the proliferative Ki67 antigen has been validated as a long-term predictor of 
outcome.   HCQ is a commonly used and generally safe drug used to treat malaria and as a remittive 
agent for various autoimmune diseases (see more expanded description in Section 6.2). This trial will 
therefore provide evidence of a promising therapeutic effect with lower dose palbociclib plus letrozole 
for a greater therapeutic effect with less side effects. This is needed before proceeding with a more 
definitive trial that could be potentially practice-changing. 
 
1.3Rationale for the Use of Pre-
Therapy  
We have chosen to perform this trial using the combination of letrozole, palbociclib and HCQ 
in the pre-
Figure 1:  Model for Hydroxychloroquine  
to Inhibit Autophagy and Potentiate 
Palbociclib  
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8874].  However, the initial lead-in Phase I safety trial that includes HCQ dose escalation with the 
study regimen of continuous low dose palbociclib and letrozole and the determination of the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for HCQ will be conducted in patients with advanced metastatic 
breast cancer, followed by [CONTACT_9517]/window trial. 
The following rationale support this approach:  
 Palbociclib is already FDA-approved for metastatic breast cancer with an excellent safety 
record. It is currently in several clinical trials in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. 
 Treatment will include letrozole, a standard endocrine therapy as is used clinically for early 
stage breast cancer. 
 HCQ is an approved drug commonly used for malaria and autoimmune disease and 
particularly safe when used at the doses and timeframes proposed (see more expanded 
description in Section 6.2). 
 This model allows for safe biopsies as needed for the correlative tissue aims and eliminates 
artifact and variability due to prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_9465]. 
 
on study drug (2 weeks on low dose palbociclib plus letrozole, then 2 weeks with the addition 
of HCQ) then to proceed with surgery or a research biopsy if additional standard of care 
neoadjuvant therapy is indicated, and then followed by [CONTACT_9518]. 
 The very first exposure to the combination will be performed in a cohort of patients with 
adva
combination with the study regimen of low dose continuous palbociclib with letrozole.  Once 
safety is established at the specific HCQ dose level, the corresponding arm of the Phase II 
neoadjuvant/window trial will be activated.  This approach will maximize safety by [CONTACT_9519].  
 
There is ample clinical experience and clinical trial to support the use of neoadjuvant 
endocrine therapy as method to downstage tumors and allow more patients to undergo breast-
conserving surgery.[ADDRESS_8875] treatment has been extensively validated as index 
that correlates with the likelihood of achieving a complete pathological response and with longer term 
outcomes specifically in trials.23-31 The key metrics using this model are obtained after 4 weeks of low 
dose Palbociclib and HCQ (safety) in the Phase I portion and after 2 weeks of low dose palbociclib 
and then 2 additional weeks with the addition of HCQ (efficacy) in the Phase II portion (see Sections 
2.0 and 3.1).   
Therefore, patients can come off study after [ADDRESS_8876] therapy 
aromatase inhibitor), neoadjuvant chemotherapy if the patient is known to have the stage, grade and 
other indices that warrant chemotherapy.  Alternatively, they can proceed with definitive 
breast/axillary node surgery. In addition, if the biopsy after both 2 and 4 weeks show suppression of 
proliferative index that is used as the main endpoint of the study (see Section 2.2.1), patient can stay 
on therapy for the typi[INVESTIGATOR_9466] 16-24 weeks. 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
11 
 These pragmatic alternatives will maximize accrual and allow patients and their physicians to opt for 
tuation.
1.4 Risk/Benefit Assessment   
Patients on this study will be receiving standard of care therapy (endocrine therapy with 
letrozole) and palbociclib, an FDA-approved and relatively non-toxic therapy that doubles time to 
progression in the metastatic setting, but not approved in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting (see 
additional description of palbociclib in Section 6.1). HCQ is an approved drug used for malaria and 
autoimmune disorders that also had a very good safety profile (see additional description of HCQ in 
Section 6.2). One concern of retinal toxicity that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_9467], will 
be mitigated by [CONTACT_9520], and exclusion of 
those who are felt to be at risk for retinal toxicity as established by [CONTACT_9521].[ADDRESS_8877] palbociclib and letrozole therapy.  The 
experimental regimen proposed for the window/neoadjuvant protocol, low dose continuous 
palbociclib and standard dose letrozole will be used, in combination with increasing doses of HCQ. 
The benefits of participation of this trial cannot be fully ascertained, but the addition of 
palbociclib has been shown to achieve a high rate of complete cell cycle arrest, a surrogate 
biomarker of long-term benefit.18 While short term exposure (4 weeks) may not affect outcome, 
patients who stay on study for a total of 16-[ADDRESS_8878] a greater degree of 
down staging and more conservative surgery (e.g. breast conservation, sentinel node biopsy as 
opposed to axillary dissection). 
 
2.0  STUDY AIMS AND OBJECTIVES 
The overall study aim is to determine whether autophagy inhibition with HCQ can significantly 
decrease proliferation index, a validated surrogate of long term outcome, when added to a 
continuous low dose palbociclib and letrozole. 
2.1 Phase I Safety Component (metastatic disease) Objectives and Endpoints 
 
2.1.1 The primary objective of the Phase I portion in the metastatic setting is to determine the 
safety of adding HCQ to continuous low dose palbociclib and letrozole and to determine the 
recommended phase II dose for HCQ for the subsequent Phase II study. 
 
Primary endpoint is safety, to be assessed continuously using CTCAE V4.03, with physical 
examination and laboratory assessments as indicated on the study schedule. Dose-limiting 
toxicities as defined in Section 3.3. 
 
2.1.2 The secondary objective is to determine the response rate and clinical benefit rate at 8 weeks 
of the assigned HCQ dose plus continuous low dose palbociclib and letrozole.

 2.2 Phase II Window/Neo-adjuvant Component Objectives and Endpoints 
2.2.1 Phase II - Part 1 Primary Objectives and Endpoints 
To determine the dose responsiveness of 2 dose levels (400 mg and RP2D) of 
hydroxychloroquine added to low dose palbociclib and letrozole on pre and post HCQ breast 
tumor proliferation index (Ki67), autophagy, senescence and cell cycle control.  
 
2.2.2 Phase II - Part 1 Secondary and Additional Objective and Endpoints 
Determine longer term clinical tumor responsiveness (tumor volume) and tumor biomarker 
indices (for patients who have extended pre-operative therapy, maximum 24 weeks).  
 
Perform exploratory studies on blood-based tumor protein, DNA and RNA biomarkers with a 
focus on pathways of cell proliferation, autophagy, senescence and cell cycle control.   
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_8879] (CCCA, 
defined as the ) comparing T2 to T1 as shown in Figure 2, see Section 5.3.4).  
 
The primary endpoint is the increase in percentage of all patients who achieve CCCA with low 
dose palbociclib and letrozole (at week 2, time T1) compared to that of low dose palbociclib 
and letrozole with the addition of HCQ (at 5 weeks, day 29, time T2).   
 
A previously conducted trial of neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole) plus standard 
dose palbociclib estimated the CCCA probability to be 44% with aromatase inhibitor alone 
and powered their study to detect a 50% increase of 44% to 66%18. A 26% CCCA probability 
was seen with anastrozole alone and 86% with the addition of standard dose palbociclib. We 
will aim for a CCCA reference probability of 50% with low-dose palbociclib + letrozole (T1) 
and a CCCA probability of 75% with the addition of HCQ (see Section 8 for statistical plan 
and samples size calculations for the Phase II portion). 
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_8880] tumor indices of proliferation, autophagy, senescence, cell cycle 
control and other intersecting pathways.  
 Determine longer term clinical tumor responsiveness and tumor biomarkers indices (for 
patients who have extended pre-operative therapy, maximum 24 weeks).  
 To determine the dose responsiveness of HCQ (400 mg vs. RP2D) on the primary 
(proportion with CCCA) and secondary clinical/biological endpoints 
 To perform exploratory studies on blood-based tumor protein, DNA and RNA biomarkers. 
 Obtain additional safety information for the combination of low dose palbociclib, letrozole 
and hydroxychloroquine.

3.0  INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overall Design  
This is an open label Phase I/II prospective interventional trial with a safety component in metastatic 
disease followed by [CONTACT_9522]-adjuvant (pre-operative) setting. 
 
Phase I Safety Component: 
The Phase I is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of adding HCQ to continuous low dose 
palbociclib and letrozole in the metastatic setting and to determine the recommended phase [ADDRESS_8881] 3+3 dose escalation designed will be employed. 
This safety component will be completed before the initiation of the window trial (Phase II) in the pre-
operative setting.  
 
Phase II Pre-  
-operative palbociclib plus 
letrozole followed by [CONTACT_9523] (HCQ) for postmenopausal patients with 
Stage I-III estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer (Figure 2).   
Correlative studies using baseline and follow up breast biopsies and blood work are included in the 
research plan. The Phase II portion will assess the change in the percentage of all patients who 
achieve CCCA when adding HCQ to the palbociclib/letrozole combination. 
 
3.2 TRIAL SCHEMATA 
3.2.1Trial Overview Schema Design and Flow  
 
Figure 1: General schema for both phases of the trial.   The run-in Phase I safety study done in 
the metastatic setting will establish safety and determine the Phase II dose. The Phase II study will 
assess two doses of HCQ (400 mg in 6 patients and RP2D in 30 patients) added to continuous low 
dose palbociclib plus letrozole and assess proliferative index (Ki67) pre and post HCQ administration.

Design for the Safety Component/Phase I 
A cycle will be defined as 28 days, with dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessed over the first cycle. 
 
The dose of letrozole and palbociclib will be fixed for the safety cohorts at: 
 Palbociclib: 75 mg capsule taken orally once daily on a continuous basis. 
 Letrozole: 2.5mg/d taken orally once daily continuously.

The dose escalation portion will use a 3+3 dose escalation design to evaluate escalating dose levels 
of HCQ in combination with palbociclib and letrozole (see dose level table above). Three patients will 
be enrolled at the first dose level (DL 0, 400 mg daily) of the triplet combination. At least [ADDRESS_8882] complete a treatment cycle (28 days) with the triple combination and undergo toxicity 
assessment before any additional patients are enrolled into higher dosing cohorts. Intrapatient dose

If two DLTs are seen at the starting dose of 400 mg (DL 0), then this treatment will be declared to not 
be feasible as doses of HCQ < 400 mg may be too low for the intended effects. 
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9468], review patient data and make 
decisions prior to advancing to the next dose level, approve dose escalation, and will also declare the 
establishment for RP2D and declare when the Phase II part of the study can commence.

-adjuvant setting.  
 
3.4Phase II Component (Window/Neo-adjuvant Cohorts) 
uates the combination of pre-operative palbociclib plus 
letrozole followed by [CONTACT_9523] (HCQ) for postmenopausal patients with 
Stage I-III estrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer (Figure 2).   
 
Correlative studies using baseline and follow up breast biopsies and blood work are included in the 
overall research grant. The Phase II portion will assess the change in the percentage of all patients 
who achieve CCCA when adding HCQ to the palbociclib/letrozole combination. 
 
3.5 Phase II Window/Neo-adjuvant Component  Dose Cohorts (Parts 1 and 2) 
 
To estimate the dose responsiveness of HCQ in the main outcome measures as stated on Section 
2.2.3, two groups will be enrolled at the HCQ levels as shown below: 
 
Dose Level  
GroupsNumber of 
patients Hydroxychloroquine 
dose Letrozole 
dose Palbociclib dose 
Part 1 6 400 mg/d p.o. 2.5 mg/d p.o. 
 75 mg capsule p.o. daily  
continuously, 28-day cycle Part 2 30 RP2D 
 
An initial group of 6 patients (part 1) will be enrolled at an HCQ dose of 400 mg daily sequentially, 
and then a second group of 30 patients (part 2) will be enrolled at the HCQ dose defined in the 
Phase I portion as RP2D. The main efficacy endpoint statistical plan is based on the [ADDRESS_8884] 2 weeks, then after the second biopsy 
(T2), HCQ at the assigned dose will be added. After 4 weeks (2 weeks of HCQ) (T2), the primary 
endpoint will have been obtained with analysis of the surgical specimen (or research biopsy at that 
timepoint if additional neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or chemotherapy is indicated as standard of 
care. Details on dosing and dose adjustments are shown in Sections 6.1.4 and 6.2.3. Using the same 
population, treatment and biopsy schema, 30 patients will be enrolled for the phase II Stage 2 portion 
of the trial.

 3.6 Phase II Patient Evaluability 
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria and complete a full 4 weeks of therapy (14 days of low-dose 
palbociclib plus letrozole and 14 days of dose palbociclib plus letrozole with HCQ) will be considered 
evaluable for Phase II.  In addition, the completion of biopsies at T0, T1 and T2 with interpretability of 
Ki67 are required for evaluability. Baseline Ki67 >5% is required to enhance the interpretability of 
CCCA fraction change from T1 to T2. 
 
3.7   Replacement of Patients 
Patients who are not evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity in the Phase I portion and those not 
evaluable for Ki67 at T0, T1 and T2 in the Phase II portion will be replaced. 
 
3.8 Target Accrual 
A total of 54 patients will be enrolled to the study. This includes 2 to 18 patients (up to [ADDRESS_8885] dose of HCQ (400 mg daily) and 
the study is halted.) in the Phase I metastatic portion, 6 patients for neo-adjuvant Phase II Part 1 and 
30 patients for the Phase II Part 2 portion (25 needed for statistical plan and 5 expected to drop out). 
This does not account for replaced patients (as stated in Sections 3.6 and 3.7).

5.2.2 Evaluation During Study Phase II 
 
Patients will be evaluated with an organ-specific review of systems and physical exam at 
weeks 2, 3, 4, and those (as 
described in Sections 1.3, 3.2.2 and 5.2-Table 2) and stay on study until definitive surgery at 
week [ADDRESS_8894] as shown on Table 2.  
 
 
5.2.3 Treatment Duration 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase I 
Patients will receive treatment for at least until week [ADDRESS_8895] 1.1 criteria (applies only to patients with 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21

 measurable disease), they will be allowed to stay on treatment as long as there is no 
evidence of progression or significant toxicities up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_8896] treatment (standard dose palbociclib and letrozole) or alternate therapy at 
the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase II 
Following the study schema (Figure 2) patients are expected to complete  [ADDRESS_8897] dose of study drug.  
 
Patients whose tumors at T1 biopsy show Ki67 > 10% will be required to come off study and 
per standard of care would typi[INVESTIGATOR_9470].  All other patients will continue on study therapy and at 
T2 (week 5, or day 29), will proceed with definitive surgery or undergo a research biopsy and 
continue with standard of care neoadjuvant endocrine therapy or chemotherapy as clinically 
indicated.  
 
5.2.4 End of treatment visit and Follow up assessments  
Patients who discontinue study treatment, will be followed for 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9471] (i.e., assessment of AEs and/or serious AEs [SAEs] and 
concomitant medications) and resolution of any treatment related toxicity. Patients continuing 
to experience toxicity at this point following discontinuation of treatment will continue to be 
followed at least every 4 weeks until resolution or determination, in the clinical judgment of the 
investigator, that no further improvement is expected. 
 
5.2.5 Early discontinuation 
Patients who come off trial early will be asked to return for the off-study assessments as 
detailed in Tables 1 and 2. In the event of a continuing AE, the patient will be asked to return 
for follow-up until resolution or stabilization of the AE. 
 
5.2.6 Review of Systems and Physical Exam 
A full review of systems that covers all of the domains and systems represented in CTCAE  
V 4.03 toxicity criteria will be performed at screening/baseline.  Subsequent physical exams 
may be limited and should be focused on sites of disease to explore clinical signs and 
symptoms. 
 
5.2.7 Laboratory Assessments 
CBC/differential, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, albumin, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase,  PT, PTT, and Urinalysis.

Tumor response should be assessed using the same imaging method throughout the study. 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_8900] 10% formalin, and all other cores will be placed in a cryovial and snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. 
All of the correlative studies (unless otherwise indicated) will be performed in the laboratory of 
[CONTACT_9580] located in the Zayed building at [ADDRESS_8901], Houston, 
[LOCATION_007], [ZIP_CODE].  For all the correlative analysis we will use tumor tissues collected from the 
biopsies and at surgical resections.  
Cyclin E, and Rb immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays.   FFPE tumor tissue slides will be 
prepared from paraffin imbedded blocks per standard methodologies and subjected to IHC 
analysis with 2 different antibodies: cyclin E and Rb:  
Cyclin E: the anti-human C-19 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biologicals) at 1:2000 dilution 
will be used to stain each slide. Each slide will be scored for percent nuclear and percent 
cytoplasmic positive staining. Only tumor cells with greater than 5% nuclear or cytoplasmic 
positivity are considered as cyclin E positive. Nuclear and cytoplasmic staining scores are 
assigned according to the staining intensity (0 = no staining, 1 = blush staining, 2 = weak 
staining, 3 = intermediate staining and 4= strong staining). The nuclear and cytoplasmic 
scores are then combined, and four immunophenotypes are identified. First, breast tumors 
will be considered to be negative for cyclin E when staining is not detected in the nuclei or 
cytoplasm (phenotype 1). Second, in cases determined to be cyclin E+, if the nuclear staining 
score exceeded the cytoplasmic score, cyclin E expression is defined as predominantly 
nuclear (phenotype 2). Third, when the nuclear and cytoplasmic staining scores are equal, 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
24 
 cyclin E expression is considered to be both nuclear and cytoplasmic (phenotype 3). Fourth, if 
the cytoplasmic staining score is higher than the nuclear score, cyclin E expression is 
considered to be predominantly cytoplasmic (phenotype 4).  
Rb: The anti-human Clone 4H1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, 
Denvers, MA) at 1:100 dilution will be used to stain each slide. Each slide will be scored 
separately for intensity of staining and percentage of positive cells. Staining intensity will be 
scored as follows: 0, no staining; 1, weak positive (faint yellow staining); 2, intermediate 
positive; and 3, strong positive (brown staining). The number of positive cells will visually be 
evaluated and stratified as follows: <1%, 0 (negative); 1 to <5% positive cells, 1 (weak); 5-
50% positive cells, 2 (moderate); >50% positive cells, 3 (strong). The sum of the staining 
intensity and percentage of positive cell scores will be used to determine the staining index for 
each section, with a minimum score of 0 and maximum score of 6; scores  >1 will be defined 
as Rb positivity.  
 
5.3.2 Whole Blood/Plasma Biospecimens 
Blood specimens (Phase II only) will be collected as shown on Table [ADDRESS_8902] three tubes  one for plasma (8 mL CPT top) and the other for serum (6 mLred 
top) and one for whole blood (6 mLlavender).  Blood will be processed immediately following 
collections  tubes will be gently inverted and kept at room temperature prior to centrifuging, 
and clotted tube (red top) will have serum aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831], while the green top tube will have 
plasma aspi[INVESTIGATOR_9472] 0.5 mL cryovials and placed in a -20 C freezer 
(and stored long term at -80 C). A laboratory protocol contains additional details. 
 
5.3.3 Ki67 Tumor Assay and Scoring 
CLIA-approved Ki67 staining will be performed using anti-Ki67 rabbit monoclonal antibody 
( clone MIB-1, DAKO) in the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of 
Department of Pathology using an established protocol. Briefly this protocol includes de-
paraffinization (30 minutes at 72°C)and rehydration with antigen retrieval performed at 100°C 
for 20 minutes with Tris-EDTA buffer, pH 6.0.   
Endogenous peroxidase is blocked with 3% peroxide for 5 minutes. Primary anti-Ki-67 
antibody (Dako, clone MIB-1) is applied at 1:[ADDRESS_8903] primary 
antibody detection is carried out using a commercial polymer system (Bond Polymer Refine 
Detection, Leica), and stain development is achieved by [CONTACT_9528] (Leica).   
 
Ki67 staining will be evaluated in whole tissue sections without focusing on the hot spots. The 
staining will be quantitatively assessed by [CONTACT_9529]2 scanner (Leica Biosystems, Inc., [ADDRESS_8904], Buffalo Grove IL, 
[ZIP_CODE]).  All Ki67 immunostained slides will be scanned at [ADDRESS_8905] performed using red, orange, 
and yellow  (high, medium, and low reaction, respectively) to represent positive cells, and 
blue to represent negative ones.  A curvature threshold adjustment is made to de-cluster or

Version date: 03.17.21
25 
 break up large groups of closely apposed nuclei when needed. The original factory algorithm 
is also adjusted to avoid false positives by [CONTACT_9530]. All 
algorithm adjustments are tested to assure accurate detection of positive and negative 
nuclei.
 
5.4Banked Biospecimens 
Leftover blood and tumor samples which are not consumed for planned study testing will be retained 
for potential additional testing at a later date (i.e. if newer technologies become available) under the 
same objectives. Samples will be retained at a secure storage facility (in the laboratory of [CONTACT_9581] located in the Zayed building at [ADDRESS_8906], Houston, [LOCATION_007], [ZIP_CODE]) in case 
there is need for retesting or additional testing. Samples will be stored for up to 10 years or until 
termination of this study. These may be used for future studies only as approved by [CONTACT_9531]. 
 
 
6.0 .INVESTIGATIONAL AND NON  INVESTIGATIONAL AGENTS  
6.1Palbociclib 
 
6.1.1 Description of palbociclib 
Palbociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) [ADDRESS_8907] cancer cell lines with the combination of 
palbociclib and endocrine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_9473] (Rb) 
phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression and signaling, and increased growth 
arrest compared to treatment with each drug alone. In vitro treatment of ER-positive breast 
cancer cell lines with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to increased cell 
senescence, which was sustained for up to [ADDRESS_8908] cancer xenograft model demonstrated that the 
combination of palbociclib and letrozole increased the inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, 
downstream signaling and tumor growth compared to each drug alone ([COMPANY_007] Pharma United 
States product insert (USPI), (2015). Highlights of Prescribing Information; IBRANCE® 
(palbociclib) for oral use. [LOCATION_001]: [COMPANY_007], Inc.  details are contained in the package insert

6.2 Hydroxychloroquine 
 
6.2.1 Description of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ): 
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is a small molecule drug that is indicated for the suppressive 
treatment and treatment of acute attacks of malaria due to Plasmodium vivax , P. malariae , P. 
ovale, and susceptible strains of P. falciparum . It is also indicated for the treatment of discoid 
and systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis, and often used for overlap 
connective tissue disorders. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, it may be 
based on ability of HCQ to bind to and alter DNA. HCQ has also has been found to be taken 
up into the acidic food vacuoles of the parasite in the erythrocyte. This increases the pH of the 
acid vesicles, interfering with vesicle functions and possibly inhibiting phospholipid

7.0 ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING AND REPORTING
7.1 Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical 
condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related 
to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only 
considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values 
or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are 
considered clinically significant, or require therapy.
7.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting
view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
A life-threatening adverse drug experience any adverse experience that places the patient, in 
the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it 
occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions.
A congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9475] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 

MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8915] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or

7.4 Assessment of Adverse Events 
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9477].  
As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated using CTCAE V 4.03 criteria to 
determine: 
 The severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) or grade (1-4). 
 Its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected). 
 Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at the final exam). 
 Action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug 
permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medications taken; non-drug 
therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 Whether it constitutes a serious adverse events (SAE). 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8920], or other means, will be 
reported appropriately.   
Expected AEs are those AEs that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert (PI) or current  
includes AEs for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] 
. 
The investigator (or physician designee) is responsible for verifying and providing source 
documentation for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for all adverse events for subjects 
enrolled. 
7.5Communications between the Investigator and Supporting Company [COMPANY_007] 
 
SAEs that occur after completion of the reporting time period as defined above are reportable to 
[COMPANY_007] if the Investigator suspects a causal relationship between the [COMPANY_007] product and the SAE. Of 
note, [COMPANY_007] is supporting the study only with provision of palbociclib. 
 
-[PHONE_182] (See 
Appendix G in PDOL for [COMPANY_007] Reportable Events Fax Form). 
 
8.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Phase I: 
For the phase I portion, a 3+3 design will be used with 3 to 6 patients for each dose escalation cohort 
(depending on whether a DLT is seen) and 6 patients in the final (RP2D) cohort to assess the 
primary endpoint of safety and the determination of RP2D.38 Therefore a minimum of 12 and 
maximum of 18 patients will be enrolled.  This total does not include patients who may need to be 
replaced if not evaluable for DLT (see Section 3.3). 
 
Phase II: 
The Phase II portion will be performed in a different population of patients (early stage) in the pre-
operative setting.  In order to obtain qualitative information about the dose responsiveness of HCQ 
when added to letrozole and palbociclib, Part 1 of the Phase II portion will enroll 6 patients at an HCQ 
dose of 400 mg (if in fact, the RP2D is 600 or 800 mg).  Following this, Part 2 will be conducted at the 
RP2D for HCQ based on the primary endpoint of proportion of patients achieving tumoral CCCA, with 
the formal statistical plan using a 2-stage Simon optimal design and looking to increase the CCCA 
rate from 50% with low dose palbociclib + letrozole to 75% after the addition of HCQ. This design 
requires [ADDRESS_8921] 17 out of 25 total evaluable patients exhibit CCCA.  
 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
32 
 This design has alpha = 4%, 81% power, and a probability of 0.[ADDRESS_8922] stage if 
the true CCCA rate=50%.  For the group of patients at the RP2D, we therefore plan a sample size of 
30 patients over 12-15 months, accounting for patient dropout (including those with Ki67 >10% at 
T1). We have a large eligible patient population and have led national accruals in other multi-center 
neoadjuvant endocrine trials in post-menopausal women (e.g. ALTERNATE Trial). In addition, recent 
local experience of conducting window of opportunity trials in this setting have demonstrated the 
feasibility of accrual at a rate of ~[ADDRESS_8923] to achieve accrual goals. 
 
8.1  IND Office Reporting 
 
The Investigator is responsible for completing toxicity/efficacy summary reports and submitting them 
to the IND office

1. INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE
IBRANCE is indicated for the treatment of HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer in combination with:
an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine based therapy in 
postmenopausal women; or
fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine 
therapy.
2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
1. Recommended Dose and Schedule
The recommended dose of IBRANCE is a 125 mg capsule taken orally once daily for 21 consecutive 
days followed by 7 days off treatment to comprise a complete cycle of 28 days. IBRANCE should be 
taken with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .
administer the recommended dose of an aromatase inhibitor when given with IBRANCE. Please refer 
to the Full Prescribing Information for the aromatase inhibitor being used.
When given with IBRANCE, the recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg administered on Days 1, 
15, 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the Full Prescribing Information of fulvestrant.
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose of IBRANCE at approximately the same time each 
day.
If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. The next prescribed 
dose should be taken at the usual time. IBRANCE capsules should be swallowed whole (do not 
chew, crush, or open them prior to swallowing). Capsules should not be ingested if they are broken, 
cracked, or otherwise not intact.

4. Dose Modifications for Use With Strong CYP3A Inhibitors 
 
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors and consider an alternative concomitant 
medication with no or minimal CYP3A inhibition. If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor, reduce the IBRANCE dose to 75 mg once daily. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, 
increase the IBRANCE dose (after 3 to 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose used prior to the 
initiation of the strong CYP3A inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
1. Neutropenia 
Neutropenia was the most frequently reported adverse reaction in Study 1 (PALOMA-2) with an 
incidence of 80% and Study 2 (PALOMA-
neutrophil counts was reported in 66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole in Study 1 and 
66% of patients receiving IBRANCE plus fulvestrant in Study 2. In Study 1 and 2, the median time to 
ia 
was 7 days [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 
 
Monitor complete blood counts prior to starting IBRANCE therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, 
as well as on Day [ADDRESS_8942] 2 cycles, and as clinically indicated. Dose interruption, dose 
reduction, or delay in starting treatment cycles is recommended for patients who develop Grade 3 or 
4 neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 
 
Febrile neutropenia has been reported in 1.8% of patients exposed to IBRANCE across Studies 1 
and 2. One death due to neutropenic sepsis was observed in Study 2. Physicians should inform 
patients to promptly report any epi[INVESTIGATOR_3942] [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . 
 
2. Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of palbociclib 
to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity at maternal 
e human clinical exposure based on area under the curve (AUC). 
Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to

ADVERSE REACTIONS 
The following topic is described below and elsewhere in the labeling: Neutropenia [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)].  
 
3. Clinical Studies Experience 
 
Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed 
cannot be directly compared to rates in other trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical 
practice. 
 
Study 1: IBRANCE plus Letrozole 
 
5. Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer for initial endocrine based therapy 
 
The safety of IBRANCE (125 mg/day) plus letrozole (2.5 mg/day) versus placebo plus letrozole was 
evaluated in Study 1 (PALOMA-2). The data described below reflect exposure to IBRANCE in [ADDRESS_8944] 1 
dose of IBRANCE plus letrozole in Study 1. The median duration of treatment for IBRANCE plus 
letrozole was 19.8 months while the median duration of treatment for placebo plus letrozole arm was 
13.8 months. 
 
Dose reductions due to an adverse reaction of any grade occurred in 36% of patients receiving 
IBRANCE plus letrozole. No dose reduction was allowed for letrozole in Study 1. 
 
Permanent discontinuation associated with an adverse reaction occurred in 43 of 444 (9.7%) patients 
receiving IBRANCE plus letrozole and in 13 of 222 (5.9%) patients receiving placebo plus letrozole.

3. DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 
Palbociclib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A and sulfotransferase (SULT) enzyme SULT2A1. In 
vivo, palbociclib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A. 
 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8948] of CYP3A 
Inhibitors 
Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) increased the plasma exposure of 
palbociclib in healthy subjects by 87%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors 
(e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, and voriconazole). Avoid grapefruit or 
grapefruit juice during IBRANCE treatment. If coadministration of IBRANCE with a strong CYP3A 
inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of IBRANCE [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
 
1. Agents That May Decrease Palbociclib Plasma Concentrations Effect of CYP3A 
Inducers 
Coadministration of a strong CYP3A inducer (rifampin) decreased the plasma exposure of palbociclib 
in healthy subjects by 85%. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., phenytoin, 
 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
 
2. Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by [CONTACT_9545] 61%, in healthy subjects, compared to administration of midazolam alone. The dose of 
the sensitive CYP3A substrate with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, 
dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924], quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus) 
may need to be reduced, as IBRANCE may increase its exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
 
 
4. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
 
0. Pregnancy Risk Summary 
Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm 
when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . There are no available 
data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, 
administration of palbociclib to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in 
embryofetal toxicity at maternal exposures that were 4 times the human clinical exposure based on 
AUC [see Data] . Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. 
 
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is 
unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and 
miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. 
 
11.Data 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
52 
  
Animal Data
 
In a fertility and early embryonic development study in female rats, palbociclib was administered 
orally for 15 days before mating through to Day 7 of pregnancy, which did not cause embryo toxicity 
at doses up to 300 mg/kg/day with maternal systemic exposures approximately 4 times the human 
exposure (AUC) at the recommended dose. 
 
In embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, pregnant animals received oral doses of 
palbociclib up to 300 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively, during the period of organogenesis. 
The maternally toxic dose of 300 mg/kg/day was fetotoxic in rats, resulting in reduced fetal body 
(increased incidence of a rib present at the seventh cervical vertebra). At the maternally toxic dose of 
20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, there was an increased incidence of skeletal variations, including small 
phalanges in the forelimb. At 300 mg/kg/day in rats and 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, the maternal 
systemic exposures were approximately 4 and 9 times the human exposure (AUC) at the 
recommended dose, respectively. 
 
CDK4/[ADDRESS_8949] been reported to die in late stages of fetal development 
(gestation Day 14.5 until birth) due to severe anemia. However, knockout mouse data may not be 
predictive of effects in humans due to differences in degree of target inhibition. 
 
1. Lactation Risk Summary 
There is no information regarding the presence of palbociclib in human milk, its effects on milk 
production, or the breastfed infant. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in 
breastfed infants from IBRANCE, advise a lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with 
IBRANCE and for [ADDRESS_8950] dose. 
2. Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing 
Based on animal studies, IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman 
[see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy 
test prior to starting treatment with IBRANCE. 
 
12. Contraception 
 
Females 
 
IBRANCE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific 
Populations (8.1)] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during 
treatment with IBRANCE and for at least [ADDRESS_8951] dose.

13.Infertility 
 
Males
 
Based on animal studies, IBRANCE may impair fertility in males of reproductive potential [see 
Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 
 
3. Pediatric Use 
 
The safety and efficacy of IBRANCE in pediatric patients have not been studied. 
Altered glucose metabolism (glycosuria, hyperglycemia, decreased insulin) associated with changes 
in the pancreas (islet cell vacuolation), eye (cataracts, lens degeneration), kidney (tubule vacuolation, 
chronic progressive nephropathy) and adipose tissue (atrophy) were identified in a [ADDRESS_8953] 
exposure [AUC] at the recommended dose). Some of these findings (glycosuria/hyperglycemia, 
pancreatic islet cell vacuolation, and kidney tubule vacuolation) were present with lower incidence 
and severity in a 15 week repeat-dose toxicology study in immature rats. Altered glucose metabolism 
or associated changes in the pancreas, eye, kidney and adipose tissue were not identified in a 27-
week repeat-dose toxicology study in rats that were mature at the beginning of the study and in dogs 
in repeat-dose toxicology studies up to 39 weeks duration. 
 
Toxicities in teeth independent of altered glucose metabolism were observed in rats. Administration 
of 100 mg/kg palbociclib for 27 weeks (approximately 15 times the adult human exposure [AUC] at 
the recommended dose) resulted in abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (discolored, ameloblast 
degeneration/necrosis, mononuclear cell infiltrate). Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric 
patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals. 
4. Geriatric Use 
 
Of 444 patients who received IBRANCE i
 
differences in safety or effectiveness of IBRANCE were observed between these patients and 
younger patients.

1. OVERDOSAGE 
 
There is no known antidote for IBRANCE. The treatment of overdose of IBRANCE should consist of 
general supportive measures. 
 
2. DESCRIPTION 
 
IBRANCE capsules for oral administration contain 125 mg, 100 mg, or 75 mg of palbociclib, a kinase 
inhibitor. The molecular formula for palbociclib is C24H29N7O2. The molecular weight is 
447.54 daltons. The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 6-acetyl-8-cyclopentyl-5-methyl-2-{[5-(pi[INVESTIGATOR_9482]-1-yl) pyridin-2
yl] amino} pyrido [2, 3- d] pyrimidin-7(8 H)-one, and its structural formula is:

Palbociclib is a yellow to orange powder with pKa of 7.4 (the secondary pi[INVESTIGATOR_9483]) and 
3.9 (the pyridine nitrogen). At or below pH 4, palbociclib behaves as a high-solubility compound. 
Above pH 4, the solubility of the drug substance reduces significantly. 
Inactive ingredients: Microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, sodium starch glycolate, 
colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, and hard gelatin capsule shells. The light orange, light 
orange/caramel, and caramel opaque capsule shells contain gelatin, red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide, 
and titanium dioxide; the printing ink contains shellac, titanium dioxide, ammonium hydroxide, 
propylene glycol, and simethicone.  
 
3. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
 
1. Mechanism of Action 
 
Palbociclib is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6. Cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 are 
downstream of signaling pathways which lead to cellular proliferation. In vitro, palbociclib reduced 
cellular proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cell lines by [CONTACT_9546] G1 into S phase of the cell cycle. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines 
with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens leads to decreased retinoblastoma (Rb) protein 
phosphorylation resulting in reduced E2F expression and signaling, and increased growth arrest 
compared to treatment with each drug alone. In vitro treatment of ER-positive breast cancer cell lines 
with the combination of palbociclib and antiestrogens led to increased cell senescence compared to 
each drug alone, which was sustained for up to [ADDRESS_8956] 
cancer xenograft model demonstrated that the combination of palbociclib and letrozole increased the 
inhibition of Rb phosphorylation, downstream signaling, and tumor growth compared to each drug 
alone. 
 

MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8957] of palbociclib on the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) was evaluated using time- 
matched electrocardiograms (ECGs) evaluating the change from baseline and corresponding 
pharmacokinetic data in [ADDRESS_8958] on QTc (i.e. > 
20 ms) at 125 mg once daily (Schedule 3/1). 
 
3. Pharmacokinetics 
 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of palbociclib were characterized in patients with solid tumors including 
advanced breast cancer and in healthy subjects. 
 
14. Absorption 
 
The mean maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of palbociclib is generally observed between 6 
to 12 hours (time to reach maximum concentration, Tmax) following oral administration. The mean 
absolute bioavailability of IBRANCE after an oral 125 mg dose is 46%. In the dosing range of 25 mg 
to 225 mg, the AUC and Cmax increased proportionally with dose in general. Steady state was 
achieved within 8 days following repeated once daily dosing. With repeated once daily administration, 
palbociclib accumulated with a median accumulation ratio of 2.4 (range 1.5 to 4.2). 
 
Food effect: Palbociclib absorption and exposure were very low in approximately 13% of the 
population under the fasted condition. Food intake increased the palbociclib exposure in this small 
subset of the 
population, but did not alter palbociclib exposure in the rest of the population to a clinically relevant 
extent. Therefore, food intake reduced the intersubject variability of palbociclib exposure, which 
supports administration of IBRANCE with food. Compared to IBRANCE given under overnight fasted 
conditions, the population average area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity 
(AUCINF) and Cmax of palbociclib increased by 21% and 38%, respectively, when given with high-
fat, high-calorie food (approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from 
protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), by 12% and 27%, respectively, when given with low-fat, 
low-calorie food (approximately 400 to 500 calories with 120, 250, and 28 to 35 calories from protein, 
carbohydrate, and fat, respectively), and by 13% and 24%, respectively, when moderate-fat, 
standard calorie food (approximately 500 to 700 calories with 75 to 105, 250 to 350 and 175 to 245 
calories from protein, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively) was given 1 hour before and 2 hours after 
IBRANCE dosing. 
 
15. Distribution 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
57 
  
Binding of palbociclib to human plasma proteins in vitro was approximately 85%, with no
concentration dependence over the concentration range of 500 ng/mL to 5000 ng/mL. The geometric 
mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) was 2583 L with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 26%. 
 
16.Metabolism 
 
In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that palbociclib undergoes hepatic metabolism in humans. 
Following oral administration of a single 125 mg dose of [14C]palbociclib to humans, the primary 
metabolic pathways for palbociclib involved oxidation and sulfonation, with acylation and 
glucuronidation contributing as minor pathways. Palbociclib was the major circulating drug-derived 
entity in plasma (23%). The major circulating metabolite was a glucuronide conjugate of palbociclib, 
although it only represented 1.5% of the administered dose in the excreta. Palbociclib was 
extensively metabolized with unchanged drug accounting for 2.3% and 6.9% of radioactivity in feces 
and urine, respectively. In feces, the sulfamic acid conjugate of palbociclib was the major drug-
related component, accounting for 26% of the administered dose. In vitro studies with human 
hepatocytes, liver cytosolic and S9 fractions, and recombinant SULT enzymes indicated that CYP3A 
and SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the metabolism of palbociclib. 
 
17.Elimination 
 
The geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of palbociclib was 63.1 L/hr (29% CV), and the 
mean (± standard deviation) plasma elimination half-life was 29 (±5) hours in patients with advanced 
breast cancer. In 6 healthy male subjects given a single oral dose of [14C]palbociclib, a median of 
91.6% of the total administered radioactive dose was recovered in 15 days; feces (74.1% of dose) 
was the major route of excretion, with 17.5% of the dose recovered in urine. The majority of the 
material was excreted as metabolites. 
 
18.Age, Gender, and Body Weight 
 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis in 183 patients with cancer (50 male and 133 
female patients, age range from 22 to 89 years, and body weight range from 37.9 to 123 kg), gender 
had no effect on the exposure of palbociclib, and age and body weight had no clinically important 
effect on the exposure of palbociclib. 
19.Pediatric Population 
 
Pharmacokinetics of IBRANCE have not been evaluated in patients <18 years of age. 
 
20.Drug Interactions 
 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
58 
 In vitro data indicate that CYP3A and SULT enzyme SULT2A1 are mainly involved in the metabolism 
of palbociclib. Palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg dosing 
to steady state in humans. In vitro, palbociclib is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 
2C19, and 2D6, and is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 3A4 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. 
 
CYP3A Inhibitors: Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=12) indicate that 
coadministration of multiple 200 mg daily doses of itraconazole with a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose 
increased palbociclib AUCINF and the Cmax by [CONTACT_3450] 87% and 34%, respectively, relative 
to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] . 
 
CYP3A Inducers: Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=15) indicate that 
coadministration of multiple 600 mg daily doses of rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, with a single 
125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCINF and Cmax by 85% and 70%, respectively, 
relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone. Data from a drug interaction trial in healthy 
subjects (N=14) indicate that coadministration of multiple 400 mg daily doses of modafinil, a 
moderate 
CYP3A inducer, with a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose decreased palbociclib AUCINF and Cmax by 
32% and 11%, respectively, relative to a single 125 mg IBRANCE dose given alone [see Drug 
Interactions (7.2)] . 
 
CYP3A Substrates: Palbociclib is a weak time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A following daily 125 mg 
dosing to steady state in humans. In a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects (N=26), 
coadministration of midazolam with multiple doses of IBRANCE increased the midazolam 
AUCINF and the Cmax values by 61% and 37%, respectively, as compared to administration of 
midazolam alone [see Drug Interactions (7.3)] . 
 
Gastric pH Elevating Medications: In a drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, coadministration of a 
single 125 mg dose of IBRANCE with multiple doses of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) rabeprazole 
under fed conditions decreased palbociclib Cmax by 41%, but had limited impact on AUCINF 
(13% decrease), when compared to a single dose of IBRANCE administered alone. Given the 
reduced effect on gastric pH of H2-receptor antagonists and local antacids compared to PPIs, the 
effect of these classes of acid-reducing agents on palbociclib exposure under fed conditions is 
expected to be minimal. Under fed conditions there is no clinically relevant effect of PPIs, H2-
receptor antagonists, or local antacids on palbociclib exposure. In another healthy subject study, 
coadministration of a single dose of IBRANCE with multiple doses of the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_9484] 62% and 80%, respectively, when 
compared to a single dose of IBRANCE administered alone. 
 
Letrozole: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no drug 
interaction between palbociclib and letrozole when the 2 drugs were coadministered.  
 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
59 
 Fulvestrant: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically 
relevant drug interaction between palbociclib and fulvestrant when the 2 drugs were coadministered.
Goserelin: Data from a clinical trial in patients with breast cancer showed that there was no clinically 
relevant drug interaction between palbociclib and goserelin when the 2 drugs were coadministered.  
 
Anastrozole or exemestane: No clinical data are available to evaluate drug interactions between 
anastrozole or exemestane and palbociclib. A clinically significant drug interaction between 
anastrozole or exemestane and palbociclib is not expected based on analyses of the effects of 
anastrozole, exemestane and palbociclib on or by [CONTACT_9547].  
 
Effect of Palbociclib on Transporters: In vitro evaluations indicated that palbociclib has a low potential 
to inhibit the activities of drug transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), organic anion transporter (OAT)1, OAT3, organic cation transporter (OCT)2, and organic 
anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3 at clinically relevant concentrations.  
 
Effect of Transporters on Palbociclib: Based on in vitro data, P-gp and BCRP mediated transport are 
unlikely to affect the extent of oral absorption of palbociclib at therapeutic doses.  
 
4. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
 
1. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with palbociclib. 
 
Palbociclib was aneugenic in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells in vitro and in the bone marrow of male 
reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte 
chromosome aberration assay. 
 
In a fertility study in female rats, palbociclib did not affect mating or fertility at any dose up to 
300 mg/kg/day (approximately 4 times human clinical exposure based on AUC) and no adverse 
effects were observed in the female reproductive tissues in repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 300 
mg/kg/day in the rat and 3 mg/kg/day in the dog (approximately 6 times and similar to human 
exposure [AUC], at the recommended dose, respectively). 
 
The adverse effects of palbociclib on male reproductive function and fertility were observed in the 
repeat-dose toxicology studies in rats and dogs and a male fertility study in rats. In repeat-dose 
toxicology studies, palbociclib-related findings in the testis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], prostate, and seminal vesicle 
at 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
60 
 gs included decreased organ weight, atrophy or 
degeneration, hypospermia, intratubular cellular debris, and decreased secretion. Partial reversibility 
of male reproductive organ effects was observed in the rat and dog following a 4- and 12-week non-
dosing 
times, respectively, the exposure [AUC] in humans at the recommended dose. In the fertility and 
early embryonic development study in male rats, palbociclib caused no effects on mating but resulted 
in a slight decrease in fertility in association with lower sperm motility and density at 100 mg/kg/day 
with projected exposure levels [AUC] of 20 times the exposure in humans at the recommended dose.
 
21. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Study 1: IBRANCE plus Letrozole 
22. Patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer for initial 
endocrine based therapy 
Study 1 (PALOMA-2) was an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter 
study of IBRANCE plus letrozole versus placebo plus letrozole conducted in postmenopausal women 
with 
ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had not received previous systemic 
treatment for their advanced disease. A total of 666 patients were randomized 2:1 to IBRANCE plus 
letrozole or placebo plus letrozole. Randomization was stratified by [CONTACT_9548] (visceral versus non-
visceral), disease-
treatment to disease recurrence versus >12 months from the end of adjuvant treatment to disease 
recurrence), and nature of prior (neo) adjuvant anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (prior hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_9485]). IBRANCE was given orally at a dose of [ADDRESS_8959]. The major efficacy outcome of the study was investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival (PFS) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 
(RECIST). 
 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 62 years (range 28 to 89). The majority of 
patients were White (78%), and most patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status (PS) of 0 or 1 (98%). Forty-eight percent of patients had received chemotherapy 
and 56% had received antihormonal therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting prior to their 
diagnosis of advanced breast cancer. Thirty-seven percent of patients had no prior systemic therapy 
in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. The majority of patients (97%) had metastatic disease. 
Twenty-three percent of patients had bone only disease, and 49% of patients had visceral disease. 
 
Major efficacy results from Study 1 are summarized in Table 8 and Figure 1. Consistent results were 
observed across patient subgroups of disease-free interval (DFI), disease site, and prior therapy. The 
treatment effect of the combination on PFS was also supported by [CONTACT_9549]. The overall survival (OS) data were not mature at the time of the final PFS analysis 
(20% of patients had died). Patients will continue to be followed for the final analysis.

Study 2: IBRANCE plus Fulvestrant 
 
25. Patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have 
had disease progression on or after prior adjuvant or metastatic endocrine 
therapy 
 
Study 2 (PALOMA-3) was an international, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter 
study of IBRANCE plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant conducted in women with HR-
positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, regardless of their menopausal status, whose 
disease progressed on or after prior endocrine therapy. A total of 521 pre/postmenopausal women 
were randomized 2:1 to IBRANCE plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant and stratified by 
[CONTACT_9550], menopausal status at study entry (pre/peri versus 
postmenopausal), and presence of visceral metastases. IBRANCE was given orally at a dose of 125 
mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by 7 days off treatment. Pre/perimenopausal women were 
enrolled in the study and received the LHRH agonist goserelin for at least [ADDRESS_8960] 1.1. 
 
Patients enrolled in this study had a median age of 57 years (range 29 to 88). The majority of 
patients on study were White (74%), all patients had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and 80% were 
postmenopausal. All patients had received prior systemic therapy, and 75% of patients had received 
a previous chemotherapy regimen. Twenty-five percent of patients had received no prior therapy in 
the metastatic disease setting, 60% had visceral metastases, and 23% had bone only disease. 
 
The results from the investigator-assessed PFS from Study 2 are summarized in Table 9 and Figure 
2. Consistent results were observed across patient subgroups of disease site, sensitivity to prior 
hormonal therapy and menopausal status. The overall survival (OS) data were not mature at the time 
of the final PFS analysis (11% of patients had died). Patients will continue to be followed for the final 
analysis.

PHYSICIANS SHOULD COMPLETELY FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE 
COMPLETE CONTENTS OF THIS LEAFLET BEFORE PRESCRIBING 
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE. 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8969] 
been reported following the accidental ingestion of chloroquine, sometimes in relatively small doses 
(0.75 g or 1 g in one 3-year-old child). Patients should be strongly warned to keep these drugs out 
of the reach of children. 
Use of PLAQUENIL in patients with psoriasis may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a severe attack of psoriasis. When 
used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated. The preparation should not be 
used in these conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient outweighs 
the possible hazard. 
Usage in Pregnancy Usage of this drug during pregnancy should be avoided except in the 
suppression or treatment of malaria when in the judgment of the physician the benefit outweighs the 
possible hazard. It should be noted that radioactively-tagged chloroquine administered 
intravenously to pregnant, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9488]. It accumulated 
selectively in the melanin structures of the fetal eyes and was retained in the ocular tissues for five 
months after the drug had been eliminated from the rest of the body. 
 
 
31.PRECAUTIONS, General  
Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism 
or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. 
Periodic blood cell counts should be made if patients are given prolonged therapy. If any severe 
blood disorder appears which is not attributable to the disease under treatment, discontinuation of 
the drug should be considered. The drug should be administered with caution in patients having G-
6-PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency. 
 
 
32.OVERDOSAGE  
The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_9489], and in 
accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may 
occur within [ADDRESS_8970]. The electrocardiogram may reveal atrial standstill, nodal rhythm, prolonged intraventricular 
conduction time, and progressive bradycardia leading to ventricular fibrillation and/or arrest. 
Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt with immediate evacuation of the stomach by 
[CONTACT_9551] (at home, before transportation to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) or gastric lavage until the stomach is 
completely emptied. If finely powdered, activated charcoal is introduced by [CONTACT_9552], after 
lavage, and within [ADDRESS_8971] five times the 
estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested.  Convulsions, if present, should be controlled

six hours. Fluids may be forced, and sufficient ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for 
adults) may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine to help promote urinary excretion in 
cases of both overdosage and sensitivity. 
 
 
33. Actions  
Like chloroquine phosphate, USP, PLAQUENIL is highly active against the erythrocytic forms of P. 
vivax and malariae and most strains of P. falciparum (but not the gametocytes of P. falciparum ). 
PLAQUENIL does not prevent relapses in patients with vivax or malariae malaria because it is not 
effective against exo-erythrocytic forms of the parasite, nor will it prevent vivax or malariae infection 
when administered as a prophylactic. It is highly effective as a suppressive agent in patients with 
vivax or malariae malaria, in terminating acute attacks, and significantly lengthening the interval 
between treatment and relapse. In patients with falciparum malaria, it abolishes the acute attack 
and effects complete cure of the infection, unless due to a resistant strain of P. falciparum . 
34. Indications  
PLAQUENIL is indicated for the treatment of acute attacks and suppression of malaria. 
35. Warning  
In recent years, it has been found that certain strains of P. falciparum have become resistant to 4-
aminoquinoline compounds (including hydroxychloroquine) as shown by [CONTACT_9555]. 
Treatment with quinine or other specific forms of therapy is therefore advised for patients infected 
with a resistant strain of parasites. 
36. Adverse Reactions  
Following the administration in doses adequate for the treatment of an acute malarial attack, mild 
and transient headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal complaints (diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, 
abdominal cramps and, on rare occasions, vomiting) may occur. 
Cardiomyopathy has been rarely reported with high daily dosages of hydroxychloroquine. 
37. Dosage and Administration  
One tablet of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is equivalent to 155 mg base. 
Malaria: Suppression  In adults , 400 mg (=310 mg base) on exactly the same day of each week. 
In infants and children , the weekly suppressive dosage is 5 mg, calculated as base, per kg of body 
weight, but should not exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. 

MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
73 
 If circumstances permit, suppressive therapy should begin two weeks prior to exposure. However, 
failing this, in adults an initial double (loading) dose of 800 mg (=620 mg base), or in children 10 mg 
base/kg may be taken in two divided doses, six hours apart. The suppressive therapy should be 
continued for eight weeks after leaving the endemic area. 
Treatment of the acute attack  In adults , an initial dose of 800 mg (= 620 mg base) followed by 400 
mg (=310 mg base) in six to eight hours and 400 mg (=310 mg base) on each of two consecutive 
days (total 2 g hydroxychloroquine sulfate or 1.55 g base). An alternative method, employing a single 
dose of 800 mg (=620 mg base), has also proved effective. 
The dosage for adults may also be calculated on the basis of body weight; this method is preferred 
for infants and children. A total dose representing 25 mg of base per kg of body weight is 
administered in three days, as follows: 
First dose: 10 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 620 mg base). 
Second dose: 5 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 310 mg base) [ADDRESS_8973] dose: 5 mg base per kg 18 hours after second dose. Fourth dose: [ADDRESS_8974] not responded satisfactorily to 
drugs with less potential for serious side effects: lupus erythematosus (chronic discoid and systemic) 
and acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis. 
39.Warnings  
PHYSICIANS SHOULD COMPLETELY FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE COMPLETE 
CONTENTS OF THIS LEAFLET BEFORE PRESCRlBlNG PLAQUENIL. 
Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received long- term or high-
dosage 4-aminoquinoline therapy for discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid 
arthritis.  Retinopathy has been reported to be dose-related. 
When prolonged therapy with any Antimalarial compound is contemplated, initial (base line) and 
periodic (every three months) ophthalmologic examinations (including visual acuity, expert slit-lamp, 
funduscopic, and visual field tests) should be performed. 
If there is any indication of abnormality in the visual acuity, visual field, or retinal macular areas (such 
as pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], loss of foveal reflex), or any visual symptoms (such as light flashes and 
streaks) which are not fully explainable by [CONTACT_9556], the drug 
should be discontinued immediately and the patient closely observed LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS AND  
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

 for possible progression. Retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after 
cessation of therapy. 
All patients on long-term therapy with this preparation should be questioned and examined 
periodically, including the testing of knee and ankle reflexes, to detect any evidence of muscular 
weakness.  If weakness occurs, discontinue the drug. 
In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, if objective improvement (such as reduced joint swelling, 
increased mobility) does not occur within six months, the drug should be discontinued. Safe use of 
the drug in the treatment of juvenile arthritis has not been established. 
 
 
40. Precautions  
Dermatologic reactions to PLAQUENIL may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised 
when it is administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce 
dermatitis. 
The methods recommended for early diagnosi  
(1) funduscopic examination of the macula for fine pi[INVESTIGATOR_9492] (2) examination of the central visual field with a small red test object for pericentral or 
paracentral scotoma or determination of retinal thresholds to red. Any unexplained visual 
symptoms, such as light flashes or streaks should also be regarded with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_9493]. 
If serious toxic symptoms occur from overdosage or sensitivity, it has been suggested that 
ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) be administered orally three or four days a 
week for several months after therapy has been stopped, as acidification of the urine increases 
renal excretion of the 4-aminoquinoline compounds by [ADDRESS_8975] be 
exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis. 
 
 
41. Adverse Reactions  
Not all of the following reactions have been observed with every 4-aminoquinoline compound during 
long-term therapy, but they have been reported with one or more and should be borne in mind when 
drugs of this class are administered. Adverse effects with different compounds vary in type and 
frequency. 
CNS Reactions: Irritability, nervousness, emotional changes, nightmares, psychosis, headache, 
dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus, nerve deafness, convulsions, ataxia. 
Neuromuscular Reactions: Skeletal muscle palsies or skeletal muscle myopathy or 
neuromyopathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups which may 
be associated with mild sensory changes, depression of tendon reflexes and abnormal nerve 
conduction. 
Ocular Reactions:  
A. Ciliary body : Disturbance of accommodation with symptoms of blurred vision. This reaction is 
dose-related and reversible with cessation of therapy. 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
75 
 B. Cornea: Transient edema, punctate to lineal opacities, decreased corneal sensitivity. The corneal 
changes, with or without accompanying symptoms (blurred vision, halos around lights, 
photophobia), are fairly common, but reversible. Corneal deposits may appear as early as three 
weeks following initiation of therapy. 
The incidence of corneal changes and visual side effects appears to be considerably lower with 
hydroxychloroquine than with chloroquine. 
C. Retina: Macula -
appearance), loss of foveal reflex, increased macular recovery time following exposure to a 
bright light (photo-stress test), elevated retinal threshold to red light in macular, paramacular, and 
peripheral retinal areas. 
Other fundus changes include optic disc pallor and atrophy, attenuation of retinal arterioles, fine 
granular pi[INVESTIGATOR_9494]. 
D. Visual field defects : Pericentral or paracentral scotoma, central scotoma with decreased visual 
acuity, rarely field constriction, abnormal color vision. 
The most common visual symptoms attributed to the retinopathy are: reading and seeing difficulties 
(words, letters, or parts of objects missing), photophobia, blurred distance vision, missing or blacked 
out areas in the central or peripheral visual field, light flashes and streaks. 
Retinopathy appears to be dose related and has occurred within several months (rarely) to several 
years of daily therapy; a small number of cases have been reported several years after antimalarial 
drug therapy was discontinued.  It has not been noted during prolonged use of weekly doses of the 
4-aminoquinoline compounds for suppression of malaria. 
Patients with retinal changes may have visual symptoms or may be asymptomatic (with or without 
visual field changes). Rarely scotomatous vision or field defects may occur without obvious retinal 
change. 
Retinopathy may progress even after the drug is discontinued. In a number of patients, early 
retinopathy (macular pi[INVESTIGATOR_9495]) diminished or regressed 
completely after therapy was discontinued. Paracentral scotoma to red targets (sometimes called 
of therapy. 
A small number of cases of retinal changes have been reported as occurring in patients who 
received only hydroxychloroquine. These usually consisted of alteration in retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_9496]; visual field defects were also present 
in some instances. A case of delayed retinopathy has been reported with loss of vision starting one 
year after administration of hydroxychloroquine had been discontinued. 
Dermatologic Reactions: Bleaching of hair, alopecia, pruritus, skin and mucosal pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
photosentivity, and skin eruptions (urticarial, morbilliform, lichenoid, maculopapular, purpuric, 
erythema annulare centrifugum, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous 
pustulosis, and exfoliative dermatitis). 
Hematologic Reactions: Various blood dyscrasias such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, 
leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (hemolysis in individuals with glucose- 6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency). 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
76 
 Gastrointestinal Reactions: Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps.  
Isolated cases of abnormal liver function and fulminant hepatic failure. 
Allergic reactions: Urticaria, angioedema and bronchospasm have been reported.
Miscellaneous Reactions: Weight loss, lassitude, exacerbation or precipi[INVESTIGATOR_9497]-sensitive psoriasis. 
Cardiomyopathy has been rarely reported with high daily dosages of hydroxychloroquine. 
 
 
42. Dosage and Administration  
One tablet of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 200 mg, is equivalent to 155 mg base. 
Lupus erythematosus Initially, the average adult dose is 400 mg (=310 mg base) once or twice 
daily. This may be continued for several weeks or months, depending on the response of the 
patient. For prolonged maintenance therapy, a smaller dose, from 200 mg to 400 mg (=155 mg to 
310 mg base) daily will frequently suffice. 
The incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is 
exceeded. 
Rheumatoid arthritis The compound is cumulative in action and will require several weeks to 
exert its beneficial therapeutic effects, whereas minor side effects may occur relatively early. 
Several months of therapy may be required before maximum effects can be obtained. If objective 
improvement (such as reduced joint swelling, increased mobility) does not occur within six months, 
the drug should be discontinued. Safe use of the drug in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid 
arthritis has not been established. 
Initial dosage In adults, from 400 mg to 600 mg (=310 mg to 465 mg base) daily, each dose to be 
taken with a meal or a glass of milk. In a small percentage of patients, troublesome side effects may 
require temporary reduction of the initial dosage. Later (usually from five to ten days), the dose may 
gradually be increased to the optimum response level, often without return of side effects. 
Maintenance dosage When a good response is obtained (usually in four to twelve weeks), the 
dosage is reduced by 50 percent and continued at a usual maintenance level of 200 mg to 400 mg 
(=155 mg to 310 mg base) daily, each dose to be taken with a meal or a glass of milk. The 
incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded.
Should a relapse occur after medication is withdrawn, therapy may be resumed or continued on an 
intermittent schedule if there are no ocular contraindications. 
Corticosteroids and salicylates may be used in conjunction with this compound, and they can 
generally be decreased gradually in dosage or eliminated after the drug has been used for several 
weeks.  When gradual reduction of steroid dosage is indicated, it may be done by [CONTACT_9557] 5 mg to 15 mg; of hydrocortisone from 
5 mg to 10 mg; of prednisolone and prednisone from 1 mg to 2.5 mg; of methylprednisolone and 
triamcinolone from 1 mg to 2 mg; and of dexamethasone from 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg.

Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8978] Cancer  
Femara (letrozole) is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor 
positive early breast cancer.  
1.[ADDRESS_8979] cancer is based on an analysis of disease-free survival in patients treated 
with Femara for a median of 60 months [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)] . 
1.[ADDRESS_8980] cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy [see Clinical 
Studies (14.4, 14.5)].  
 
2DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
2.[ADDRESS_8981] approval adjuvant study, median treatment duration was 5 years. Treatment should be 
discontinued at relapse [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. 
2.[ADDRESS_8982] Cancer 
In the extended adjuvant setting, the optimal treatment duration with Femara is not known. The planned 
duration of treatment in the study was 5 years. In the final updated analysis, conducted at a median follow-up 
of 62 months, the median treatment duration for Femara was 60 months. Seventy-one (71%) percent of patients 
were treated for at least 3 years and 58% of patients completed at least 
4.5 years of extended adjuvant treatment. The treatment should be discontinued at tumor relapse [see Clinical Studies 
(14.2)].
2.[ADDRESS_8983] Cancer 
In patients with advanced disease, treatment with Femara should continue until tumor progression is evident [see 
Clinical Studies (14.4, 14.5)] . 
2.5 Use in Hepatic Impairment 
No dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, although Femara 
blood concentrations were modestly increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment due to cirrhosis. 
The dose of Femara in patients with cirrhosis and severe hepatic dysfunction should be reduced by 50% [see 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21

 Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. The recommended dose of Femara for such patients is 2.[ADDRESS_8984] of hepatic impairment on Femara exposure in noncirrhotic cancer patients with 
elevated bilirubin levels has not been determined. 
2.6 Use in Renal Impairment 
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment if creatinine clearance is greater than or equal to 10 
mL/min [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 
 
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 
2.5 mg tablets: dark yellow, film-coated, round, slightly biconvex, with beveled edges (imprinted with the 
letters FV on one side and CG on the other side).

Version date: 03.17.21
82 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
5.1Bone Effects
Use of Femara may cause decreases in bone mineral density (BMD). Consideration should be given to 
monitoring BMD. Results of a safety study to evaluate safety in the adjuvant setting comparing the effect on 
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L2-L4) BMD of adjuvant treatment with letrozole to that with tamoxifen showed at 24 months 
a median decrease in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_9498] 4.1% in the letrozole arm compared to a median increase of 0.3% 
in the tamoxifen arm (difference = 4.4%) ( P <0.0001) [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . Updated results from the 
BMD substudy (MA-17B) in the extended adjuvant setting demonstrated that at 2 years patients receiving 
letrozole had a median decrease from baseline of 3.8% in hip BMD compared to a median decrease of 2.0% 
in the placebo group. The changes from baseline in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_9499] [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 
In the adjuvant trial (BIG 1-98) the incidence of bone fractures at any time after randomization was 14.7% for 
letrozole and 11.4% for tamoxifen at a median follow-up of 96 months. The incidence of osteoporosis was 
5.1% for letrozole and 2.7% for tamoxifen [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . In the extended adjuvant trial (MA-
17), the incidence of bone fractures at any time after randomization was 13.3% for letrozole and 7.8% for 
placebo at a median follow-up of 62 months. The incidence of new osteoporosis was 14.5% for letrozole and 
7.8% for placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. 
5.2 Cholesterol 
Consideration should be given to monitoring serum cholesterol. In the adjuvant trial (BIG 1-98), 
hypercholesterolemia was reported in 52.3% of letrozole patients and 28.6% of tamoxifen patients. Grade 3-4 
hypercholesterolemia was reported in 0.4% of letrozole patients and 0.1% of tamoxifen patients. Also in the 
adjuvant setting, an increase of greater than or equal to 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) in total cholesterol 
(generally nonfasting) was observed in patients on monotherapy who had baseline total serum cholesterol 
within the normal range (i.e., less than =1.[ADDRESS_8985]) in 155/1843 (8.4%) patients on letrozole vs 71/1840 
(3.9%) patients on tamoxifen Lipid lowering medications were required for 29% of patients on letrozole and 
20% on tamoxifen [see Adverse Reactions (6)].  
5.3Hepatic Impairment  
Subjects with cirrhosis and severe hepatic impairment who were dosed with 2.5 mg of Femara experienced 
approximately twice the exposure to Femara as healthy volunteers with normal liver function [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)] . Therefore, a dose reduction is recommended for this patient population. The effect of 
hepatic impairment on Femara exposure in cancer patients with elevated bilirubin levels has not been 
determined [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 
5.[ADDRESS_8986] of Femara on any hematologic or clinical chemistry parameter was evident. Moderate 
decreases in lymphocyte counts, of uncertain clinical significance, were observed in some patients receiving 
Femara 2.5 mg. This depression was transient in about half of those affected. Two patients on Femara 
developed thrombocytopenia; relationship to the study drug was unclear. Patient withdrawal due to laboratory 
abnormalities, whether related to study treatment or not was infrequent. 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_8987]-marketing reports, use of letrozole during 
pregnancy resulted in cases of spontaneous abortions and congenital birth defects. Letrozole caused embryo-
fetal toxicities in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that were below the maximum recommended human 
dose (MHRD) on a mg/m2 basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of 
reproductive potential to use effective contraception during therapy with Femara and for at least [ADDRESS_8988] dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.1)].

In study, BIG 1-98, the median treatment duration of adjuvant treatment was 60 months and the median 
duration of follow-up for safety was 96 months for patients receiving Femara and tamoxifen. 
Certain adverse reactions were prospectively specified for analysis (see Table 1), based on the known 
pharmacologic properties and side effect profiles of the two drugs. 
Adverse reactions were analyzed irrespective of whether a symptom was present or absent at baseline. Most 
adverse reactions reported (approximately 75% of patients who reported AEs) were Grade 1 or Grade 2 applying 
the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Version 2.0/Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
Version 3.0. Table 1 describes adverse reactions (Grades 1-4 and Grades 3-4) irrespective of relationship to study 
treatment in the adjuvant trial for the monotherapy arms analysis (safety population).

* Target events pre-specified for analysis 
** Events pre-printed on CRF 
1At median follow-up of 96 months (i.e. any time after randomization) for Femara (range up to 144 months) and 95 months for 
tamoxifen (range up to 143 months ) 
2At median treatment duration of 60 months (i.e. during treatment + 30 days after discontinuation of treatment) for Femara and 
tamoxifen (range up to 68 months) 
3Excluding women who had undergone hysterectomy before study entry 
TIA = Transient ischemic attack 
Note: Cardiovascular events (including cerebrovascular and thromboembolic events), skeletal and urogenital/endometrial events and 
second primary malignancies were collected life -long. All of these events were assumed to be of CTC Grade 3 to 5 and were not 
individually graded 
When considering all grades during study treatment, a higher incidence of events was seen for Femara 
regarding fractures (10.1% vs 7.1%), myocardial infarctions (1.0% vs 0.5%), and arthralgia (25.2% vs 
20.4%) (Femara vs tamoxifen respectively). A higher incidence was seen for tamoxifen regarding 
thromboembolic events (2.1% vs 3.6%), endometrial hyperplasia/cancer (0.3% vs 2.9%), and endometrial 
proliferation disorders (0.3% vs 1.8%) (Femara vs tamoxifen respectively).

 At a median follow-up of 96 months, a higher incidence of events was seen for Femara (14.7%) than for 
tamoxifen (11.4%) regarding fractures. A higher incidence was seen for tamoxifen compared to Femara 
regarding thromboembolic events (4.6% vs 3.2%), and endometrial hyperplasia or cancer (2.9% vs 0.4%) 
(tamoxifen vs Femara, respectively).
Bone Study : Results of a safety trial in [ADDRESS_8990] on lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L2-L4) BMD of adjuvant 
treatment with letrozole to that with tamoxifen showed at 24 months a median decrease in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_9500] 4.1% in the letrozole arm compared to a median increase of 0.3% in the tamoxifen arm (difference = 
4.4%) (P <0.0001). No patients with a normal BMD at baseline became osteoporotic over the 2 years and 
only 1 patient with osteopenia at baseline (T score of -1.9) developed

 osteoporosis during the treatment period (assessment by [CONTACT_9559]). The results for total hip BMD 
were similar, although the differences between the two treatments were less pronounced. During the 2 
year period, fractures were reported by 4 of 103 patients (4%) in the letrozole arm, and 6 of 97 patients 
(6%) in the tamoxifenarm.
Lipid Study : In a safety trial in [ADDRESS_8991] 
cancer at 24 months comparing the effects on lipid profiles of adjuvant letrozole to tamoxifen, 12% of 
patients on letrozole had at least one total cholesterol value of a higher CTCAE grade than at baseline 
compared with 4% of patients on tamoxifen. In another postapproval randomized, multicenter, open label, 
study of letrozole vs anastrozole in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone 
receptor and node positive breast cancer (FACE, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), the median duration of treatment was 60 
months for both treatment arms. Table 2 describes adverse reactions (Grades 1-4 and Grades 3-4) 
irrespective of relationship to study treatment in the adjuvant study (safety population).

Based on a median follow-up of patients for 28 months,the incidence of clinical fractures from the core 
randomized study in patients who received Femara was 5.9% (152) and placebo was 5.5% (142). The incidence 
of self-reported osteoporosis was higher in patients who received Femara 6.9% (176) than in patients who 
received placebo 5.5% (141). Bisphosphonates were administered to 21.1% of the patients who received Femara 
and 18.7% of the patients who received placebo. 
The incidence of cardiovascular ischemic events from the core randomized study was comparable between 
patients who received Femara 6.8% (175) and placebo 6.5% (167). 
A patient-reported measure that captures treatment impact on important symptoms associated with estrogen

Treatment Duration of 60 Months  
The extended adjuvant treatment trial (MA-17) was unblinded early [see Adverse Reactions (6)] . At the 
updated (final analysis), overall the side effects seen were consistent to those seen at a median treatment 
duration of 24 months. 
During treatment or within 30 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056] (median duration of treatment 60 months) a higher 
rate of fractures was observed for Femara (10.4%) compared to placebo (5.8%), as also a higher rate of 
osteoporosis (Femara 12.2% vs placebo 6.4%). 
Based on 62 months median duration of follow-up in the randomized letrozole arm in the safety population 
the incidence of new fractures at any time after randomization was 13.3% for letrozole and 7.8% for 
placebo. The incidence of new osteoporosis was 14.5% for letrozole and 7.8% for placebo. 
During treatment or within 30 days of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056] (median duration of treatment 60 months), the 
incidence of cardiovascular events was 9.8% for Femara and 7.0% for placebo. 
Based on 62 months median duration of follow-up in the randomized letrozole arm in the safety 
population the incidence of cardiovascular disease at any time after randomization was 14.4% for 
letrozole and 9.8% for placebo. 
Lipid substudy : In the extended adjuvant setting (MA-17), based on a median duration of follow-up of 62 
months, there was no significant difference between Femara and placebo in total cholesterol or in any lipid 
fraction over 5 years. Use of lipid lowering drugs or dietary management of elevated lipi[INVESTIGATOR_9502]

In study P025 a total of 455 patients were treated for a median time of exposure of 11 months in the Femara arm 
(median 6 months in the tamoxifen arm). The incidence of adverse reactions was similar for Femara and 
tamoxifen. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were bone pain, hot flushes, back pain, nausea, 
arthralgia and dyspnea. Discontinuations for adverse reactions other than progression of tumor occurred in 
10/455 (2%) of patients on Femara and in 15/455 (3%) of patients on tamoxifen. 
Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 5% of the patients treated with Femara 2.[ADDRESS_8995]-line treatment study are shown in Table 4.

Other less frequent (less than or equal to 2%) adverse reactions considered consequential for both treatment 
groups, included peripheral thromboembolic events, cardiovascular events, and cerebrovascular events. 
Peripheral thromboembolic events included venous thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, portal vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism. Cardiovascular events included angina, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, and 
coronary heart disease. Cerebrovascular events included transient ischemic attacks, thrombotic or hemorrhagic 
strokes and development of hemiparesis.

Study discontinuations in the megestrol acetate comparison study (AR/BC2) for adverse reactions other than 
progression of tumor were 5/188 (2.7%) on Femara 0.5 mg, in 4/174 (2.3%) on Femara 2.5 mg, and in 15/190 
(7.9%) on megestrol acetate. There were fewer thromboembolic events at both Femara doses than on the 
megestrol acetate arm (0.6% vs 4.7%). There was also less vaginal bleeding (0.3% vs 3.2%) on Femara than on 
megestrol acetate. In the aminoglutethimide comparison study (AR/BC3), discontinuations for reasons other 
than progression occurred in 6/193 (3.1%) on 0.5 mg Femara, 7/185 (3.8%) on 2.5 mg Femara, and 7/178 
(3.9%) of patients on aminoglutethimide. 
Comparisons of the incidence of adverse reactions revealed no significant differences between the high and 
low dose Femara groups in either study. Most of the adverse reactions observed in all treatment groups were 
mild to moderate in severity and it was generally not possible to distinguish adverse reactions due to treatment 
intercurrent illness.  
Adverse reactions that were reported in at least 5% of the patients treated with Femara 0.5 mg, Femara 2.5 mg, 
megestrol acetate, or aminoglutethimide in the two controlled trials AR/BC2 and AR/BC3 are shown in Table 5.

[IP_ADDRESS] Tamoxifen  
Coadministration of Femara and tamoxifen 20 mg daily resulted in a reduction of letrozole plasma levels of 
38% on average (study P015). Clinical experience in the second-line breast cancer trials (AR/BC2 and 
AR/BC3) indicates that the therapeutic effect of Femara therapy is not impaired if Femara is administered 
immediately after tamoxifen.

Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_9002]-marketing reports, use of letrozole during 
pregnancy resulted in cases of spontaneous abortions and congenital birth defects; however, the data are 
insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse 
Reactions (6.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)] . 
In animal reproduction studies, administration of letrozole to pregnant animals during organogenesis resulted in 
increased post- implantation pregnancy loss and resorption, fewer live fetuses, and fetal malformation affecting 
the renal and skeletal systems in rats and rabbits at doses approximately 0.1 times the daily maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD) on a mg/m2 basis (see Data) . 
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, 
the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2%-4% and of miscarriage is 15%-
20% of clinically recognized pregnancies.

0.003 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.01 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). 
In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats, daily administration of oral letrozole during the period 
a mg/m2 basis) resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity including intrauterine mortality, increased resorptions and 
postimplantation loss, decreased numbers of live fetuses and fetal anomalies including absence and shortening of 
renal papi[INVESTIGATOR_9387], dilation of ureter, edema and incomplete ossification of frontal skull and metatarsals. Letrozole was 
teratogenic to rats at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg (approximately 0.01 times the maximum recommended human dose 
on a mg/m2 basis) and caused fetal domed head and cervical/centrum vertebral fusion. 
In the embryo-fetal development toxicity study in rabbits, daily administration of oral letrozole during the period 
a mg/m2 basis) resulted in embryo-fetal toxicity including intrauterine mortality, increased resorption, increased 
postimplantation loss and decreased numbers of live fetuses. Fetal anomalies included incomplete ossification of 
the skull, sternebrae, and fore- and hind legs. 
8.2 Lactation 
Risk Summary 
It is not known if letrozole is present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of letrozole on the breastfed 
infant or milk production. Exposure of lactating rats to letrozole was associated with impaired reproductive 
performance of the male offspring (see Data) . Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed 
infants fromFemara, advise lactating women not to breastfeed while taking Femara and for at least 3 weeks after 
the lastdose.

 Data
Animal Data
In a postnatal developmental toxicity study in lactating rats, letrozole was administered orally at doses of 1, 
0.003, 0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg/day on day 0 through day 20 of lactation. The reproductive performance of the male 
offspring was impaired at letrozole dose as low as 0.003 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.01 times the maximum 
recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis), as reflected by [CONTACT_9561]. There were 
no effects on the reproductive performance of female offspring. 
 
8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential 
Pregnancy Testing 
Based on animal studies, Femara can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.1)] . Females of reproductive potential should have a pregnancy test prior to starting 
treatment with Femara.

neuroendocrine and reproductive developmental perturbations of the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_9504]. Administration 
of 0.3 mg/kg/day resulted in AUC values that were similar to the AUC in adult patients receiving the 
recommended dose of 2.5 mg/day. Decreased fertility was accompanied by [CONTACT_9563][INVESTIGATOR_9505]. Young rats in this study were allowed to recover following discontinuation of letrozole 
treatment for [ADDRESS_9005] cancer was 
64-65 years. About 1/[ADDRESS_9006]-line study, patients 
greater than or equal to 70 years of age experienced longer time to tumor progression and higher response rates 
than patients less than 70. 
For the extended adjuvant setting (MA-17), more than 5,100 postmenopausal women were enrolled in the 
clinical study. In total, 41% of patients were aged 65 years or older at enrollment, while 12% were 75 or older. 
In the extended adjuvant setting, no overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these older 
patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses 
between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 
In the adjuvant setting (BIG 1-98), more than 8,000 postmenopausal women were enrolled in the clinical study. 
In total, 36% of patients were aged 65 years or older at enrollment, while 12% were 75 or older. More adverse 
reactions were generally reported in elderly patients irrespective of study treatment allocation. However, in 
comparison to tamoxifen, no overall differences with regards to the safety and efficacy profiles were observed 
between elderly patients and younger patients.

MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_9007] dose used was 30 mg, which was well tolerated; in multiple-dose trials, the largest dose 
of 10 mg was well tolerated. 
Lethality was observed in mice and rats following single oral doses that were equal to or greater than 2,000 
mg/kg (about 4,000 to 8,000 times the daily maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis); death 
was associated with reduced motor activity, ataxia and dyspnea. Lethality was observed in cats following 
single IV doses that were equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg (about 50 times the daily maximum recommended 
human dose on a mg/m2 basis); death was preceded by [CONTACT_9564]. 
 
11 DESCRIPTION 
Femara tablets for oral administration contains 2.5 mg of letrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (inhibitor 
of estrogen synthesis). It is chemically described as 4 -(1H-1, 2, 4-Triazol-1-ylmethylene) dibenzonitrile, and 
its structural formula is

Letrozole is a white to yellowish crystalline powder, practically odorless, freely soluble in dichloromethane, 
slightly soluble in ethanol, and practically insoluble in water. It has a molecular weight of 285.31, empi[INVESTIGATOR_9506] C 17H11N5, and a melting range of 184°C to 185°C. 
Femara is available as 2.5 mg tablets for oral administration. 
Inactive Ingredients: Colloidal silicon dioxide, ferric oxide, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, lactose 
monohydrate, magnesium stearate, maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, sodium 
starch glycolate, talc, and titanium dioxide. 
 
[ADDRESS_9008] cancer 
thought to be hormonally responsive (i.e., estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive or receptor unknown) 
has included a variety of efforts to decrease estrogen levels (ovariectomy, adrenalectomy, hypophysectomy) or 
inhibit estrogen effects (antiestrogens and progestational agents). These interventions lead to decreased tumor 
mass or delayed progression of tumor growth in some women. 
In postmenopausal women, estrogens are mainly derived from the action of the aromatase enzyme, which 
converts adrenal androgens (primarily androstenedione and testosterone) to estrone and estradiol. The 
suppression of estrogen biosynthesis in peripheral tissues and in the cancer tissue itself can therefore be 
achieved by [CONTACT_9565]. 
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme system; it inhibits the conversion of 
androgens to estrogens. In adult nontumor- and tumor-bearing female animals, letrozole is as effective as 
ovariectomy in reducing uterine weight, elevating serum LH, and causing the regression of estrogen-dependent 
tumors. In contrast to ovariectomy, treatment with letrozole does not lead to an increase in serum FSH. Letrozole 
selectively inhibits gonadal steroidogenesis but has no significant effect on adrenal mineralocorticoid or 
glucocorticoid synthesis. 
Letrozole inhibits the aromatase enzyme by [CONTACT_9566] P450 subunit 
of the enzyme, resulting in a reduction of estrogen biosynthesis in all tissues. Treatment of women with 
letrozole significantly lowers serum estrone, estradiol and estrone sulfate and has not been shown to 
significantly affect adrenal corticosteroid synthesis, aldosterone synthesis, or synthesis of thyroid hormones. 

MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_9009] cancer, daily doses of 0.1 mg to 5 mg Femara (letrozole) 
suppress plasma concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate by 75% to 95% from baseline with 
maximal suppression achieved within two- three days. Suppression is dose-related, with doses of 0.[ADDRESS_9010] performed after 6 and 12 weeks 
of treatment with daily doses of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg did not indicate any attenuation of aldosterone or 
cortisol production. Glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid supplementation is, therefore, not necessary. 
No changes were noted in plasma concentrations of androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) among 
healthy postmenopausal women after 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg single doses of Femara or in plasma concentrations 
of androstenedione among postmenopausal patients treated with daily doses of 0.1 mg to 5 mg. This indicates 
that the blockade of estrogen biosynthesis does not lead to accumulation of androgenic precursors. Plasma 
levels of LH and FSH were not affected by [CONTACT_9567], nor was thyroid function as evaluated by [CONTACT_9568], T3 uptake, and T4 levels.

 12.3 
Absorption and Distribution: Letrozole is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_9507]. It is metabolized slowly to an inactive metabolite whose glucuronide 
conjugate is excreted renally, representing the major clearance pathway. About 90% of radiolabeled letrozole is 
-life is about 2 days and steady-state plasma 
concentration after daily 2.5 mg dosing is reached in 2-6 weeks. Plasma concentrations at steady state are 1.5 to 
2 times higher than predicted from the concentrations measured after a single dose, indicating a slight non-
linearity in the pharmacokinetics of letrozole upon daily administration of 2.5 mg. These steady-state levels are 
maintained over extended periods, however, and continuous accumulation of letrozole does not occur. Letrozole 
is weakly protein bound and has a large volume of distribution (approximately 1.9 L/kg). 
Elimination 
Metabolism and Excretion: Metabolism to a pharmacologically-inactive carbinol metabolite (4,4'-methanol-
bisbenzonitrile) and renal excretion of the glucuronide conjugate of this metabolite is the major pathway of 
letrozole clearance. Of the radiolabel recovered in urine, at least 75% was the glucuronide of the carbinol 
metabolite, about 9% was two unidentified metabolites, and 6% was unchanged letrozole. 
In human microsomes with specific CYP isozyme activity, CYP3A4 metabolized letrozole to the carbinol 
metabolite while CYP2A6 formed both this metabolite and its ketone analog. In human liver microsomes, 
letrozole inhibited CYP2A6 and CYP2C19, however, the clinical significance of these findings is unknown. 
Specific Populations 
Pediatric, Geriatric and Race: In the study populations (adults ranging in age from 35 to greater than 80 years), 
no change in pharmacokinetic parameters was observed with increasing age. Differences in letrozole 
pharmacokinetics between adult and pediatric populations have not been studied. Differences in letrozole 
pharmacokinetics due to race have not been studied. 
Renal Impairment: In a study of volunteers with varying renal function (24-hour creatinine clearance: 9 to 116 
mL/min), no effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of 2.5 mg of Femara was found. In 
addition, in a study (AR/BC2) of [ADDRESS_9011] cancer, about half of whom received 2.5 mg 
Femara and half 0.5 mg Femara, renal impairment (calculated creatinine clearance: 20 to 50 mL/min) did not 
affect steady-state plasma letrozole concentrations. 
Hepatic Impairment: In a study of subjects with mild to moderate non-metastatic hepatic dysfunction (e.g., 
cirrhosis, Child-Pugh classification A and B), the mean area under curve (AUC) values of the volunteers 
with moderate hepatic impairment were 37% higher than in normal subjects, but still within the range seen in 
subjects without impaired function. 
In a pharmacokinetic study, subjects with liver cirrhosis and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
classification C, which included bilirubins about 2-[ADDRESS_9012] with minimal to severe ascites) had two-fold 
increase in exposure (AUC) and 47% reduction in systemic clearance. Breast cancer patients with severe hepatic 
impairment are thus expected to be exposed to higher levels of letrozole than patients with normal liver function 
receiving similar doses of this drug [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
13.1Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment ofFertility
A conventional carcinogenesis study in mice at doses of 0.6 to 60 mg/kg/day (about 1 to 100 times the daily 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2  basis) administered by [CONTACT_9569] 2 years revealed a 
dose-related increase in the incidence of benign ovarian stromal tumors. The incidence of combined 
hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma showed a significant trend in females when the high dose group was 
excluded due to low survival. In a separate study, plasma AUC 0-12hr levels in mice at 60 mg/kg/day were [ADDRESS_9013] cancer patients at the recommended dose. The carcinogenicity study in 
rats at oral doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day (about 0.4 to 40 times the daily maximum recommended human dose on 
a mg/m2 basis) for up to 2 years also produced an increase in the incidence of benign ovarian stromal tumors at 
10 mg/kg/day. Ovarian hyperplasia was observed in females at doses equal to or greater than 0.1 mg/kg/day. At 
10 mg/kg/day, plasma AUC 0-24hr levels in rats were [ADDRESS_9014] cancer patients at the 
recommended dose. The benign ovarian stromal tumors observed in mice and rats were considered to be related 
to the pharmacological inhibition of estrogen synthesis and may be due to increased luteinizing hormone 
resulting from the decrease in circulating estrogen. 
Femara (letrozole) was not mutagenic in in vitro tests (Ames and E.coli bacterial tests) but was observed to be a 
potential clastogen in 
in vitro assays (CHO K1 and CCL 61 Chinese hamster ovary cells). Letrozole was not clastogenic in vivo 
(micronucleus test in rats). 
In a fertility and early embryonic development toxicity study in female rats, oral administration of letrozole 
starting 2 weeks before mating until pregnancy day 6 resulted in an increase in pre-
0.03 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis). In repeat-
dose toxicity studies, administration of letrozole caused sexual

Version date: 03.17.[ADDRESS_9015] in males and females at doses of 0.6, 0.1 and 0.03 
mg/kg in mice, rats and dogs, respectively (approximately 1, 0.4 and 0.4 times the daily maximum recommended 
human dose on a mg/m2 basis, respectively). 
 
[ADDRESS_9016] Cancer  
In a multicenter study (BIG 1-98, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolling over 8,[ADDRESS_9017] cancer, one of the following treatments was randomized in a 
double-blind manner:  
Option 1: 
A. tamoxifen for 5 years  
B.Femara for 5 years  
C.tamoxifen for 2 years followed by [CONTACT_9570] 3 years  
D. Femara for 2 years followed by [CONTACT_9571] 3 
years Option 2:  
A. tamoxifen for 5 years  
B. Femara for 5 years  
The study in the adjuvant setting, BIG 1-98 was designed to answer two primary questions: whether Femara 
for 5 years was superior to Tamoxifen for 5 years (Primary Core Analysis) and whether switching endocrine 
treatments at 2 years was superior to continuing the same agent for a total of 5 years (Sequential 
Treatments Analysis). Selected baseline characteristics for the study population are shown in Table 6.  
The primary endpoint of this trial was disease-free survival (DFS) (i.e., interval between randomization and 
earliest occurrence of a local, regional, or distant recurrence, or invasive contralateral breast cancer, or death 
from any cause). The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), systemic disease-free survival (SDFS), 
invasive contralateral breast cancer, time to breast cancer recurrence (TBR) and time to distant metastasis 
(TDM). 
The Primary Core Analysis (PCA) included all patients and all follow-up in the monotherapy arms in both 
randomization options, but follow-up in the two sequential treatments arms was truncated [ADDRESS_9018] cancer [e.g., DFS: hazard ratio, HR 0.79; 95% CI (0.68, 0.92); P=0.002; SDFS: HR 0.83; 
95% CI (0.70, 0.97); TDM: HR 0.73; 95% CI (0.60, 0.88); OS: HR 0.86; 95% CI (0.70, 1.06). 
In 2005, based on recommendations by [CONTACT_9572], the tamoxifen arms 
were unblinded and patients were allowed to complete initial adjuvant therapy with Femara (if they had 
received tamoxifen for at least 2 years) or to start extended adjuvant treatment with Femara (if they had 
received tamoxifen for at least 4.5 years) if they remained alive and disease-free. In total, 632 patients 
crossed to Femara or another aromatase inhibitor. Approximately 70% (448) of these [ADDRESS_9019] of these crossed in years 3 to 4. All of these patients 
were in Option 1. A total of 184 patients started extended adjuvant therapy with Femara (172 patients) or with 
MDACC# 2017-0071 
Version date: 03.17.21
106 another aromatase inhibitor (12 patients). To explore the impact of this selective crossover, results from 
analyses censoring follow-up at the date of the selective crossover (in the tamoxifen arm) are presented for 
the MAA.  
The PCA allowed the results of Femara for [ADDRESS_9020] of 
Femara after a longer time (because follow-up was truncated in two arms at around 25 months). The MAA 
(ignoring the two sequential treatment arms) provided follow-up equally as long in each treatment and did not 
over-emphasize early recurrences as the PCA did. The MAA thus provides the clinically appropriate updated 
efficacy results in answer to the first primary question, despi[INVESTIGATOR_9508]. The updated results for the MAA are summarized in Table 7. Median 
follow-up for this analysis is 73 months. 
The Sequential Treatments Analysis (STA) addresses the second primary question of the study. The primary 
analysis for the STA was from switch (or equivalent time-point in monotherapy arms) + 30 days (STA-S) with a 
two-sided test applied to each pair-wise comparison at the 2.5% level. Additional analyses were conducted 
from randomization (STA-R) but these comparisons (added in light of changing medical practice) were under-
powered for efficacy.

Updated analyses were conducted at a median follow-up of 62 months. In the Femara arm, 71% 
of the patients were treated for a least 3 years and 58% of patients completed at least 4.5 years 
of extended adjuvant treatment. After the unblinding of the study at a median follow-up of 28 
months, approximately 60% of the selected patients in the placebo arm opted to switch to 
Femara. 
In this updated analysis shown in Table [ADDRESS_9032] cancer compared with placebo (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.63, 
0.89; P=0.001). However, in the updated DFS analysis (interval between randomization and 
earliest event of loco-regional recurrence, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, or 
death from any cause) the treatment difference was heavily diluted by 60% of the patients in the 
placebo arm switching to Femara and accounting for 64% of the total placebo patient-years of 
follow-up. Ignoring these switches, the risk of DFS event was reduced by a non-significant 
11% (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77, 1.03). There was no significant difference in distant disease-free 
survival or overall survival.

A randomized, double-blind, multinational trial (P025) compared Femara 2.5 mg with 
tamoxifen 20 mg in 916 postmenopausal patients with locally advanced (Stage IIIB or loco-
regional recurrence not amenable to treatment with surgery or radiation) or metastatic breast 
cancer. Time to progression (TTP) was the primary endpoint of the trial. Selected baseline

months (95% CI 32 to 38 months) Randomized tamoxifen: n=458, events 57%, 
median overall survival 32 months (95% CI 28 to 37 months) Overall log-rank 
P=0.5136 (i.e., there was no significant difference between treatment arms in overall 
survival). 
The median overall survival was 35 months for the Femara group and 32 months for the 
tamoxifen group, with a P-value 0.5136. Study design allowed patients to cross over upon 
progression to the other therapy. Approximately 50% of patients crossed over to the opposite 
treatment arm and almost all patients who crossed over had done so by 36 months. The median 
time to crossover was 17 months (Femara to tamoxifen) and 13 months (tamoxifen to Femara). 
In patients who did not cross over to the opposite treatment arm, median survival was 35 
months with Femara (n=219, 95% CI 29 to 43 months) vs 20 months with tamoxifen (n=229, 
95% CI 16 to 26 months).

Femara was initially studied at doses of 0.1 mg to 5.0 mg daily in six noncomparative trials 
(AR/BC1, P01, AR/ST1, AR/PS1, AR/ES1 and NJO-03) in 181 postmenopausal

118 estrogen/progesterone receptor positive or unknown advanced breast cancer patients previously 
treated with at least antiestrogen therapy. Patients had received other hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_9509]. Eight (20%) of forty patients treated with Femara 2.5 
mg daily in trials achieved an objective tumor response (complete or partial response). 
Two large randomized, controlled, multinational (predominantly European) trials (AR/BC2, 
AR/BC3) were conducted in patients with advanced breast cancer who had progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_9510]. Patients were randomized to Femara 0.5 mg daily, Femara 
2.5 mg daily, or a comparator [megestrol acetate 160 mg daily in one study (AR/BC2); and 
aminoglutethimide 250 mg twice a day with corticosteroid supplementation in the other 
study (AR/BC3)]. In each study over 60% of the patients had received therapeutic 
antiestrogens, and about one-fifth of these patients had an objective response. The megestrol 
acetate controlled study was double- blind; the other study was open label. Selected baseline 
characteristics for each study are shown in Table 16.

Confirmed objective tumor response (complete response plus partial response) was the primary 
endpoint of the trials. Responses were measured according to the Union Internationale Contre le 
Cancer (UICC) criteria and verified by [CONTACT_6222], blinded review. All responses were 
confirmed by a second evaluation [ADDRESS_9037] trial (AR/BC2), with a minimum follow-up of 15 
months, which compared Femara 0.5 mg, Femara 2.5 mg, and megestrol acetate 160 mg

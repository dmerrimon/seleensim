Study  Duration:  The duration of the study is approximately 30 months 
(enrollment + treatment)  Phase of Study :  II 
Study  Center s: This study will be conducted by 9 participating sites.  
Number of 
Patients:  46 patien ts will be enrolled in the study.  
Objectives:  Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is:  
• To determine the efficacy of everolimus in combination with anti -estrogen therapy 
in patients with ER and/or PR -positive, HER2 -negative advanced breast  cancer 
demonstrating disease progression on prior hormonal therapy as measured by [CONTACT_16625].  
Secondary Objective  
The secondary objective of this study is:  
• To determine the safety and tolerability of everolimus with an anti -estrogen therapy 
in patients with ER a nd/or PR -positive, HER2 -negative advanced breast cancer.  
Exploratory Objective  
The exploratory objective of this study is:  
• To evaluate the VeriStrat assay in this HR -positive patient population treated with 
everolimus in combination with anti -estrogen ther apy. 
Study  Design : This is a multi -centered, open -labeled, Phase II study in MBC.  The patient population 
includes locally recurrent or MBC patients with cytologically or histologically confirmed 
hormone receptor -positive breast cancer who have demonstrat ed disease progression on 
prior anti- estrogen therapy or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Eligible patients must have evaluable or measurable 
disease per RECIST v1.1.  
Everolimus will be administered at a dose of [ADDRESS_1207748] anti -
estrogen therapy (tamo xifen, fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, toremifine, or 
LHRH agonists in conjunction with anti -estrogen therapy ) to which they demonstrated 
disease progression.  Anti -estrogen therapy will be administered at the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) prescribed doses.  
A treatment cycle will be defined as 4 weeks, with radiological evaluations every 2 cycles.  
Patients will be treated until disease progression, toxicity  or intercurrent illness  requiring 
cessation of treatment, withdrawal of con sent, or other reasons outlined in Section 3.3 .

Correlative 
Testing:  For patients who participate in the exploratory biomarker researc h component of this study, 
archival tumor tissue will be collected and assayed for selected biomarkers.  
VeriStrat Assay  Serum samples will be collected from all patients at baseline and 
subsequent selected time points, for performing the VeriStrat assay.  Treatment options for 
this study will not be based on the results of this testing.  For details regarding the assay and 
sample collection, refer to Section 7.3.4and Appendix F.  
Statistical 
Methodology:  Results from the recently published BOLERO -2 study re ported a median PFS of 2.8 
months (as assessed by [CONTACT_12707]) that improved to 6.9 months as a result of 
the addition of everolimus in patients treated with exemestane after failing the NSAI therapy (Baselga J.et al. 2012).  A similar median  PFS is predicted in this study’s study 
population that is based on similar inclusion criteria.  It is anticipated that everolimus in combination with the last anti- estrogen therapy that the patient demonstrated disease 
progression to, will result in an in crease in median PFS from 2.8 months to 5 months in this 
refractory population.  
Based on the above assumptions, given a follow -up period of 12 months after the 
completion of enrol lment (18 months), with a 5% alpha and a one -sided test of hypothesis, 
a samp le size of 42 will provide 80% power to detect an improvement in median PFS from 
2.8 months to 5 months in the patients treated with the combination of ever olimus with 
anti-estrogen therapy.  Allowing for 8 -10% inevaluable patients, the total number of 
patients to be enrolled is 46 patients.

1. INTRODUCTION 
In the [LOCATION_002] (US) it is estimated that approximately 226,[ADDRESS_1207768] cancer patients are hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER] 
and/or progesterone receptor [PR]) -positive and are usually treated with endocrine therapy.  
While most of the ER/PR -positive tumors initially respond to hormonal therapy, many patients

1.1 Background  
The mammalian target of rapamycin  (mTOR) pathway is an intracellular convergence point for 
numerous cellular signaling pathways involved in cell growth, protein synthesis, autophagy and metabolism.  The mTOR complex performs its regulatory function in response to activating or inhibiting signals transmitted through these pathways.  
Abundant evidence has linked hormone resistance to crosstalk between cell signaling pathways and signal transduction pathways and ER signaling.  Evidence of the PI3 kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway activation in aromatase inhibitor -resistant and in long -term estrogen deprived breast 
cancer cells has been demonstrated ( Campbell R. A. et al. 2001, Santen R. J. et al. 2005, 
Tokunaga E. et al. 2006).  mTOR inhibitors have the potential to provide critical pathway blockade, irrespective of the nature of the upstream activating oncogenic event.  Early preclinical data for mTOR inhibitors in combination with tamoxifen or letrozole have been encouraging 
(Boulay A. et al. 2005).  
1.2 Everolimus  
Everolimus, a rapamycin analog, is a signal transduction inhibitor that acts by [CONTACT_865782].  mTOR is a key serine -threonine kinase in the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade, 
which is known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers ( Boulay A. et al. 2005).  
There is growing evidence for a close interaction between the mTOR p athway and ER signaling.  
A substrate of the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) called S6 kinase 1, phosphorylates the activation function domain 1 of the ER, which is responsible for ligand independent receptor activation ( Yamnik R. L. et al. 2009, Yamnik R. L. et al. 2010).  
Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act:  
• directly on the tumor cells by [CONTACT_069];  
• indirectly by [CONTACT_129552] (via potent 
inhibition of tumor cell [vascular endothelial growth factor {VEGF}] production and VEGF -
induced proliferation of endothelial cells).  
Everolimus has been in clinical  development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ 
transplantation.  It is marketed in the US for oncology indications under the trade name 
[CONTACT_3617]
®.  It is approved in Europe and other global markets (trade name: [CONTACT_117]®) for cardiac

and re nal transplantation, and in the US (trade name: [CONTACT_118]®) for the prevention of organ 
rejection of kidney transplantation. 
Everolimus is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for various conditions:  
• Advanced kidney cancer (approved in March 2009)  
• Prevention of or gan rejection after renal transplant (April 2010)  
• Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) in 
patients who are not suitable for surgical intervention (October 2010)  
• Progressive or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocr ine tumors not surgically removable 
(May 2011)  
• Breast cancer in post -menopausal women with advanced hormone -receptor positive, 
HER2 -negative type cancer, in conjunction with exemestane (July 2012)  
• Prevention of organ rejection after liver transplant(Feb 2013)  
A randomized Phase II study with single agent everolimus compared two schedules, daily versus 
weekly dosing in minimally pretreated metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients.  The results suggested that daily dosing at 10 mg everolimus was beneficial relative to weekly dosing in this setting, with a trend favoring benefit in ER -positive and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]

 (HER2) -negative MBC ( Ellard S. L. et al. 2009); however, the single agent activity was 
modest.  Reports from preclinical studies on the potential ability of everolimus to inhibit cell proliferation and re -establish sensitivity to anti- hormonal therapy have prompted it s evaluation in 
combination with endocrine therapy in ER -positive MBC.  One of the first studies to report 
results evaluating this approach was the TAMRAD trial.  This randomized phase II trial in hormone receptor (HR) -positive MBC patients progressing on an aromatase inhibitor (AI), 
demonstrated that the addition of everolimus to tamoxifen improved the clinical benefit rate (CBR) from 42% to 61% and lengthened median time to progression (TTP) from 4.5 months to 8.6 months.  In the subset of patients who de monstrated sensitivity to the preceding AI as defined 
by a response to or a late relapse following a 6 month AI treatment interval, the CBR increased from 45% to 78% with median TTP improving from 5 months to 17.4 months ( Bachelot T. et al. 
2010).  In a small, Phase II single arm study, the addition of everolimus to fulvestrant in ER -
positive MBC after AI failure revealed a median TTP of 8.6 months with a clinical benefit rate of 55% ( Badin F. et al. 2010).  Further support for the activity of everolimus in ER -positive MBC 
comes from the results of the Phase III, randomized, placebo controlled, BOLERO -2 study 
(Baselga J. et al. 2012).   Hormone receptor -positive advanced breast cancer patients (N=724) 
who had recurrence or progression while receiving previous therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors ( NSAI ) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive everolimus and 
exemestane or ex emestane and placebo.  This study reported a 6 month improvement in median 
progression- free survival (PFS) with the addition of everolimus to exemestane of 10.6 months 
relative to 4.2 months on the exemestane/placebo arm (HR 0.36, 95% CI, 0.27- 0.47, p<0.001) 
based on central assessment.  The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (AEs) were

stomatitis (8% in the combination -therapy group vs. 1% in the exemestane -alone group), anemia 
(6% vs. <1%), dyspnea (4% vs. 1%), hyperglycemia (4% vs. <1%), fatigue (4%  vs. 1%), and 
pneumonitis (3% vs. 0%).  The time  to deterioration of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status (PS) and time to deterioration of quality of life (≥5%) were not 
statistically different between the two treatment groups.  
Most recently, data from the BOLERO -3 trial present ed at ASCO 2013 reported that addition of 
everolimus to trastuzumab and vinorelbine in HER2+ MBC resulted in a 22% decrease in risk of disease progression or death (median PFS 7.0 months vs 5.78 months, P=0.0067, HR=0.78) in patients with HR - positive, HER 2-positive advanced breast cancer ( O'Regan R, et al. 2013).  
Approximately 35,[ADDRESS_1207769] been treated with everolimus as of 31- Mar-2014:  
• 19,668 patients in [COMPANY_001] -sponsored clinical trials  
• 2,394 pati ents in the individual patient supply program  
• More than 13,930 patients in investigator -sponsored studies. 
In 2012 Afinitor
® received FDA approval for the treatment of postmenopausal women with 
advanced hormone receptor -positive, HER2-  negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in 
combination with exemestane, after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.  Furthermore in 2012, Afinitor
® received approval for the treatment of patients with TSC who 
have renal angiomyolipoma not requiring immediate su rgery.

endocrine resistant patients, resistance to anti -estrogen therapy is driven by [CONTACT_865783]3K/Akt/mTO R pathways and hence the addition of the mTOR inhibitor to the failing anti -
estrogen therapy may result in reversing the resistance established by [CONTACT_865784].

avoided one week before and during treatment with everolimus.  Examples of live vaccines 
include  intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella

5.5 CYP3A4 and/or PgP Inhibitors/Inducers/Substrates  
Everolimus is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall.  Therefore, the following are recommended:  
• Co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
ritonavir) or P -glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitor should be avoided.  
• Co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin, fluconazole) or PgP 
inhibitors should be used with caution.  If a patient requires co -administration  of moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors or PgP inhibitors, reduce the dose of everolimus by [CONTACT_3450] 50%.  Additional dose reductions to every other day may be required to manage toxicities.  If the inhibitor is discontinued, the everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor after a washout period of 2 to 3 days.  
• Grapefruit or citrus juices affect P450 and PgP activity; therefore, concomitant use should be 
avoided.  
• If patients require co -administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer, consider doubling the 
daily dose of everolimus (based on pharmacokinetic data), using increments of [ADDRESS_1207794] 3 to 5 days (reasonable time for significant enzyme de -induction), before the 
everolim us dose is returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer.  
• This dose adjustment of everolimus is intended to achieve similar AUC to the range observed without inducers.  However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustm ent in patients 
receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers.  If the strong inducer is discontinued the everolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/PgP inducer.  
• Oral contraceptives in preclinical and clinical data have shown everolimus to have CYP3A4 
inhibitory activity rather than induction activity; induction of metabolism of contraceptive 
hormones by [CONTACT_129577].  Consequently, administration of everolimus should not reduce the efficacy of oral contracepti ves.  
Refer to the listing of relevant inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and the list of relevant substrates, inducers and inhibitors of PgP in Appendix E.  
Everolimus and drugs influencing CYP3A4 enzyme  
Everolimus is a substrate of CYP3A4, and a substrate  and moderate inhibitor of the multidrug 
efflux pump, PgP (PgP, MDR1, and ABCB1).  Therefore, extent of absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by [CONTACT_865786] (S):  EVEROLIMUS   SCRI  INNOVATIONS  STUDY  NUMBER :  BRE  212 
FINAL PROTOCOL  DATE :  19 JUNE  2014      VERSION 1.0

substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4 and/or PgP.  Concurrent treatment with strong 
CYP3A4 -inhibitors should be avoided.  Refer to Appendix E  for a comprehensive list of 
inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A4 and for a list of relevant substrates, in ducers and inhibitors of 
PgP. Inhibitors of PgP may decrease the efflux of everolimus from brain or tumor and therefore increase everolimus concentrations in these tissues.  In vitro studies showed that everolimus is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of products eliminated by [CONTACT_36918].  Thus, caution should be exercised when co- administering 
everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index.  Clinical studies have been conducted in healthy subjects to assess pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
between everolimus and potential CYP3A modifiers (ketoconazole, verapamil, erythromycin, rifampin, midazolam, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (statins). 
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
All toxicities will be graded utilizing the NCI CTCAE v 4.0 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE
).  If toxicity occurs, the toxicity will be graded, and 
appropriate supportive care treatment will be administe red to decrease the signs and symptoms 
thereof.  Dose adjustments will be based on the organ system exhibiting the greatest degree of toxicity.   
Adverse events most frequently observed with everolimus are rash, stomatitis/oral mucositis, non-infectious pneumonitis, fatigue, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
infections.  Overall, the most frequently observed laboratory abnormalities include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and/or hypertriglyceridemia.  Th e 
majority of these AEs have been of mild to moderate severity (NCI CTCAE Grade 1 -2). 
The dose level reductions for everolimus to be used in this study are shown in Table 1. 
If everolimus is interrupted for any reason, and the patient has no toxicity relat ed to anti -estrogen 
therapy, the patient should continue anti -estrogen therapy per schedule. If the patient 
discontinues everolimus for any reason, they should continue to receive anti -estrogen therapy if 
patient is deriving clinical benefit from the thera py.

Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with everolimus and 
treat pre -existing infections prior to starting treatment with everolimus.  While the patient is 
taking everolimus, the tre ating investigator should be vigilant for symptoms and signs of 
infection; if a diagnosis of infection is made, institute appropriate treatment promptly and consider interruption or discontinuation of everolimus. 
If a diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, discontinue everolimus and treat 
with appropriate antifungal therapy.  
Cases of pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), some with a fatal outcome, have been reported in patients who received everolimus. PJP may be associated with concomit ant use of

6.2.5 Renal Failure Events  
Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with fatal outcome, occurred in patients treated with everolimus.  Renal function of patients should be monitored particularly where p atients have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.  
Elevations of serum creatinine, usually mild, and proteinuria have been reported in patients taking everolimus.  Monitoring of renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urinary protein, or serum creatinine, is recommended prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically thereafter.  Please refer to Table 4 for management of non -hematologic 
toxicities related to everolimus.

Recommendations  
Stomatitis  Grade 1 
(Minimal 
symptoms,

Manage with non -alcoholic or salt water (0.9%) mout h 
wash several times a day.  
 Grade 2

Re-initiate everolimus at the same dose.  
If stomatitis recurs at grade 2, interrupt dose until recovery to grade ≤1. Re -initiate everolimus  at a lower dose.  
Manage with topi[INVESTIGATOR_032] (e.g.

(i.e. triamcinolone oral paste)*.  
 Grade 3 
(Symptomatic 
and unable to 
adequately eat 
or hydrate 
orally)  Temporary dose interruption until recovery to grade ≤1.  
Re-initiate everolimus at lower dose.  
Manage with topi[INVESTIGATOR_032] (i.e. 
benzocaine,butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrocholoride, 
menthol or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] 
(i.e. triamcinolone oral paste)*  
 Grade 4 
(Symptom s 
associated with 
life-threatening 
consequences)  Discontinue everolimus and treat with appropriate medical 
therapy.  
* using agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives in management of stomatitis is 
not recommended as they may worsen mouth ulcers.  
Patients with a clinical history of stomatitis/mucositis/mouth ulcers and those with 
gastrointestinal morbidity associated with mouth/dental infections, irritation of esophageal mucosa (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]) must be monitored even more closely.  Patients should be instructed to report the first onset of buccal mucosa irritation/reddening to their study physician immediately.  
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to everolimus should be treated using local supportive care.  Please note that investigators in earlier studies have described the oral toxicities associated with everolimus as mouth ulcers, rather than mucositis or stomatitis.  If your examination reveals mouth ulcers rather than a more general in flammation of the mouth, please 
classify the AE as such.  Please follow the paradigm below for treatment of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers:  
1. For mild toxicity (Grade 1), use conservative measures such as non- alcoholic mouth wash 
or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until resolution.  
2. For more severe toxicity (Grade [ADDRESS_1207804] pain but are able to maintain adequate oral alimentation, or Grade 3 in which case patients cannot maintain adequate oral alimentation), the sug gested treatments are topi[INVESTIGATOR_865773] (S):  EVEROLIMUS   SCRI  INNOVATIONS  STUDY  NUMBER :  BRE  212

treatments (i.e., local anesthetics such as, benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine 
hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], such as 
triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (Kenalog in Orabase®).  
3. Agents containing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen mouth ulcers.  It is preferable to avoid these agents.  
4. Antifungal agents should be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed.  In particular , 
systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) 
should be avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of everolimus metabolism, therefore leading to higher everolimus exposures.  Therefore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_865774].

followed by 2 mg orally every 2 hours until resolution of diarrhea).  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1207806] be taken in the fasting state.  Grade 
2 hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L) or Grade 2 hypertriglyceridemia (>2.[ADDRESS_1207807]) should be treated with a 3- hydroxy -3-methyl -glutaryl (HMG) -CoA reductase inhibitor 
(e.g., atorvastatin, pravastatin) or appropriate lipid- lowering medication, in addition to diet.   
Note:  Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor is associated 
with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested by 
[CONTACT_090], markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels and myoglobinuria, acute renal failure and sometimes death.  The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual patients based on their risk of cardiovascular complica tions of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035].  
Dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (including hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia) has been reported in patients taking everolimus.  Monitoring of blood cholesterol and triglycerides prior to the start of everolimus therapy and periodically th ereafter as well as management with appropriate medical 
therapy is recommended.  
Hyperglycemia has been reported in patients taking everolimus.  Monitoring of fasting serum glucose is recommended prior to the start of everolimus and periodically thereafter.   More 
frequent monitoring is recommended when everolimus is co- administered with other drugs that 
may induce hyperglycemia.  Optimal glycemic control should be achieved before starting a patient on everolimus.

FINAL PROTOCOL  DATE :  [ADDRESS_1207809] been severe and on rare occasions, a f atal outcome was 
observed.  
• A diagnosis of non -infectious pneumonitis should be considered in patients presenting 
with non- specific respi[INVESTIGATOR_036], pleural effusion, 
cough or dyspnea, and in whom infectious, neoplastic and ot her non- medicinal causes 
have been excluded by [CONTACT_129575].  Opportunistic infections 
such as PJP should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis of non- infectious 
pneumonitis.  Patients should be advised to report promptly any ne w or worsening 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].  
Patients who develop radiological changes suggestive of non- infectious pneumonitis and have 
few or no symptoms may continue everolimus therapy without dose alteration. 
If symptoms are moderate (grade 2), consideration s hould be given to interruption of therapy 
until symptoms improve.  The use of corticosteroids may be indicated.  Everolimus may be 
reintroduced at a daily dose approximately 50% lower than the dose previously administered.  
For cases of grade 3 non -infectio us pneumonitis, interrupt everolimus until resolution to less than 
or equal to grade 1.  Everolimus may be re -initiated at a daily dose approximately 50% lower 
than the dose previously administered depending on the individual clinical circumstances.  If toxicity recurs at grade 3, consider discontinuation of everolimus.  For cases of grade 4 non -
infectious pneumonitis, everolimus therapy should be discontinued.  Corticosteroids may be indicated until clinical symptoms resolve.  
For patients who require use of corticosteroids for treatment of non- infectious pneumonititis, 
prophylaxis for pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) may be considered. The two compounds studied most extensively for prophylaxis against PJP have been trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole, 
given  orally, and pentamidine, given as an aerosol.  
Patients in this study will be routinely questioned as to the presence of new or changed pulmonary symptoms consistent with pneumonitis.  Moreover, potential lung radiological changes can be detected by [CONTACT_865787]/MRI scans that are performed on all patients every 2 
cycles for tumor assessment according to the schedule of events ( Appendix  D).  Pulmonary 
function tests (PFTs) will be conducted, if clinica lly indicated, to monitor for pneumonitis.  If 
non-infectious pneumonitis develops, the guidelines in Table [ADDRESS_1207810] is recommended for any case of pneumonitis that develops during the study.

6.2.10  Management of Hepatitis Reactivation/Flare  
Reactivation of hepatitis  B (HBV) has been observed in patients with cancer receiving 
chemotherapy ( Yeo W. et al. 2004).  Sporadic cases of hepatitis  B reactivation have also been 
seen in this setting with everolimus.  In cancer patients with hepatitis  B, whether carriers or in 
chronic state, use of antivirals during anti -cancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of 
hepatitis  B virus reactivation and associated morbidity and mortality ( Loomba R. et al. 2008).  A 
detailed assessment of hepatitis  B or C medical history and risk factors must be done for all 
patients at screening, with testing performed prior to the first dose of everolimus.  
Patients with known hepatitis, or positive hepatitis serology, are ineligible to enroll in this study.

9. RESPONSE EVALUATIONS  AND MEASUREMENTS  
Response and progressi on will be evaluated in this study  using the Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumor s (RECIST) Version 1.1 (see Appendix E ).  Lesions are either measurable or non -
measurable according to the criteria.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability  will not 
be used, as it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.[ADDRESS_1207830] 
v1.1. 
10.2 Sample Siz e Considerations  
Results from the recently published BOLERO -2 study reported a median PFS of 2.8 months (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_12707]) that improved to 6.9 months as a result of the addition of 
everolimus in patients treated with exemestane after failing the NSAI therapy ( Baselga J. et al. 
2012).  A similar median PFS is predicted in this study’s patient  population that is based on 
similar inclusion criteria.   It is anticipated that everolimus in combina tion with the last anti-
estrogen therapy on which the patient d emonstrated disease progression , will result in an increase 
in median PFS from 2.8 months to 5 months in this refractory population.  
Based on the above assumptions, given a follow -up period of 12 months after the completion of 
enrol lment (18 months), with a 5% alpha and a one -sided test of hypothesis, a sample size of 42 
will provide 80% power to detect an improvement in median PFS from 2.8 months to 5 months in the patients treated with the combination of ever olimus with anti- estrogen therapy. Allowing 
for 8 -10% inevaluable patients, the total number of patients to be enrolled is 46 patients. 
Sample size calculations are based on SWOGSTAT online sample size calculator for one -arm 
non-parametric survival endpoints 
(http://www.swogstat.org/stat/public/one_nonparametric_survival.htm
). 
10.3 Analysis Population  
The following analysis populations will be used:  
• Efficacy Evaluable Population is defined as all patients who receive at least [ADDRESS_1207831] -baseline assessment.  (Patients who discontinue 
treatment during Cycle 1 will not be replaced in the study.)  
• Safety Population is defined as  all patients who have received any dose of study 
treatment.

measures will also be presented .  Time to events endpoints will be reported using Kaplan- Meier 
estimates, with 95% confidence intervals (CI)  for median time to event.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS v9.3 or higher.  
10.4.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized .  Data to be tabulated will 
include demographic features such as age, sex and race, as well as disease- specific 
characteristics.  
The number and percentages of patients enrolled , treated, completed the treatment/study and 
withdrawn from treatment/study for any reasons will be presented overall.  
10.4.2 Efficacy Analysis  
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the Efficacy  Evaluable Population. 
• Overall Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with observed 
complete response ( CR) or partial response ( PR) according to the RECIST v1.1 criteria.  
 
• Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD  x 
[ADDRESS_1207833] -baseline tumor assessment will be 
classed as not evaluable (NE) and considered as non -responder.  
 
• Progression Free Survival (PFS), defined as the time from the first day of study dru g 
administration (Day 1) to disease progression (event) as defined by [CONTACT_39694]  v1.1 
criteria, or death (event) on study.  Patients who are alive and free from disease 
progression will be censored at the date of last tumor assessment.  Patients who receiv e 
non-protocol therapy (subsequent therapy) prior to incurring an event will be censored at 
the date of last tumor assessment prior to the start of subsequent therapy.  Patients who do not have a post -baseline tumor assessment will be censored at the date of first 
treatment (Day 1).  
 
• Overall Survival (OS), defined as the time from the first day of study drug administration 
(Day 1) or death on study.  Patients who are alive will be censored at the date of last 
known date alive.

the summaries of DOR.  
 
• Percentage of patients progression- free at [ADDRESS_1207835] treatment.  
For ORR and CBR, the estimates and the associated 95% CI  (based on both asymptotic normal 
approximation and exact binomial methods ) will be calculated.  
Best overall response will be tabulated: CR, PR, SD, PD and not evaluable (NE).  
For PFS , DOR and OS, Kaplan- Meier curves will be generated and the median tim e to event and 
the associated 95% CI  will be provided.  
The number and percentage of patients progression- free at 4 and 6 months will be provided. 
10.4.3 Safety Analysis  
Safety will be assessed through the analysis of the reported incidence of treatment -emergent 
AEs.  Treatment -emergent AEs are those with an onset on or after the initiation of therapy, and 
will be graded according to NCI CTCAE v 4.03.  A copy of CTCAE scoring system may be 
downloaded from: http:// evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010- 06-

11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or a suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “serious” if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171762] 24- hours or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life fun ctions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subj ect and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.   
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” AE, as the terms are not synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of  severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient/event outcome or action usually associated with even ts that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  
For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and 
seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the SAE Report Form.

11.1.5 Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
Recording of Adverse Events  
All AEs of any patient during the course of the research study will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_246718] (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration). 
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including  its date of onset and 
resolution, whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) or not, any action taken (e.g., 
changes to study treatment), and outcome, should be provided, along with the investigator’s assessment of causality (i.e., the relations hip to the study treatment[s]).  For an AE to be a 
suspected treatment -related event there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal 
relationship between the protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI C TCAE v4.0, and changes will be documented.  
If the AE is serious, it should be reported immediately to SCRI  Innovations  SD.  Other untoward 
events occurring in the framework of a clinical study are to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, 
including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment run- in). 
Any clinically significant signs and symptoms; abnormal test findings; changes in phy sical 
examination; hypersensitivity; and other measurements that occur will be reported as an AE, and collected on the relevant eCRF screen.  
Test findings will be reported as an AE if: the test result requires an adjustment in the study drug(s) or disconti nuation of treatment, and/ or test findings require additional testing or surgical 
intervention, a test result or finding is associated with accompanying symptoms, or a test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_093].  
Reporting Period for Adverse Events  
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to everolimus  treatment (called study 
treatment), spanning from the the start of study treatment, until 30 calendar days after discontinuation or completion of study treatment as defined by [CONTACT_64373], are to be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) included in the eCRF.   
All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the study should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  All new AEs occurring during this period must be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE or laboratory abnormality/ies are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the investigators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical record and as a comment on the eCRF screen.

reported appropriately.  Each reported A E or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to the study drug 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.  
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality asses sments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
YES:  There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the study medication, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the study drug, and/or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge.  
NO:  Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., pre -
existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication), and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to study drug administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1207841] dose of study drug).

11.3 Recording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_64338], the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or A E eCRF screen).  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information is available.  If a 
diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to re flect the diagnosis.  
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_206852] (for example, as per RECIST criteria for solid tumors), should not be reported as an SAE.  
11.3.[ADDRESS_1207843] ent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE eCRF screen.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity,  it should be 
recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or A E 
eCRF screen.  
11.3.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sign should be c onsidered additional information that must be collected on the relevant 
eCRF screen.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF screen.  
Abnormal laboratory va lues will be reported as an AE if: the laboratory result requires an 
adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/ or laboratory findings require additional testing or surgical intervention, a laboratory result or finding is associa ted with 
accompanying symptoms, or a laboratory result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_093].  
11.3.4 Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period that are attributed by [CONTACT_585127] “Study Discontinuation” eCRF screen.  All other on study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an SAE Report Form and expeditiously reported to the SCRI  Innovations  Safety Department.

screen.  During post -study survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of disease will be 
recorded only on the “After Progressive Disease Follow -Up” eCRF screen.  
11.3.5 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Pr olonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] >24 hours or prolongation of pre -existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246720].  There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_246721].  
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be treated as an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Outpatient or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay unit  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64341]  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_64342] a pre -planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the study), does not require reporting as a n SAE to the SCRI  
Innovations  Safety Department.  
11.3.6 Pre-Existing Medical Conditions  
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions 
should be recorded on the General Medical History eCRF screen.  A pre -existing medical 
condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, se verity, or character of the 
condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has 
changed by [CONTACT_9672]. 
11.3.[ADDRESS_1207845] one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  11.2).  New primary cancers are those that are 
not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have developed after the inclusion of the patient into the study.  They do not include metastases of the original cancer.  Symptoms of metastasis or the metastasis itself should not be repo rted as an AE/SAE, as they are 
considered to be disease progression.

Section  11.2).  These events include the following:  
Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies:  
If a patient becomes pregnant wh ile enrolled in the study, a Pregnancy Form (a paper report 
form) should be completed and faxed to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  SCRI Innovations Safety Department should be notified expeditiously, irrespective of whether or not it meets the criteri a for expedited reporting.  Abortions
 (spontaneous, accidental, or therapeutic) 
must also be reported to SCRI Innovations Safety Department.  
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always  meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an S AE, using the previously described process for SAE reporting.  A 
Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will need to be updated to reflect the outcome of the pregnancy.  
Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse whil e taking the drug and for [ADDRESS_1207848] also be advised to use one of the following contraception 
methods: Use of (1) oral, injected, implanted or other hormonal methods of contraception, or (2)

SCRI Innovations is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the competent authority, other 
applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with International 
Confe rence on Harmonisation ( ICH) guidelines, FDA regulations.  
11.5.1 SCRI Innovations Safety Department  Assessment of Unexpected  
SCRI Innovations SD is responsible for assessing an adverse event or suspected adverse event as   “unexpected .” 
An adverse event or suspec ted adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” when the following 
conditions occur:  
• Event(s) is not mentioned in the IB (or current US Package Insert)  
• Event(s) is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed  
• An event(s) is not consiste nt with the General Investigative Plan or in the current 
application  
• Includes AEs or SAR that may be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the study drug, or that occur with members of the drug class, but that have previously been observed under investigation  
When applicable, an unexpected adverse event may also apply to an event that is not listed in the current US Package Insert (USPI) or an event that may be mentioned in the USPI, but differs from the event because of greater severity or specificity.    
Known as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R), these events suspected 
(by [CONTACT_9304]) to be related to the study drug, are unexpected (not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or USPI), and are serious (as defined by [CONTACT_760]) and require expedient submission to relevant health authorities within 7 days (fatal or life -threatening event) 
or 15 days (all serious events), or as defined by [CONTACT_2371].  The term S[LOCATION_003]R is used primarily in the reporting of events to r egulatory authorities. 
Expected AEs are those events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or current IB.

13.3 Informed Consent  
Informed consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a patient voluntarily confirms his or her willingness to participate in a particular study  after having been informed of all aspects of the study  that are 
relevant to the patient 's decision to participate.  Informed consent is documented by [CONTACT_3553] a 
written, signed, and dated informed consent form  (ICF) . 
The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is responsible for review and approval of 
the study .  Each consent form  must include all of the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_1556], as well as local county authority or state regulations and national requirements. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the study , each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the research study .  Once the essential information has been provided to the 
prospective candidate, and the Investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the 
implications of participating in this research study , the candidate will be asked to give consent to 
participate in the study  by [CONTACT_8753].  A notation that written informed consent has been 
obtained will be made in the patient’s medical record.  A copy of the ICF, to include the patient’s 
signature, will be provided by [CONTACT_21007].  
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study  design or the potential risks to the 
patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the study  should be obtained.  
13.3.1 Confidentiality  
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Confi dentiality  
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA ).  HIPAA regulations require that, 
in order to participate in the study , a patient must sign a n authorization form for the study  that he 
or she has been informed of following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information 
• That health information may be further disclosed by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_64343], and

• The information collected about the research stud y will be kept separate from the 
patient’s medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the research records after 
the conclusion of the study  
• Whether the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization 
In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the end of their scheduled study  period.  
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and appli cable parts of [ADDRESS_1207853] access to review the patient’s original medical records at the site for verifica tion of study -related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique study number and initials will identify patients in the eCRF or other documents submitted to SCRI Innovations.  This information, together with the patie nt’s date of birth, will be used in the database for patient identification.  
Patient names or addresses will not be entered in the eCRF.  No material bearing a patient’s name [CONTACT_96044] [CONTACT_340616].  Patients will be informed of their ri ghts within

14.4 Data Collection  
The study  eCRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study .  Case report forms will 
be completed using the English language  and should be kept current to enable the Sponsor to 
review the patients’ status throughout the course of the study . 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only study  number, patient number, initials and date of birth 
will identify the patient in the e CRF.  If the patient’s name [CONTACT_75502] (e.g., 
laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to SCRI Innovations and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s initials.  The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list (patient numbers with corresponding patien t 
identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  Patient data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations. 
All data requested i n the eCRF must be supported by [CONTACT_64388]’s source 
documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, 
assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “Unknown” box is not an option on the e CRF, 
a note should be create d verifying that the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown.”  For any entry 
errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should be provided.  
The investigator will electronically sign and date the patient e CRF casebook  indicating that the 
data in the e CRF has been assessed.  Each completed e CRF will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1268], once all data for that patient is final.  
14.5 Disclosure and Publication Policy  
All information provided regarding the study, a s well as all information collected/documented 
during the course of the study, will be regarded as confidential.  SCRI Innovations reserves the right to release literature publications based on the results of the study.  Results from the study will be publ ished/presented as per SCRI Innovations publication process.  
Inclusion of the investigator in the authorship of any multicenter publication will be based upon substantial contribution to the design, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting and/or critica lly 
revising any manuscript(s) derived from the study.  The investigator acknowledges that the study is part of a multicenter study and agrees that any publication by [CONTACT_696801].

Appendix C : Guidelines for Female Patient s of Child bearing  Potential and Fertile  Male 
Patient s 
 
Acceptable Contraception Methods:    
Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study and for 8 weeks  after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056].   
High ly effective contraception is defined as either:  
True Abstinence When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not accep table methods of 
contraception. 
Sterilization   When a woman of childbearing potential has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to study entry.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by 
[CONTACT_104]. 
Male Partner Sterilization  When  the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate.  
Use of a combination of any two of the f ollowing ( one from a + one from b):  
a)  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system 
(IUS) . 
b)  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal su ppository.  
Fertile male patients , defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring, 
with female partners of child -bearing potential must use condoms plus spermicidal agent 
during the study treatment period and for [ADDRESS_1207867] also refrain from donating sperm during their participation in the study.  
The following are acceptable forms of barrier contraception:  
• Latex condom, diaphragm or cervical/vault cap when used with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
Unacceptable Contraception Methods:
 for women of childbearing potential include:  
• IUD progesterone T  
• Female condom

• Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility a wareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield  
Pregnancies  
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a subject on study treatment must be reported to 
the SCRI  Innovations  Safety Department within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The 
pregnancy should be foll owed up for 3 months after the termination of the pregnancy to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn c omplications.  
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_865794] .  Pregnancy follow -up should be 
recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome.  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study treatment in this study.  Conse nt to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the mother. 
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are defined as Follows:   
• Women are considered post -menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have 
had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).  
• Women who are permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy).   
• Women who are >[ADDRESS_1207868] a 
follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value >40  mIU/mL and an estradiol value 
<40 pg/mL (140 pmol/L) . 
• Women who are >[ADDRESS_1207869] had documented evidence of menopause based on FSH >40 mIU/mL and estradiol <40 pg/mL prior to initiation of hormone -replacement therapy.

Appendix E : Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 
Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study  using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al 2009).  Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria 
provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used, as it does not provide 
additional meaning or accuracy.  
Baseline Eligibility  
Measurable Disease:  Tumor lesions:  Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• [ADDRESS_1207876] by [CONTACT_14781] (CT scan slice thickness 
no greater than 5 mm).  
• 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions that cannot be 
accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as non -
measurable).  
• [ADDRESS_1207877] x -ray. 
 
Skin lesions:   Doc umentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes:   To be considered pathologically enlarged and 
measurab le, a lymph node must be ≥[ADDRESS_1207878] scan.  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
Non-Measurable Disease:  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <<10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 - to <<15- mm short axis) as well as truly 
non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic inv olvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses, 
abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_20475].  
Target Lesions:  The most reproducible measurable lesions, up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and  5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs should be 
identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.   
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), should be represent
ative of all involved organs, and in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  Pathological nodes which are defined as measurable and that may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion or a short ax is of 
≥[ADDRESS_1207879] scan.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal 
lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted 
above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response.  
Non-Target Lesions:  All other lesions should be identified as non- target lesions at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or 
absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

FINAL PROTOCOL  DATE :  [ADDRESS_1207880] of a treatment.  
 
Clinical Lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be cons idered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥[ADDRESS_1207881]  X-ray: Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, a CT scan is 
preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI:  CT, MRI:  CT is the best currently available and reproducible met hod to 
measure lesions selected for response assessment.  This guideline has 
defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT 
slice thickness is 5mm or less.  When CT scans have slice thickness greater 
than 5  mm, the minimum size  for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans).  
Ultrasound:  When the primary study endpoint is objective response, ultrasound should 
not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible alternative 
to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules.  Ultrasound may also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by  [CONTACT_15077].  
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy:  Use of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation has not yet 
been fully and widely validated.  Therefore, use of these techniques for 
objective tumor response should be restricted to validat ion purposes in 
specialized centers.  Such techniques can be useful in confirming complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
Tumor Markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially above the upper li mit of normal, they must normalize for a subject to 
be considered in complete clinical response when all lesions have 
disappeared.  
Cytology and Histology:  Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response 
(PR) and complete respo nse (CR) in rare cases (e.g., after treatment to 
differentiate between residual benign lesions and residual malignant lesions 
in tumor types such as germ cell tumors).

Response Criteria  
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.   
Partial Response (PR):  
 At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target  
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. . 
Stable Disease (SD):    Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient in crease to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest (nadir) sum of diameters 
since the treatment started.  
Progressive Disease (PD):   
 At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest (nadir) s um since the treatment started, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  Requires not only 20% increase, but 
absolute increase of a minimum of 5  mm over sum.  
 
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target l esions and normalization of tumor markers.  
All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size ( <<10 mm short axis).  
Stable Disease (SD):    
 Persistence of one or more non -target lesions and/or persistence of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  
 Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing non -target lesions.  When the subject also has measurable disease, to 
achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, 
there  must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target disease 
such that, even in presence of SD or PR in the target disease, the overall 
tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Re sponse  
As detailed above, the best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
In general,  the subject’s best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.   
Confirmation of response (by [CONTACT_340625] 4 weeks or as specified in the protocol) is required for studys in 
which response rate i s the primary endpoint, but is not required in randomized study s or studys  with primary 
survival endpoints (i.e., where response is not a primary endpoint).

In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation 
of a CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by [CONTACT_254453][INVESTIGATOR_14166].  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions, and the nodes decrease to “normal” size ( <<10 mm), 
they may still have a  measurement reported on scans.  This measurement should be recorded even though the nodes 
are normal in order not to overstate progression, should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means that subjects with CR may not ha ve a total sum of “zero” on the e CRF.

Appendix G : VeriStrat® Assay  
VeriStrat is a pre -treatment blood -based test correlated with clinical outcome after  epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] (EGFR)- tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in patients with NSCLC.  
VeriStrat was developed in a multi- institutional study of advanced NSCLC patients treated with 
gefitinib 1.  The VeriStrat algorithm was developed usi ng a training set of pre -treatment serum 
samples from patients who experienced either long term stable disease or early progression on 
gefitinib therapy.  Mass spectra (MS) from these patients’ serum samples were used to define 12 MS features (i.e. peaks),  differentiating these two outcome groups.  VeriStrat was created by 
[CONTACT_865795] a k -nearest neighbors (KNN) classification scheme and 
its parameters optimized using additional spectra from the training cohort.  All aspects o f the 
algorithm were permanently frozen after development.  VeriStrat assigns patient samples a 
classification of VeriStrat Good (VS -G) or VeriStrat Poor (VS -P). 
VeriStrat was validated in a blinded fashion on the pre -treatment serum of two independent 
cohorts of patients who were treated with gefitinib or erlotinib (an EGFR -TKI)
1.  These studies 
confirmed that patients classified as VS -G had better outcomes than patients classified as VS -P 
(Hazard Ratio [HR] of death=0.  50 P =0.0054 in one cohort, HR of dea th=0. 40 P≤0.001 in the 
other).  VeriStrat was shown to correlate with clinical outcome following EGFR -TKI therapy, 
but not following chemotherapy or post -surgery as there was no statistically significant 
difference seen in the overall survival of patients classified as VS -G or VS -P before second -line 
chemotherapy (HR=0.74, 95%, P =0.42 in one cohort and HR=0.81, P =0.54 in another).  In a 
third control cohort of patients with resected early -stage NSCLC, the HR for overall survival was 
0.90 ( P=0.79).  
Retrospective analysis of VeriStrat testing performed on available serum samples of a subset of 
patients from the BR 21 trial (second or third line NSCLC patients randomized to erlotinib or placebo), demonstrated evidence of a significant prognostic component of the VeriStrat test, and indicated a strong statistically significant correlation of the VS -G label with objective response 
rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in the treatment arm (Fisher exact test 2 -sided p value 
0.0022 for ORR and p value <0.001 for  DCR)
2.  Importantly, this study also demonstrated the 
independence of VeriStrat classification from known genetic markers (i.e., EGFR mutations, 
EGFR amplification [by [CONTACT_4656]], and  KRAS  mutations).  
Finally, VeriStrat was prospectively validated in the Rando mized Proteomic Stratified Phase III 
Study of Second Line Erlotinib versus Chemotherapy in Patients with Inoperable Non -Small Cell 
Lung Cancer (PROSE)3.  PROSE is the world’s first completed prospective biomarker -stratified 
study in oncology to test treatment and biomarker interaction.  This is a multi- center, 
randomized, Phase [ADDRESS_1207882] line chemotherapy treatment.  Patients were randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1207883] dose erlotinib or chemotherapy (dealer’s choice, pemetrexed or docetaxel), and stratified by [CONTACT_102648], smoking status, and blinded pre -treatment VeriStrat classification.  
PROSE results show that patients classified as VS -G have similar OS when treated wi th either

squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), VeriStrat was correlated with survival of patients treated 
with gefitinib (HR=0.41, p=0.007), erlotinib/bevacizumab (HR=0.2, p=0.02), and cetuximab 
(HR=0.26, p=0.06); a chemotherapy cohort showed no statistically significant survival 
difference.  In a cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated with cetuximab, the difference in progressi on free survival between VS -G and VS -P patients was also significant, with HR=0.51 
(p=0.0065).   
More recent studies evaluated the effect of VeriStrat stratification on the treatment efficacy of letrozole with or without lapatinib in first line metastatic breast cancer patients in a retrospective analysis of the phase III trial EGF30008
5.  Of the 1286 patients randomized (HER2 
positive=219; HER2 negative=952; HER2 unknown=115), 1163 patients had serum available for analysis.  A VeriStrat label was assigned to 1046 patients ( VS-G=961; VS -P=80; VS 
Indeterminate=5).  In the overall population there was no significant difference in PFS between VS-G and VS -P groups within the letrozole + lapatinib arm (p=0.53).  In contrast, PFS of the 
VS-G group was longer than that of the VS -P group within the letrozole only arm (HR=0.36, 
p<0.001) and comparable with that of Good patients within the letrozole  + lapatinib arm (median 
PFS 10.8 months vs 11.0 months).  In multivariate analysis VeriStrat classification was 
independe ntly significant in the presence of other clinical variables.  A significant interaction 
between VeriStrat classification and treatment (interaction p=0.002) indicate that the test is not 
merely prognostic, but predictive with respect to benefit from diffe rent treatments.  This suggests 
that the VS -P group may represent primary hormone resistance that is overcome by [CONTACT_865796].  
In this study an exploratory evaluation of VeriStrat will be conducted.  Treatment options for this 
study will not be based on the results of this testing.  
Serum samples for VeriStrat testing will be collected as follows; the investigative site will follow 
standard of care protocols : 
• Baseline visit (pre -treatment)  
• Cycle 3, Day 1 visit (prior to treatment)  
• At disease progression  
• At the first Follow -Up visit after disease progression.  
Sample Collection and Processing

Procedures  
Upon completion of all serum collection (i.e., all patients have completed the first follow -up visit 
following end of trial treatment), serum samples will be analyzed using MALDI ToF MS and the 
VeriStrat results will be sent to SCRI  at the completion of the study.  Upon unblinding of the 
clinical data, in accordance with the endpoints described in the trial protocol, s tatistical analysis 
will be carried out independently by [CONTACT_865798].  Biodesix statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS 9.2 (Cary, NC) and PRISM (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA). 
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Since there is no previous information on VeriStrat testing in this population of patients, this 
study is exploratory in nature.  In the retrospective analysis of metastatic breast cancer patients from the EGF30008 study, the VS -P classification was observed in 8 -10% of the study 
population.  Ass uming a similar rate of occurrence of the VS -P classification, and the planned 
accrual of 46 subjects, ~[ADDRESS_1207891] a VS -P classification.  Based on 
the lack of previous information on the VeriStrat classification for the patients to be enrolled in this study, no estimation of detectable alternative is provided for the suggested statistical analyses.  The feasibility of the statistical analyses will be evaluated after the actual ratio of VS -
G/VS -P classification has been determin ed.

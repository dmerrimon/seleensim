1. Abstract  
The human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the 
[LOCATION_002] (U.S.) and is responsible for a wide range of conditions, including cancers within the 
anogenital tract and the oropharynx. Each year in the U.S., H PV causes approximately 330,[ADDRESS_739074] pregnant 
women receive some prenatal care, the postpartum period is  ideal to educat e and implement a HPV 
vaccination  program . Prior studies demonstrate <15% of pregnant women had received any doses of 
HPV vaccine and <8% completed the series. Given this window of opportunity, a few investigators 
have implemented postpartum HPV vaccinatio n at their institutions, and the Departments of Health 
in the states of [LOCATION_001] and Washington recommend it for women who have not completed the 
series.  
 
2. Objectives  (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
Our primary aim is to determine whether a two-dose [ADDRESS_739075] dose will be given after giving  birth while inpatient.

 3. Background (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or de vice, and any other relevant information to justify the research)  
 
The human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the 
[LOCATION_002] (U.S.) and is responsible for a wide range of conditions, including cancers within the 
anogenital tract and the oropharynx. Each year in the U.S., HPV causes approximately 330,[ADDRESS_739076] women 
will become infected with HPV at some point in their lives, 2 the majority of infections are 
asymptomatic. 3,4 However, if infection persists, over time, precancerous disease can eventually 
develop into cancer and spread through the body.   
 
Prophylactic HPV Vaccine   
In 2006, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved a quadrivalent HPV vaccine that 
prevents infection against four common HPV types (i.e. 6, 11, 16, and 18) that are responsible for 
70% of cervical cancer cases. The vaccine is administered as a series of three doses at 0 -month s, 1-2 
months, and 6 -months. Then in 2014, the FDA approved a 9 -valent vaccine that prevented infection 
from five additional HPV types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) that are responsible for 20% of cervical 
cancers. Until recently, the multi -dose HPV vaccine reg imen has been recommended for children 
11-12 years old, with catch -up or permissive immunization through age 26. However, the 
immunization rate of the HPV vaccine in the US is disappointing: overall, only 49% of adolescents 
(ages 13 -17) are fully immunized .[ADDRESS_739077] -effective. In an HPV vaccine efficacy trial 
with 18,644 women 15 -25 years of a ge, including those who were sexually active, and average 
follow -up of 2.9 years, incidence of precancerous lesions of moderate grade 3 or worse (CIN2+) 
was 30% lower in the vaccinated arm .6 There also were 24.7% fewer cervical excision procedures 
to treat precancerous lesions in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Higher uptake of HPV vaccine could not only 
reduce the number of women that require surveillance and procedures to treat precancerous cervical 
lesions, which are linked to anxiety,7 pain,8 and adverse obstetrical outcomes,9 but also reduce the 
associated medical costs estimated to be $[ADDRESS_739078] pregnant 
women receive some prenatal care, the postpartum period is ideal to educate and implement a HPV

 vaccination. Prior studies demonstrate <15% of pregnant women rece ived any doses of HPV 
vaccine and <8% completed the series .15-[ADDRESS_739079] postpartum HPV vaccination studies enrolled a sample of 150 Hispanic 
women who tolerated the vacc ination with few side effects and patients reported a high degree of 
satisfaction .20 However, 30% of t he women completed all 3 doses, 23% received two doses, and 
41% received only one dose during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Completion of the series of three HPV doses 
was a challenge. The second study, also done in [LOCATION_007], used patient navigators who used multiple 
reminder methods (texting, mailed   reminders, and phone calls) to increase completion rates. This 
study reported a 65% completion rate and 75% of postpartum women received at least one dose .[ADDRESS_739080] dose as the 
priming dose and the second distant dose resulting in consolidation of the immune response .22  The 
second dose administered at 6 -months to allow complete initial B cell response stimulation; affinity -
matured B cells produce an amnestic response after booster, but affinity maturation takes at least 
four months to develop. Recent studies have demonstrated non -inferio rity of HPV vaccination in a 
two-dose regimen in adolescents .[ADDRESS_739081]  
• Eligible participants who are being seen for prenatal care during the 3rd trimester of 
pregnancy or inpatient postpartum care will be notified by [CONTACT_562384]. The study coordinator will identify eligible participants through EPIC and 
notify the provi ders which of their patients are eligible for the study. Providers will notify 
study team members of their patient’s interests  either in -person or through referral cards. 
Referral cards will be scanned into Epic electronic medical records .  
• After eligible  participants have been referred by [CONTACT_30155], the research coordinator will 
thoroughly explain the study to the participant, give the participant a study information 
sheet, and answer any questions the participant might have .  
• If the participant agree s to participate , the research coordinator will consent the participant 
and collect  brief demographic and clinical information pertaining to the study. The consent 
may occur in person or through a video visit in the form of a telehealth visit. The consent 
process may occur either when the patient is still pregnant  during prenatal care or after the 
delivery of a child while the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
• If the patient  decline s to participate , the reason for declining w ould be documented. For all 
patie nts who are being seen for prenatal care during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy or 
inpatient postpartum care , the research coordinator will do a chart review to collect data at

 the end of the enrollment phase.   This information is needed to compare demographic data 
between those who agree to participate in the trial and those who decline  or were never 
approached . 
 
Visit 1 (0 -Months)  
• After delivery of a live child, t he enrolled participant will have 15mL of blood  drawn and 
labelled with a unique study ID .A vial of the vaccin e will be ordered from the Pharmacy and 
Investigational D rug Services (IDS) through EPIC and dose #1  will be administered by a 
licensed medical provider per clinical protocol (e.g., intramuscular [deltoid]).  
• After the vaccine is administered, the study coordinator will observe the participant for [ADDRESS_739082] events or allergic reactio ns.

or a CR U located at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562374].  
• Participants will be contact[CONTACT_562385] [ADDRESS_739083] 
preference to schedule a 6 -month research visit at an OB/GYN clinic or a CRU.  
• If participants cannot come at [ADDRESS_739084] 
them to schedule a research visit between 6 and 12  month s. 
• Participants will be asked for their last menstrual period date and provide 20mL of urine for 
a pregnancy  test before proceeding  with the study.  
• If the pregnancy test is negative, participants will have 15mL of blood drawn and labelled 
with a unique study ID.  
• A vial of the vaccine will be ordered from the Pharmacy and Investigational Drug Services 
(IDS) through EPIC and dose #2 will be administered by a licensed medical provider per 
clinical protocol (e.g., intramuscular [deltoid]).

will be advised to contact [CONTACT_278149]/GYN for further clinical management.  
 
Visit 3 (One m onth  after Visit 2 ) 
• Participants will have their final blood draw of 15mL collected and labelled with a unique 
study ID.  
• There is no vaccine administered at this visit.  
 
Visit 4 ( One to five months after Visit 3 )  
• At Visit [ADDRESS_739086] at an OB/GYN clinic or a CRU located at Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562375]. This is the time for a routine gyn annual examination, and the vaccine can be 
administered during that visi t as well.  
• Participants will be asked for their last menstrual period date and to provide 20mL of urine 
for a pregnancy test before they can  precede with the final vaccine dose. 
• A vial of the vaccine will be ordered from the Pharmacy and Investigational Drug Services 
(IDS) through EPIC and dose #3 will be administered by a licensed medical provider per 
clinical protocol (e.g., intramuscular [deltoid]).

Home visits  
Participants can choose home visits for visits [ADDRESS_739088] two research staff members , and o ne of them is a 
registered nurse (RN) . The RN will be responsible for the urine pregnancy test, blood draw, and 
vaccine injection. All these activities can be done safely in the home. Before and on the day of the 
home visit, participants will be screened for COVID symptoms. Up-to-date screenin g questions 
will be utilized to assess the risk of coronavirus transmission. In the home visit, the home visit 
team  will follow the protocol as described above.  The home  visit team  is equipped with emergency 
kits which include allergy  and asthma medication s. Because participants all received the first dose 
of the vaccine at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_562376], the risk of adverse events for the 
second and third doses of the vaccine is very low. If any adverse event were to happen, the team 
would imm ediately start emergency treatment following the American Red Cross Guidelines for 
anaphylaxis and the practice parameter developed by [CONTACT_201056], Asthma 
and Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology . The em ergency 
management includes assess ing airway, breathing, and circulation , give intramuscular epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ,

• Serum will be tested for vaccine HPV type antibodies by [CONTACT_562388] (cLIA). A participant will be defined as anti -HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 
positive if her anti -HPV serum level is >30, >16, >20, >24, >10, >8, >8, >8, or >8 milli 
[COMPANY_006] units (mMU)/mL for the 9 types, respectively. Assays to be performed by M erck’s

5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
Participants biologically born as females between the ages of [ADDRESS_739091], moderate or severe acute illness (deemed by [CONTACT_562389]), and immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, solid o rgan transplant).  
 
6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
GARDASIL 9 is an inactive HPV vaccine that is administered intramuscularly and available in 
0.5mL single does vials.  GARDASIL 9 is commercially approved by [CONTACT_562390], vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancer caused by [CONTACT_163535] 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 
52, and 58. Participants will receive the recommended FDA dosage throughout the course of the 
study.  
 
b. Justificati on and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -
FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant  
populations are changed.  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 4 Dated:   01/2021  
Page 8 of 12 
  
Gardasil -9 is FDA approved as a 3 -dose series for patients 15 -45 years ol d, and as a 2 -dose 
series for patients 9 -14 years old.  In a 3 -dose series, the second dose is usually given 1 –[ADDRESS_739092] dose (0, 1 –
2, 6 month schedule).  Per the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, there are minimal 
intervals for administration of the HPV vaccine but no maximum intervals .[ADDRESS_739093] recent dose. If the vaccination schedule is interrupted, vaccine doses do not need to be 
repeated (no maximum interval). To stay in compliance, all participants will still receive 3 d oses 
of the vaccine, although the scheduling is different.  We are allowing enough time between 
doses (minimal interval) to allow an appropriate B -cell response and participants will complete 
the series within one -year. Therefore, this study aligns with th e lack of a maximum interval and 
poses no change in risk compared to the traditional dosing schedule.  
 
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will be 
administered.  
N/A 
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable . 
• Anti-HPV16 antibody titers  measured four weeks after the second dose . 
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
• Antibody  titers  to the other 8 HPV types  
• Seropositivity for each HPV type after 1 -dose and 2 -doses  
• Percentage of participants who complete 1 -dose, 2 -dose, or 3 -dose vaccination  
• Percentage of participants with baseline titers suggestive of natural infection  or prior 
vaccination  
• Characteristics and percentage of participants who completed study visits in -person using 
their own transportation, required Lyft, or requested a home -visit. Characteristics will 
include individual demographic characteristics , sexual reproductive health history, STI 
history, neighborhood median income based on zipcode  and neigborho od deprivation index  
based on address.   
• Thematic coding of field notes if home visits were conducted  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis . 
Geometric mean titer (GMT) ratios for each HPV genotype will be compared b etween the 2 -
dose and 3 -dose regimen. As a non -inferiority trial, the primary analysis will use the per -
protocol analysis.  One -sided 90% confidence intervals (adjusted for multiple comparisons) will 
be constructed for the primary immunogenicity, which is the accepted method of reporting non -
inferiority results. Antibody GMTs at month -7 (4 weeks after 2nd dose) among participants who 
received the 2 -dose regimen will be compared with historical controls who received the 3 -dose 
regimen.24 The criteria for declaring non -inferiority will be defined as the lower bounds of the 
multiplicity -adjusted 90% CI f or the ratio of antibody GMT greater than 0.67. This non -
inferiority margin was selected based on bridging studies used for licensure.25

mean to the limit of 0.15. That is, if the GMT  mean  ratio is ≥ 0.82, we will be 90% confident 
that the true ratio is not less than 0.67. To allow for almost  28% attrition, we will enroll 231 
subjects.  
 
Secondary en dpoints include % seropositive at baseline (before administration of 1st dose), % of 
participants who seroconverted.  Descriptive statistics will be performed.   Additionally, we will 
determine if hormone levels are associated with seropositivity and GMTs.  
 
Given the success of our home visits as a method to increase retention, we would like to write a 
separate paper (brief report) to share our methodology  with other researchers.  
 
De-identified serum samples will be shipped to a [COMPANY_006] designated laboratory to perform the 
proprietary assay for HPV antibodies.  No PHI will be shipped.  Shipment will occur at study 
end in one batch.   Hormone levels will be shipped to OHSU for analyses . 
 
d. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] . 
Participants will be temporarily or perman ently removed from the study regarding a severe AE 
related to the vaccination. Any participants with a positive pregnancy test after the baseline visit 
will be permanently removed from the study.  
 
Participants may voluntarily withdraw from the study for an y reason at any time. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_562377], 
and/or if participants are unable or unwilling to comply with study procedures.  During the 
study, any abnormalities identifie d by [CONTACT_969], physical examination, or laboratory tests will be 
reassessed until resolution, an explanation is found, or up until one month if changes are deemed 
permanent.  
 
8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expec ted frequency.  
Risks of the proposed study include the risk of pain, infection, dizziness, swelling, bruising, or 
bleeding from the needle stick that can occur with phlebotomy. Risks commonly associated with 
venipuncture include bleeding, occasional bruisi ng at the site of venipuncture, hematoma, or 
infection. Rare complications (1/100) include lightheadedness or fainting.  Other risks include 
infection, damage to the vein, blood clot or stroke, if a large amount of air enter the vein, but 
these are rare.   Early pregnancies may not be detected even with a known last menstrual period 
and urine pregnancy test.  The vaccine is not a live virus  and does not cause birth defects. 
Administration of the vaccine may cause injection site pain, injection site swelling,  redness of 
the skin, allergic reactions, and/or headaches. The vaccine also has a small risk of syncope.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
Only licensed medical staff will draw blood and administer the vaccine.  Participants will be 
monitored after the vaccine to ensure there are no missed side effects.  To minimize the chances 
of pregnancy, participants will be asked if they are using an effective form of birth control (e.g. 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch, ring, sterilization, implant, iud, same -sex relationship, abs tinence), asked for the 
date of the last menstrual period, and undergo a urine pregnancy test.

www.vaers.hhs.gov  with any vaccine exposures during an early pregnancy.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
Although the study site will make every effort to protect the privacy and confidentiality of all 
study volunteers, it is possible that volunteers' involvement in the study could become known to 
others. This risk is communicated to all research subjects in JHMIRB approved studies.  
 
Given the sensitive nature of the proposed studies, the investigational  team will keep the study 
information private to the extent possible by [CONTACT_2371].  Where possible, clinical information will be 
identified by a unique number assign ed to each individual research participant . Access to study 
records will be limited to the study team, including the Johns Hopkins University CRU staff 
involved in the study, the Office of Human Research Protections, and Johns Hopkins University 
officials, where applicable and required by [CONTACT_2371].  Enrolled patients will be assigned study 
numbers for data  collection and evaluation.  Publications in medical journals arising from this 
study will not include any names or other identifie rs of the subjects involved.  
 
The key linking research subjects to study numbers will be kept as an electronic file. Electro nic 
files will be maintained on the PI’s SAFE Desktop  with limited access by [CONTACT_3476] .  Any 
paper files are maintained in a locked cabinet located in PI’s office, again, with limited access to 
study investigators.

9. Benefits  
There are not direct benefits to subjects who participant in this study, but the study has potential to 
provide key strategies to ensure completion of the HPV vaccine series among postpartum women.  
 
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
Participants in the study will receive a total of $75 dollars. $25 will be dispensed at visit 2 and $50 
will be dispensed at visit 3.  For participants who park in a Hopkins parking garage for visit 2 and 
visit 3,  we will give them a patient/visitor parking  coupon that will cover the cost of their parking 
for that visit. For participants arriving via bus, we will give them a bus token to cover the cost of 
their transportation. For participants unable  to travel to visit 2 or 3 through the previous two 
methods , we will use a Lyft concierge service to call them a ride to and from the visit.  
The $25 and $[ADDRESS_739096], depending on the participant’s preference.  
 
11. Costs  
There is minimal no cost to the participant as vaccine costs are covered by [CONTACT_89755].

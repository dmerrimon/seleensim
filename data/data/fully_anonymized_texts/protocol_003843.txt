Rationale for this Study  
Cutaneous CD30 lymphoproliferative disorders include lymphomatoid papulosis and primary cutaneous anaplastic large 
cell lymphoma.  Systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503816], radiation therapy, and 
brentuximab vedotin, all of which have poor  side effect profiles for a group of diseases that have a relatively indolent 
course. Leflunomide is a commercially available oral immunosuppressive agent that has been FDA approved since 1998 
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The primary mec hanism of action of leflunomide is inhibition of de novo 
pyrimidine synthesis by [CONTACT_503850] (DHODH), resulting  in anti-proliferative effects in B - and 
T-lymphocytes. Leflunomide has been investigated for its anti -neoplastic pote ntial in a variety of pre -clinical tumor 
models. Recent pre- clinical studies have demonstrated significant anti -neoplastic activity in CD30+ lymphoproliferative 
disorders. In addition, limited clinical experience is suggestive of a beneficial response when  leflunomide is used to treat 
CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (CD30+LYPD). Considering the favorable toxicity profile and extensive clinical experience with leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis, this drug represents a potential new candidate for therapy CD30 
LYPDs. 
Treatment Description  
Leflunomide will be administered orally at a  dose of 20 mg /day following a loading dose of 100 mg /day for the first three 
days of administration. Patients will be treated in planned 28 -day treatment cycles. Patients may  continue to receive 
cycles of treatment on study (maximum 13 cycles)  until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for 
removal from study treatment are satisfied. While on active treatment patients will undergo  evaluation for resp onse 
after every cycle.  At the time of terminating leflunomide, all participants will receive 11 days of oral cholestyramine 
treatment (8 g three times daily) to reduce the plasma leflunomide levels.  Patient will be followed for 1 year after 
terminating le flunomide treatment , or until disease progression, whichever is earlier . 
Objectives  
Primary Objective 
 To evaluate overall response rate of leflunomide treatment  
Secondary Objectives  
 To assess complete response rate and duration of resp onse of leflunomide treatment  
 To assess toxicities of leflunomide treatment  
 To assess disease status by [CONTACT_503851] (composite assesment of index lesion severity)

Study Design  
This study will be conducted as a single center, single agent pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Evaluation Criteria and Endpoints  
Primary Endpoint (s): 
 The primary endpoint is overall response (CR + PR). Response will be categorized  by [CONTACT_503852]. The response 
categories and criteria are summarized in Table 11.2 of the protocol.  
Statistical Considerations  
Sample size: This study will accrue 12 response evaluable patients, with a maximum accrual of 14 patients. Because this is 
a rare disease that has not been systematically studied in a prospective clinical trial, there is a lack of historical data o n the 
response rate ( and by [CONTACT_503853] [ mSWAT]) in this patient population. The sample size 
for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_503818], and not based on any definitive statistical criterion.  
With 12 patients, the 95% exact binomial confidence interval for the overall response rate will have a width of 55% (33% 
response rate, with 4 responders), 57% (42% response rate, with 5 responders), 58% (50% response rate, with 6 
responders), 57% (58% response rate, with 7 respond ers), 55% (67% response rate, with 8 responders), 52% (75% 
response rate, with 9 responders), and 46% (83% response rate, 10 responders) respectively. For any AE with a true incidence of 15% or higher, with [ADDRESS_648514] an 86% chance of ob serving 1+ patients with such AE.  
We project to accrue approximately one patient every 3 months. The projected study accrual duration is therefore 3 
years.  
Analysis: Observed toxicities will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination), severity, 
attribution, time of onset, duration, serum concentration of the active leflunomide metabolite, probable association with 
the study treatment and reversibility or outcome. Baseline information (e.g. the extent/type of prior therapy) a nd 
demographic information will be presented as well to describe the patients treated in this study.  
Rates and 95% Clopper Pearson binomial confidence interval (CI) will be calculated for overall response rate (patients 
that have confirmed CR or PR) and clinical benefit rate (patients that have confirmed CR /PR/MR or SD). In addition, sub -
analyses will be performed where participants will be considered evaluable for response if they are confirmed eligible, receive at least 75% of leflunomide during the fir st cycle of therapy and have their disease re -evaluated. Response rates 
will also be explored based on number/type of prior therapy(ies) and serum concentration of the leflunomide metabolite 
(µg/mL). Time to response and survival will be estimated using th e product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier.  
Preliminary molecular profiles for mRNA will be derived from skin biopsies . These profiles will be used to identify 
molecular correlates of therapeutic response using pathway identification and supervised principal components analysis.

2.[ADDRESS_648524] ion/Rationale for Development  
The term “CD30+ T- cell lymphoproliferative disorders” (CD30+LYPDs) describes a group of diverse diseases of the 
skin.[1] Primary cutaneous CD30+ T cell lymphoproliferative disorders (pcCD30+ T cell LPDs) are the second most 
common type of cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL), after mycosis fungoides (MF), accounting for 30% of all 
primary cutaneous lymphomas  [2, 3]. CD30+LYPD includes primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
(pCALCL) and lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP).  Their diagnostic hallmark is CD30 expression by [CONTACT_503854][INVESTIGATOR_503820], in the same typi[INVESTIGATOR_503821] (sALCL)  [4]. The treatment and prognosis of cutaneous CD30+ T cell LPDs differ significant ly from those 
of systemic lymphomas, emphasizing the importance of a clinical pathological correlation and thorough workup 
to ensure an accurate diagnosis  [5]. 
For both LyP and pcALCL, treatments are determined by [CONTACT_277275]. In LyP, topi[INVESTIGATOR_503822] n ot effective in changing the overall course of disease.  Current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503823], such as pruritus  [6, 7]. Patients with diffuse disease 
are treated with phototherapy or methotrexate  [8]. Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503824]. Once these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503825], lesions usually recur with the same intensity. 
In pcALCL, for single or localized lesions the main effective treatments are surgical excision or radiotherapy.  For 
multifocal or recurrent pcALCL, systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503826], bexarotene or Brentuximab 
Vedotin [9].  Treatment decision making is particularly challenging, given the to xic nature of available agents for 
a relatively indolent lymphoma.  
2.2  Leflunomide  
Leflunomide is a commercially available oral immunosuppressive agent that has been FDA approved since 1998 
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a single agent or in  combination with methotrexate. It has been 
used in over 300,000 patients worldwide for RA treatment. Leflunomide is generally well- tolerated and may be 
taken over a long per iod of time.   
The in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of leflunomide are not completely defined. The primary clinical mechanism 
of action is inhibiting de novo pyrimidine synthesis by [CONTACT_503850] (DHODH), and 
thus achieving anti -proliferative effect in B- and T-lymphocytes. A secondary mechanism of action is inhibition of 
cytokine and growth factor receptor associated tyrosine kinase activity [ 10].

Page 11  Leflunomide (the pro -drug) is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_503827] (A77 1726), which 
mediates leflunomide’s pharmacologic activity. Teriflun omide serum concentrations show wide inter -patient 
variability; in one study, the mean serum teriflunomide concentration in patients receiving 20 mg/ daily was 42 
mg/l with a range from 3 -150 mg/l and a standard deviation of 35 mg/l [ 11]. Of note, the serum concentration of 
this metabolite was shown to predict RA response  [11].  
The FDA approved dose in adults for the treatment of RA is a loading dose of 100 mg orally (PO) once daily for 3 
days, followed by a maintenance dose of 10 -20 mg PO once daily. Leflunomide has been used at up to 40 mg/day 
in patients  with Wegner’s granulomato sis with a safety profile similar to the 20mg/day dose used in RA [ 12, 13]. 
Doses up to 60 mg/day have been safely  used for the treatment of allograft polyoma BK virus in renal allograft 
patients to achieve a targeted blood level of teriflunomide (A77 1726) of 50 -100 micrograms/mL [14]; the targeted 
blood level was frequently achieved with a dose of 40mg/ day with no increase in toxicity reported [ 14].  
In addition to studies that demonstrate the serum concentra tion of the metabolite may predict response, recent 
work demonstrates that polymorphisms in the gene encoding DHODH may be associated with leflunomide 
treatment outcome in RA patients [15, 16].  
The long half -life of the metabolite (about 2 weeks) affects management of patients taking leflunomide.  A loading 
dose of 100 mg for 3 days is used to facilitate rapid attainment of steady state levels of M1.  Without a loading 
dose, it is estimated that attainment of steady  state concentrations would require nearly two months of dosing 
[17]. To eliminate the metabolite, a drug elimination procedure using cholestyramine is recommended.  
Cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, fixes the metabolite, preventing reabsorption and expediting drug 
elimination.  Without the drug elimination procedure, it may take up to 2 years to reach non -detectable plasma 
levels after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503828] [ 17] 
2.[ADDRESS_648525] reports of anti- tumor activity in mouse xenograft models of glioma indicate that inhibition of pyrimidine 
synthesis is not sufficient for anti- tumor activity and concomitant inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation may also 
play a role [18]. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), leflunomide has been shown to inhibit the  cell cycle 
progression in primary leukemic cells in vitro [ 19]. Dietrich et al showed that teriflunomide (A77 1726) affects 
proliferation of CLL by [CONTACT_503855] (3 -5 µg/ml) and by a dditionally inhibiting 
JAK/STAT pathway at intermediate concentrations (>10 µg/ml) [20]. The metabolite is also effective in fludarabine -
refractory cells  [20]. In addition, pre -clinical anti- tumor activity of leflunomide has been reported for melanoma 
[21] and prostate cancer [ 22].  
Recent pre -clinical studies of teriflunomide ( A77 1726) have demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity in 
myeloma [23]. Teriflunomide inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in common myeloma cell lines at clinically 
achievable concentrations (50 -200 µmol/L) in a time - and dose-dependen t manner. The stimulatory effect of 
conditioned medium of HS -5 bone marrow stromal cells on multiple myeloma cell growth is completely abrogated 
by [CONTACT_239486].  In addition, studies revealed additive effects when teriflunomide was combined with the 
genotoxic agents melphalan and doxorubicin and synergistic effects when combined with bortezomib and 
treosulfan [23]. Finally, the Rosen laboratory has found leflunomide to be active in both glucocorticoid sensitive 
and resistant myeloma cell lines (Steven Rosen, personal communication).   
 With respect to cutaneous lymphoma , the Querfeld laboratory has found the active metabolite

Page 12  2.4  Background for Correlative Studies  
Leflunomide is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_503827] (A77 1726), which med iates 
leflunomide’s pharmacologic activity. Previous population -based PK studies in patients with RA have 
demonstrated a high degree of intersubject variability in measured steady -state total (free + albumin -bound) 
teriflunomide serum concentrations, resulting in coefficients of variation in CL/F estimates of >50% [29, 30]. 
Teriflunomide is >99% bound to serum albumin and free drug concentrations have also been reported to be highly variable, with a median of 55.8 μg/l and a range of 27.9 -148.4 μg/l [31]. M oreover, measured total and free 
teriflunomide levels have been shown to predict response and toxicity in RA patients, leading some investigators to suggest a role for therapeutic drug monitoring and dose optimization of leflunomide [16]. It has also been reported that genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, the hepatic enzymes responsible for leflunomide metabolism, and DHODH, a key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and the main target of teriflunomide, can all influence the risk of leflu nomide-associated toxicity in RA patients [32 -34]. 
Transcriptomic diversity exists within the clonal tumor cells that comprise cutaneous lymphomas as noted by 
[CONTACT_503856] Sézary Syndrome [ 24, 25].  This correlates with the clinical experience of 
many experts that monotherapy alone is unable to produce response rates higher than 30 -40% or meaningful 
durations of response in these patients as well.  In a ddition, it is not only the tumor heterogeneity but  also the 
response to the tumor in the microenvironment in the form of T- cell exhaustion that contributes to a lack of higher 
response rates [ 26].  For these reasons, it is important to assess the heterogeneity of gene expression of tumor 
cells and the cells of the microenviro nment that likely exists within CD30 +LYPDs. Single -cell RNA analysis provides 
a view of all involved cellular components simultaneously and their individual gene expression states. Utilizing 
single cell mRNA sequencing will not only allow us to note the multiple mutations and the molecular signature [CONTACT_503881] e by [CONTACT_503857], but also will help us to explore the 
mechanism by [CONTACT_503858]30+L YPDs as noted in work conducted on 
CTCL lines by [CONTACT_503859]. In addition, this will contribute to deter mining what future combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_503829] -specific treatment.  
The parallel assessment of immunohistochemistry will allow us to correlate the new single cell data with  what is 
seen/noted pathologically. Tumor cells in CD30 +LYPD will be characterized utilizing a standard 
immunohistochemistry panel which includes CD3, CD4, CD8, CD30, BF1, Gamma, TRAF1, MUM1, perforin, 
granzyme, TIA -1 [27].  Current work in this area has noted that the predominant cells in the tumor 
microenvironment of CD30 +LYPDs include a large percentage of CD163+ macrophages (M2) (44.7% in LyP vs. 35% 
in pcALCL).  However, there are a number of tumor  infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes, FOXP3+ T -regulatory cells 
(Tregs) and only a few programmed cell death (PD1) lymphocytes [ 28].  We would like to examine the effect 
leflunomide has on the changing microenvironment as well.  
2.5  Overview and Rationale of  Study  Design  
Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, is approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis [ 15]. The “on 
target” effect of leflunomide and teriflunomide, which occurs at low doses, is mediated through inhibition of the cellular dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme  [16]. DHODH is required for  de novo pyrimidine 
synthesis (but not for pyrimidine synthesis mediated by [CONTACT_503860]), and “on target” effects of the leflunomide/teriflun omideare is reversed in vitro by [CONTACT_503861], which restores  de 
novo pyrimidine synthesis. Lymphocytes are particularly dependent upon  de novopyrimidine synthesis for their 
proliferation [ 17], and the major “on target” immunosuppressive effect of leflunomide/teriflunomide is thought 
to be due to decreased T cell proliferation. In addition to decreasing the amount of pyrimidine -based nucleotides 
available for DNA/RNA synthesis, drugs that inhibit DHODH activity globally decrease the level of O -linked 
GlcNAcylate -modified proteins through an “on -target” effect [ 18]. Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines 
and primary DLBCL tumor cells have higher levels of nuclear O -GlcNAcylate -modified proteins than do normal B-
cells, and the levels of these proteins correlate with DLBCL cell growth and survival [ 19]. With respect to cutaneous 
lymphoma the Querfeld laboratory has found the active metabolite teriflunomide to be effective at 48 -72 hours

Page 13  in inducing apoptosis in my cosis fungoides, Sézary cell, and CD30+LYPD cell lines.  In particular, the apoptosis was 
achievable  at the 50-200umol/L concentration.  
These pre- clinical data, and the relatively low toxicity profile seen with prolonged administration in the 
rheumatoid arthritis population  as well as the multiple myeloma population , in total provide evidence to support 
the investigation of leflunomide as an anti- CD30+ agent.  
While the standard dose of leflunomide (20mg daily), following a loading dose of 100mg daily for 3 days, is FDA 
approved for continu ous treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, leflunomide has been administered without an 
increase in the type, frequency or severity of adverse events at doses up to 40 mg/day in patients with Wegner’s granulomatosis, and up to 60mg/day in a subset of patients with polyoma BK neuropathy to achieve targeted therapeutic levels [ 12, 13].  
Because the current dosing guideline for patients with rheumatoid arthritis  do not to exceed 20 mg daily 
maintenance doses [ 17], the 20mg/day dose is selected as the safe starting dose.  In addition, in personal 
communications, Miles Prince has used leflunomide at doses of [ADDRESS_648526] 
failed methotrexate with report of minimal side effects.  
Patients will be treated in planned 28 -day treatment cycles. Patients may continue to receive cycles of treatment 
on study until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or other criteria for removal from study treatment are 
satisfied. While on active treatment patients will undergo monthly evaluation for response by [CONTACT_503862] (composite assessment of index lesion severity)  [29, 30]. Following the decision to end leflunomide 
treatment, all patie nts will undergo 11 days of treatment with cholestyramine, which fixes the metabolite, 
preventing re -absorption and effectively lowering drug levels.  Cholestyramine has been shown to decrease plasma 
levels of teriflunomide (A77 1726) in healthy volunteers by [CONTACT_3450] 40% in 24 hours and by 49 -65% in 48 
hours [17]. 
In addition , molecular correlates and ex vivo responses will be evaluated using skin specimens, which will be 
collected from patients before treatment, after one cycle, four cycles of leflunomide treatment , end of therapy (if 
lesions are still present), and at disease progression . Molecular correlate  analysis of leflunomide response will 
include single cell RNA sequencing. Specimens derived from before and after leflunomide treatment (after 1 
month and at progression or complete response, if possible) will be analyzed, as well as pre -treatment specimens 
exposed to teriflunomide ex vivo .

Version 01 - 07/08/[ADDRESS_648539] of daily treatment with leflunomide; patients 
will be treated in planned 28 -day treatment cycles  for up to 13 cycles (approximately 1 year)  until meeting any 
off-protocol treatment criteria ( Section 5.6). After the decision to end study treatment has been made, 
participants will receive treatment with cholestyramine ( Section 5.5) to eliminate leflunomide. Participants who 
end study treatment for reasons other than disease progression will undergo active follow -up (Section 5.7 ) until 
disease progression or [ADDRESS_648540] be actively taking 
study agent.  Windows for procedures a re detailed in Section 10 .0. 
5.3  Agent Administration  
5.3.1  Leflunomide  
Participants will be instructed to take each dose of leflunomide orally, once a day, at approximately the same time each day. They may take it with or withou t food. If a patient forgets or misses a dose for whatever reason, it should 
not be replaced or made up. Participants will be given a study calendar (pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642] , see Appendix D ) to document 
each dose of leflunomide that is taken or missed.  
Leflunomide is administered with a loading dose of 100 mg /day for the first three doses (first three days)  in Cycle 
1. Starting day 4  in Cycle 1 and for all later cycles , it will be administe red at 20 mg /day (or 10 mg /day if dose 
reduced due to toxicities).    
There will be no intra- patient dose escalation; patients will undergo dose modification due to toxicity per Section 
7.2. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_648541] of all stu dy procedures including timing and windows, see  Section 10.0 .

City of Hope #: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_503813]30+ Lymphoproliferative Disorders  
Version 01 - 07/08/[ADDRESS_648542] of all assessments 
and windows.  
Because of the ability of leflunomide to be reabsorbed through the colon, resulting in a very long half- life, all 
participants will be treated with cholestyramine to prevent re -absorption of leflunomide after the decision to end 
study treatment has been ma de.  
Participants removed from study treatment will undergo oral administration of cholestyramine 8 grams oral 
suspension three times daily for 11 days. It will not be a deviation if an administration of cholestyramine is delayed or if the 11 days are not consecutive. Cholestyramine administration may be adjusted per the discretion of the 
treating investigator. After the treatment with cholestyramine, clinical laboratory testing will be performed to verify plasma levels less than 0.02 mg/L or 0.02µg/mL by t wo separate tests at least 14 days apart. If plasma levels 
are higher than 0.02 mg/L or 0.02µg/mL, additional cholestyramine treatment will be considered. See Section 10 for a tabular view of cholestyramine administration and metabolite testing windows and  days of administration.  
Note: Cholestyramine can affect the absorption of other oral medications. Such medications should be taken 1 hour before administration of cholestyramine on any day or per other guidance in the package insert. Watch for 
bleeding ab normalities due to vitamin K deficiency for which intravenous vitamin K may be administered.  
5.6  Duration of Therapy and Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
Patients will receive study treatment for a maximum of 13 cycles until disease progression, unac ceptable toxicity 
or other criteria for removal from study treatment are satisfied. Participants may be removed from treatment for 
any of the following reasons:  
o  Evidence of disease progression  per mSWAT (see Appendix C ) 
o  Participant receives 13 cycles (~ 12 months of protocol therapy)  
o  Patient is deemed intolerant to study treatment because of toxicity, despi[INVESTIGATOR_58341]/delay  
o  Participant withdraws from the treatment phase of the study  
o  General or specific changes in the participant's condition, including non -compliance, which renders the 
participant unacceptable for further treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021].  
Documentation of the reason for discontinuing therapy and the date effective should be made in the medical 
record and appropriate eCRF. The participant should then proceed to off- treatment procedures for safety 
monitoring, leflunomide elimination and follow -up procedures. The participant’s status is to be modified in the 
OnCore system once the off -treatment period is completed. Alternative care options will be discussed with the 
participant.  
5.7  Active Follow -Up 
Participants who do not progress while on treatment (regardless of whether the patient finished 13 cycles or terminated treatment early) will be in Active Follow Up , for [ADDRESS_648543], or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for 
discontinuing study participation should be documented and may include:

8.0  AGENT INFORMATION  
8.1  Leflunomide  
Leflunomide is an FDA approved agent for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Please refer to the Package Insert for additional details not provided in this section.  
8.1.1  Description and classification  
The chemical name [CONTACT_503884] N -(4’-trifluoromethylphenyl) -5-methylisoxazole -4-carboxamide. It has a 
molecular formula C H F N O, a molecular weight o f 270.2. Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor.  
Leflunomide Pi[INVESTIGATOR_503814]30+  LYPD 
City of Hope #: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_503838]30+ Lymphoproliferative Disorders  
Version 01 - 07/08/2021 
CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 26  8.1.2  Mode of action  
Leflunomide is an isoxazole immunomodulatory agent which inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (an enzyme 
involved in de novo pyrimidine synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity.  Several in vivo and in vitro 
experimental models have demonstrated an anti -inflammatory effect.  
8.1.3  Toxicology  
See Section 6.1 
8.1.4  Pharmacology  
Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite teriflunomide (A77 1726) which is responsible for essentially all of its activity in vivo . Following oral administration, peak levels of the active 
metabolite occurred between 6 to 12 hours after dosing. Due to the very long half- life of teriflunomide (~2 weeks ), 
a loading dose of 100 mg for 3 days was used in clinical studies to facilitate the rapid attainment of steady -state 
levels of teriflunomide. Without a loading dose, it is estimated that attainment of steady -state plasma 
concentrations would require near ly two months of dosing. Biliary recycling is a major contributor to the long 
elimination half- life of teriflunomide. The active metabolite of leflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. 
Use of a drug elimination procedure (cholestyramine or activate d charcoal) is used to reduce the drug 
concentration more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_503839].  
8.1.5  Storage and stability  
Leflunomide tablets should be stored at 25°C (77°F); excursions are permitted to 15 –30°C (59–86°F). Protect from 
light. 
8.1.6  Preparation  
Leflunomide is commercially available for oral administration as tablets containing 10, 20, or 100 mg of active drug. 
8.1.7  Agent administration  
Leflunomide is administered orally. Participants will be given a study calendar to track all doses taken or missed. There will be an initial loading dose of 100 mg /day for the first 3 days of doses.  Participants will then receive 
leflunomide at the assigned dose level. See Section 5.3.1 for administration details.   
8.1.8   Availability and supp ly 
Tablets in 10 and 20 mg strengths are packaged in bottles of 30 pi[INVESTIGATOR_457013]. Leflunomide will be provided to patients by [CONTACT_503866]. A commercial supply will be purchased and distributed as an investigational agent by [CONTACT_503867].  
8.2  Cholestyramine  
Cholestyramine is not the study agent being evaluated for efficacy, but is required for the elimination of the study 
agent leflunomide. Cholestyramine is FDA approved for hypercholesterolemia.  Cholestyramine use is indicated 
in the leflunomide package insert to eliminate the leflunomide metabolite.   
8.2.1  Description   
Cholestyramine is a strong anion exchange resin comprised of a quaternary ammonium group attached to an inert 
styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer. Cholestyramine removes bile acids from the body by [CONTACT_503868],  which are then excreted in the feces.

Page 27  8.2.2  Other names  
Questran®, Questran Light, Cholybar, Olestyr  
8.2.3  Mode of action  
Cholestyramine resin adsorbs and combines with the bile acids in the intestine to form an insoluble complex which 
is excreted in the feces. Thi s results in a partial removal of bile acids from the enterohepatic circulation by 
[CONTACT_503869].  
8.2.4  Toxicology  
See Section 6.2 . 
8.2.5  Storage and stability  
Store between 20º- 25ºC (68º-77ºF). [See USP Controlled Room Temperature]. Excursions permitted to 15º- 30ºC 
(59º-86ºF). 
8.2.6  Agent administration  
Cholestyramine should be administered orally after being prepared per package insert (powder diluted in fluid). See Section 5.3.2 for study administration details.  
8.2.7  Availability and supply  
Cholestyramine will be provided to participants by [CONTACT_1758]. A commercial supply will be purchased and distributed by [CONTACT_503870].

for processing as stated in Figure 9.1 . 
9.2.6  Single Cell RNA Sequencing  
The samples at baseline and beginning of cycle 2 for each patient will be analyzed together to identify changes in 
both CD30 tumor cells and other immune cell populations. Cells with mitochondrial read rate > 10% and < [ADDRESS_648561] gene expression based on the number of UMIs per cell as 
well as the percentage of mitochondrial gene content. Normalized and scaled data will be clustered using the top 
significant principal components of the highly variable genes. The t -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t -
SNE) algorithm will be used to visualize the resulting clusters. Cluster specific markers will be identifie d to generate 
heatmap and identify cell types in each cell cluster. T cell subtype markers, such as T reg, memory T cells, effector 
T cells, exhausted T cells etc. will be used to identify different T cell populations. Chromium’s V(D)J -Loupe will be 
used for analysis of TCR clonotypes and for visualization. Over- represented TCR clone in each patient will be 
identified and considered as indication of malignant cells. Genes will be compared between malignant and non -
malignant cells using Bioconductor package “Limma” on log transformed and normalized scRNA -seq data. Gene 
Set Enrichment analysis (GSEA) v3 will be performed to evaluate the significance activation of the Hallmark and 
KEGG gene sets in MSigDb. This analysis will help us understand what specific pat hways are activated in tumor 
cells and how the pathways are changing after treatment. Single cell trajectory analysis will be conducted with 
diffusion pseudotime method using Bioconductor package “destiny”, which will capture the dynamic changes of tumor cells before and after treatment.  
9.2.[ADDRESS_648562] leflunomide has on the changing tumor and tumor microenvironment as well as correlate these findings with those from scRNA-seq.  Current work in this area has noted that the predominant cells in the tumor microenvironment of 
CD30+LYPDs include CD163+ M2, tumor infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes, FOXP3+ Tregs and programmed cell death 
(PD-1) lymphocytes.  
The multiplex immunohistochemistry of the tumor microenvironment will distinguish the CD30+ T cells (tumor cells) from other cells (M2, Tregs, tumor infiltrating T cells) and whether or not PD1 co -expression is noted. The 
findings will be correlated to clinical response.

 11.0 ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS/MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
11.1 Safety  Endpoints  
Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0.  
11.2 Efficacy  Endpoints  
Response on this study will be assessed by [CONTACT_503852] (see Appendix C). In addition to m SWAT, individual 
lesions will also assessed by [CONTACT_503872] (CAILS) tool (see Appendix 
E). 
Overall Response  Rate: 
o  Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented response (CR or PR) any time during 
study treatment.  
Complete Response Rate:  
o  Defined as the proportion of patients with a documented CR any time during study treatment.  
Duration of response : 
o  Defined as the time interval from the date of first documented response (CR or PR) t o the first 
documented disease progression or death , whichever occurs first.  Patients without a 
documented CR or PR will be excluded.  Patients who do not achieve CR or PR are excluded from 
this analysis.

Endpoints for the exploratory objective on RNA signature [CONTACT_503885].  
  
12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Study Design  
This study will be conducted as a single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_503842] . Patients will receive up to 13 cycles of leflu nomide until any 
criterion for off- treatment is met. P atients without progress ive disease at the time of off -treatment will 
be followed for up to 1 year after off- treatment as active follow -up. Response will be assessed after every 
cycle per mSWAT while on treatment and every 3 months while in active follow -up. The primary endpoint 
is overall response rate. Secondary endpoints include complete response rate, duration of response, and 
toxicities.   
12.2 Sample Size and Accrual Rate  
This study will accrue 12  response evaluable patients, with a maximum accrual of 14 patients. Because 
this is a rare disease  that has not been systematically studied in a prospective clinical trial, there is a lack 
of historical data on the response rate (and by [CONTACT_503852]) in this patient population. T he sample size for this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_503818], and not based on any definitive statistical 
criterion.With 12 patients, the 95% exact binomial confidence interval for the overall response rate will 
have a width of 55% ( 33% response rate, with 4 responders), 57% ( 42% response rate, with 5 responders),

We project to accrue approximately one patient every [ADDRESS_648572] -baseline response assessment 
will be evaluable for response; patients inevaluable for response (for example patients who did not 
receive any protocol treatment, or patients who had no response assessment on study due to withdrawal 
of consent during cycle 1) will be replaced.  
12.4 Statistical Analysis Plan  
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including age, gender, medical history, and prior 
therapy, will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics 
(number [n] , mean, standard deviation, standard error, median , and range will be provided. For 
categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided.  
Observed toxicities will be summarized, in terms of type , grade, time of onset, duration, and attribution 
to the study treatment. The overall response rate and complete response rate will be calculated  along 
with the Clopper Pearson binomial 95%  exact confidence intervals . Duration of response  will be calculated 
using Kaplan -Meier product limit estimator; median duration  of response  will also be estimated when 
possible. 
The miRNA/mRNA expression profile data will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. The data will also be used to explore the miRNA/mRNA that show significant differences between responders and non -
responders after leflunomide treatment. For miRNA/RNA profiling, fold changes >[ADDRESS_648573] <0.[ADDRESS_648574] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]

Page 36  The following definitions will be used to determine the causality (attribution) of the event to the study 
agent or study procedure.  
o  Unrelated – The event is clearly NOT related to  study treatment, and is clearly related to other 
factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the participant.  
o  Unlikely – The event is unlikely related to the study treatment, and is most likely related to other 
factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant 
drugs. 
o  Possible – The event may be related to study treatment, as it follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from the tim e of drug administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_503873]’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.   
o  Probable – The event is most likely related to the study treatment, as it follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from the time of drug administration and a known response pattern to the 
study drug, and is unlikely related to the participant’s clinical state, other t herapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
o  Definite – The event is clearly related to the study treatment, as it follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from the time of drug administration and a known response pattern to the study drug, and is not re asonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s condition, therapeutic 
interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
14.2 Routine AE Collection and Reporting Guidelines  
AEs will be collected from the signing of informed consent until ending study particip ation.  Routine AE 
reporting will occur via data entry into the study eCRF.  Adverse events will be monitored by [CONTACT_462490] (PMT). Adverse events that do not meet the criteria of serious OR are not unanticipated problems do not require ex pedited reporting . AEs reported through expedited processes 
(e.g., reported to the IRB, DSMC, FDA, etc.) must also be reported in routine study data submissions.  
Routing AEs recorded in the CRF will include: 
During protocol treatment  through EOT , all grade 2 or higher adverse events  
All SAEs

14.4.1  Definition of Overdose  
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol- specified dose of 
lenalidomide assigned to a given patient, regardless of any associated adverse events o r sequelae.  
PO any amount over 60 mg leflunomide  
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the protocol required schedule or frequency.   
Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the overdose 
was accidental or intentional, should be reported.  
14.4.2    Second Malignancies  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with 
investigational agent/intervention, radiation or ch emotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered 
a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
The investigator must immediately notify the Study PI/ DCC via an expedited report . 
15.0 ADHERENCE TO THE PROTOCOL  & REPORTING OF PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Deviations from the  protocol should be avoided, except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazard (s) 
for the protection, safety, and well- being of a research participant. As a result of deviations, corrective 
actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_503874] p romptly. All protocol deviations and 
planned protocol deviations will be reported in accordance with the Clinical Research Protocol Deviation 
policy.

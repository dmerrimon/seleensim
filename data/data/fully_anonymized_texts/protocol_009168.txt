maximum total daily  dose of 0.6 mg (0.3 mg b.i.d.) pending 
tolerability . 
If a dose is not tole rated, the study  drug may  be decreased to the 
previous dose level. If the initial dose of 0.01 mg b.i.d. is not 
tolerated, dosing may  be decreased to 0.01 mg q.d.
Concurrent Control: Matching placebo
Route and 
Formulation: Oral, liquid-filled, hard-gelatin capsules
Objectives: Primary :
The primary  objective of the study  is to assess the hemody namic 
effects of APD811 and the effect of APD811 on 6MWD in patients 
with PAH after 22 weeks of treatment including an initial dose 
titration period of up to 9weeks.
Secondary :
The secondary  objectives of the study  are:
•to assess the safet y and tolerability  of APD811
•to assess the effect of APD811 on clinical worsening 
Exploratory :
Exploratory  objectives of the study  are:
•to assess the effect of APD811 on levels of BNP and 
NT-proBNP after 22 weeks of treatment
•to assess change in WHO/NYHA functional class
•to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (C minand  presumptive C max) 
of oral APD811 
•to evaluate the effects of APD811 on sy stemic vascular 
resistance (SVR)
Study Design: The study  will be conducted as a placebo- controlled, randomized 
(2:1, APD811:placebo), 22 week double -blind study  which will 
include a dose titration period of up to 9 weeks. An additional 
transition period of 3 weeks (±1 week) will occur for those patients 
who elect to enroll into the open -label extension study , APD811 -007. 
Patients that do not continue in the extension study will have a 
3-week follow -up visit. Approximately  60 patients with PAH will be 
enrolled.
Safety  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_301186] y Monitoring Committee (SMC). 
The SMC will review safety  data including adverse events, blood 
pressure and heart rate periodically , in order to ensure patient safet y 
and determine an appropriate dose titration regimen.

Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments:Dose Titration Period: Pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be 
collected pre -dose and at [ADDRESS_833497] dose escalation.
Treatment Phase: PK blood samples will be collected pre- dose and at 
[ADDRESS_833498] -dose at each visit during the treatment phase.
An additional blood sample for P K anal ysis will be collected if 
possible at the time of any  intolerable AE or SAE.
Safety Assessments: •Clinical laboratory  tests (to include hematology , coagulation 
parameters [PT/PTT, I NR], serum chemistry , and urinaly sis) 
•Vital signs
•Physical examinati ons
•12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs)
•Adverse events
Data Analyses: The primary  efficacy  hypothesis regarding the superiority  of APD811 
to placebo will be assessed in a stepwise manner. First, the statistical 
significance of APD811 versus placebo result will be determined for 
the change from baseline in PVR at the end of 22 weeks of treatment. 
If the result is significant (p < 0.05, two -sided), the primary  
hypothesis will be considered satisfied and this study  will be declared 
positive. Subsequently , the c hange from baseline in 6MWD will only  
be tested if the change from baseline in PVR is significant. This 
testing procedure preserves the overall Ty pe I error rate for testing 
the primary  efficacy  hypothesis.
An anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline PVR as a 
covariate and treatment and baseline WHO/NYHA functional class as 
factors will be used to assess the effect of APD811. Appropriate 
transformations will be applied if necessary  (i.e., log trans formation). 
6MWD and other continuous efficacy endpoints will be anal yzed

Confidential1INTRODUCTION
APD811 is an orally  available , potent and selective, non- prostanoid, prostaglandin I 2(PGI 2, 
prostacyclin, IP) receptor agonist. The IP receptor is a rhodopsin -like transmembrane 
spanning G protein -coupled receptor which is expressed on platelets and on the smooth 
muscle cells of several tissues including the lung, he art, aorta, liver, and kidney s.Activation 
of the I P receptor results in vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation.1
APD811 is being developed to treat World Health Organization (WHO) Group [ADDRESS_833520] opposition, thromboxane A 2
promotes vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. An imbalance in this homeostasis 
towards vasoconstriction, in situ thrombosis, and remodeling of the small pulmonary  arteries 
results in pulmonary  hypertension.4,5  
Studies indicate that patients with pulmonary  hypertension (PH) have decreased levels of 
prostacy clin.4,[ADDRESS_833521] 
demonstrated efficacy through improved exercise capacity  and/o r delay  in clinical 
worsening . There is a need for effective oral agent stargeting the prostacy clin pathway .
The clinical definition of PH requires confirmation by [CONTACT_137910] (RHC) 
demonstrating a mean pulmonary  artery  pressure (PAP) >25 mm Hg. The diagnosis of PAH 
requires a normal ( ≤15 mm Hg) pulmonary  capi[INVESTIGATOR_275402] (PCWP) and an 
increase in pulmonary  vascular resistance (PVR) in add ition to an elevated mean PAP. The 
latest clinical classification by  [CONTACT_941] 4th World Sy mposium on Pulmonary  Hypertension 
divides pulmonary  hypertension into five categories based on similarities in clinical 
presentation, pathogenesis, and response to treatme nts.8PAH is the first category  (Group 1) 
and is further divided into subgroups reflecting associated conditions. All of the subgroups in 
Group 1 PAH share similar clinical characteristics and virtually  identical histopathology  in 
the pulmonary  arteriolar circulation.

higher female preponderance (~3:1) .9,10,11The range in reported prevalence  is likely  due to 
the difficulty  in diagnosing earl yPAH. Patients are usually  asymptomatic in the earliest 
stages of the disease and presenting s ymptoms, which include ex ertional dyspnea, fatigue, 
peripheral edema, and s yncope ,can be indistinguishable from other cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_227314]. The majorit y of patients are not diagnosed until they  have developed sy mptoms of
World Health Organization (WHO) [modification of the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association 
(NYHA) classification for pulmonary  hypertension] functional class III.
The current evidence -based recommended treatment algorithm emerged from the Fifth World 
Symposium on Pulmonary  Hypertension12and is summarized in Figure 1. The majority  of 
patients who undergo acute vasoreactivity  testing are classified as non -responders, and are 
therefore candidates for treatment with an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA), a
phosphodiesterase -type 5 (PDE -5) inhibitor or a prostacy clin receptor agonist, depending 
upon the severit y of s ymptoms. Patients with inadequate response to initial medical therap y 
may progress to combination drug therapy  or ultimately  to surgical procedures that could 
include lung transplantation. The efficacy  of prostacy clin receptor agonists has been 
demonstrated for monotherap y in patients with functional class II or greater symptoms, and 
for combination therap y with an ERA or with a PDE -[ADDRESS_833523] been limited by[CONTACT_625692]. One analog ofprostacy clin(PGI2)hasbeen recentl yapproved

Confidential1.1 Background Information
1.1.1 Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_625671], PAH remains a fatal disease with 
approximately  15% mortality  within 1 y ear15and a 3 -year survival rate between 35 -75% 
depending on PAH etiology  and co- morbid conditions.4,15There is a significant need for 
alternative treatments for this disease. APD811, an oral non- prostanoid IP rec eptor agonist, 
could be an effective and convenient treatment option.
APD811 has been characterized in both single and multiple dose studies in a health y 
volunteer population. The safet y profile suggest sthatdose-related pharmacology  at the IP 
receptor is occurring withinthe dose ra nge of 0.01 – 0.[ADDRESS_833526] 
level (NOAE L) was determined to be 0.1 mg/kg in a 4 -Week Good Laboratory  Practice 
(GLP) study .18The NOAEL  corresponds to Day  28 C maxvalues of 22.1 and 15.5 ng/mL in 
male and female monkeys, respectivel y.18In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 14 -day repeat dose range finding study , a
“slight convulsion” was observed in one male monkey at 0.2 mg/kg after four once dail y 
doses and one convulsion in one female monkey  at 0.5 mg/kg after two once dail y doses .20
Plasma concentrations were only measured on Day 1 and Day  14 during this study . Thus 
plasma levels were not determined at the time of the convulsions. However C maxon Day 1 
and Day  14 for the male monkey  with a “slight convulsion ,” administered 0.2 mg/kg ,was 
119ng/mL and 64.1 ng/ mL, respectivel y.A NOAEL  could not be determined for this study . 
It is not clear whether the reported incidences of convulsions were due to indirect effects 
such as h ypotension, or to a direct CNS effect. Convulsions were not observed in the GLP 
repeat dose toxicity  studies of 4 -weeks, 3- months and 9 -months in duration where doses of 
0.02, 0.06, 0.10, 0.20, or 0.40 mg/kg/day  were administered to monkey s.18,19APD811 was
better tolera ted in the chronic (9 -month) monkey  study  with no adverse findings reported.  
A single 0.2 mg/kg dose of APD811 substantially  decreased mean arterial pressure and pulse 
pressure from 40 to 70 minutes after dosing in a single dose ,oral,cardiovascular GLP study  
in monkey s.21The NOAEL  for this study  was also 0.1 mg/kg.

APD811 Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol : APD811 -003, Amendment [ADDRESS_833527] 2014
ConfidentialMuch higher doses and exposures of APD811 were tolerated in rats, consistent with a 
substantial reduction in potency  (EC 50 529 nM) at the rat IP receptor as compared to monkey 
(EC 50= 0.15 nM). In a 4-week GLP repeat -dose toxicity study , APD811 was administered to 
rats at doses of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg/day  by [CONTACT_16759]. It was well tolerated up to 
100mg/kg/day  for males and 30 mg/kg/day  for females. The NOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day  for 
males, corresponding to Day  [ADDRESS_833528] values of 45.1 µg/mL and 475 h r•µg/mL, 
respectivel y, and 30 mg/kg/day  for females, corresponding to Day  [ADDRESS_833529]
values of 18.5 µg/mL and 190 hr•µg/mL, respectively . In the chronic 6-month toxicity  study 
in rats, the NOAEL was established at 30 mg/kg/day  for both sexes.
1.1.[ADDRESS_833530]- in-man study  (APD811- 001) wasdetermined in 
accordance with the FDA Guidance Document “Estimating the Safe Starting Dose in Clinical 
Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy  Volunteers” (July  2005) and was based on the 
monkey  NOAEL of 0.1 mg/kg/day , using a safety  factor of 20, and assuming a [ADDRESS_833531] human study (APD811-001), up to 9 single ascending dose cohorts of 8 subjects 
each (6 active, 2 placebo) were planned .The administration of single doses of 0.03, 0.[ADDRESS_833532] commonly  experienced included headache, vomiting, nausea and jaw 
pain.
No consistent effects were seen on blood pressure , but pulse rate appeared to increase more 
in APD811 subjects than placebo su bjects (delta ~ 10 bpm) at the [ADDRESS_833533] 
doses. Consequently , uncorrected QT interval decreased, but rate corrected QT interval 
(QTcF) was increased from baseline at t maxin non -dose responsive fashion, by  [CONTACT_625694] [ADDRESS_833534] on QT interval is not 
supported by  [CONTACT_625695] (hERG IC 50>[ADDRESS_833535] on QTc in a primate 
cardiovascular stud yat 3-4 times the C maxachieved in this phase 1 study ). No dose response
on QT interval was seen, and the significance of the findings in this limited study  is unclear.
A subsequent multiple ascending dose stud ywas conducted in health y volunteers 
(APD811 -002). The safety  and tolerability  of two different dosing regimens was evaluated: a
once -daily regimen in C ohorts 1 and 2 (run concurrently ) began at an initial dose of 0.05 mg 
and was escalated as tolerated to doses of 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg and 0.4 mg at 5 -day 
intervals, and a twice -daily  regimen in Cohort 3 began at an initial dose of 0. 01 mg b.i.d. and 
was escalated as tolerated to doses of 0.02 mg, 0.03 mg, 0.04 mg, 0.05 mg, and 0.07 mg b.i.d. 
at 5-day intervals. In Cohorts 1 and 2, a total of 30 subjects were dosed, with 20 receiving 
APD811 and 10 receiving placebo. In Cohort 3, a total of 25 subjects were dosed, with 20 
receiving APD811 and 5 receiving placebo.

APD811 Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol : APD811 -003, Amendment [ADDRESS_833536] 2014
ConfidentialOverall tolerability  for both dosing regimens was similar; when comparing the total daily  
dose taken b y subjects for at least 3 consecutive days, 40% of subjects tolerated atotal dail y
dose of 0.1 mg or higher with either q.d. or b.i.d. regimens. The specific adverse events 
observed were similar for each of the dosing regimens and included headache, nausea, 
vomiting, jaw pain and flushing ; nausea and vomiting occurred more f requently  with the 
once -daily dosing regimen . The AEs observed in the study  were similar to the AE profile 
seen with other IP agonists .As this study  was designed to titrate to individual tolerability , it 
was not surprising that the majority  of AEs for sub jects on active drug were moderate in 
intensity  and were considered by  [CONTACT_625696] y related to study  drug.
One serious adverse event (SAE), transient atrial fibrillation, occurred in a single patient 
during the first portion of the study after receiving [ADDRESS_833537] was admitted overnight to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], treated with metoprolol and 
subcutaneous heparin and spontaneously  converted to sinus rhy thm. No further epi[INVESTIGATOR_625672] s of monitoring, or after discharge. The 
investigator considered the event to be of moderate intensity  and possibl y related to study 
drug. The patient was subsequently  evaluated in a cardiology  clinic, with no etiology  
identified for the resolved bout of atrial fibrillation. 
For all cohorts, the majority  of AEs experienced by  [CONTACT_625697] (SOCs) Nervous Sy stem Disorders, 
Gastrointestinal Disorde rs, and Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (MedDRA 
v. 13.1). Headache, nausea, pain in jaw, and vomiting were the most commonly  reported 
preferred terms. There were no deaths reported in the study .
APD811 appears to be associated with a vasodi latory  effect at lower doses, and reflex 
tachycardia at higher doses. These hemod ynamic effects were not limiting for dose 
escalation. These observations are consistent with the expected pharmacology  of APD811 
and are also consistent with observations for other I P agonists.
Intensive ECG monitoring was undertaken in this study  to better understand possible e ffects 
of APD811 on QT interval and to evaluate risk for QT effects . APD811 in the dose range 
administered in this study  is not likely  to be associated with QT prolongation. Mean ∆∆QTcF 
was below [ADDRESS_833538] levels achieved, approximately
10ng/mL, with an upper bound of the 90% CI below 10 msec, the threshold of regulatory  
concern.
Results of the pharmacokinetic measuremen ts of APD811 demonstrate that the median time 
to reach maximum plasma concentration (t max) for APD811 was similar between doses and 
occurred betwe en 1.[ADDRESS_833539] -dose. The half -life of APD811 was consistent across 
doses and was between 20.5 to 26. 4 hours. The apparent oral clearance (Cl/F) was low 
compared to hepatic blood flow. The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) was moderate 
(~2-fold that of total body  water). Clearance and volume of distribution were dose 
independent.  
APD811- 004 was conducted as an open- label, randomized, single dose, two -treatment 
crossover stud y to assess the pharmacokinetic properties of APD811 at a dose of 0.03mg in

3.1 Overall Study  Design and Plan
APD811- 003 will be conducted as a 22 week, randomized ,double -blind , placebo controlled
study  which will include a dose titration period of up to 9 weeks. An additional transition 
period of 3 weeks ( ±1 week) will occur for those patients who elect to enroll into the open -
label extension study , APD811- 007. Patients that do not continue in the extension study  will 
have a 3-week follow -up visit. Patients will be randomized 2:1 active to placebo. 
Approximately  60 patients with PAH will be enrolled. At the end of the treatment period, all 
patients that choose to continue in the open- label extension study  (OLE: APD811 -007) will 
remain on study  treatment until the follow -up visi t at Week 25. This visit will serve as the 
baseline visit for the open- label extension study  if the patient is eligible and chooses to 
participate (see Figure 2). Patients who do not choose to participate in the OL E will 
discontinue treatment at the end of the treatment period.
Safety  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_301186] y Monitoring Committee (SMC) as documented in the 
SMC Charter. The SMC will review safety  data in cluding adverse events, blood pressure and 
heart rate periodically  during the dose titration period and the treatment period , in order to 
ensure patient safet y and determine an appropriate dose titration regimen.

All patient s will undergo screening procedures within 28 day s of dosing.
All patients will receive doses of APD811 according to the dose titration scheme outlined in 
Section 5.6. The dose titration will take up to 9weeks. After dose titration is completed, 
patients will enter a treatment period where the opti mal (i.e. maximally  tolerated) dose of 
APD811 will be continued. The schedule of procedures and visits for the dose titration period 
and the treatment period are provided in Table 1and Table 2, respectivel y.
The SMC will review safety  and tolerability  and recommend any  changes to the dose titration 
scheme.

individual differences in tolerability  of APD811 in healthy  volunte ers, consistent with 
findings with other prostacy clin rece ptor agonists. 
Twice dail y dosing and dosing after meals is being employed in this study to decrease peak -
to-trough variability and maintain exposure, as these may  be important in minimizing 
adverse events while maintaini ng activity  at the IP receptor. A ph ase 1 study  demonstrated 
that a high fat meal increased t maxfrom ~1 to 4 hours and decreased C maxby ~ 30% while 
preserving total drug exposure (AUC).

5.6.1 Dose Titration Period ( up to 9Weeks)
There will be a total of approximately  60 patients randomized to either active treatment or 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio. The starting dose is 0.01 mg APD811 twice dail y (b.i.d.) or placebo. 
Thus, the identity  of study  drug (active or placebo) will be blinded, but the dose level is not. 
Patients will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_833578] -dose PK sample will be collected 
at each study  visit in which dose escalation is planned . Adverse events, blood pressure, and 
heart rate will be monitored during the observation period. The observation period may  be 
extended based on the judgment of the investigator. If deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093], 
the patient may  be monitored as an in -patient for the initial dose and/or subsequent increases 
in dose. The medical monitor should be notified in any instance that prolonged observation 
and/or in -patient monitoring is anticipated or required.
If a dose is not tolerated, the study  drug may be decreased to the previous dose level. If the
initial dose of 0.01 mg b.i.d. is not tolerated, dosing may  be decreased to 0.01 mg q.d.
If the initial dose is tolerated (0.01 mg b.i.d.), the dose will be increased in the following 
fashion at subsequent visits: 0.02 mg b.i.d., 0.03mgb.i.d., 0.04 mg b.i.d., 0.06 mgb.i.d., 
0.08mgb.i.d., 0.1 mg b.i.d., 0.2mgb.i.d and 0.3 mg b.i.d .The dose may  be escalated to a 
maximum total daily  dose of 0.6 mg (0.3 mg b.i.d.) de pending on tolerability . 
Prolonged dosing may  result in tolerance to some adverse effects and thus, more than [ADDRESS_833579] possible dose within the 9- week dose titration period. If a particular 
dose is not tolerated, treatment may be reduced to a previous dose as directed by  [CONTACT_1275]. The dose may  be decreased for safety  reasons at any  time , but may  not be
increased without assessment in the clinic.
Table 3indicates the dosing regimen during the 9-week dose titration period. This dosing 
regimen (starting dose, dose increments, dosage forms, duration) may  be modified during the 
course of the stud y by [CONTACT_301186] y Monitoring Committee based on cumulative patient 
experience. In order to simplify  dose titration, the 0.[ADDRESS_833580] dose tolerated prior to Week 9, and no additional dose

will include the following members: at least 2 phy sicians, representing expertise in clinical 
care of patients with PAH, and expertise in drug development; and abiostatistician. The 
SMC will oversee the safe conduct of the trial, and in particular, guide dose titration in order 
to determine a suitable scheme to achieve the optimal dose within the 9 -week titration period 
while maintaining patient safet y. Based on review of safet y and tolerability information, the 
SMC may  recommend a higher starting dose , differe nt dose increments (escalation scheme), 
different dosage strengths, and/or duration.

analyzed according to the Centralized ECG Procedure Manual.   
6.5.3 ECG Acquisition
The safet y ECG equipment will be set according to the procedure manual . The operator will 
enter certain patient demographic information prior to obtaining the ECG. Every  attempt will 
be made to ensure that patient ECG readings throughout the stud y will be obtained from the 
same machine. Patient information will be entered into the machine according to the ECG 
procedure manual and may  include the following:
•Patient initials (examp le: XYZ or X -Z)
•Patient identifier (screening and/or randomization number)
•Patient gender
•Patient date of birth ( DDMMMY YYY)
•Study  day and time
ECGs will be recorded with patient s in the r ecumbent position and resting. Patient s will have 
been in this rest ing position for 10 minutes prior to ECG recording and performed prior to 
any blood draw that occurs at the same time point.
In case of baseline tremor, measures will be taken to eliminate this as it may interfere 
significantl y with the quality  of the interpretation. Prior to electrode placement, the 
anatomical sites will be prepared to allow for proper skin/electrode interface. Patient s with

6.7 WHO/NYHA  Functional Class A ssessment
PAH will be classified according to a sy stem originally  developed for heart failure b y the 
[LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) and then modified by  [CONTACT_38375] 
(WHO) for patients with PAH.12The severity of PAH will be graded according to the 
functional status of the patient and assessed at every  visit. The grades range from Functional 
Class (FC) I, where the patient's disease does not affect their day -to-day activities, to FC I V, 
where patients are severely  functionall y impaired, even at rest (see Appendix 2 ). 
The same Investigator or designee should complete the WHO/NYHA functional class 
evaluation at the patient’s first visit and for the duration of the study when possible. See 
Appendix [ADDRESS_833594] a repeat screening RHC.
The following values will be obtained and recorded: PAP (systolic, diastolic, and mean), 
HR,right atrial pressure (RAP), pulmonary  capi[INVESTIGATOR_275402] ( PCWP ) right 
ventricular pressure (RVP) and car diac output (CO) , pulmonary  vascular resistance (PVR),

Confidential6.9 Assessment of Clinical Worsening
The Investigator will evaluate the patient for potential clinical worsening throughout the 
study . If clinical worsening is suspected, additional clinic evaluations may  be required to 
make a final dete rmination as to whether clinical worsening has been met. Clinical worsening 
is defined as one of the following:
•Death, or onset of treatment-emergent AE with a fatal outcome occurring less than or 
equal to 14 day s after study  treatment discontinuation; or
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_468311] -lung or lung transplant, or atrial septostomy ; or,
•The patient requires the addition (or change in dose if applicable) of an y of the 
following PAH specific medications:
-Prostacy clin/prostacy clin analogue (intravenous, subcutaneous, oral or 
inhaled) 
-Phosphodiesterase t ype-[ADDRESS_833596], or
•The combined occurrence of the events listed below. 
-A decrease in 6MWT b y at least 20% from Baseline, confirmed on two 
6MWTs, on different days; and
-Increase (worsening) in WHO/NYHA FC from Baseline; and
-Appearance of or worsening of signs/sy mptoms of right heart failure that did 
not respond to optimized or al diuretic therap y.
In cases of clinical deterioration, the investigator must assess carefully  if the deterioration of 
the patient’s condition (e.g. worsening functional class) is related to the underlying 
pulmonary  hypertension or can be explained by  [CONTACT_625702] (e.g. transient infection, 
musculoskeletal disease, surgical or medical intervention other than PH related, exacerbation 
of a concomitant lung disease, lacking compliance of medication intake). Only  persistent 
clinical deteriorations cau sed by  [CONTACT_625703], will be considered clinical worsening.
Transient deteriorations of clinical status requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], treatable by , for example, 
short -time application o f intravenous diuretics, positive inotropic agents or non -invasive 
ventilation and allowing patients discharge within 48 hours, are not considered to meet the 
criteria for clinical worsening. Patients should be discontinued only  if an y of the above 
criteri a exceed 48 hours.
Patients who meet the criteria for clinical worsening should be discontinued from study  drug, 
and should undergo procedures for early  termination . Patients who meet the criteria for 
clinical worsening donot qualify  for entry  into the extension study  APD811 -007 with the 
exception of placebo -treated patients.

6.13 Adverse Events A ssessments
AEs will be recorded and reported in accordance with I CH Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
The definitions of AEs and SAEs will be as given in the I CH Topic E2A, ICH Guideline 
“Note for Guidance on Clinical Safety  Data Management: Definitions and Stand ards for 
Expedited Reporting.” 
6.13.1 Adverse Event Reporting
Patient s will be instructed that they  may  report AEs at any  time . AEs will be regarded as 
‘pre-treatment’ if they  occur between Screening and the time of administration of the first 
dose of APD 811.All events reported following study medication administration will be 
recorded as treatment emergent AEs ( TEAE ).
Monitoring of AEs will be contin ued up to [ADDRESS_833602] udy medication administration. In 
the event that an AE is not resolved or stabilized by  [CONTACT_159753], the sponsor in consultation 
with the investigator will decide whether to continue to monitor the AE or close -out the event 
in the d atabase if no further follow -up is necessary .
For this study , an AE is defined as: “Any  untoward medical occurrence in a study  patient
administered an y dose of study  medication (APD 811or placebo) and which does not 
necessarily  have to have a causal rela tionship with this treatment.” An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, 
or disease temporally  associated with the use of the study  medication, whether or not related 
to the product. Worse ning of underl ying disease (section 6.9) will not be considered to be an 
adverse event .
AEs can be an y of the following:
•Unfavorable changes in general condition
•Subjective or objective signs/s ymptoms
•Concomitant disease or accidents
•Clinically  relevant adverse changes in laboratory  parameters observed in a patient in 
the course of a clinical study

Confidential•Pre-existing conditions which worsen in severity  or frequency  or which have new 
signs/sy mptoms associated with them
Adverse event s will be elicited at the time indicated in the schedule by  [CONTACT_244330]: 
“Since you were last asked, have you felt unwell or different from usual in any  way ?”Any 
adverse or unexpected events, signs and s ymptoms, will be fully  recorded on the Adver se 
Event Form including details of intensity , onset, duration, outcome and relationship to the 
drug as determined b y the PI .Whenever possible, a constellation of signs and sy mptoms 
should be recorded as a unify ing diagnosis (e.g., self -limited fever, runn y nose, cough, and 
scratch y throat should be captured as an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_625675] s ymptoms). AEs may also be reported at an y time. The ty pe and 
duration of follow -up of patient s after AEs will be documented.
6.13.2 Serious Adverse Events and Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event ( SAE )is an y untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose results 
in the following outcomes:
•Death
•Is Life -Threatening
•Require d/Prolong edHospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
•Disability /Incapacit y
•Congenital A nomal y/Birth D efect
•Important Medical Event
SAEs will be captured from the time of screening to 30 days after the dose of study  drug, and 
will be monitored until resolution or stabilization.
An important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227334] a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this d efinition. Examples of such a medical event includes allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or surgery  for clearl y pre-existing conditions (for example a 
surgery  that has been scheduled prior to the patient’s entry  into the study ) will not be 
reported as a SA E. All other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], including e lective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_625676] -existing, will be reported as a SAE.  
All SAEs, whether or not considered related to study  treatment, must be reported to the 
sponsor Contact [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. In addition, a completed 
report using the sponsor ’s SAE form must be submitted within 24 hours of notification to:

Other situations as defined in I CH Topic E2A, 21 CFR§ 312.32, 
and EU Volume 10 also 
qualify  for expedited reporting . In these situations the process will be as detailed for SAEs 
above:
•Serious adver se events which could be associated with the trial procedures;
•Serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest that could materially  
influence the benefit- risk assessm ent of a medicinal product, such as: a clinically  
important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed 
in the investigator brochure.
Patient s who become pregnant during the stud y will be discontinued immediately. Although 
not considered a SAE or AE, pregnancies occurring during the period of st udy drug

partners who become pregnant by  [CONTACT_625705] , 
reasonable efforts will be made to collect information on the partner’s pregnancy  through the 
first well bab y visit as provided by  [CONTACT_625706] .
6.13.3 Assessment of Adverse Event Severity
The severit y of each AE will be assessed at onse t by a nurse and/or phy sician. When 
recording the outcome of the AE the maximum severity  of the AE experienced will also be 
recorded. The severit y of the AE will be graded according to the CTCAE v4.0323definitions,   
listed below:

Confidential7 STUDY ACTIVITIES
7.1 Screening Visit (Days -28 to -1)
At the initial screening visit, potential patient s will have a detailed oral presentation of the 
nature, purpose, risks, and requirements of the study  in addition to receiving detailed written 
information. They  will have adequate opportunit y to ask the appropriate person of the clinical 
staff (i.e., principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461]) presenting the study  about any aspect of the 
study . Once the patient is satisfied that he/she is willing to participate in the study , he/she 
will be asked to sign the study  ICF. The clinical personnel obtaining written consent from the 
patient will also sign the form to confirm consent has been obtained. Once signed, the 
investigator will retain the original for the patient’s study  records and provide the patient
with a signed cop y. The investigator will verify  that informed consent has been obtained 
from each patient prior to admission into the study  and prior to the patient undergoing any  
study -related procedures. If it is standard practice at the site to conduct a few general non -
invasive study procedures (i.e., medical /social history , collection of concomitant 
medications, etc. ) before a patient can be considered for a specific study ,the study  center 
must have a written SOP detailing the procedure ,and also ensure that each patient signs a 
general consent prior to undergoing the general procedures.
A unique patient screening number will be assigne d upon completion of the ICF.
Within 28daysbefore administration of the study  medication, or sooner, all screening 
activities subsequent to obtaining informed consent will be conduc ted and consist of the 
following :

9.4 Analysis Populations
The anal yses of all efficacy  variables will use the modified intent to treat (MITT) population 
as primary . The completers population will be used as a secondary  anal ysis population.
Modified Intent -to-treat (MI TT) Population:
This population consists of all patients randomized who received at least one study dose, 
have a baseline measurement, and have a post- randomization measurement. Under this 
appro ach, patients are counted in the treatment group to which they  were randomized, 
regardless of the treatment received during the course of the trial.  
Completers Population:
This population consists of all patients that completed the study.  No missing dat a will be 
imputed for this analy sis. Any  substantial differences between conclusions based on the 
MITTpopulation and the completers population will be investigated.
Safety  Population:
This population will include all randomized patients who received study medication.
9.5 Statistical Methods
9.5.1 Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Variables
APD811 plasma concentrations are limited to pre -dose (C min) and 4hours post -dose.
APD811 plasma stead y-state will be determined by  [CONTACT_259572] C minvalues over time and the 
resultant slope tested for its difference from zero. 
APD811 will be administered in the trial as a liquid- filled, hard -gelatin capsule formulation 
provided as 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.10 mg dose strengths.   
Individual APD811 plasma concentrations at specified time points will be listed for each 
patient by [CONTACT_1570]. I ndividual plasma concentration -time points of APD811 will be 
plotted on both a linear and a semi -logarithmic scale for each dose level. 
9.5.2 Statistical Analyses of Efficacy Measuremen ts
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary  endpoints are listed below:
Change from baseline in PVR after 22 weeks of treatment
Change from baseline in 6 MWD after 22 weeks of treatment .
Page 62 of 80
APD811 Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol : APD811 -003, Amendment [ADDRESS_833632], the statistical significance of APD811 versus placebo 
result will be determined for the change from baseline in PVR at the end of 22 weeks of 
treatment. If the result is significant (p < 0.05, two -sided), the primary  hypothesis will be 
considered satisfied and this study  will be declared positive.  Subsequently , the change from 
baseline in 6MWD will only  be tested if the change from baseline in PVR is significant.  This 
testing procedure preserves the o verall Ty pe I error rate for testing the primary  efficacy  
hypothesis.
An anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline PVR as a covariate and treatment 
and baseline WHO/NYHA functional class as factors will be used to assess the effect of 
APD811 on change from baseline in PVR . Missing values will be imputed using the last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Assumptions for the anal ysis of covariance will 
be checked, and if not satisfied, parametric anal yses will be corroborated with nonparametr ic 
analyses or with appropriate data transformations if necessary  (i.e., log transformation) .
Six minute walking distance (6MWD) will be analy zed using the above ANCOVA method 
described for PVR, substituting the relevant baseline measurement as the covaria te.Missing 
values will be imputed with last observation carried forward, except if an y patient withdraws 
early due to death or due to clinical worsening without a 6MWT being measured at a 
termination visit, a worst value of 0 for 6MWD will be imputed.
Note that testing for secondary  and exploratory  endpoints will proceed only if the 
comparison for the change from baseline in PVR is significant.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints are listed below:
Percent change from baseline in PVR after 22 weeks of treatment
Proportion of patients who progress to clinical worsening
Thepercent change from baseline in PVR will be anal yzed using the above ANCOVA 
method described for change from baseline in PVR . Missing values will be imputed using the 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) method.  For the proportion of patients who 
progress to clinical worsening , the effect of APD811 will be compared to placebo using a 
logistic regression model with model with terms for treatment and baselin e WHO/NYHA
functional class.

9.5.3 Safety An alysis
All patient s who receive study  medication will be evaluated for safet y.Safety  and tolerability  
will be assessed b y a review of all safet y parameters including adverse experiences (AEs), 
laboratory  safet y parameters, vital signs, and ECG. S ummary  tabulations (N, mean [or 
median], SD, mean [or median] change/per cent change) will be obtained for the safet y 
parameters. Adverse experiences will only  be pr esented as summary tabulations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
All baseline patient characteristics of demographic data (age, height, weight, race), social 
history  (smoking status, caffeine intake, alcohol intake), medical history  (abnormalities 
only), physical examination (abnormalities only ), and concomitant medications at study  entry  
will be listed for all patients. Demographic data will be summarized and tabulated. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using number of observations (n) , mean, standard 
deviation (SD) ,median, minimum, and maximum. Frequencies and percentages will be 
report ed for all categorical data.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the most current Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  
Activities (MedDRA) and tabulated, including categorical information of interest such as 
onset and resolution times, time of onset relative to dose, severit y at onset, maximum 
severit y, causal relationship to study medication, and action taken. AEs will be regarded as 
‘pre-treatment’ if they  occur between Screening and the time of administration of the first 
dose of APD811. 
Allother AEs that occur after the first dose of study  medication will be listed by  [CONTACT_625710] y and relationship to study medication.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations

clinically  significant change from baseline may be recorded as an AEif deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_10157] .
9.6 Multiplicity
The principal evaluation of the efficacy  of APD811 will be based on testing the primary  
hypotheses for PVR and 6MWD.  The testing procedure specified in the Statistical Methods 
section preserves the overall Ty pe 1 error rate for testing the primary  hypotheses. 
Comparisons involving other efficacy endpoints and time points are considered supportive or 
exploratory  and will be made at α=0.050 level (two- sided). No multiplicity  adjustment will 
be made for these other comparisons.

Walk Test. www.atsjournal.org
Location
The 6MWT should be performed indoors preferably , along a long, flat, straight, hallway with 
a hard surface that is seldom traveled. The walking course must be 15-[ADDRESS_833652] and same pair 
of shoes.
Safety Issues
1. Testing should be performed in a location where a rapid, appropriate response to an 
emergency  is possible. The appropriate location of a crash cart should be determined b y 
the phy sician supervis ing the facility .
2.Supplies that should be available include ox ygen, sublingual nitroglycerine, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], and 
albuterol (eg, a beta agonist by  [CONTACT_625712]). A telephone or other 
means should be in place to enable a call for help.
3.The t echnician should be certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation with a minimum of 
Basic Life Support and American Health Association -approved cardiopulmonary  
resuscitation course (or equivalent) . Advanced cardiac life support certification is 
desirable. Training, experience, and certification in related health care fields (registered 
nurse, registered respi[INVESTIGATOR_77538], certified pulmonary  function technician, etc) are 
also desirable. A certified individual should be readily  available to respond if needed.
4.Physicians are not required to be present during all tests. The phy sician ordering the test 
or supervising a laboratory  physician may  decide whether phy sician attendance at a 
specific test is required.
Reasons for immediately stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 6MWT include the following: (1) chest pain, (2) 
intolerable d yspnea, (3) leg cramps, (4) staggering, (5) diaphoresis, and (6) pale or ashen 
appearance.
Technicians must be trained to recognize these problems and the appropriate responses. If a 
test is stopped for an y of these reasons, the subject should sit or lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_625689]’s assessment of the severit y of the 
event and the risk of s yncope.
Equipment in the Vicinity
1. O 2saturation equipment + forehead pro bes.
2.Countdown timer or stopwatch.
3.Mechanical lap counter.

APD811 Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Clinical Trial Protocol : APD811 -003, Amendment [ADDRESS_833653] (cane, walker, etc).
4.The subject’s usual medical regime n should be continued and study  drug taken in the 
morning before the commencement of the 6MWT.
5.A light meal is acceptable before earl y morning or earl y afternoon tests.
6.Subjects should not have exercised vigorously  within [ADDRESS_833654].
Mea surements
1.Repeat testing should be performed about the same time of day  to minimize intra -day 
variability .
2.A “warm -up” period before the test should not be performed.
3. The subject should sit at rest in a chair, located near the starting position, for at lea st 
[ADDRESS_833655] (ie, starting location, length of hallway , direction the subj ect will be 
walking, time of test, subject’s general condition/feeling on the day  of the test, and an y 
other phy sical or medical information that may  potentially  influence the results of the 
test).
4.Subjects who require supplemental ox ygen must breathe a st able ox ygen dose for at least 
15minutes prior to the measurement of SpO2 and until the end of the 6MWT (see below 
for SpO2 requirements). It is critical that if oxy gen was utilized during the Screening 
6MWTs, that it be utilized during all subsequent on- study  tests and that it is delivered in 
the same manner with the same flow .Note whether the oximeter signal quality  is 
acceptable.
5. Set the lap counter to 0 and the time to 6 minutes. Assemble all necessary  equipment (lap 
counter, timer, worksheets, etc. )and move to the starting point .
6. Instruct the subject as follows:
The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for [ADDRESS_833656]. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you will be exerting yourself. 
You w ill probably get out of breath or become exhausted. You are permitted to slow

Clinical Trial Protocol : APD811 -003, Amendment [ADDRESS_833657] without hesitation. Now I’m going to show you. 
Please watch the way I turn without hesitation.
Demonstrate b y walking one lap yourself. Walk and pi[INVESTIGATOR_113988] a cone briskly.
Are you ready to do that? I am going to use this counter to keep track of the number of 
laps you complete. I will click it each time you turn around at this starting line. 
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE for 6 minutes, but don’t run 
or jog.
Start now or whenever you are ready.
7.Position the subject at the starting line.   You should also stand near the starting line 
during the test. Do not walk with the subject. As soon as the subject starts to walk, start 
the timer.
8.Do not talk to anyone during the walk.  Use an even tone of voice when using the 
standard phrases of encouragement.  Watch the subject.  Do not get distracted and lose 
count of the laps.  Each time the participant returns to the starting line, click the lap 
counter once (or mark the lap on the worksheet).  Let the participant see y ou do it. 
Exaggerate the click using bod y language, like using a stopwatch at a race.
After the first minute, tell the subject the following (in even tones): You are doing well. 
You have [ADDRESS_833658] the following: Keep up the

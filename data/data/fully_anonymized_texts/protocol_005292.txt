1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_814956]  (sLea) conjugated  to keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  
(KLH)  plus the immunological  adjuvant  QS-21. Eligible  patients  include  those  with metastatic

IRB Number: 06 -156 A(4)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1128156] no evidence  of disease  or stable  disease  on hormone  therapy.  Initially  3 
patients  will be entered  at a lower  dose (10 mcg)  of sLea. If safe, [ADDRESS_1128157] an immune  response  at any time point  
then an additional  10 patients  will be accrued  and injected  with a higher  dose of QS-21. 
 
Injections  will be administered  subcutaneously  during  weeks  1, 2, 3, 7 and 19. Prior  to and during  
therapy, blood samples will be obtained to assess immune response. 
 
The primary  endpoints  of this trial are safety  and immune  response.  Clinical response  will be 
monitored  but will not be a primary  endpoint.  A secondary  endpoint  is the evaluation  of blood  
samples  for circulating  tumor  cells.  
 
2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND  SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
 
The primary  objectives  of this trial are to determine  the following  endpoints  after injection  with 
sLea-KLH  plus QS-21: 
 
• Safety  
 
• The IgG and IgM antibody  response  to sLea  and breast  cancer cells expressing  
this antigen  
 
The secondary  objective  of this trial is to monitor  the presence  of circulating  tumor  cells (CTC)  
prior to, during  and after injection  with sLea-KLH  plus QS-21. 
 
Clinical  response  will be monitored  but will not be an endpoint.  As part of standard  care,  patients  
on this trial will be followed  for progression  of disease.  It is unknown  how many  patients  will 
enroll  with evidence  of disease.  Therefore,  we will report  any responses  that are observed  for 
these  patients  in a purely  descriptive  manner  (see section12).  This is consistent  with the pi[INVESTIGATOR_814957].

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1128159] cancer cells include the gangliosides GM2 and  
Globo  H5,  blood  group -related  antigens  TF, sTn, Lewis  y (Ley)  6 and the protein  MUC17. 
 
3.2.1  Keyhole  Limpet  Hemocyanin   (KLH)    Various  methods  have been used to increase  
the immunogenicity  of antigens,  in particular  to induce  an IgG response.  The approach  
that [CONTACT_814989]  and colleagues  have found  to be most successful  at inducing  an 
IgG response  against  the closely  related  T antigen  in the mouse  has been covalent  
attachment  to keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  (KLH).   KLH  is an immunogenic  protein  
which  is derived  from  the blood  of the keyhole  limpet.  This approach  also resulted  in 
anti-T antigen  delayed  type hypersensitivity  reactions  and partial  protection  against  
cancer  cells expressing  T antigen.  [ADDRESS_1128160] shown  that in a variety  of experimental  systems,  T-cell (not 
related  to T antigen)  unresponsiveness  is more  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_814958] B cell unresponsiveness  .9 Levels  of circulating  antigens  suitable  for 
maintaining  T-cell tolerance  frequently  fail to maintain  B cell tolerance.  Consequently  
if T-cell help is provided  (as by [CONTACT_814970]),  antibodies  can be induced  to tolerated  T-cell 
dependent  antigens.  This approach  has been successfully  used to induce  IgG 
antibodies  against  a variety  of carbohydrate  antigens,  and the titer of antibody  induced  
is greatly  augmented  with the use of immunological  adjuvants.10 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Conjugationof antigens  to KLH  can be accomplished  using  a direct  method  
or with a  bifunctional  linker  MMCCH  (M2C2H):  (4-(4-N-maleimidomethyl)  
cyclohexane -1-carboxyl  hydrazide.  This latter  method  of conjugation  was 
developed  to improve  the antigen  epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]:KLH  ratio.[ADDRESS_1128161]  cancer  patients

various  constructs  containing  the adjuvants  DETOX,  BCG  and QS21  or no adjuvant  at 
all. QS-21 was a significantly  more  effective  adjuvant  than the others,  producing  
significantly  higher  titer IgM and IgG antibodies.14   A dose of 100 mcg of QS-21 was 
found  to be minimally  toxic  and immunogenic.  15  Therefore,  QS-21 was selected  for 
- 5 - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 06 -156 A(4)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1128163] cancer patients to assess the safety and immunogenicity of various 
single  antigens  conjugated  to keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  (KLH)  and mixed  with the 
immune  adjuvant  QS21.  Antigens  included  the peptide  MUC -1 and the carbohydrates  
Globo-H, GM2 and STn[clustered] (protocol numbers 94-130, 95-67, 97-123, 99-023). 
These immunizations were well-tolerated with the most common toxicities including 
transient  local  skin reactions  at the injection  site and mild flu-like symptoms.  Although,  
there  were  no definite  autoimmune  reactions  attributable  to the injection,  several  patients  
developed  hypothyroidism  or hyperthyroidism.  The majority  of patients  developed  IgM 
and IgG antibody  titers  reactive  with the immunizing  antigen.  There  were  no significant  
differences  in the immune  response  observed  among  patients  with no evidence  of disease  
or those with stable disease. No definite T cell responses were elicited in the MUC-[ADDRESS_1128164] 
containing  7 antigens  conjugated  to KLH  and mixed  with either  QS21  or GPI-0100  (a semi- 
synthetic  saponin).21-23  The injections  were  well tolerated  with common  local  skin reactions  
and mild flu-like symptoms.   Several  patients  receiving  GPI-0100  developed  a transient  
Grade  1-3 elevation  in the hepatic  enzymes  (AST,  ALT).   Following an extensive  hepatic  
evaluation, it was felt that the GPI-[ADDRESS_1128165]  cancer

with infiltrating  ductal  carcinoma  it was found  in about  79% of samples.[ADDRESS_1128167] cancer. It contains 
four antigens  expressed  on mucins  (MUC1,  Tn, sTn and TF) and three  antigens  expressed  
as glycolipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]  (GM2,  globo  H and Lewis  Y). There  are advantages  to glycolipid  antigens  
including greater  susceptibility  to activation  of complement  in the presence  of antibodies  
and greater induction of complement medicated cytotoxicity, as recently described.24a  We 
have recently learned that Lewis Y is poorly immunogenic, inducing antibodies in fewer 
than 30% of vaccinated  patients.  If sLea  proves  immunogenic  in this trial, we plan to 
replace Lewis Y in the polyvalent construct with sLea.

3.5 Evaluation  of Circulating  Tumor  Cells  (CTC)  
 
Circulating  tumor  cells (CTC)  can be detected  in the blood  from  patients  with var ious 
primary  or metastatic  carcinomas.  25-[ADDRESS_1128169] reported  that the presence  of CTC  predicted  shortened  disease  free and overall  
survival times.  These  studies  demonstrate  that detection  of CTC  correlates  with prognosis  
at baseline  and that changes  in CTC  levels  during  and after treatment  may be more  
predictive  than other  measures.  30-34  Monoclonal  antibody  based  therapy  (trastuzumab)  
with or without  additional  chemotherapy  was particularly  effective  at eliminating  CTC.  
This was associated  with improved  disease  free and overall  survival.[ADDRESS_1128170] identified  CTC  in approximately  95% of breast  cancer  patients  with 
Stage  I/II disease  prior to surgery.35,26. After  resection  of all known  disease,  30% of 
patients  continued  to have CTC  that persisted  for at least [ADDRESS_1128171] 
30% of these  patients  will have demonstrable  CTC.  
 
In this study,  CTC  will be evaluated  in an exploratory  manner  to determine  whether  they 
can be detected  in this patient  population  at baseline  and if so whether  there  is evidence

chromatography  and the purity  established  to be greater  than 99% by [CONTACT_814973].  
 
The pentenyl  glycoside group  on sLea  was bound  to M2C2H  heterobifunctional  linker  
following  ozone  treatment.  Keyhole  limpet  hemocyanin  (KLH)  was activated  by 
[CONTACT_814974] 2-Iminothiolane.  Activated  
KLH  was mixed  with sLea-M2C2H  and the resulting  sLea-M2C2H -KLH  purified  and 
washed  by [CONTACT_814975].  The carbohydrate  and protein  components  were  quantitated  and 
the conjugate was tested for toxicity and immunogenicity in mice. The sLea/KLH ratio 
was determined  to be greater  than 600/1.  The dose of sLea-KLH   to be studied  is [ADDRESS_1128175] six of the ten patients,  then in the 
second  group  of patients,  an additional  50 mcg of QS-21 will be added  to the preparation  
during  weeks  1, 7 and 19. 
 
5.1.3  The injection  will contain sLea-KLH  conjugate  30 mcg ([ADDRESS_1128176] 3 
patients)  and QS-21 100 mcg per 1 ml 0.9%  saline.  It will be stored  at -80°. The total

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by a memb er of the patient‟s treatment  team,  the 
protocol  investigator,  or research  team  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC).   If 
the investigator  is a member  of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patient‟s medical  records  
for suitable research study participants and discuss the study and their potential for enrolling in  
the research  study.   Potential  subjects  contact[CONTACT_301030]/research  staff of the study.  
 
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_500744] a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be eligible  
to enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  [CONTACT_695051].  
 
During  the initial conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and the patient,  the patient  
may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary to the recruitment and 
- 10 - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 06 -156 A(4)  
Approval date: 24 -Sep-2018   
  
 
enrollment  process.   The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical  
records  at MSKCC  in order  to further  assess  eligibility.   They  will use the information  provided  
by [CONTACT_17491]/or  medical  record  to confirm  that the patient  is eligible  and to contact  [CONTACT_814977].   If the patient  turns  out to be ineligible  for the research  study,  
the research  staff will destroy  all information  collected  on the patient  during  the initial  
conversation and medical records review, except for any information that must be maintained for 
screening  log purposes.  
 
In most cases,  the initial  contact  [CONTACT_46444],  investigator  or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  team.  
The recruitment process outlined presents no more than minimal risk to the privacy of the patients 
who are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log.  For these  
reasons,  we seek a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization  for the purposes  of (1) reviewing  
medical  records  to identify  potential research  subjects  and obtain  information  relevant  to the 
enrollment  process;  (2) conversing  with patients  regarding  possible enrollment;  (3) handling  of 
PHI contained  within  those  records  and provided  by [CONTACT_41907];  and (4) maintaining  
information  in a screening  log of patients  approached  (if applicable).  
 
Patients  will be recruited  for this protocol  primarily  by [CONTACT_814978].  In addition,  patients  
outside  of MSKCC  may be aware  of this trial from  other  patients,  their local doctors  or the National  
Cancer  Information  Center.  
 
Once  a patient  has indicated  an interest  in participation,  he/she  will be referred  to one of the 
consenting  physicians  for further  evaluation  and discussion  of informed  consent.  If the patient  is 
determined  to be eligible,  he/she  will be registered  according  to standard  MSKCC  policy.  
 
Most  patients  with breast  cancer  are female,  but male patients  will not be excluded.  Children  are 
excluded  from  participation  in this study  since  breast  cancer  is rare in this patient  population  and 
therefore  toxicity  analysis  would  be of questionable  significance.

10.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION 
 
The study  evaluation  will include  parameters  to assess  the safety  of the injections  as well as 
assessments  of immunity  to sLea  (Appendix  A). Interval safety  assessments  will include the „Patient  
Diary‟ (Appendix  B). Patients  will be provided  with Appendix  A and B. Long  term followup  will 
also be maintained  to assess  toxicity.  Although  not a primary  endpoint,  patients  will be monitored  
for any evidence  of an anti-tumor  effect.  Imaging  to assess  extent  of disease  will be performed  at 
baseline,  then as appropriate  for clinical  circumstances.  Patients  with metastatic  disease  are often  
evaluated  with imaging  every  [ADDRESS_1128187]  of care.  Clinical benefit  will also be assessed  
by [CONTACT_814979].

100ml  of heparinized  blood  may be drawn  once (during  weeks  9-23) during  the course  of 
immunizations  depending  on the serologic  response  in individual patients,   at the 
principal  investigators  discretion,   for evaluation  of the immune  response  at the clonal  
level  by [CONTACT_814980].

10.2 Immunologic  Res ponse  
 
Serological  response :  Three  [ADDRESS_1128190]  sLea  in ELISA  and/or  immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_332] -western  blot 
assays.  These  assays  detect  antibodies  against  sLea  and confirm  identity  of the reaction.  If 
serologic  reactivity  is detected,  then additional blood  (~10ml)  may be drawn  at later  
times  after the injections  are completed  to determine  the duration  of this response  (every  
3 months  if feasible).   An extra  100ml  of heparinized  blood  may be obtained once during  
the course  of immunizations  depending  on the serologic  response  in individual  patients  at 
the principal investigators  discretion,  for hybridoma  production.   This will be used for 
evaluation  of the B-cell response  to vaccination  at the clonal  level by  [CONTACT_814981].  This will be performed in collaboration with MabVax 
Therapeutics, Inc., (San Diego, CA).  It will make possible more detailed analysis of the 
most immunogenic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_814959]. 
 
T cell response  will not be evaluated  since  this is a carbohydrate  antigen  and significant  T 
cell response  is not anticipated.  The immune  response  analyses  will be conducted  in the 
laboratory  of [CONTACT_814989]  under  [CONTACT_814991] ‟s supervision.  
 
10.3 Circ ulating  Tumo  r Ce ll M e thodo  logy 
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_814960]  (EpCAM)  is used to concentrate  ciruclating  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_814961]  a 7.5 ml peripheral  blood  specimen.  A semi-automated  
system  called  CellSearch,  uses EpCAM  antibody -based  immunomagentic  capture  of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_814962] (CTC).  
Immunomagnetically  captured  CTCs  are stained  and enumerated  using  specially  
prepared  buffers  and three  immunofluorescent  markers:  DAPI  [INVESTIGATOR_814963]; Cytokeratin-PE to detect epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]; and CD-45-APC to detect 
leukocytes. CTCs are defined as DAPI(+), CK-PE(+) and CD-45(-) cells. Digitally 
archived  images  of candidate  CTCs  meeting  these  criteria  also must meet  standardized  
morphologic   inspection.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
In our earlier  breast  cancer  immunization  trials,  common  toxicities  included  local skin reactions  
at the injection  sites,  flu-like symptoms  (ie, fever,  fatigue,  myalgias, arthralgias),  and less 
frequent  symptoms  such as pruritis,  rashes,  diarrhea,  nausea  and vomiting.  These  symptoms   
were  transient  and usually  of less than 5 days duration.  In addition,  minimal  transient  decreases  
in hematologic  values,  primarily  white  blood  cell counts  and lymphocyte  counts  were  noted.  It is 
unlikely that these  fluctuations  were  due to the vaccine.  Transient  elevation  in various  laboratory  
values  (ie glucose,  liver enzymes)  were  observed  and also thought  unrelated to the vaccine.  
 
Since  the antigen  in this injection  is present  on the surface  of normal  tissues,  the theoretical  
possibility  of a serious  autoimmune  reaction  exists.  In our previous  breast  cancer  trials,  there  
was no consistent  evidence  of an autoimmune  reaction  due to the immunization.  Several  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_814964].  Patients  were  
subsequently  treated  with radioactive  I-[ADDRESS_1128191] therapy.  
 
In addition, no definite evidence of autoimmunity has been observed in immunization trials in 
prostate  or ovarian  cancer  at MSKCC  (personal communication  with [CONTACT_294642]  and [CONTACT_814992]).  Autoimmune  reactions  may be controlled  by [CONTACT_814982]- 
inflammatory  medications.  The symptoms  would  be dependent  on the organs  involved.  These  
may include but are not limited to diarrhea, dyspnea, numbness, weakness, vaginal bleeding, 
inflammation  of the breast  or pancreas  and blood  in the stool.  This autoimmunity  is considered  
unlikely however,  since  cytotoxic  T-cells and antibodies  against  various  antigens  found  on 
breast  cancer  cells have been recognized  in the peripheral  blood  of patients  with breast  cancer in 
the absence  of any evidence  for autoimmunity.  Some  patients  have also demonstrated  baseline  
antibody  titers  against  various  antigens  used in our prior trials.  
 
In MSKCC  protocol  01-[ADDRESS_1128192] and 
ALT levels (grade 1-3) were observed. The finding was though t to be due to the GPI-0100 and we 
do not anticipate  this toxicity  on this trial using  QS-21. 
 
The rare possibility  of allergic  reaction  exists  (ie wheezing,  hives,  fevers,  chills,  dyspnea).  
 
In prior immunization  trials,  moderate  local discomfort  at injection  sites and flu-like symptoms  
were  observed  with QS-21 at the 200 mcg dose.  The 100 mcg dose was found  to be effective  with 
minimal toxicity.  We do anticipate  significant  toxicity  with the higher  dose of QS-21 (150 mcg).  
The only expected  toxicity  of KLH  is local injection  site reaction.  
 
Grade  III or greater  local or systemic  toxicity  will result  in removal  of the patient  from  the study.  
Grade  II or greater  toxicity  of autoimmune  etiology  will result  in removal  from  the study.  Grade  II 
or greater  allergic  toxicity,  excluding  a fever  or flushing,  will result  in removal  from  the study.  
However,  patients  who develop  a fever  > 38 degrees  Centigrade,  thought  to be due to the vaccine,  
will be monitored  for 60 minutes  in the Immunology  Unit following  the next vaccination.  
 
Any patient removed  from  the study  due to toxicity  will result  in suspension  of the study  pending  
further  investigation  and discussion  with the CBER  IND review  team.   In that case,  if mutually  
agreed  on, the trial may resume  at the 10mcg  sLea dose,  if that was well tolerated.  Patients  will be 
counseled  to avoid  pregnancy.

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
The primary  endpoints  of this trial are toxicity  and immunologic  response.  Patients  will have 
baseline  imaging  studies  to assess  the extent  of the disease.  However,  patients  will not routinely 
undergo  followup  imaging  studies  unless  felt to be appropriate  by [CONTACT_814983].

12.[ADDRESS_1128195] response  criteria  as follows:  
 
Complete  Response  (CR):  
Target  Response  Criteria:  The disappearance  of all known  disease  and no new sites or 
disease  related  symptoms  confirmed  at least [ADDRESS_1128196] be assessed,  including  non-measurable  sites,  such as effusions,  or markers  
Non-Target  Response  Criteria:  Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and normalization  of 
tumor  markers  level confirmed  at least 4 weeks  after initial documentation.  
 
 
Partial  Response  (PR):  
- 16 - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 06 -156 A(4)  
Approval date: 24 -Sep-2018   
  
 
Target  Response  Criteria:  At least a 30% decrease  in the sum of the longest  diameters  of 
target  lesions,  taking  as a reference  the baseline  sum of the longest  diameters  confirmed  at 
least 4 weeks  after initial documentation.  PR is also recorded  when  all measurable  disease  
has completely  disappeared,  but a non-measurable  component  (i.e., ascites)  is still present  
but not progressing.  
 
Stable  Disease  (SD):  
Target  Response  Criteria:  Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify for partial  response  nor 
sufficient  increase  to qualify  for progressive  disease.  
Non-Target  Response  Criteria:  Persistence  of one or more  non-target  lesions  and/or  the 
maintenance  of tumor  marker  level above  the normal  limits.  
 
 
Progressive Disease (PD): 
Target  Response  Criteria:  At least a 20% increase  in the sum of the longest  diameters  of 
target  lesions,  taking  as reference  the smallest  sum of the longest  diameters  recorded  since  
the treatment started;  or the appearance  of one or more  new lesions;  or the unequivocal  
progression  of a non-target  lesion.  
Non-Target  Response  Criteria:  Appearance  of one or more  non-target  lesions  and/or  
unequivocal  progression  of existing  non-target  lesions.  
 
13.1 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY 
 
Cessation  of tre atment  
 
Therapy  may be discontinued  at any time due to severe  unacceptable  side effects,  dose- 
limiting  toxicities  as defined,  life-threatening  events,  patient‟s non-compliance  with the 
defined  treatment  plan, the patient  becomes  pregnant  or the patient‟s request to withdraw  
consent.  
 
With  evidence  of recurrent  disease  or progression  of disease,  the patient‟s primary  
physician  will be notified  immediately  by [CONTACT_442437].   The decision  
regarding  optimal  therapy  will be made  by [CONTACT_814984].  The 
patient  may continue  on study  if the patient‟s primary  physician  feels it is acceptable  and 
the only change  in therapy  is hormone  therapy.  
 
The following dose limiting toxicities as evaluated during weeks 1-21 will result in 
cessation  of treatment:  
• Grade  2 or greater  autoimmune  reactions  
• Grade  2 or greater  allergic  reactions  (excluding  isolated  fever and/or  flushing)  
• Grade  3 or greater  toxicity  of any kind (excluding  grade  3 lymphopenia)  
 
If any of these  toxicities  occur,  no additional  patients  will be treated  except  
following  mutual  agreement  after discussion  with the CBER  IND review  team.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1128197]  cancer.   If immune  responses  are observed  at  
the 100 mcg level  of QS-21 then QS-21 will be escalated  to the 150mcg  level. 
 
The immunization  schedule  comprises  five injections  administered  during  weeks  1,2,3,7  and 19. 
The primary endpoint of this trial is to evaluate immunological response to this single antigen and 
evaluate toxicity. Immunological response for a patient is defined as an antibody response of 
greater  than 1:[ADDRESS_1128198] an immune response at any time point then an additional 10 patients may  
be accrued  and receive  sLea-KLH  plus QS-21 (at 150mcg)  during  weeks  1, 7 and 19. This sample  
size is chosen  to minimize  the total number  of patients  who need  to be immunized  to identify  a 
promising  agent  with a probability  of an immunological  response  greater  than 50% in a series  of 
immunization trials. The error rates of missing a promising agent or selecting a nonpromising 
agent  are set to be at most 10%.[ADDRESS_1128199]  in future  studies.  
 
Severe toxicities are not anticipated. Toxicities will be tabulated according to the NCI C TC 
version  3.0. Any grade  3 or greater  toxicity  (excluding  grade  3 lymphopenia)  or grade  2 or greater  
allergic/immunologic  toxicity  (except  isolated  fever  and/or  flushing)  will result  in removal  of the 
patient  from  the study.  Since  the above  listed  toxicities are unexpected,  any event  of this sort will 
result  in suspension  of the study  pending  further  investigation.    Descriptive  statistics  summarizing  
the antibody  responses  will be provided  for each patient.  The length  of the study  will be 
approximately  1-2 years.  
 
Circulating  tumor  cells (CTC)   will be evaluated  in an exploratory  manner  to determine  whether  
CTC  can be detected  in this patient  population  at baseline  and if so whether  there  is evidence  of a 
decline  in those  patients  who have an immune  response.  
 
Severe toxicity is not anticipated. Frequencies of all toxicities will be recorded. We plan to accrue 
approximately  1-2 patients  per month  and therefore  accrual should  be completed  in 10 months.

16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data.   Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be 
monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential problems will be brought to the 
attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
 
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362],  
at a minimum  of  two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data and  Safety Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_127149]  2001.   The plans  address  the new policies  
set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National Cancer  Institute  for Data 
and Safety  Moni toring  of Clinical  Trials” which  can be found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html .    The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].   The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: 
http://mskweb2.msk  cc.org/irb/index.htm  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_211148],  safety  and 
quality.   There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  
research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional 
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials  programs.   The 
committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and 
the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase III clinical  trials,  report  to the Center‟s 
Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its level 
of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g. NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the 
monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

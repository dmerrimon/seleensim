Title A Phase 2, Multicenter, Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo-controlled, 
Parallel-group, Study to Investigate the Safety and Tolerability of 
Multiple Dose Administration of CSL112 in Subjects with Moderate 
Renal Impairment and Acute Myocardial Infarction    
Study Number CSL112_2001  
Sponsor CSL Behring LLC  (CSLB) 
Development Phase  [ADDRESS_347956] CSL112 (Reconstituted High Density Lipoprotein)  
Indication  Reduction of early recurrent atherothrombotic events in acute myocardial 
infarction patients (ST segment elevation myocardial i nfarction [STEMI] 
or non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) who are 
at high risk of subsequent events.  
Study Summary  CSL112 drug product resembles nascent high density lipoprotein (HDL). It is a novel formulation of apolipoprotein A- I (apoA-I), 
phosphatidylcholine (PC), and cholate; and is stabilized by [CONTACT_285018]. 
CSL112 is being developed for the reduction of recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The premise of the 
CSL112 mechanism of action and the resulting treatment strategy is that 
infusion of apoA -I after the index ACS event, and during the subacute 
period after the event, will reduce the size and/or instability of 
atherosclerotic plaque, thereby [CONTACT_285019] a recurrent CV event in patients with AMI .  
Renal impairment (RI) is a prevalent and increasingly common 
concurrent condition in patients with AMI . Patients who experience an 
AMI event are at high risk for a recurrent CV event and mortality is 
inversely related to renal function status: subjects wit h mild, moderate, 
and severe RI have, respectively, progressively poorer long -term 
prognosis as compared with patients with normal renal function. As the number of AMI  patients with RI is relatively high (~15 % to 30%) 
(Gibson et al, 2004; Fox et al, 2010), the identification of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284978].  
This study is a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to investigate the safety and tolerability of up to 4 weekly intravenous (IV) administrations of 
CSL112 compared with placebo in subjects with moderate RI ( estimated 
glomerular fitration rate [ eGFR] ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347957] contains sucrose as a stabilizer. Administration of 
sucrose by [CONTACT_285020] (AKI) attributed to osmotic nephrosis when immune globulin 
intravenous (IGIV) products formulated with sucrose were administered 
at high doses or high rates of administration  (Epstein and Zoon, 2000 ). 
Thus, evaluation of the renal safety of CSL112 is warranted, specifically in the subpopulation of patients with moderate RI who have experienced 
a recent AMI event. No renal safety concerns were identified in the 4 
completed CSL112 phase 1 and 2a studies, including a phase 1 
multicenter center, double -blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single-
dose phase 1 study in adult subjects with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and in healthy adult subjects with normal renal 
function (eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Study CSL112_1001). In 
addition, a phase 2b study (Study CSLCT- HDL-12-77), a multicenter, 
randomized, placebo- controlled study to investigate the hepatic and renal 
safety and tolerability of multiple dose administration of 2 IV infusion 
regimens of CSL1 12 versus placebo in approximately 1200 subjects with 
acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was initiated in the third quarter of 
[ADDRESS_347958] ( DSMB) has reviewed safety 
and pharmacokinetic ( PK) data from the Active Treatment Period after 
5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% of subjects were enrolled, and recommended the study continue without change. Data are not yet 
available for this study. Further evaluation of the safety and tolerability 
of multiple dose administration of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI 
and AMI are warranted before inclusion of this population in a phase [ADDRESS_347959] experienced a recent 
AMI. The occurrence of clinically important renal serious adverse events 
(SAEs) as reported by [CONTACT_285021].  In 
subjects with moderate RI who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the occurrence of AKI as defined by [CONTACT_285022] (AKIN) criteria is approximately 10% ( Tsai et al, 
2014
). After excluding subjects with evidence of AKI  at screening , the 
occurrence of renal SAEs and AKI will be assessed in this post- AMI 
moderate RI patient population.    
Primary Objective(s)  To assess the renal safety of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI and 
AMI after  administration of  up to 4 weekly infusions of CSL112.  
Primary Endpoint(s)  Co-primary endpoints of the incidences of treatment- emergent: 
1. Renal SAEs, defined in Section 2.1.2  
2. AKI, defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µmol /L) during the Active Treatment 
Period that is sustained upon repeat measurement by [CONTACT_64295] l 
 Study Number :  CSL112_2001_Am1

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347960]-077 Confidential  laboratory no earlier than 24  hours after the elevated value . If no 
repeat value is obtained, a single serum creatinine value that is 
increased from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) during the Active 
Treatment Period would also fulfil the definition of AKI.  
Treatment -emergent is defined as occurring at or after the start of the first 
infusion. Baseline for determination of AKI is defined as the pre-infusion 
central laboratory serum creatinine level on Study Day 1. 
Secondary Objective(s)  Secondary objectives of the study are:  
1. To further characterize the safety and tolerability of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI and AMI.    
2. To characterize the PK of CSL112 after multiple dose administration in subjects with moderate RI and AMI. 
Secondary Endpoint(s)  Secondary safety and tolerability endpoints include:  
1. The occurrence of any treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) 
throughout the study 
2. Occurrence of treatment- emergent adverse drug reactions or 
suspected adverse drug reactions defined as:  
a. All TEAEs, inc luding local tolerability events, that begin 
during or within [ADDRESS_347961] (CSL112 or placebo), or  
c. All TEAEs for which the Investigator's causality assessment is 
missing or indeterminate, or  
d. All TEAEs for which the incidence in an active treatment arm exceeds the exposure-adjusted incidence rate in the placebo arm by 30% or more, provided the difference in incidence 
rates is 1% or more.  
3. Changes from baseline ( ie, pre-infusion on Study Day 1)  through to 
the end of the Active Treatment Period  in renal status de
fined as: 
a. Absolute increases from baseline in serum creatinine as 
follows: 
i. ≤ baseline value  
ii. > 0 to < 0.3 mg/dL 
iii. ≥0.3 to ≤0.5 mg/dL 
iv. > 0.5 mg/dL 
b. Increases in serum creatinine that are sustained for

i. ≥ 1.5 x baseline value  
ii. ≥ 2 x baseline value 
iii. ≥ 3.0 x baseline value 
iv. serum creatinine ≥  4.0 mg/dL (353.6 µmol/L)   
c. Initiation of renal replacement therapy 
d. Decrease in eGFR ≥ 25% from baseline starting during the  
Active Treatment Period and that is sustained at the final 
study visit  
4. Change from baseline ( ie, after infusion on Study Day 1) in hepatic 
status that occurs during the Active Treatment Period  and that are 
sustained for ≥ 24 hours upon repeat measurement as follows: 
a. Alanine aminotran sferase (ALT) > 3 x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) 
b. ALT > [ADDRESS_347963] 
c. ALT > [ADDRESS_347964]  
d. Serum total bilirubin > 1.[ADDRESS_347965] (Note: For subjects with a 
history of Gilbert’s syndrome, this assessment will be based 
on indirect bilirubin.) 
e. Serum total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_347966] (Note: For subjects with a history of Gilbert’s syndrome, this assessment will be based 
on indirect bilirubin.) 
f. Possible Hy's Law cases, as defined in the FDA Guidance for 
Industry: Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation ( July 2009 ; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for definition of 
Hy’s Law ) 
5. The occurrence of treatment -emergent bleeding events as defined by 
[CONTACT_196561] (BARC) criteria 
(Mehran et al, 2011 )
 from start of the first infusion until the end of 
the Safety Follow -up Period. 
6. Clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory test results 
(serum biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), physical 
examination findings, body weight, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and 
vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature). 
7. The occurrence of binding antibodies specific to apoA -I and/or 
CSL112. 
Secondary PK endpoints include: 
1. Baseline (ie, pre- infusion on Study Day 1)-corrected plasma apoA -I

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347967] is expected 
to be approximately 9 weeks. This estimation is based on:  
• a 5-day Screening Period  
• a 4-week Active Treatment Period  
• a 4-week Safety Follow -up Period  
The overall study duration ( ie, first subject’s screening visit to last 
subject’s end of study visit) is estimated to be approximately [ADDRESS_347968] 18 years of age with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 and 
< 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, as calculated by [CONTACT_91019]-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908]). Subjects 
must also have evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting 
consistent with a type I (spontaneous) AMI as defined by [CONTACT_716]: 
• Detection of a rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin I or T with at least 
1 value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit.  
AND, 
• Any 1 or more of the following:  
− Symptoms of ischemia 
− New (or presumably new) significant ST/T wave changes or left 
bundle-branch block (LBBB) 
− Development of pathological Q waves on ECG 
− Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality  
− Identification of intracoronary thrombus by [CONTACT_285023], the subject  must be 
clinically stable, have hepatic function tests within acceptable limits, and 
have documented evidence of stable renal function and no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_284979] [ADDRESS_347969] 
administration that is increased < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre-contrast 
administration value.  
If the local laboratory post- contrast serum creatinine value is increased  
> 0.3 mg/dL from the pre-contrast administration value, the laboratory 
test may be repeated once at least [ADDRESS_347970] be increased  < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre-contrast 
administration value and there must be no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_284980] (Table 7).

1.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON CSL112 
1.1.1 Overview 
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening condition, that most commonly occurs 
when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures or erodes , leading to thrombus formation within a 
coronary artery. A thrombus within a coronary artery can result in unstable angina (UA), a myocardial infarction (MI [ ie, heart attack ]) or sudden death. Even after recovery from an 
acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_284982], patients continue to be at heightened risk. The short- term morbidity 
and mortality associated with both the index coronary event and recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events can be as high as 20% per year (Fox et al, 2006), and are inversely related to 
renal function status, such that subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment (RI) have progressively poorer long -term prognosis as compared with patients with normal 
renal function  (Gibson et al, 2004; Fox et al, 2010). In patients with ACS and RI, the 
prognosis, both short- and long-term, is worse than for those with normal renal function, as 
the risk of CV events and mortali ty is inversely proportional to the estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR [ Nabais et al, 2008; Bhandari and Jain, 2012]). Therefore, the 
identification of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284983]. 
Renal impairment is a prevalent and growing concurrent condition in ACS and acute 
myocardial infarction (AMI). Among 13,[ADDRESS_347979]-
Segment Elevation A cute Coronary Syndrome Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 
(NSTE-ACS TIMI) trials, 37.2% of patients had normal renal function (GFR ≥ 90 
mL/min/1.73 m
2), 47.1% of patients had mildly impaired GFR (GFR ≥ 60 to < 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2), and 15.1% of patients had moderately impaired GFR (GFR ≥ 30 to <60 
mL/min/1.73 m2 [Gibson et al, 2004]). In a more recent analysis of 49,491 AMI patients from 
the US-based National Cardiovascular Data Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention 
Outcomes Network (ACTION) Registry, which collects data from 280 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284984]:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_347980]-077 Confidential  patients with a primary diagnosis of MI (either non -ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction [NSTEMI] or ST segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]) who 
presented within 24 hours of the onset of an ischemic syndrome, approximately 30.5% of 
patients had Stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD, ie , moderate RI [ Fox et al, 2010]). Given 
the growing prevalence of RI in patients with AMI coupled with the subsequent heightened 
risk of recurrent CV events in this population, identification of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284985].    
High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol exerts a protective effect in experi mental models 
of atherosclerotic CV disease. The proposed mechanism(s) for the atheroprotective properties 
of HDL are multifaceted ( Remaley et al, 2008; Tardif et al, 2009). High density lipoprotein is 
believed to bring about beneficial effects mainly by [CONTACT_285024], whereby 
[CONTACT_285025]. This removal of cholesterol is mediated by [CONTACT_285026], 
apolipoprotein A- I (apoA-I, Tall, 1998).    
CSL112 is a novel formulation of apoA-I purified from human plasma and reconstituted to form HDL particles. It is being developed for use in patients with AMI  for the reduction in 
risk of recurrent CV events via the action of apoA -I. Apolipoprotein A- I is the active 
component of CSL112 and other components include phosphatidylcholine ( PC), sodium 
cholate, and sucrose. Additional information about the disposition of components of administered CSL112 can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for CSL112.

intravenous (IV) infusion of 1-hour duration, a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 
300 mg/kg was established in both the rat and cynomolgus monkey. In the repeat dose studies (CSL112 administered once every 3 days for 4 weeks by 2-hour IV infusion), a NOAEL of 
80 mg/kg was established in the rat; however, a NOAEL was not established in the

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347982] dose tested 
(80 mg/kg). No treatment- related deaths occurred in any of the toxicity studies.  
After IV administration of CSL112 to both rats and monkeys, the primary toxicological effects were hepatic and hematologic in nature. The effects were generally reversible, 
asymptomatic, and exhibited a moderate dose-response relationship. Some minor effects on 
renal parameters were also observed; however, as there were no correlative histopathology 
findings in the kidney, the toxicological significance is unclear.  
Further details on the hepatic and hematologic effects  in the nonclinical studies , as well as 
other observations with CSL112, can be found in the IB for CSL112. 
1.1.3 Previous C linical Experience  
CSL112 has been evaluated in 2, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1, 
healthy adult, non- Investigational New Drug ( IND) studies conducted in Australia 
(CSLCT-HDL-09-63 – Single Ascending Dose [SAD] study; CSLCT -HDL-10-68 – Multiple 
Ascending Dose [MAD] study) and 1 multicenter center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single-dose phase 1 non- IND study in adult subjects with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 
and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
2) and in healthy adult subjects with normal renal function (eGFR ≥ 
90 mL/min/1.73 m2) (Study CSL112_1001) conducted in [LOCATION_013] and the [LOCATION_008]. 
Study CSL112_1001 was initiated in the second quarter of 2015, enrolment was completed as of [ADDRESS_347983] visit occurred on 15 February 2016. This study 
was conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetic ( PK), safety, and tolerability of CSL112 in 
adult subjects with moderate RI and in age, gender, and weight matched healthy adult subjects with normal ren al function. The primary objective of the study was to assess the 
effect of moderate RI on the PK of CSL112. Subjects were randomized 3:1 active to placebo within a cohort (4 cohorts total: [ADDRESS_347984] cohorts at 2 
different d oses, each with 8 subjects). Twenty-four subjects received 1 infusion of CSL112 in 
this study, 12 with normal renal function and 12 with moderate RI. Based on Data and Safety Monitoring ( DSMB) review of PK and safety data from 12 moderate RI subjects recei ving

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347985]-077 Confidential  either the CSL112 2 g or 6 g dose, the 6 g dose has been selected for the current study. Data 
from the Active Treatment Period  are available and demonstrate an acceptable safety profile 
of a single dose of CSL112 in adult subjects with moderate RI (Section 1.3). The rationale for the 6 g CSL112 dose based on PK data from this phase 1 study is presented in Section 3.2. 
In addition, a phase 2a IND study (CSLCT -HDL-10-70a) has been conducted in subjects 
diagnosed with stable atherothrombotic disease; in essence, the AMI target population after  
their initial acute presentation. The phase 2a subjects were representative of the target phase 3 
population in age, sex , concurrent medical conditions (eg, diabetes, hypertension) and 
chronic concomitant medications (eg , dual anti- platelet therapy, statins)  and were stratified 
by [CONTACT_254488] (ie, normal renal function or mild RI). The goals of the phase 2a study were 
to evaluate the comparability of the PK and safety profile in patients with stable 
atherothrombotic disease as compared to that of h ealthy adults and to evaluate a range of 
doses to be administered in future CSL112 clinical studies in AMI  patients who are at high 
risk of subsequent CV events.  
A total of 126 subjects ( 93 healthy adults , including 12 with moderate RI, and 33 patients) 
have received at least 1 dose of CSL112 in 4 completed studies. The results of the phase 1 
and 2a studies showed acceptable safety, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of CSL112 
across a range of doses  and renal function groups. 
A phase 2b study (Study CSLCT-HDL-12-77) was initiated in the third  quarter of [ADDRESS_347986] quarter of 2016. It is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled 
study to investigate the hepatic and renal safety and tolerability of multiple dose 
administration of 2 IV infusion regimens of CSL112 (low [2 g] and high dose [6 g]) versus 
placebo in approximately 1200 subjects with acute myocardial infarction  (AMI). Subjects are 
stratified by [CONTACT_254488] (normal renal function [eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m
2] or mild RI 
[eGFR ≥ 60 and < 90 mL/min/1. 73 m2]). The study consisted of a Safety Lead -in Period, 
during which subjects received a single 2-hour infusion of CSL112 (2 g) or placebo , followed 
by [CONTACT_1030], during which subjects rece ive four 2-hour infusions of inves tigational

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347987] (CSL112 low [2 g] or high dose [6 g] or placebo), a minimum of [ADDRESS_347988] visit occurred on 21 March 2016. Based on a randomization ratio 
(CSL112:placebo) of 2:[ADDRESS_347989] 1 infusion of CSL112 in the phase 2b  study. To date, 
the program level DSMB has reviewed safety and PK data from the Active Treatment Period  
after 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% of subjects were enrolled, and have recommended the 
study to continue without change. Data are not yet available for this study. Further details 
regarding the phase [ADDRESS_347990] resembles nascent HDL. It is a novel formulation of apoA-I, PC, and 
cholate; and is stabilized by [CONTACT_285018]. CSL112 is being developed for the reduction of 
recurrent CV events after  AMI. The premise of the CSL112 mechanism of action and the 
resulting treatment strategy is that infusion of apoA -I after the index AMI  event, and  during 
the subacute period after  the event, will reduce the size and/or instability of atherosclerotic 
plaque, thereby [CONTACT_285027] a recurrent 
CV event in patients with AMI.  
Renal impairment (RI) is a  prevalent and increasingly common concurrent condition in 
patients with AMI. Patients who experience an AMI event are at high risk for a recurrent CV 
event and mortality is inversely related to renal function status: subjects with mild, moderate, and severe RI have, respectively, progressively poorer long -term prognosis as compared with 
patients with normal renal function. As the number of AMI  patients with RI is relatively high 
(~15% to 30%) ( Gibson et al, 2004; Fox et al, 2010), the identification of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284986]:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_347991]-077 Confidential  safe and effective in these patients would represent an important advancement in medical 
therapy. 
This study is  a phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, study to i nvestigate the safety and tolerability of up to 4 weekly IV 
administration s of CSL112 compared with placebo in subjects with moderate RI (eGFR ≥ 30 
and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and AMI.  
CSL112 drug product contains sucrose as a stabilizer. Administration of s ucrose by [CONTACT_285028] (AKI) attributed to osmotic 
nephrosis when immune globulin intravenous (IGIV) products formulated with sucrose were 
administered at high doses or high rates of administration ( Epstein and Zoon, 2000). Thus, 
evaluation of the renal safety of CSL112 is warranted, specifically in the subpopulation of patients with moderate RI who have experienced a recent AMI event. Although no renal 
safety concerns were identified in the completed CSL112 phase 1 and 2a studies (n=126 total 
subjects treated with CSL112: 96 with normal renal function, 15 with mild RI , and 15 with 
moderate RI ), further evaluation is warranted before  the inclusion of AMI patients with 
moderate RI in a phase [ADDRESS_347992] experienced a recent AMI. The occurrence of clinically important renal serious adverse 
events (SAEs) as reported by [CONTACT_285029], defined as an  increase in serum

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347994]-077 Confidential  1.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
The Development C ore Safety Information  document (appended to the IB for CSL112) 
outlines the potential risks to subjects administered CSL112 and precautions for its use.  
The most frequently reported AEs in completed clinical studies of CSL112 included: Infusion 
Site Pain, Infusion Site Swelling, Infusion Site Induration, Infusion Site Erythema, Infusion 
Site Coldness, Injection Site Phlebitis, Catheter Site Phlebitis, Infusion Site Haematoma, 
Injection Site Haematoma, Vessel Puncture Site Haematoma, and Vessel Puncture S ite 
Haemorrhage. Headache was also frequently reported in these studies. Events related to injection or infusion site reactions, local tolerability events related to bruising  (coded to a 
Preferred Term [PT] Haematoma in the Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities  
[MedDRA ]), and Headache were reported more frequently in subjects who received CSL112 
as compared with placebo. Most of these events were mild and transient. Adverse events (AEs) reported within other System Organ Classes (SOCs) occurred with similar frequency in 
the placebo and active treatment groups across the [ADDRESS_347995] dose published in the 
literature associated with pote ntial nephrotoxicity ( Anderson and Bethea, 1940). CSL112 has 
been reformulated such that the maximum dose of sucrose to be administered in this study is approximately 2.5-fold less than this lowest single dose of sucrose that was associated with 
histopathologic changes in the kidney but without clinical evidence of nephrotoxicity. In 
addition, the maximum infusion rate for CSL112 of 6 g/2 hour (50 mg/min) ensures a sucrose 
infusion rate of ≤ 1.7 mg sucrose/kg/min for a 50- kg adult, which is well within the published 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1

Final V2.[ADDRESS_347996]-077 Confidential  guideline for safe administration of sucrose containing IGIV products ( Epstein and Zoon, 
2000).  
In the completed phase 1 and 2a clinical studies with CSL112, no clinically significant 
elevations (> 3 x upper limit of normal [ ULN]) in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) or 
alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) have been reported in [ADDRESS_347997] treated with a single 135 mg/kg dose of CSL112 in the SAD study 
experienced a transient elevation in total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_347998] at a single time point. No AEs 
were reported in association with this laboratory finding. Two subjects with moderate RI 
treated with CSL112 6 g in Study CSL112_1001 had treatment-emergent non- serious AEs of 
“Blood B ilirubin Increased” for transient elevations at a single time point on Study Day 2 
(maximum of 1.[ADDRESS_347999]). One subject with normal renal function treated with CSL112 6 g 
in Study CSL112_1001 had an elevation in total bilirubin to > 1.[ADDRESS_348000] at a single time point on Study Day 2 that was not reported as a treatment- emergent AE  
(TEAE). In the phase 2b study (Study CSLCT- HDL-12-77), 2 reports of serious liver 
dysfunction (L iver Disorder and H epatic Function Abnormal ) have been received as of 
[ADDRESS_348001] was considered as meeting Hy’s Law criteria. These cases were reviewed by 
[CONTACT_285030], and the DSMB determined that the study 
may continue without modification. A thorough panel for hepatic assessment has also been 
incorporated into the protocol and the study will be conducted under oversight by [CONTACT_285031]. 
No SAEs were reported in the SAD or MAD phase [ADDRESS_348002] (pain in right shoulder [due to loosened osteosynthesis plate], injury

of a TEAE.  
In the phase 2b study (Study CSLCT- HDL-12-77), as of [ADDRESS_348004] by [CONTACT_737] ( Pharyngeal Oedema 
[[ADDRESS_348005]], Hepatic Function Abnormal [2 subjects], Gastrointestinal Haemorrhage 
[[ADDRESS_348006]]). Eight subjects had [ADDRESS_348007] by [CONTACT_737] (Pneumonia, Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_60064], Cardiac Arrest, Pneumothorax, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Hypoxic Ischemic 
Encephalopathy; Septic Shock; Basal Ganglia Haemorrhage; Cerebral Haemorrhage, Brain Metastatic Cancer; Cardiac Failure [2 events]; Shock Haemorrhagic, Multiple Organ 
Dysfunction Syndrome; Cardiac Aneurysm, Pulmonary Embolus, and Death).  On 21 
December  2015, based on review of safety and PK data after 75% of subjects had completed 
the Active Treatment Period , the program level DSMB determined that there were no 
significant safety or PK concerns and recommended that the study continue under the current 
protocol without modification. 
The risk of viral and prion contamination is a feature common to all biologic agents where 
the manufacture involves the use of materials of animal or human origin. CSL112 may carry 
a risk of transmitting infectious agents ( eg, viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease agent) because it is made from human blood. However, the risk of infectious agent transmission has been reduced by [CONTACT_285032], testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and including virus 
inactivation / removal steps in the manufacturing process.  
There is potential for allergic reactions or hypersensitivit y to CSL112 in certain individuals, 
given the constituents of the product. CSL112 consists of apoA-I isolated from human plasma 
that may contain immunoglobulin A (IgA) and also contains PC derived from soy beans. 
Therefore, subjects with a positive history of IgA deficiency, antibodies to IgA, or allergy to 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348008]-077 Confidential  either soy bean or peanuts will be excluded from the study. In addition, study level stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284987] . 
It is the central premise of the CSL112 program that infusion of apoA-I via reconstituted 
HDL will provide therapeutic benefit to patients with AMI. Based on the previous clinical 
data, the dose of CSL112 selected for use in this study  should raise cholesterol efflux 
capacity by a meaningful amount. The increase in cholesterol efflux capacity of blood plasma 
may enable the acceptance of excess cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaque. The resulting 
reduction in plaque cholesterol should render the plaques more stable and less  likely to 
rupture. This and other purported apoA- I related actions may translate to a reduction in the 
subacute risk of cardiac ischemia and recurrent CV events in patients with AMI.  
Thus, the associated benefit risk assessment of the study is acceptable for subjects enrolled in 
the study. 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 PRIMARY O BJECTIVE AND ENDPOINT  
2.1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is  to assess the renal safety of CSL112 in subjects with 
moderate RI and AMI after administration of up to 4 weekly  infusions of CSL112. 
2.1.2 Co-primary Endpoint s 
The renal safety profile of CSL112 in subjects with moderate RI and AMI who receive up to 4 weekly administrations of CSL112 will be assessed by [CONTACT_3252]-primary endpoints of the 
incidences of treatment -emergent (1) renal SAEs as defined below, and (2) AKI, defined as 
an absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmo l/L) during the 
Active Treatment Period  that is sustained upon repeat measurement by [CONTACT_285033] 24 hours after the elevated value.  If no repeat value is obtained [due, for

Ongoing eligibility for all subsequent infusions of investigational product will be confirmed 
before administration of each subsequent dose. Eligibility for continued administration of 
investigational product will be based on the criteria presented in Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Table 8. 
Each infusion should be completed as close to the protocol- specified visit schedule as 
possible, ie , no fewer than 7 days and no more than 10 days between each infusion. An 
infusion may be skipped or delayed at the discretion of the Investigator if more time is 
necessary to confirm renal function stability or to evaluate and treat an AE before the next

• Provide recommendations to CSL  surrounding study conduct matters that affect safety . 
• Review the safety data at the planned interim safety reviews (see Section  10.3.4) and 
identify if significant safety  concerns arise during the study. 
• Review all available data if 1 or more of the study level stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284989] (see Section 
3.6.2) 
• Review PK data and any other data that may affect  subject or study continuation. 
• Make recommendations regarding study progression. 
In order to ensure that a safety signal has not emerged that would affect the conduct of the 
study, the DSMB will review safety data after every [ADDRESS_348033] 60 subjects  (approximately 75% of 
subjects) complete Visit 5. In addition , the independent DSMB will have interim safety 
reviews when: (1) approximately 25% of subjects have completed the Active Treatment 
Period (Visit 7), (2) approximately 50% of subjects have completed Visit 5, and ( 3) 
approximately 50% of subjects have completed the Active Treatment Period  (Visit 7).  
If any of the safety criteria as specified in the DSMB charter are met at these reviews, continuation of the study without alteration should be questioned as it may be an early 
indication of an unacceptable safety profile in the broader population. The DSMB may 
recommend a change to the protocol to ameliorate any safety concerns  or provide 
recommendations regarding subsequent dosing and/or study progression/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284990].

based on local laboratory values before each infusion according to the continuing infusion 
eligibility criteria presented in  Section [IP_ADDRESS], Table 8.  
Each infusion should be completed as close to the protocol- specified visit schedule as 
possible, ie , no fewer than 7 days and no more than 10 days between each infusion, with all 
4 infusions administered within 30 days from Study Day 1 (Visit 2). An infusion may be 
skipped or delayed at the discretion of the Investigator if more time is necessary to confirm 
renal function stability or to evaluate and treat an AE before the next infusion 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]). If an infusion is skipped or delayed for a medical or safety reason, the 
medical monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and the remaining infusions should be completed as 
close to the protocol-specified visit schedule as possible. 
4.1.[ADDRESS_348059] Completion, Study Treatment Discontinuation and 
Withdrawal from Study  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Completion  
The study will be considered completed when either the pre- specified study completion is 
reached (all randomized subjects either complete Visit 8/Study Day 60, have withdrawn from 
the study, or have been lost to follow-up) or the study is terminated early based on 
recommendation of the independent DSMB and endorsement by [CONTACT_40972].  
Subjects for whom infusions of investigational product have been discontinued early should 
complete early termination procedures (Visit 7) and should be encouraged, if consent is not 
withdrawn , to continue follow-up for safety  as specified through Visit 8 (Schedule of 
Assessments). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Completion  
A subject will be considered as having completed the study if he or she has completed 
Visit 8.

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348060] follow -up visits as 
specified by [CONTACT_990] ( Schedule of Ass essments).  
If a subject is unwilling or unable to return for scheduled on- site follow-up visits, sites should 
attempt to collect as much visit information as possible, through telephone conta ct, registered 
mail contact, contact [CONTACT_285045], or use  of publically available information. 
This latter source may be the only available option for subjects who withdraw consent during 
the study (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). All efforts should be made to confirm vital status at a 
minimum.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Treatment Discontinuation  
Subjects may request at any time that further investigational product administration be 
discontinued, or it may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator or 
CSL Behring LLC ( CSLB) for safety, behavio ral or administrative reasons ( eg, due to an AE, 
protocol deviation, or study termination). The reason for early discontinuation of 
investigational product should be documented in the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Investigator always has the option to advise a subject to stop 
further administration of investigational product if the subject's safety or well-being is compromised by [CONTACT_285046]. Concern for the 
interests of the subject m ust always prevail over the interests of the study.  
If a subject prematurely discontinues study treatment and if consent is not withdrawn, every effort should be made to inform the subject of the importance of continuing in the study to 
ensure that the relevant follow -up safety assessments of Visit 7 ([ADDRESS_348061] 
infusion) and Visit 8 (at least [ADDRESS_348062] infusion) are performed ( Schedule of 
Assessments). If only [ADDRESS_348063] discontinuation,

determine continuing eligibility ; see criteria presented in Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Table 8. 
In the event that a subject experiences a hypersensitivity reaction during t he infusion of 
investigational product, the infusion must be immediately discontinued and the subject must 
receive immediate medical assessment and indicated supportive management per the 
institutional standard of care (see Section 7.1).  
If a female subject becomes pregnant, she must discontinue treatment with the investigational product, but will continue other study procedures unless not advised to do so at the discretion of the Investigator. All pregnancies must be reported according to Section 9.7.2.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Withdrawal from the Study  
Subject withdrawal from the s tudy is defined as the subject’s withdrawal of consent from 
further participation in the study, including any contact [CONTACT_285047].    
When a subject is contemplating withdrawal from the study, the Investigator (not 
coordinator) must discuss with the subject the importance of further follow-up and how 
follow-up information can be obtained (in-person visit, phone, mail, via 3
rd party, revi ew of 
medical records). The above discussion must be documented in the subject’s medical record. If at all possible, in-person visits for subjects contemplating early withdrawal should include 
an early termination visit including procedures specified at Vi sit 7 (Schedule of 
Assessments).  If no further follow -up is allowed due to subject’s decision, the reason must be 
documented in the eCRF. In such instances, t he site should collect vital status at a minimum

local regulatory requirements .  
In accordance with ICH principles of GCP, the Investigator  always has the option to advise a 
subject to withdraw from the study. Concern for the interests of the subject must always 
prevail over the interests of the study.  
If a subject withdraws from the study, they will continue to have access to medical care as per 
routine local  medical practice.  
If the subject withdraws from the study, CSLB will retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent, in accordance with prevailing regulatory 
guidance.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_348066] declines further participation or is withdrawn from the study, attempts will be 
made to complete and document the final assessment. If at all possible, this final assessment 
should include the assessments and procedures specified for Visit 7 ( Schedule of 
Assessments).  If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for 
disclosure of future information, CSL B may retain and continue to use any data collected 
before such withdrawal of consent. 
In the event that a subject withdraws from the study, the Investigator should record t he reason 
and date of withdrawal in the eCRF  and in the subject's medical records.

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348067] be accounted for throughout the study. At the end of the study, the Drug Inventory Report, dated and signed by [CONTACT_113118] 
(eg, pharmacist), must be retained at the study site as verification of  final accountability of 
CSL112. An unblinded Clinical Monitor will conduct study drug accountability. 
Records for the delivery of investigational product to the study site, the inventory at the study 
site, the use by [CONTACT_6992], and the destruction or return of investigational product to CSLB 
must be maintained by [CONTACT_737] (or delegate). The records will include dates, 
quantities, and unique code numbers assigned to investigational product and unique code numbers assigned to the subjects. 
Information on the destruction of CSL112 or placebo is provided in the study reference 
manuals. 
5.4 OTHER INTERVENTION(S ) 
Not applicable.  
5.5 RESCUE THERAPY  
Not applicable.  
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348068] ID numbers will not be reassigned or reused.   
6.1.2 Randomization Procedures  
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active treatment versus placebo 
by [CONTACT_285048]. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_67889] (30  to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 
or 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) as calculated by [CONTACT_285049] -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908] ( Levey 
et al, 2009; Stevens et al, 2010) and by [CONTACT_285050]-diabetic medication (yes or no) . The IRT will assign the appropriate 
study treatment to each subject. CSL B or a delegate will supply the Investigator with a user 
guide for the IRT system. The IRT will use centralized randomization and fixed -size blocks. 
To ensure the study blind is maintained, a CSLB statistician / delegate not directly involved in the analysis of study results will prepare the study randomization code. The unblinded 
CSLB statistician/delegate will keep the randomization code on file.  
6.1.3 Blinding Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding Method 
Physical measures of blinding will be used to mask the identity of the investigational product 
due to the physical characteristics of CSL112 when reconstituted ( ie, pale yellow/straw color 
with slight foaming characteristics). Information on the physical measures of blinding u sed to 
mask the identity of the investigational product will be provided in the study reference 
manuals.

per Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) delegated by [CONTACT_285051], in a suitable peripheral or central vein. A dedicated IV line should be used for administration of investigational product. Patency of the IV line should be ensured before the 
start of the infusion. After the completion of the infusion the IV line should be flushed with 
saline. If the infusion is interrupted for any reason, the total duration of the infusion should 
not exceed [ADDRESS_348070] for presence of hypovolemia, which may 
include signs of dry mouth, skin tenting, orthostasis, dizziness, etc. If hypovolemia is 
suspected or confirmed, the Investigator or medically qualified delegate should administer IV 
replacement fluid as clinically indicated. During the infusion,  subjects should be encouraged 
to drink fluids. 
Subjects should be advised to sit down or lie in a semi-supi[INVESTIGATOR_284997]. If necessary, upon completion of the infusion subjects should be escorted as per 
site's standard of procedures to ensure their safety . 
All subjects should be monitored for drug hypersensitivity reaction for at least [ADDRESS_348071]. Extension of the duration 
of the monitoring time and/or monitoring after administration of the third  and fourth  
infusions of investigational product may be done at the discretion of the Investigator  as 
clinically indicated.  Study site personnel who are medically qualified to recognize and treat 
drug hypersensitivity r eactions must be available together with medications and equipment to 
treat such reactions.  All possible drug hypersensitivity reactions require follow up until 
resolution (Section 7.1).  
Before departing from the clinic and after completion of the infusion and all other study assessments, all subjects should be asked to void. If a subject is unable to void before  leaving

7. CONTRAINDICATIONS, PERMITTED THERAPI[INVESTIGATOR_284998]  
7.1 CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS  TO FURTHER D OSING 
CSL112 has previously been administered to humans. Potential risks and guidance to the 
Investigator for use of CSL112 are provided in the Development Core Safety Information  
document (appended to the CSL112 IB). The administration of CSL112 to any subject not 
meeting the eligibility criteria for this study, or to any subject not enrolled in this study, is 
prohibited. 
There is potential for allergic reactions or hypersensitivity to CSL112 in certain individuals, 
given the constituents of the product. CSL112 consists of apoA-I isolated from human plasma 
that may contain IgA and PC derived from soy beans. Therefore, Investigator s should ensure 
that subjects do not have a positive history of IgA deficiency or antibodies to IgA and that the 
subjects are not allergic to either soy bean or peanuts (there is a documented risk of cross 
reactions to soy in known peanut allergy sufferers). 
In the event that a subject experiences a hypersensitivity reaction during the infusion, the 
infusion must be immediately discontinued and the subject must receive immediate medical 
assessment and indicated supportive management per the institutional standard of care. 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348074]-077 Confidential  Additional assessments are to be performed if subjects experience hypersens itivity reactions 
while on the study. In the event of a potential drug hypersensitivity reaction, additional 
assessments should be performed and follow -up is required until resolution (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
If a subject experiences a Grade 3 or 4 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) AE within [ADDRESS_348075] should not be administered. 
Because CSL112 is made from human blood, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious 
agents (eg, viruses and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease agent). The risk of 
infectious agent transmission has been reduced by [CONTACT_285053], testing for the presence of certain current virus infections, and 
including virus inactivation/removal steps in the manufacturing process. 
7.2 PERMITTED THERAPIE S 
Concomitant treatment is permitted throughout the study.  
All drugs and/or procedures currently being administered to a subject at the time of signing 
informed consent, and which are taken in ad dition to the investigational product at any time 
during the study, are regarded as concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284999].    
7.3 PROHIBITED THERAPIE S 
The following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_254771]:  
• Treatment with anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348077] demographic information and baseline 
characteristics are provided in Table 3. These assessments will be performed at time points as 
detailed in the Schedule of Assessments . 
Table 3.  Clinical Procedures : Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Assessment  Description  
Demographics  Date of birth, years of age, sex, race, and ethnicity  
Height 
Weight Height will be recorded in centimeters (cm)  
Body weight will be recorded in kilograms (kg)  
Medical history  Relevant medical history , including cause of CKD if knowna 
Gilbert’s syndrome - historical documentation (record in eCRF) 
Prior/Conc omitant 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_285000]: All medications taken by [CONTACT_262093] 4 weeks before 
screening will be recorded , including those administered for the index AMI. 
Concomitant Therapy: All medications currently being administered to a subject at the time informed consent is signed and which continue to be 
taken in addition to investigational product during the study will be recorded. 
Standard of Care 
Laboratory 
Sample: Serum 
Creatinine  Local laboratory tests obtained as part of standard of care may include 
serum creatinine measurements that will be used to determine stability of 
renal function after the index event or, for subjects undergoing angiography, 
after administration of intravenous con trast agent . If multiple laboratory 
tests are obtained before the administration of  contrast agent, the serum 
creatinine value closest in tim e but before  contrast administration should be 
used as the reference value to assess stability of  renal function ( Table 7). 
Results of t he local laboratory serum creatinine test s used as the reference 
value to assess renal function stability  should be recorded in the eCRF.  
eGFR The local laboratory serum creatinine value used to confirm stability of renal 
function before the first infusion of investigational product will be used to 
calculate baseline eGFR that will be used for stratificatio n of randomization 
by [CONTACT_67889]. The CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_10908] (see Appendix I ) will be used for 
calculation of eGFR. This method for creatinine measurement  should be 
traceable to IDMS standard s. 
AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CKD -EPI = Chronic Kidney Disease Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10444]; eCRF = 
electronic case report form; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; IDMS = isotope dilution mass 
spectrometry; MI  = myocardial infarction; PRBCs = packed red blood cells  
a. Including but not limited to prior MI, history of stable or unstable angina, coronary revascularization or 
surgery, hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, congestive heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, valvular heart disease, heart rhythm disorders, cerebrovascular disease, any clinically-significant bleeding event

Assessment  An assessment of the investigational product infusion site should be 
performed by [CONTACT_46874] a medically qualified delegate with 
each infusion. Any abnormal finding at the infusion site, including 
bruising, redness and/or swelling, should be recorded as an AE. Bruising 
should be assessed using the BARC criteria ( Appendix IV ). 
Drug 
hypersensitivity 
monitoring  If a drug hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, blood samples should be 
obtained and sent to the central laboratory for: 
• quantitative  immunoglobulins ( IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE)  
• If IgA is low or not detectable , then anti-IgA antibodies will be 
assayed  
• complete blood count with differential  
Any drug hypersensitivity reaction should be recorded as an AE.

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348081] has elevation  in ALT > [ADDRESS_348082] with a concomitant 
elevation in t otal bilirubin > [ADDRESS_348083] OR  an elevation in ALT 
> [ADDRESS_348084], blood samples should be obtained and sent to the central 
laboratory  within 48 to 72 hours for:  
• ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, GGT, amylase, and lipase  
• CBC with differential  
• CRP 
• PT/INR 
• Serology for Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E 
• CMV titers (IgM , IgG)  
• EBV titers (IgM, IgG)  
• Quantitative Immunoglobulins - IgG, IgM, IgE, IgA,  
• ANA 
If there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_285001], blood samples 
should be obtained and sent to the central laboratory for: 
• dsDNA, anti -smooth m uscle Ab, anti -mitochondrial Ab, 
cANCA, pANCA  
Diagnostic i maging of the liver such as liver ultrasound should be 
performed if clinically indicated and should be reported in the eCRF if 
performed. 
Further repeat testing for ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase and GGT should occur as clinically indicated but at 
least every [ADDRESS_348085] is 
asymptomatic to resolution. Retesting of other relevant parameters may 
be performed as clinically indicated. Local laboratory assessments may be used for this repeat testing.  
Elevations in ALT > [ADDRESS_348086] with concomitant elevation in total 
bilirubin > [ADDRESS_348087] should be reported as a SAE as per Sec tion 9.5.1. 
Urinalysis  Urine samples  will be collected and analyzed  by [CONTACT_285055]: 
 • Specific gravity  • pH • Blood 
 • Glucose • Protein • Leukocyte esterase  
 • Ketones • Bilirubin • Nitrites

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348088]-077 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Medical History and Assessment for Study Eligibility  
The subjects’ past medical history  and demographic information will be documented at 
screening. As defined in the inclusion criteria, Section 4.1.1, assessment of renal function 
status for the presence of moderate RI  based on eGFR and evidence of myocardial necrosis in 
a clinical setting consistent with a type I (spontaneous) AMI will be evaluated. A medical 
history will be obtained by [CONTACT_29517] a medically qualified delegate. Medical history 
includes all active conditions, and any condition diagnosed within 3 months before the screening visit . Such conditions may  include but are not limited to prior MI, history of stable 
or unstable angina, coronary revascularization or surgery, hypertension, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes mellitus, congestive  heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, valvular heart disease, 
heart rhythm disorders, cerebrovascular disease, or any clinically-significant bleeding event 
requiring transfusion of > 2 units packed red blood cells (P RBCs) within the past 3 months or 
a discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. If possible, documented evidence 
of CKD within the 6 months before admission for the index AMI should be obtained (eg, 
prior serum creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, suspected etiology of CKD). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening and Randomization on Same Day 
Screening and randomization of subjects may occur on the same day ( Study Day 1 of the 
Active Treatment Period ) provided that the minimum time for assessment of renal function  
stability is adhered to before administratio n of the first infusion of investigational product 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]). To receive the first infusion of investigational product, subjects must have 
documented evidence of stable renal function and no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_285002] [ADDRESS_348089] 
administration that is increased < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre -contrast administration value. See 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for repeating post-contrast assessment s of renal function. The screening 
period up to and including randomization must occur within 5 days of FMC for the index 
AMI.

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348090] infusion  (Table 7). The pre-contrast and baseline serum creatinine 
values used to confirm renal function stability must be documented in the eCRF.  
If screening and randomization occur on the same day, all protocol specified procedures and 
assessments indicated at Visit 1 and Visit 2 (Baseline/before infusion) in the  Schedule of 
Assessments must still be performed , although certain assessments do not need to be 
duplicated . If Visits 1 and 2 are combined , there may be a single blood draw for central 
laboratory serum biochemistry, and local laboratory ALT, total bilirubin, and serum 
creatinine. Both a local laboratory and central laboratory urinalysis should be performed. 
There may be 1 ECG. Single assessments of vital signs, concomitant medications, and AEs  
are also acceptable.  
8.2.2 Infusion Eligibility  
[IP_ADDRESS] First Infusion  
In addition to confirming hemodynamic stability, both hepatic (ALT and total bilirubin) and renal (serum creatinine) function, based on local laboratory values, must be reviewed by [CONTACT_285056] ( Table 7). The screening period up to and including 
randomization must occur within [ADDRESS_348091] infusion, the following 
criteria apply:

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348092]-077 Confidential  • ALT value must be ≤ [ADDRESS_348093] be ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_348094] 
(Section 4.1.2). 
• If the baseline ALT is > [ADDRESS_348095] is not  eligible for dosing . 
• If the baseline total bilirubin value is > 1.[ADDRESS_348096] is not  eligible for dosing 
unless there is historical docume ntation of Gilbert’s syndrome. In this instance, the 
Investigator or a medically qualified delegate should confirm historical documentation of Gilbert’s syndrome with the medical monitor.    
• A repeat baseline assessment for hepatic function is not permitted.  
All subjects must have documented evidence of stable renal function and no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_285003] [ADDRESS_348097] administration that is increased < 0.3 mg/dL from the pre- contrast 
administration value ( Table 7).   
If multiple laboratory tests are obtained before the administration of contrast agent, the serum 
creatinine value closest in time but before  IV contrast administration should be used as the 
reference value to assess stable renal function.  Similarly, the serum creatinine value obtained 
after, but closest in time to  the minimum time  required after FMC for the index AMI or, for 
subjects undergoing angiography, after IV contrast administration should be the baseline 
value used to confirm renal function stability before administration of the first infusion.  
These pre-contrast and baseline serum creatinine values used to confirm renal function 
stability must be documented in the eCRF.  
If the post-contrast serum creatinine value is increased ≥ 0.3 mg/dL from the pre- contrast 
administration value, the laboratory test may be repeated once at least [ADDRESS_348098] be increased < 0.3 mg/dL from 
the pre-contrast administration value for the subject to be eligible , provided no clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_285004].

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348101]-077 Version 1.0 Confidential  [IP_ADDRESS] Subsequent Infusions  
For infusions 2, 3, and 4, hepatic (ALT and total bilirubin) and renal (serum creatinine) 
function is to be assessed within [ADDRESS_348102] will be based on the criteria presented below and summarized  in 
Table 8. 
For assessment of hepatic function before infusion 2 or subsequent infusions, the following 
criteria apply: 
• ALT value must be ≤ [ADDRESS_348103] be ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_348104] for 
eligibility  
• If the ALT value is > [ADDRESS_348105] or total bilirubin value is > 1.[ADDRESS_348106] 
be delayed  and ALT and/ or total bilirubin values may be repeated  once at least [ADDRESS_348107] has a medical history of Gilbert’s syndrome, indirect bilirubin may be used 
instead of total bilirubin to determine dosing eligibility.  
• If the repeated assessment of ALT value is > [ADDRESS_348108] OR total bilirubin value is 
> 1.[ADDRESS_348109] and the observed variation is not attributable to Gilbert’s syndrome, the 
subject is not eligible for continued dosing and all remaining infusions  must be 
discontinued. If the subject has a history of Gilbert’s syndrome, indirect bilirubin may be 
used instead of total bilirubin to determine dosing eligibility.  
For assessment of renal function before infusion 2 or subsequent infusions, the following criteria apply: 
• Change from baseline (pre-infusion on Study Day 1) in serum creatinine must be 
< 0.3 mg/dL .   
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
 Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348110]-077 Version 1.0 Confidential  • If the serum creatinine value is increased 0.3 to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline value before 
infusion [ADDRESS_348111] or other clinical factors ( eg, IV fluid discontinued) or falls within range of 
variability previously observed for the subject. If the variation cannot be attributed to 
above, then perform repeat assessments before  dosing as per Table 8. 
• If the serum creatinine value is increased > 0.5 mg/dL from baseline value before 
infusion [ADDRESS_348112] 24 hours apart are 
< 0.3 mg/ dL increased from the baseline. If the creatinine does not return to < 0.3 mg/dL, 
on 2 subsequent repeat assessments, the infusion will be delayed, and a repeat serum creatinine will be assessed at 7 days (±  24 h) from the pre-infusion assessment ( ie, the 
initial assessment before the delayed dose). At the time of the delayed infusion, the 
medical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_285058]. If after 7 days, the creatinine is < 0.3 mg/dL 
increased from baseline, an additional serum creatinine  should be performed at least 
24 hours later in order to confirm that the value is still <  0.3 mg/dL increased from 
baseline before subsequent dosing. The subject will be eligible only if ≥ [ADDRESS_348113] 24 hours apart are each < 0.3 mg/dL increased from baseline. In 
addition, dosing should proceed only if the subject is assessed as clinically stable by [CONTACT_3786]. If after 7 days the creatinine is still ≥ 0.3 mg/dL increased from the baseline 
value, all subsequent infusions will be discontinued (see Table 8). 
If any administration of investigational product is discontinued due to these eligibility 
laboratory criteria, the abnormal laboratory parameter should be followed with central 
laboratory testing performed at [ADDRESS_348114]’s pre-infusion baseline value or renal and/or hepatic 
function is stabilized .

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348120]-077 Confidential  8.2.3 Safety 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
Incidence, grade, and causality of AEs, including SAEs, will be evaluated according to the 
criteria specified in Section  9. The period of observation of AEs (and SAEs) extends from the 
time the subject provides signed informed consent until the s ubject completes the study , as 
specified in Section  9.4. Procedures for reporting AEs, and SAEs, are specified in Section  9.5 
and Section  9.6, respectively.  
Reporting of bleeding events and renal SAEs includes completion of the Bleeding Event 
eCRF page or the Renal SAE eCRF page, respectively, with supporting documentation 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285006]). 
Before and at the end of each infusion conducted at the study site, the Investigator  or a 
medically qualified delegate will specifically inquire (via non -leading questioning) about any 
AEs that might have occurred since the last infusion conducted at the study site. All AEs (and 
SAEs and AEs of special interest) will be recorded on the AE pag e of the eCRF page.  
Each individual manifestation of an AE should be graded individually for severity (see Section 9.2). 
Details of the definitions and categorization of AEs, and procedures for the reporting of AEs, are available in Section  9.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
The Investigator or qualified delegate will take vital signs at screening, before the each 
infusion of investigational product, at the end of infusion of investigational product, and at any follow -up visits as specified in the Schedule of Assessments . Blood pressure (systolic 
and diastolic) and pulse rate must be measured with the subject in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_285007] 5 minutes.

Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348121]. Height will be measured at Visit 1 only. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms 
A standard 12- lead ECG will be performed using local standard procedures. ECG intervals 
(eg, RR, PQ/PR, QRS, and uncorrected QT) will be measured. Clinically significant 
abnormal findings as determined by [CONTACT_285060].  After the first 
infusion of investigational product, any new clinically significant abnormal findings should 
be recorded as AEs (see Section  9.5). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Bleeding Events  
Assessment of any bleeding event s, including assessment of the infusion site for bruising, 
redness or swelling, will be performed at each visit after r andomization (including baseline), 
up to and including Visit 8. The event should be recorded as an AE (see Section 9.5) and 
assessed by [CONTACT_285061]. The Bleeding Event eCRF  
page should also be completed along with  supporting source documents (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285008]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
The Investigator or a medically qualified delegate will perform a  physical examination 
covering the following body systems (h ead and neck, CV , respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal ( GI), 
musculoskeletal, neurologic, and integumentary systems) during screening and at the end of 
the Active Treatment Period  as specified in the Schedule of Assessments . Clinically

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348122], new clinically significant abnormal findings should 
be recorded as AEs (see Section  9.5). Physical examination findings should also include drug 
hypersensitivity reactions if relevant (see Sect ion [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Hypersensitivity Monitoring  
Drug hypersensitivity findings may include: allergic reactions, bronchospasm/wheezing, 
generalized rash, anaphylaxis, etc. In the event that a subject exper iences a hypersensitivity 
reaction during the infusion, the infusion is to be stopped immediately, and additional assessments are to be performed includ ing:   
• Blood samples for quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgE, and IgA)  and complete 
blood count with differential (Section 8.1.2, Table 4). Anti-IgA antibodies will be 
performed if clinically indicated  at the central laboratory . 
• The subject should be re-queried to confirm the absence of a history of allergy to soy or 
peanuts.  
• Pertinent positives and negatives should also be assessed and documented in the source document and eCRF including:  rash, swelling, hives, itching, wheezing, stridor, and 
involvement of the mucous membranes. 
• Relevant physical examination findings should also be documented ( eg, maculopapular 
rash, swelling of the face or oropharynx, etc.). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Procedures  
Details regarding laboratory procedures / assessments to be performed in this study are provided in the subsequent subsections. The local laboratory is to be used for all laboratory 
assessment s that must be reviewed in real time , ie, values taken to determine study eligibility 
and dosing decisions. All laboratory assessment samples should also be sent  to the 
central laboratory for analysis.  
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348123] results from the central and/or local laboratory that are outside the 
normal reference range and are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_285062]. If clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results are identified after investigational product infusion, the test(s) will be repeated until the abnormal 
values return to normal and/or baseline or stabilize  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Safety parameters 
should be repeated if the specimen is hemolyzed. 
An abnormal laboratory value should be deemed clinically significant if any of the following 
conditions is met:  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity that is new or has worsened since baseline.  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management ( ie, change of dose), 
discontinuation of the study product, close observation, more frequent follow-up 
assessments or further diagnostic investigation. 
• If the Investigator is able to provide a differential diagnosis for the abnormal clinical 
laboratory result, the AE is to be recorded accordingly. In the absence of an associated 
clinical sign or symptom, and if only a sin gle laboratory value is deemed clinically 
significant, the abnormal laboratory value is to be recorded as the AE. 
Any laboratory test result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for an AE or and SAE should be 
reported as such  (see Section 9.5). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Serum Biochemistry  
Sampling for serum biochemistry will be obtained for analysis by [CONTACT_285063] (Table 4).  
Sampling for ALT, total bilirubin and serum creatinine should be obtained from the local 
laboratory to assess for eligibility and safety for administration  of investigational product. 
Results must be reviewed by [CONTACT_285064] 1, 8, 15, and 22

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348126]-077 Confidential  arrives at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3409] ( ie, door time) or cardiac catheterization 
laboratory, for evaluation and treatment of AMI. 
The following procedures will be conducted and documented at the screening visit: 
• Informed consent 
− All subjects must provide written informed consent before any study- specific 
assessments or procedures are performed. Written informed consent is not required 
for assessments or procedures per formed according to standard of care ( eg, for 
diagnosis or treat ment); results from such assessments may be used in the 
determination of study eligibility . 
• Medical history, including active medical conditions and medical or surgical history 
diagnosed within 3 months before the screening visit (including but not limited  to prior 
MI, diabetes mellitus, GI bleed, or any other clinically -significant bleeding event 
requiring transfusion of > [ADDRESS_348127] 3 months). Specifically for 
history of CKD, evidence of CKD within the 6 months before admission for the index AMI should be obtained if possible (eg, prior serum creatinine, eGFR, proteinuria, or 
suspected etiology of CKD). 
• Demography 
• Prior / concomitant medication  review  
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria (including relevant clinical laboratory tests and 
method of contraception) 
• Height (in cm)  
• Body weight (in kg) 
• 12-lead ECG  
• Physical examination (includes examination of head and neck, CV , respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], GI, 
musculoskeletal, neurologic and integumentary systems ; any abnormal findings should be 
recorded on the medical history eCRF ) 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348128]-077 Confidential  • Vital signs  (blood pressure [supi[INVESTIGATOR_285011]], pulse rate [after 
resting for 5 minutes] , and body temperature (oral or tympanic) 
• AE assessment  
• Urine pregnancy test  
− Required for all women of child-bearing potential.  
• FSH test by [CONTACT_12115] (for amenorrheic females between the ages of [ADDRESS_348129]-menopausal status) 
• Serum biochemistry by [CONTACT_12115]  
• ALT, total bilirubin,  and serum creatinine by [CONTACT_12117]. These results must be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_285066]  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• Urinalysis. At screening only, urinalysis will be locally performed  by [CONTACT_72502]. If 
dipstick demonstrates high grade proteinuria defined as ≥ 3+ (ie, ≥ 300 mg/dL) , a urine 
sample should be sent to the central laboratory for urinalysis. 
• Use IRT to assign the subject identification  number  
Subjects who complete all of these assessments and who fulfil the eligibility criteria (ie, 
eligible subjects) will be enrolled into the study.  
If the subject is not eligible for the study, the primary  reason for screen failure must be 
entered in the IRT system . 
Screening and randomization of subjects may occur on the same day ( Study Day 1 of Active 
Treatment Period ) provided that the minimum time  after FMC for the index AMI event or 
administration of IV contrast agent is adhered to for confirmation of renal function stability 
before administration of the first infusion of investigational product. If the first infusion of 
investigational product is to be administered on the same day that screening assessments were 
performed, the local laboratory test results obtained at screening may be used to assess for 
hepatic function testing within acceptable limits and  renal functi on stability if the criteria 
outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] are met .

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348130]-077 Confidential  or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
The period of observation for AE s extends from the time the subject gives  informed consent 
until the end of study (see Section  9.4 for further details).  
Adverse event s may include: 
• Exacerbation ( ie, an increase in the fr equency or severity) of a pre-existing condition.  
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of the 
eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of 
the condition during the study.  
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before investigational product administration.  
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of investigational product. 
Adverse events do not include: 
• Events identified at screening that meet exclusion criteria  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE) 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example:  
o Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254785]-existing conditions, which have not worsened. 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254786] ( eg, cosmetic surgery) . 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a diagnostic procedure where the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254787] 
24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures ( eg, chemotherapy) . 
• Overdose of investigational product or any concomitant therapy that does not result in 
any adverse signs or symptoms.  
 
For laboratory safety parameters, any instances of absolute values being  outside the reference 
range or changes at any vi sit after study start  that are considered by [CONTACT_285067]. In addition, at the Investigator ’s

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348131]-077 Confidential  discretion, any changes or trends over time in laboratory parameters can be recorded in the 
eCRF as AEs if such changes or trends are considered to be clinically relevant, even if the 
absolute values are within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as AEs in the following cases: 
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at screening , unless a further 
increase/decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition .  
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by [CONTACT_285068] ( eg, in vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by [CONTACT_254845]. 
• Abnormal parameters that are obviously biologically implausible ( eg, values that are 
incompatible with life  or outside the measuring range ). 
• An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after re peat analysis, preferably 
in the same laboratory ( ie, the previous result could be marked as not valid and should not 
necessarily be reported as an AE).  
9.1.[ADDRESS_348132] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in  death – The event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious 
criterion. 
• Is life-threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  – 
CSLB considers “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]” for at least 
24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285012] ( eg, chemotherapy) are not considered as 
defining criteria for SAEs.

• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
• Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is defined as an event that does 
not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician to 
potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_348134] for which ongoing monitoring and/or expedited 
reporting by [CONTACT_285069] 9.5.1: 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stage 3 Acute Kidney Injury 
Acute kidney injury for this purpose will be defined as an elevation in serum creatinine 
during the Active Treatment Period  to ≥ 3 x the baseline value or a serum creatinine of 
≥ 4.0 mg/dL (353.6 μmol/L, Kidney Disease Improv ing Global Outcomes  [KDIGO] March 
2012) that is confirmed by [CONTACT_285070].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Hypersensitivity  
Drug hypersensitivity will be as assessed by [CONTACT_737].  Assessments should be 
performed as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

Evaluation 2009). Additional assessments should be performed as described in Section 8.2.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemolysis  
Hemolysis will be defined as a decrease in hemoglobin during the Active Treatment Period  of 
≥ 2 g/dL from baseline that is not explained by [CONTACT_285071]. Additional assessments 
should be performed as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Bleeding Events  
Bleeding events will be assessed according to the BARC definition for bleeding (see 
Appendix IV). 
9.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
The severity of each AE  (ie, nonserious and serious AEs ) is to be assessed by [CONTACT_285072] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria f or Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) criteria as  follows: 
NCI Grade  Definition  
Grade 0 Grade 0 is universally defined as absence of AE or within normal limits or values.  
Grade 1 An AE that is asymptomatic; or involves mild or minor symptoms; or is of marginal 
clinical relevance; or consists of clinical or diagnostic observations alone; or for 
which intervention is not indicated; or for which only non- prescription intervention is 
indicated. 
Grade 2 An AE for which only minimal, local,  or noninvasive intervention ( eg, packing, 
cautery) is indicated; or that limits instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs, eg, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], laundry, transportation or ability to conduct finances). 
Grade 3 An AE that is medically significant but not life -threatening; or for which inpatient 
care or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285013]; or that is an important medical 
event that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or m ay 
require intervention either to prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], to prevent the AE from becoming life- threatening or causing death; or that is disabling; or that results in 
persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or limitation of self-care activities o f

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348140]-077 Confidential  NCI Grade  Definition  
daily living (ADLs, eg, getting in and out of bed, dressing, eating, getting around 
inside, bathing, or using the toilet).  
Grade 4 An AE that has life -threatening consequences; for which urgent intervention is 
indicated; that puts the patient at risk of  death at the time of the event if immediate 
intervention is not undertaken; or that causes blindness or deafness.  
Grade 5 The termination of life as a result of an AE.  
ADLs = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event ; NCI = National Cancer Institu te 
Note: Definitions provided here correspond to: NCI Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events V4.0 .  
 
If an AE is reported that is not part of the CTCAE criteria, the following criteria will be 
used:  
Severity Definition  
Mild A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual ADLs. 
Moderate A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual ADLs, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe A type of AE that interrupts usua l ADLs, or significantly affects clinical status, or 
may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
ADLs = activities of daily living; AE = adverse event  
Note: definitions are based on the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data 
Tabulation Model (SDTM)  Severity Intensity Scale for Adverse Event Terminology  
 
9.[ADDRESS_348141]. If a causality assessment is not provided  for an AE (including an SAE ) that AE will 
be considered related to investigational product.  
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to investigatio nal product or an 
alternative cause ( eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be 
determined by [CONTACT_1004]: 
• Known pharmacology of investigational product. 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348142]-077 Confidential  • Clinically and  / or pathophysiol ogically plausible context.  
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the 
literature for similar products as being product related (eg, headache, facial flushing, 
pallor). 
• Plausibility support ed by [CONTACT_254847] ( eg, the event being related by [CONTACT_285073], drug withdrawal 
or reproduced on rechallenge). 
9.4 OBSERVATION PERIOD FOR ADVERSE EVENTS 
The observation period for AE (and SAE) reporting in an individual subject will start at the 
time of giving written informed consent for participation in the current study and finish with 
the end of study visit (Visit 8).   
If the Investigator becomes awar e of an SAE that has started after the observation period has 
finished, and there is at least a possible causal relationship to  investigational product, the 
event must be reported to CSLB (see Section 9.6). 
9.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
At each clinical evaluation, the Investigator (or medically -qualified delegate) will determine 
whether any AEs have occurred. Adverse events will be recorded in the AE page of the 
eCRF. If known, the medical diagnosis of an AE should be recorded in preference to the 
listing of individual signs and symptoms. T he Investigator  must follow up on the course of an 
AE until resolution  or stabilization . If an AE is ongoing after the end of study visit, the AE 
will continue to be followed up until resolution, stabilization . 
If, during the study period, a subject presents with a preexisting condition that was not noted at the time of study entry, the condition should be retrospectively recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF. 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1 
Study Product:  CSL112 
 
Final V2.[ADDRESS_348143]-077 Confidential  For AE reporting, the study period is defined as that time period from the signature [CONTACT_223103] (ICF) through Visit 8 . Therefore, events that occur before the initial 
screening visit will be recorded in the medical history and events that occur after the signing of the ICF will be recorded as an AE.  
9.5.1 Adverse Events of Special Interes t 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stage 3 Acute Kidney Injury 
Any elevation in serum creatinine of  ≥ 3 x the baseline value or a serum creatinine of ≥ 4.0 mg/dL ( 353.6 μmol/L) that is confirmed by [CONTACT_285074] 9.6. In addition, the increased value should be confirmed by [CONTACT_285075].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction  
If a drug hypersensitivity reaction is susp ected, it should be reported as an AE as described in

9.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full 
requirements of ICH Topic E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting). 
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study, whether or not causally related to 
the investigational product, must be reported  and entered into the eCRF immediately 
(within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event ). 
Adverse events occurring in the period between the time that the subject gave written 
informed consent and the first exposure to investigational product that meet [ADDRESS_348147] be entered immediately (within 24 hours of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the event) in the clinical study database in the same manner as other 
SAEs.  
Any SAE that occurs after the end of study visit that is considered to be causally related to 
investigational pr oduct must be immediately (ie , within 24 hours of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the event) reported to the sponsor . 
If access to the clinical database is not available (eg, system or internet access problem , or the 
clinical study database is locked), a handwritten SAE report must be completed, signed and 
dated by [CONTACT_285076] G lobal Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance via 
facsimile or email.  
If and/or when the system becomes available post outage, the SAE must be entered in to the 
clinical study database immediately .

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348148]-077 Confidential  9.6.1 Requirements for Immediate Reporting of S erious Adverse Event s 
The minimum reporting requirements for immediate entry of SAEs in the eCRF include: 
• Identifiable subject.  
• Suspected medicinal product and / or procedur e. 
• Event term . 
• Identifiable reporting source.  
In addition, the Investigator must:  
• Report all SAEs to the relevant IRB / IEC within the timeframe  specified by [CONTACT_5040] / IEC. 
• Enter relevant follow-up information in the eCRF until the SAE has resolved, or, in the 
case of permanent impairment, until stabilized.  
• Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF.  
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled , the Investigator should not wait to 
receive additional information to fully document the event before entering the information 
into the clinical study database .  
When submitting SAE reports and any other related reports ( eg, discharge summaries) to 
CSLB, subjects should be identified only by [CONTACT_254849]. The 
Investigator should not include the subject’s name, date of birth, or address. 
In cases of death, the Investigator  should supply CSL B and the IRB / IEC (as applicable) 
with any additional information as it becomes available ( eg, autopsy reports). When 
submitting medical reports to CSL B, the subject should be identified only by [CONTACT_285077]. 
The procedure to be followed if an ongoing AE becomes an SAE after the end of the 
observation period for AEs is described in Section  9.9.

9.7.1 Overdose  
Details (ie , volume, location of infusions, infusion rate) of overdose of investigational 
product or any concomitant therapy must be recorded in the eCRF. Any overdose that is 
considered by [CONTACT_285078] (ie, occurs in association with an 
event and meets any seriousness criteria) must be entered as an SAE ( see Section  9.5.1). An 
overdose that does not result in any adverse signs or symptoms should not be considered an 
AE (see Section  9.1.1). 
9.7.[ADDRESS_348150] will be followed, as described in Section  4.1.4). Every effort will be made to ensure that the relevant safety assessments for

10. STATISTICS  
10.1 SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION  
This is a randomized, placebo -controlled, multi-dose safety study in subjects with moderate 
RI and AMI. Subjects are to be randomized to CSL112 or placebo treatment in a 2:1 ratio. The co-primary endpoint s are: 
• Renal SAEs (defined as any SAE with  a MedDRA PT included in the Acute Renal 
Failure narrow SMQ or a PT of renal tubular necrosis, renal cortical necrosis, renal 
necrosis, or renal papi[INVESTIGATOR_59395]), and  
• AKI, defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine from baseline of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL  
(26.5 μmol /L) during the Active Treatment Period  that is sustained upon repeat 
 Study Number:  CSL112_2001_Am1

Final V2.[ADDRESS_348155]-077 Confidential  measurement by [CONTACT_285080] 24 hours after the elevated value. If 
no repeat value is obtained [due, for example, to loss of follow-up or protocol violation], 
a single serum creatinine value that is increased from baseline ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/L) 
during the Active Treatment Period would also fulfil the definition of AKI. Baseline for 
determination of AKI is defined as the pre-infusion central laboratory serum creatinine level on Study Day 1.  
With a sample size of 81 (54 active: 27 placebo), the study will detect with 80% probability a treatment -emergent event with a frequency of 3% in the active group and 2 % overall. A total 
of 81 subjects, 27 placebo and 54 CSL112, is planned for this study to meet regulatory considerations for treatment -emergent renal event characterization ; it is not powered for 
statistical testing of the co-primary endpoints.  
10.2 STUDY POPULATIONS  
10.2.1 Screened  Population 
The Screened  Population will comprise all subjects who provided written informed consent to 
undergo study screening procedures.   
10.2.2 Intent-to-Treat Population  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will comprise all subjects in the Screened Population 
who were randomized to [ADDRESS_348156] , and will be based on the actual treatment received .

national registries a ccording to local regulatory requirements. 
Results of this study will be disclosed according to the relevant regulatory requirements. All 
publications in peer- reviewed medical journals resulting from this study will be listed in the 
original study protocol registration record. 
13.3 IMPLEMENTATION  OF THE PROTOCOL / PR OTOCOL AMENDMENT(S)  
With the exception of medical emergencies, no changes or deviations in the conduct of the 
signed protocol will be permitted without documented approval of the CSLB Medical 
Monitor and the IRB / IEC. In the event of a medical emergency, the Investigator at the study 
site will institute any medical procedures deemed appropriate. However, all such procedures must be promptly reported to the CSLB Medical Monitor and the IRB / IEC.   
Modifications to the protocol that may affect subject safety or the way the study is to be 
conducted will be documented in a protocol amendment, which must be approved by [CONTACT_5040] / IEC.   
Administrative changes to the protocol, defined as minor corrections and / or clarifications 
that have no effect on the way the study is to be conducted, will not require IRB / IEC 
approval, but will be submitted to the IRB / IEC for their information . 
13.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
All instances where the requirements of the study pr otocol were not complied with will be 
tracked. Corresponding subjects may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the 
Investigator and  / or CSLB. Study protocol deviations arise when subjects who have been 
entered in the study deviate from the IRB / IEC -approved study protocol.

 Appendix IV: Assessment of Bleeding Events by [CONTACT_285089] (BARC) Definition for Bleeding  
Type 0: no bleeding  
Type 1: bleeding that is not actionable and does not cause the patient to seek unscheduled performance of 
studies, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], o r treatment by a healthcare professional; may include epi[INVESTIGATOR_15664] -
discontinuation of medical therapy by [CONTACT_15743] a healthcare professional  
Type 2: any overt, actionable sign of hemorrhage ( eg, more bleeding than would be expected for a clinical 
circumstance, including bleeding found by [CONTACT_3868]) that does not fit the criteria for type 3, 4, or [ADDRESS_348183] 1 of the following criteria: (1) requiring nonsurgical, medical interve ntion by a healthcare 
professional, (2) leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3820], or (3) prompting evaluation  
Type 3 
Type 3a  
• Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop of 3 to < 5 g/ dLa (provided hemoglobin drop is related to 
bleed)  
• Any transfusion with overt bleeding  
Type 3b  
• Overt bleeding plus hemoglobin drop ≥ 5 g/dLa (provided hemoglobin drop is related to 
bleed)  
• Cardiac tamponade  
• Bleeding requiring surgical intervention for control (excluding dental/nasal/skin/hemorrhoid)  
• Bleeding requiring intravenous vasoactive agents  
Type 3c  
• Intracranial hemorrhage (does not include microbleeds or hemorrhagic transformation, does 
include intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304])  
Subcategories confirmed by [CONTACT_15745]  
• Intraocular bleed compromising vision  
Type 4: CABG -related bleeding : 
• Perioperative intracranial bleeding within 48 h  
• Reoperation after closure of sternotomy for the purpose of controlling bleeding  
• Transfusion of ≥5 U whole blood or PRBCs within a 48 -h periodb  
• Chest tub e output ≥2L within a 24 -h period 
Type 5: fatal bleeding  
Type 5a  
Probable fatal bleeding; no autopsy or imaging confirmation but clinically suspi[INVESTIGATOR_195751] 5b  
Definite fatal bleeding; overt bleeding or autopsy or imaging confirmation  
CABG = coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292]  h = hour; PRBCs = packed red blood cells   
a. Corrected for transfusion (1 U PRBCs or 1 U whole blood = 1 g/dL hemoglobin).  
b. Cell saver products are not counted.  
NOTE: Platelet transfusions should be recorded and reported but are not included in these definitions until 
further information is obtained about the relationship to outcomes.   If a CABG -related bleed is not adjudicated 
as at least a type 3 severity event, it will be classified as not a bleeding event. If a bleeding event occu rs with a 
clear temporal relationship to CABG ( ie, within a 48 -h time frame) but does not meet type 4 severity criteria, it 
will be classified as not a bleeding event.

Page 4 of 54 VERSION:  #9: August 23rd, 2023.
The primary objective of the proposed research is to determine a daily dosing strategy for the 
dopamine precursor, levodopa (L-DOPA), that will increase functional connectivity (FC) in ventral striatum to ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VS-vmPFC) reward circuitry in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with high inflammation and anhedonia. More than 30% of patients with MDD fail to achieve remission with conventional antidepressants and even responders exhibit significant residual symptoms including anhedonia. Inflammation is elevated in a significant portion of patients with MDD, particularly in those patients who are resistant to conventional antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Preclinical and clinical findings indicate that inflammation can affect striatal dopamine availability and release, to contribute to symptoms of anhedonia and reduced motivation. We have previously reported a relationship between inflammation and FC in dopaminergic reward circuitry in patients with MDD whereby [CONTACT_337083], as defined by [CONTACT_319110] C-reactive protein (CRP), exhibited lower VS-vmPFC FC. This VS-vmPFC FC was in turn correlated with symptoms of anhedonia. Clinical and translational evidence from our group and others suggests that inflammation impacts corticostriatal circuits by [CONTACT_337084]. Our preliminary data demonstrate that VS-vmPFC FC connectivity was increased after acute administration of L-DOPA compared to placebo in patients 
with high CRP (indexed as CRP >2 mg/L), indicating that increasing dopamine with L-DOPA can reverse the impact of inflammation on this circuit. The dopamine precursor, L-DOPA, is taken up in the brain and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_337037]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_337038], little work has explored the potential for L-DOPA to improve anhedonia and motivation in MDD. By [CONTACT_337085] a functional link between decreased dopamine availability and impaired FC in reward circuits of MDD patients with high inflammation, this study will test the hypothesis that treatment with L-DOPA will improve depressive symptoms in MDD patients with high inflammation and anhedonia by [CONTACT_337086]. 
In order to obtain 30 study completers (~10-15% expected attrition rate), 35 medication-free, 
medically-stable and otherwise psychiatrically healthy adults (25-55 yrs) with 1) current MDD per DSM-V criteria, 2) plasma CRP >2 mg/L, and 3) score ≥5 on an anhedonia subscale of the 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (IDS-SR), will be randomized to two study tracks (A and B) to receive both placebo and L-DOPA (starting dose of 150 mg/day with dose escalation 150 mg/day per week to a final dose of 450 mg/day) in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study (see Figure 1 ). Patients will undergo resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline, after 1-week of placebo, and after 1-week at each dose of L-DOPA to establish target engagement in the brain for L-DOPA versus placebo to improve FC in reward circuity. Symptoms of anhedonia and an objective measure of motivation will be assessed as preliminary data regarding L-DOPA effects on behavior in relation to change in FC. Additional behavioral, biologic and MRI measures will be collected at baseline for use as predictors of response and to enhance interpretation of results. Safety and tolerability and data on the effect of L-DOPA on anhedonia and motivation in relation to target engagement in the brain (FC) will also be assessed. 
Aim 1:  To determine whether L-DOPA increases VS-vmPFC functional connectivity in MDD 
patients with high CRP (>2 mg/L) and anhedonia. Figure 1. R61 Study Design

Hypothesis 1:   L-DOPA versus placebo will increase VS-vmPFC FC along with plasma L-DOPA 
levels, and with maximal effects at higher doses. 
Exploratory aims: To obtain information on the dosing and tolerability of L-DOPA in our patient 
population, while collecting preliminary data on whether L-DOPA-sensitive fMRI FC brain 
biomarkers are affected in association with improvement in anhedonia and motivation.
Exploratory hypotheses: L-DOPA will be well-tolerated in otherwise medically-stable MDD 
adults with CRP >2mg/L and anhedonia at all doses tested, and improvement in FC in reward 
circuitry will occur in association with improved motivation and motor slowing.
3.0 Background
Depression is common, affecting ~10 million in the US alone, and confers a personal and societal burden. More than 30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to achieve remission with conventional antidepressants, and even responders exhibit significant residual symptoms including anhedonia.
1-[ADDRESS_416336] thought to contribute to symptoms of depression and particularly anhedonia is inflammation.
5-7 A significant proportion of patients with MDD are 
reliably found to exhibit increased inflammatory markers in both the periphery and central nervous system, as measured by [CONTACT_337087] C-reactive protein (CRP).
8-[ADDRESS_416337] antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
5,15-[ADDRESS_416338] pathways in the brain to lead to anhedonia and reduced motivation, which has been shown to be mediated by [CONTACT_337088].
20-25 We recently reported a relationship between 
increased inflammation (as defined by [CONTACT_337089]) and low functional connectivity between the ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) , key structures that 
receive mesolimbic dopamine input,
26 in patients with MDD, in association with increased 
anhedonia.27 Furthermore, our preliminary results also indicate that VS-vmPFC FC in MDD 
patients can be increased by [CONTACT_337090] (L-DOPA) in association with improved motivation, but only in patients with high inflammation. Together these findings indicate that MDD patients with high inflammation have low striatal dopamine availability that drives decreased FC in reward circuitry and increased anhedonia/reduced motivation ( Figure 2A ).
7 These data also support our hypothesis that VS-
vmPFC FC in these patients can be strengthened by L-DOPA administration to lead to reduced anhedonia and improved motivation ( Figure 2B ). 
This study will determine a daily dosing strategy for L-DOPA that will increase FC in VS-vmPFC 
reward circuitry in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study with 3 doses of L-DOPA in the R61. Data regarding the potential for L-DOPA to improve anhedonia Figure 2. Working Model

and motivation will also be collected. Milestones for R61: To establish target engagement in the 
brain, we expect that at least one of 3 doses of L-DOPA will produce a mean increase in VS-vmPFC FC that is ≥20% higher than that of placebo. 
This study aims to address an unmet need to investigate novel therapeutic strategies that may 
be targeted to sub-populations of patients with MDD based on a known pathophysiology that can be identified by a combination of peripheral blood and behavioral biomarkers. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_337039],

The choice of L-DOPA for this study is particularly well-matched to this target population as inflammation is known to impede dopamine synthesis (see Figure 2 ), which is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_337041], L-DOPA. Therefore, this work 
involving a dopamine agonist with known pharmacology will not only test a potential new therapy

other inflammatory stimuli (either as clinical therapy or in laboratory experiments) have found that inflammation preferentially affects corticostriatal circuitry that is relevant to anhedonia and motivation, as well as psychomotor speed.
21,22,36-39 For example, functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) has demonstrated decreased ventral striatal neural activation to hedonic reward in patients administered the inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN)- α to treat hepatitis C, which 
correlated with reduced motivation and activity.

22,38-40 Positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging investigating cytokine effects 
on dopamine metabolism revealed increased uptake and decreased turnover (indirect measures of dopamine capacity and release) of radiolabeled L-DOPA, [18F]fluorodopa, in the caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum of IFN- α-treated patients.

20,24,41,42 Indeed, we 
conducted in vivo microdialysis and PET neuroimaging with [11C]raclopride displacement 
following amphetamine challenge in IFN- α-treated monkeys.20 Results indicated that stimulated 
dopamine release was decreased in the striatum (including nucleus accumbens) after chronic administration of IFN- α, and decreased dopamine release, as measured by [CONTACT_337091], was correlated with reduced effort-based sucrose consumption.

4.0 Study Endpoints *
Milestone for R61: Target Engagement of Brain. Targeted VS-vmPFC connectivity will serve 
as the primary outcome and will be assessed for determining the Go/No-Go Criteria. Targeted FC for each subject and treatment condition will be calculated as the degree of correlation in activity between a 3mm
[ADDRESS_416350]-sensitive in neuroimaging meta-analyses105 (MNI coordinates x=0, y=44, z=-8, cluster 
size=1408 mm3 and encompassing parts of BA11 and ventral BA32 of ACC) or other similar 
ROIs used to define vmPFC in our previous work.27,64,65,106  This method will ensure rigor and 
reproducibility and application of results to potential future trials because the seeds and ROI are predefined, as opposed to those derived from whole-brain and data-driven analyses which are determined based on the specific patient sample. Z-scores will be extracted and the change in mean FC values after each dose of L-DOPA or placebo compared to baseline will be calculated. 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Dopaminergic Therapy for Inflammation-Related Anhedonia in Depression.
Page 8 of 54 VERSION:  #9: August 23rd, 2023.
FC between bilateral VS seeds and the vmPFC ROI will be examined separately and change in 
FC in either the right or left VS can contribute to meeting the Go/No-Go criteria. However, based on our previous work in MDD and IFN-a-induced depression
21,[ADDRESS_416351] bioavailability of L-DOPA. If more than 1 dose of L-DOPA meets criteria, % of patients and mean number of reported side effects will be compared across doses to determine the effective dose that was most tolerated by [CONTACT_1962]. If doses are similarly tolerated, % change in behavior (EEfRT > anhedonia) will be used. Statistical significance, ES or sensitivity analyses may be used to assist with selection of the optimal dose.  
Additional Analyses for Publication and Dissemination : Brain Target- Targeted FC Z scores 
(as described above) will be entered into linear regression models including clinical covariates (see below) and both conservative (Bonferroni) and powerful (Fisher LSD) post-hoc analyses to asses change in FC across the 3 doses of L-DOPA compared to placebo and to each other. Linear models will also be used to determine whether FC increases as a function of increasing plasma L-DOPA, and whether patients with low bioavailability exhibit low ΔFC. In addition to the 
targeted FC that will be used to assess Go/No-Go criteria, hypothesis-driven and data-driven whole-brain analysis will also be explored and compared before and after L-DOPA and placebo. Consistent with our previous data, these analyses will include VS seed-to-voxel-wise comparisons of L-DOPA versus placebo, as well as network analyses using GBC and PBNA, as a secondary outcome measure and to identify other circuits that may be affected by L-DOPA. For all analyses, concentration of CRP and final dose will be explored as a linear predictor of response to L-DOPA. Clinical covariates such as age, sex, race, BMI and ATQR and/or bipolarity scores will be explored as potential confounders or moderators of L-DOPA effects on FC. Integration of Brain and Behavior: As described for FC, linear regression models and post-hoc analyses will be used to asses change in behavioral outcomes across the 3 doses of L-DOPA compared to baseline, to placebo and to each other, and whether response was modified by [CONTACT_337094] L-DOPA, CRP, cytokine or sex hormone concentrations, or clinical covariates. Random intercept linear mixed models will be used to assess whether change in FC predicts change in anhedonia and motivation and in relation to clinical covariates. Overall depression scores and SHAPS-C and MAP-SR will be explored as secondary outcomes. Summary scores for dose-response (e.g. AUC) may be used to assess relationships among variables. 
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent
Description: Carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) is a combination of two drugs, 
L-DOPA and carbidopa. Carbidopa-levodopa is used primarily in the 
treatment of Parkinson's disease (although it is also FDA approved for other movement disorders such as Restless Legs Syndrome). Parkinson's disease is believed to be caused by [CONTACT_337095]. When L-DOPA is taken orally, it crosses into the brain through the "blood- brain barrier." Once it crosses, it is converted to dopamine. The resulting increase in brain dopamine concentrations is believed to modulate nerve conduction and improve movement impairments. Carbidopa does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Carbidopa is added to L-DOPA to prevent its breakdown before crossing into the brain. The addition of carbidopa allows lower doses of L-DOPA to be used. This reduces the risk of side effects from L-DOPA such as nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting are frequent side-effects of taking levodopa, and often improve with increasing time on medication. This combination medicine was approved by [CONTACT_34033] 1988. Carbidopa-levodopa is taken several times per day for treatment of Parkinson’s disease, up to 800 mg daily. Patients in this study will receive L-DOPA at doses ranging from 150 to 450 mg administered with at a ratio of 1 mg carbidopa for every 4 mg L-DOPA. Our preliminary data using

acute administration of 250 mg L-DOPA to MDD patients with CRP >2mg/L 
increased corticostriatal FC in reward circuitry as measured by [CONTACT_40394] (the primary study outcome) without only mild adverse events that are anticipated during initial exposure to the medication, primarily nausea (with vomiting in some patients). Other common symptoms that were experienced included headache and drowsiness or lightheadedness. Furthermore, in a similar recent study in aged adults with depression (>/=60 years),
30 L-DOPA administered at the same doses proposed herein (also 1 
week at each dose) decreased depressive symptoms and was well-tolerated. Indeed, the percent of patients reporting nausea (the most common symptom) decreased from 19.4% in Week 1 to 9.1% in Week 3, despi[INVESTIGATOR_337043] 150 mg/week. Symptoms of headache and drowsiness occurred in less than 10% of patients throughout the duration of the study, and insomnia occurred in 8% in the first week which decreased to 3% in week 3. Moreover, patients were monitored for dyskinesias (a common symptom in Parkinson’s Disease that may be specific to neurodegenerative disease pathology) and scores were 0.0 at Week 3 for all subjects.

The following rare but serious side effects have also been reported 
following the use of chronic high doses of L-DOPA for treatment of Parkinson’s disease: easy bleeding/bruising, signs of infection (e.g., fever, persistent sore throat), tingling of the hands/feet, vision changes (e.g., blurred/double vision), chest pain, seizures, vomit that looks like coffee grounds, black/tarry stools, unusual muscle stiffness, severe confusion, sweating, fast/irregular heartbeat, rapid breath or trouble breathing, painful or prolonged erection in males, rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), and severe dizziness. Transient and mild side effects that may occur following acute administration of the doses used in this study include: dizziness, nausea, vomiting, increased sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_337044], and headache. L-DOPA may also increased eye blinking/twitching, cause fainting, mental/mood changes, and worsening of involuntary movements/spasms.

at least two screening visits (Screen A and B, which may be conducted on the same day), 2) baseline blood draws and behavioral assessments, and fMRI scan, 3) 4 follow-up visits during dose-escalation of L-DOPA or washout to placebo that include blood, fMRI scan and behavioral assessments, and 4) two follow-up visits without scans to collect self-report and safety and tolerability information. An initial intake visit (to be conducted on the phone or virtually) will also be conducted either within the study (after study consent) or prior to study consent within our Behavioral Immunology Program Screening Clinic. At screening (in-person visit to occur after study consent), patients will receive a physical examination and laboratory testing (blood sampling) and will be requested to provide detailed information on past medical and psychiatric history and treatment, as well as current symptom status. Height, weight and vital signs will be recorded. Some aspects of laboratory testing (blood work and urinalysis) and medical and psychiatric history may be collected in the Screening Clinic to help match participants to this or other ongoing studies. During screening, a fasting research blood sample (18 ml total) may be collected (along with blood draw for additional safety labs and/or CRP measurement if needed) as a Pre-Baseline assessment. Research blood will be used for measurement of plasma inflammatory markers, mRNA gene expression for inflammatory signaling pathways, circulating and mRNA gene expression markers related to metabolism and endocrine hormones, and buffy coat to examine polymorphisms in relevant inflammatory proteins. Pre-Baseline assessments will be collected during the Screen B visit, and will also include practice neurocognitive and motivation assessments.
Eligibility for completing further screening and Pre-Baseline assessments: 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s designee will review information collected from the initial 
intake/consent visit and any subsequent screening to determine whether subjects are eligible to proceed with further screening and collection of Pre-Baseline assessments based on the following:
(1) Attainment of informed consent (2) Psychiatric clinician has determined presence of current depressive 
symptoms at intake with PHQ9 score >10, unless otherwise approved by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s designee
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Dopaminergic Therapy for Inflammation-Related Anhedonia in Depression.
Page 11 of 54 VERSION:  #9: August 23rd, 2023.
(3) The patient has not informed study staff or the psychiatric clinician of 
any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_337047]’s designee, would make the patient unsuitable for or unable to complete further screening 
Following the in-person screening visits and Pre-Baseline data collection, 
the patient will undergo the Baseline visit including MRI scan and randomization. At the Baseline visit, urine will be obtained for toxicology and pregnancy testing (where appropriate) and a fMRI scan will be performed. Subjects will receive standardized clinician-administered interviews and ratings for psychiatric symptoms, will be asked to fill out self-report questionnaires and will undergo objective tests of motivation and motor activity. Blood will also be drawn for the measurement of inflammatory marker/hormone levels after the scan procedures, and patients will receive study medication. At the end of each indicated week of treatment (7 days after each dose change in weeks 1, 3, 4 and 6), subjects will undergo fMRI scans, receive standardized clinician-administered interviews and ratings for psychiatric symptoms, will be asked to fill out self-report questionnaires, have blood drawn for L-DOPA concentrations and inflammatory markers, urine will be obtained for toxicology, and pregnancy testing, and will perform objective tests of motivation/motor activity. Safety and tolerability will also be assessed. For follow up visits at weeks 2 and 5, patients will either be seen in person (where possible) or virtually to fill out self-report questionnaires, height, weight and vital signs will be recorded (in-person only), update psychiatric symptoms, and safety and tolerability will be assessed. If the visit occurs virtually, medication will be mailed to the participant and unused medication will be returned at the next in-person visit.

6.2 Neuropsychiatric Assessments : Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-V 
Axis I Disorders (SCID-V): is a semi-structured clinical interview that 
provides a wide range of DSM-V diagnoses. All patients will be evaluated 
by a modified version of the SCID as part of the screening process. These interviews will primarily be conducted virtually. In addition to providing information for inclusion/exclusion purposes, the SCID will provide data about psychiatric predictors of treatment response, including number of past major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], length of the current epi[INVESTIGATOR_337048]-morbid anxiety disorders and/or dysthymia. At screening and at each visit, a standardized clinician interview will also be used to 
assess or monitor symptoms of mania/hypomania, substance abuse (also confirmed by [CONTACT_337097]), alcohol use, dyskinesia, and gambling (a potential symptom of dopaminergic medications like L-DOPA).
The MGH Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ): The 
ATRQ provides specific criteria for adequate dose and adequate length of a 
trial for it to be considered a failure, thus allowing clinicians to systematically collect data aimed at assessing degree of treatment-resistance of the MD epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. The data obtained can then be used to calculate a score using the MGH Staging Method (MGH-S) to classify degree of treatment resistance.

covariate in relevant statistical analyses and to exclude severely treatment 
resistant subjects (>3 adequate failed trials). 
MRI neuroimaging:  Scans will be carried out in Emory University’s Facility 
for Education & Research in Neuroscience (FERN) on a Trim Trio scanner and 32-channel head coil. T1 weighted anatomic images will  be collected with MPRAGE
148 or a similar high-resolution sequence for co-registration 
with fMRI data after a localizer. fMRI BOLD for resting and task-based 
functional connectivity: A multi-echo (ME) ep2 BOLD sequence will be 
optimized to provide high signal-to-noise ratio in regions of interest that is maintained during minor incidences of head motion. Resting ME BOLD will be acquired over ~10 min, and task fMRI will involve two scans of ~10 minutes each. For resting bold, a single acquisition of phase-encoding in the opposite direction of polarity (anterior-posterior) for distortion correction will be collected over ~ [ADDRESS_416353] 
preprocessing protocols in AFNI and SPM1. Individual’s fMRI data will be normalized into a standard stereotaxic space, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template with 1mm
3 resolution. MIDT : MIDT will be used to 
assess FC95,152,[ADDRESS_416354] reliability.157 Monetary 
outcome depended on patient performance in a simple reaction time task by [CONTACT_7326] a button in response to a visual target stimulus. The “anticipatory delay,” ~4000 m, occurs after presentation of a pseudo-randomly distributed cue to inform participants whether a given trial will allow them to win or lose money (reward: +$; loss: -$; no incentive: 0$; averaging ~$2) but prior to the target stimulus, has reliably been shown to robustly activate ventral striatum.
154,158,159 Participants will complete 2 
functional runs of 70 trials each (140 trials total) over ~20 minutes.95,152 FC 
during each anticipation condition will be assessed for comparison. Exploratory Measures (baseline only) - DTI: Inflammation may have 
consequences on white matter fiber tracts necessary to maintain neural connections.
[ADDRESS_416355] or confound L-DOPA response.164,165 Briefly, 
diffusion weighted images will be acquired over ~5 min, with an image acquired in the opposite polar direction for ~30 seconds. Faces task: This 
task that has been developed to measure brain activity in response to viewing of fearful and neutral faces and will be collected at the 1
st scan. For 
the duration of the task, patients will be instructed to passively view faces as they appear on the screen. The task lasts 5 minutes and proceeds as follows: [ADDRESS_416356] period is presented. The task has been designed to minimize patient discomfort and enhance cooperation. If at any time a patient experiences negative or unpleasant reaction, they will be removed from the scanner. The addition of these tests does not add to the overall risk to patient safety
Targeted FC will serve as the primary outcome and will be calculated as the 
degree of correlation in activity between a 3mm3 radius sphere in VS (see

Fig. 1A) and the vmPFC cluster identified as being reward-sensitive in 
neuroimaging meta-analyses and as used to define vmPFC in our previous work (MNI coordinates x=0, y=44, z=-8, cluster size=1408 mm3 and encompassing parts of BA11 and ventral BA32 of ACC) or other similar 
ROIs used to define vmPFC in our previous work.
27,64,65,106 This method will 
ensure rigor and reproducibility and application of results to potential future trials because the seeds and ROI cluster are predefined as opposed to those derived from whole-brain and data-driven analyses which are determined based on the specific patient sample. Z-scores will be extracted and the change in mean FC values compared to baseline will be calculated. FC between bilateral VS seeds and the vmPFC ROI will be examined separately and treatment-driven change in FC in either the right or left VS will be considered in the analysis. However, based on our previous work in MD and IFN-alpha-induced depression and preliminary studies above, we anticipate that changes in FC will be more pronounced on the left side. Additional Analyses for Publication and Dissemination: In addition to the 
targeted FC that will serve as the primary outcome, hypothesis-driven and data-driven whole-brain analysis will also be explored and compared before and after L-DOPA and placebo. Consistent with our previously published data, these analyses will include VS seed-to-voxel-wise comparisons of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_337049], as well as network analyses using GBC and PBNA, as a secondary outcome measure and to identify other circuits that may be differentially affected by [CONTACT_337098]. For all analyses, concentration of CRP and final dose will be explored as linear predictors of response.
Assessments of Positive Valence (Motivational) Constructs
Objective:  The EEfRT28,167,168: was developed by [CONTACT_15957]-I, [CONTACT_337139]. 
EEfRT is a suggested measure under the RDoC Domain: Positive Valence 
Systems > Construct: Reward Valuation, and can detect dose-dependent increases in effort expenditure for reward in response to dopaminergic drugs.
[ADDRESS_416357] as opposed to simply affecting the ability to experience pleasure.
20,138,139 As 
described, EEfRT performance correlated with both the IDS anhedonia subscale and with VS-vmPFC FC in our preliminary data. In this multi-trial game, participants are given an opportunity to choose between two different task difficulty levels in order to obtain monetary rewards by [CONTACT_337099] a short time.

study examining hedonic capacity, confirmatory factor analysis revealed a 
Hedonic Capacity factor that was largely defined by [CONTACT_337100]. Hamilton 
Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D-17): The HAM-D-17 is a 17-item, 
clinician-administered scale, that rates severity of depression.70 Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9: The PHQ9 is a clinician administered 
assessment covering the 2 core (depressed mood, anhedonia) symptoms of depression plus 7 additional symptoms that will be used for screening purposes.
Self-Report Assessments of Depression and Anhedonia: Anhedonia subscale of IDS-SR: correlates with the SHAPS,
27,[ADDRESS_416359] established relationships 
between this scale and both FC and performance on the EEfRT. 
Mood and Pleasure Scale (MAP): The mood and pleasure scale is an 18-
item self-report inventory that has been validated in psychiatric populations 
and is designed to disentangle motivational and consummatory components of everyday activities over a 24-hr period.

Additional Measures of Lifestyle, Stress, Anxiety and PTSD Symptom Severity:
Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A): The HAM-A is a 14-item clinician-
administered scale that assesses the severity of symptoms of anxiety71.
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI): The BAI is a 21-item self-report measure of 
anxiety symptoms, rated on a 4-point Likert scale72 modified to be based on 
the patient's experience in the past week. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) State Scale:  This 20-item self-report 
scale is used to measure current anxiety symptoms.
PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5): The PCL-5 is a The PCL-5 is a 20-item 
self-report measure that assesses the 20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD, rated 
on a 5-point Likert scale73 modified to be based on the patient's experience 
in the past week. 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): The PSS is a self-report scale measuring 
the perception of stress. The items are designed to predict how 
uncontrollable, unpredictable, and overloaded the subjects find their lives.
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ): The CTQ is a standardized, 
retrospective 28-item self-report inventory that measures the severity of 
different types of childhood trauma. Participants will not be excluded for history of childhood trauma. 
Habits : The Habits form is a brief questionnaire that assesses a subject’s 
daily smoking, caffeine and alcohol consumption, and exercise patterns.
Neurocognitive Tasks: Additional Measures of Psychomotor Speed 
and Goal-Directed Behavior
Finger Tappi[INVESTIGATOR_292713] (FTT): This task uses a specially adapted tapper that 
the subject is asked to tap as fast as possible using the index finger.  The 
subject is given 5 consecutive 10-second trials for both the preferred and

and is computed for each hand.  
Reaction Time Task (CANTAB):  The reaction time test includes simple and 
choice reaction time tasks and is divided into 5 stages requiring 
increasingly complex chains of responses and providing distinction between reaction (or decision) time and movement latencies (3). 
Trail Making Tests A (TMT):  is a commonly used neuropsychological 
measure with updated norms. Part A (TMT-A) requires the patient to 
connect numbered circles in order and reflects a measure of basic attention and processing speed. 
Digit Symbol Task (DSST):  The Digit Symbol Substitution Task is a subtest 
of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and consists of rows of 
blank squares, each printed with a randomly assigned number. The test involves graphimotor speed, visual scanning and memory, with about half of the variance being accounted for by [CONTACT_156732], a third by [CONTACT_156733] 4-5% by [CONTACT_85801].
Safety and TolerabilityAdverse Event Recording:  All adverse events will be coded in standard 
MeDRA terms (Version 14.1), and whether events are expected and study-related will be determined by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. In addition, severity and start and end dates will be recorded as well as any evidence of unanticipated problems. This information will be provided to the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences DSMB and IRB annually as described in the Human Subjects Section.
6.[ADDRESS_416360] Risk: 
Every effort will be taken to prevent injury or distress that may result from 
this study. 
Recruitment and Informed Consent:
•Male and female subjects with depression will be recruited from local (inter-
Departmental) referrals, medical record queries and/or social media recruitment campaign(s). Subjects in this study may also be referred from our Behavioral Immunology Program “Recruitment Clinic” protocol, Psychiatric Research Screening Clinic: IRB00075162, which uses the screening strategy for this protocol to recruit and screen patients with depression for our active studies through IRB approved social media campaigns including Facebook and Instagram. An overview of the study will initially be provided virtually or over the phone by [CONTACT_75872]. A telephone or virtual prescreening interview may be conducted on candidates providing verbal consent. If a subject shows interest in the study, research staff members will describe the general procedures involved and will answer relevant questions. If a subject remains interested in participation, the detailed nature, purpose, procedures, benefits risks of, and alternatives to this research study will be explained to each subject, and written informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_337101] a private

office space. To ensure comprehension of the informed consent 
information, the clinician will allow time for adequate consent review and questioning. Virtual interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_337102], a video conferencing service endorsed by [CONTACT_337103]. Informed consent will be documented on an Emory Institutional Review Board-approved form. A copy of the signed form will be given to the subject or accessible to the participant following virtual consent provided in a REDCap ICF document link. The original document will be filed in a central study consent binder. Subject casebooks will be in electronic format in the REDCap database. The consent binder(s) and select regulatory information gathered as part of the study  will be kept in a 
locked office and/or cabinet.
Neuropsychiatric Assessments:
Care will be taken to avoid bringing about undue psychological distress 
during the neuropsychiatric interviews. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_337104] (clinicians) for all neuropsychiatric assessments. In the event that a subject becomes unduly distressed, [CONTACT_10017] will be immediately contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and an appropriate clinical intervention plan will be developed. Drs. Miller and is a Board-Certified psychiatrist, and has many years of clinical experience in a wide variety of treatment settings, including emergency, consultation-liaison, inpatient and outpatient psychiatry.  In cases where patients need extra time to collect their thoughts and emotions, mental health clinicians will be available for emotional support after all interviews.
Blood Draws: 
Standard sterile procedure for blood withdrawal will be used. Blood draws 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_337105]. In addition, the volume of blood withdrawn for this study will not exceed 400 ml over a ~8-week period (from screening to study completion). 
Rapid CRP test: 
May be conducted at screening using the Diazyme hsCRP POC (or 
comparable) Test Kit. The kits produce rapid results using a finger prick method to collect 20 μl of blood and is intended for the in vitro quantitative 
determination of C-reactive protein. Screening laboratory evaluations, including rapid CRP, may be repeated at PI’s or PI [INVESTIGATOR_151602]’s discretion.
fMRI scans: 
To minimize discomfort during the fMRI scanning, patients will be provided 
with a head cushion and ear plugs. Patients will also be informed about the progress of the procedure through a remote microphone. In the case of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_337051]. 
L-DOPA Treatment:
To reduce the risks associated with treatment, all subjects will be monitored 
carefully for the development of adverse events as well as worsening of their condition. Although it remains unclear what risk chronic therapy with L-

DOPA will have in depression, and risks are assumed to be small, 
procedures will be put in place to ensure that any risks associated with receiving L-DOPA are minimized. At screening, subjects will be carefully evaluated for the presence of any medical conditions that might increase the risk of an adverse events (for example cardiovascular issues uncovered by [CONTACT_137884]). Subjects will be evaluated by [CONTACT_337106] 24/[ADDRESS_416361] every 7 days to ensure that symptoms haven’t worsened appreciably or that suicidal ideation has not developed. In the case of either of these eventualities, subjects will be discontinued from the study immediately and appropriate psychiatric referral will be made. Specific indications for discontinuation between screening and baseline will include any of the following: 1) the development of suicidal ideation or attempt assessed by [CONTACT_337107] >3 on the HAM-D suicide item [item #3]) at any assessment or 2) the development of psychotic or catatonic symptoms at any assessment. Other criteria for discontinuation between screening and the baseline visit include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337052] a clinical judgment that a subject is an imminent threat to self or others. Subjects will be evaluated for the appropriate level of care, including emergency hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337053]. Subjects with non-emergent symptoms but who disqualify for further participation will be referred back to their primary psychiatric physician. Appropriate follow-up care will be arranged for subjects not in active psychiatric treatment. An individualized plan will be crafted for each subject to ensure psychiatric back-up should emergency psychiatric care be required after hours or on weekends. Upon completion of the study protocol, all depressed subjects without a current psychiatrist will be offered an appropriate referral. 
Confidentiality and Data Management: 
Loss of confidentiality is a risk of research participation. Every effort will be 
made to maintain subject confidentiality throughout the study. All project personnel, including those involved in data entry, have completed an on-line course in human subjects’ protection for patient-related research with annual recertification. Each subject will be assigned a unique ID number that will be used in all data files and on all measures in place of personal identifiers. Data entry forms will be developed using the REDcap database system developed at the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (CTSA). REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is an 
Oracle-based, secure, password-protected, HIPAA-compliant, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. REDCap provides: 1) an intuitive interface for data entry (with intrinsic data validation); 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R); 4) procedures for importing data from external sources; 5) Real-time data cleaning and

validation; 6) Automatic field computation; 7) Data dropdowns for choice 
lists (including condition selections based on earlier responses); 8) Data entry warnings for out of range or missing values; and 9) Electronic scheduling. Data entry can be performed anywhere using the internet and provides 128-bit SSL security. All electronic and hard entry forms will include unique patient identifiers to maintain patient confidentiality and will not relate to the patient in any way. Any protected personal health information will be encrypted and stored separately. The only link between identifying information (e.g., name, contact [CONTACT_3031]) and project data will be in a key stored on a password-protected computer accessible only to the PIs and to the project coordinators, who will be making appointments and assigning research personnel to meet with the participant. Paper forms will be stored in locked file cabinets accessible only to study personnel.
Appointment Scheduling & Reminders: All participants will be given the 
opportunity to receive appointment reminders and scheduling information 
via text message on their mobile phones. If the subject consents to this form of communication, study staff may use OhMD Texting Service to communicate with participants. This platform provides a Desktop and Mobile Version of OhMD for the research team to securely communicate with participants and maintain subject confidentiality. This service will only be used for communicating relevant appointment information and never used for PHI. Participants will receive the following text message from the study team upon first contact: “Please do NOT send any personal information via text. You may call the study team at [PHONE_6999] to discuss any personal or health details.” Any PHI received via text message will be reported to the IRB as a potential breach of confidentiality
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:
Subjects will be closely evaluated throughout the study for worsening of 
psychiatric symptoms. Subjects will be discontinued at any point for any of the following: 1) the development of significant suicidal ideation, plan or intent as determined by [CONTACT_337108] >3 on the HAM-D suicide item [item #3], 2) the development of psychotic or catatonic symptoms, or 3) a 25% increase from baseline of HAM-D score, 4) below 85% compliance on more than one week during the study, and 5) positive pregnancy test. Subjects requiring discontinuation will be referred for further evaluation and treatment by [CONTACT_337109].

8.3 During the consent process, participants will be informed that they will 
receive the results of their screening laboratory tests performed by [CONTACT_337116]. Participants will also be informed that their other results (i.e. computerized testing, psychiatric evaluations, as described above) are not intended to be clinical or diagnostic and will not be reported. They will also be informed that although MRI scans are also not diagnostic, will not be reviewed by a radiologist, and that fMRI results will not be reported, they will be informed that if an abnormality is observed during collection of MRI data, this finding will be discussed with them by [CONTACT_978], Study Physician or their designee. Participants will have the option to opt out of receiving their lab results or being alerted to any incidental findings.
8.4 This study is not deigned to provide treatment and does not include a 
budget for the diagnosis or treatment of incidental findings uncovered during participation in this research. The study team will discuss the screening laboratory results with the participant, including going over values that are outside of the normal range. Patients with abnormal results will be advised to schedule a visit with their primary care or treating physician. If potential abnormalities are observed during MRI scans, the participants will be informed that a potential structural abnormality was observed and that it

9.0 Study Timelines*
Because our programs are currently running longitudinal experimental medicine studies and clinical trials, and because we are already administering L-DOPA to a similar MDD population, we expect that start up and training can be completed in the [ADDRESS_416366], and that 
we will be able to study 5 patients by [CONTACT_2671] 2nd quarter. Start up and training will

Based on a screening failure rate of up ~50%, we anticipate that enrolling and screening 70 subjects (35 per year) will provide 35 qualified subjects for inclusion in the study. AT screening, participants will undergo laboratory testing (for safety labs including coagulation parameters and determination of the absence of unstable medical illness including infection, thyroid disease and autoimmune disorder).  Electrocardiogram (EKG to rule out cardiac contraindications to L-DOPA) will also be conducted followed by a complete psychiatric examination (conducted by a trained clinician) including detailed information on past psychiatric history and treatment, as well as current symptom status. There will be no exclusions for race/ethnicity and minority populations, and women will be actively recruited. Indeed, based on our previous work ~65% of the sample will be female. We will make active attempts to enroll minority patients in a Year 1 (R61) Year 2 (R61) Year 3 (R33) Year 4 (R33) Year 5 (R33)

Due to the high co-morbidity between anxiety disorders and depression, we plan to include patients with comorbid dysthymia and/or anxiety-related disorders excluding OCD if depression is the primary diagnosis. Enrolled subjects may also have a comorbid personality disorder (except for subjects who meet criteria for antisocial personality disorder or with a history recurrent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355]/or recurrent suicidal behavior due to the personality disorder). Patients with stable medical conditions and on medications/treatments for those conditions will not be excluded.
10.3 INCLUSION OF WOMEN, MINORITIES, AND CHILDREN
a. Recruitment of minorities : Eligible subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate 
regardless of gender or minority status. We appreciate that minority groups tend to be under-represented in research samples and under-treated for mood and anxiety disorders. Therefore, we will recruit minority patients to ensure that the subject sample represents the community. Census estimates from 2017 for Atlanta, GA, were 40.1% white, 52.4% African American, 0.3% American Indian and Alaskan Native, 4% Asian, and <1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander; Hispanic or Latino were 4.8%. There will be two factors that will determine recruitment of minorities into the current study. First, although Emory University is located in Atlanta, we 
tend to draw participants regionally ; therefore, recruitment is more likely to reflect the minority 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Dopaminergic Therapy for Inflammation-Related Anhedonia in Depression.
Page 24 of 54 VERSION:  #9: August 23rd, 2023.
distribution of Georgia, which is similar to that of the larger Metro-Atlanta population. 
Specifically, these distributions are as follows: 60.8% white, 32.2% African American, 0.5% 
American Indian and Alaskan Native, 4.2% Asian, and <1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander; Hispanic or Latino were 9.6%. Second, the prevalence rate of depression among non-Hispanic whites (17.9%) is higher than Hispanic whites (13.5%) and African Americans (10.8%) (Breslau J, et al. Psychological Med 2006; 36:57-68). Based on these factors, we anticipate 
recruitment of minorities with the following distribution: 60-65% white, 30-35% Black or African 
American, 1-2% American Indian and Alaskan Native, 3-5% Asian, <1% Native Hawaiian and 
other Pacific Islander, 2.1% Two or More Races, and 6-8% Hispanic or Latino.  
Efforts to boost minority enrollment:  The following efforts will be undertaken to help maintain 
minority enrollment: 1) Advertisements in African American or Hispanic television or radio programs, 2) Advertisements in African American or Hispanic-Latino newspapers, 3) Advertising in Emory-affiliated clinics serving communities with high representation of African Americans and Hispanic-Latino groups (e.g. Grady Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]), and 4) targeting of our online Advertisement campaign to minority social media users. Recruitment of minorities will be assessed quarterly and approaches adjusted accordingly.
b. Inclusion of women : Consistent with NIH policy, women will be included in this study. 
Women typi[INVESTIGATOR_337058] 65% of subjects at Emory, distributed over racial and ethnic categories similar to men. Furthermore, epi[INVESTIGATOR_337059], with a risk ratio of roughly 2:1 (e.g. Kessler, J Affect Disord, 2003, 74:5-13). Higher enrollment of women than men will more closely approximate the prevalence of depression, making this study sample more representative of and generalizable to the population of depressed patients from which it samples. In addition, because of the potential interactive effects of sex with inflammation and depression, recruitment of women will be assessed quarterly to ensure adequate representation. 
c. Inclusion of Children: 
In order to limit the variability of the primary outcome variables (neuroimaging and behavioral), we have chosen to limit the age range from 25-55, reflecting +/- ~1-[ADDRESS_416369] deviations from the mean age (40 years) in our previously published patient samples. This design consideration precludes the inclusion of children (and older adults), limiting variability contributed by [CONTACT_337118] (a primary outcome of this study). Furthermore, the relationship between inflammatory markers, dopamine and reward responsivity has not been established in children. The study will also exclude younger adults (<25 years) due to the unknown risk of treating subjects in an age range where the brain is still be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

14.[ADDRESS_416373] design, no partial withdrawal with continued data collection will be allowed for participants who miss their schedule MRI, blood and neurocognitive follow-up assessments.
15.0 Risks to Participants*
There are 5 major areas of potential risk in the proposed study stemming from 1) neuropsychiatric assessments, 2) blood drawing, 3) fMRI scanning, 4) medication administration, and 5) loss of confidentiality. Neuropsychiatric assessments may uncover strong and potentially disturbing feelings about the subject’s past or present emotional state. The risks of blood drawing include discomfort, bruising, infection, bleeding, and fainting. Undergoing fMRI scanning poses no more risk than undergoing a routine MRI scan. Physical discomfort due to lying in the scanner, occasional headaches due to scanner sounds and previously unrecognized claustrophobic attacks are the prominent adverse effects of the procedure. L-DOPA may cause nausea or vomiting, and carbidopa is co-administered with the L-DOPA as a combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_337061]. Common symptoms are most pronounced after the first few doses of L-DOPA and may also include dizziness or headache. L-DOPA may also cause increased eye blinking/twitching, fainting, or worsening of involuntary movements and spasms. People who take high-doses of L-DOPA daily for Parkinson’s disease have reported more serious but rare symptoms such as dyskinesias, and these are not anticipated following the doses used in this study or in patients with depression who do not have neurodegeneration. Participants’ vital signs and adverse events will be monitored at weekly follow visits. If patients are unable to tolerate dose escalations, the study physician will provide the patient with a dose pack or bottle of one pi[INVESTIGATOR_337062] (containing 150 mg L-DOPA) a day for 3 days followed by [CONTACT_337120]. Finally, there is a risk of loss of confidentiality. Confidentiality of all 
subjects will be protected per institutional and NIH and other federal requirements, and as described in greater detail below. 
Alternative options include not participating in the proposed study. In addition, an array of 
demonstrated effective treatments for depression exists and include, but are not limited to: 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Dopaminergic Therapy for Inflammation-Related Anhedonia in Depression.
Page 29 of 54 VERSION:  #9: August 23rd, 2023.
selective serotonergic antidepressants (i.e. fluoxetine, paroxetine, etc.), serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_153868] (i.e. venlafaxine, duloxetine), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_170437] (i.e. bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nefazodone), tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and psychotherapy (i.e. interpersonal and cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). Risks and side effects of these agents vary in type and severity depending on class, but include sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal distress, anxiety, anticholinergic symptoms, induction of mania, suicidal ideation and potential lethality in overdose. Common risks of ECT include short term memory loss, head and body aches and risks related to anesthesia. Benefits of antidepressants and ECT include documented efficacy in the treatment of depression. In addition to approved modalities, trials of novel treatments are ongoing and include the use of vagal nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation. Benefits of these modalities may include efficacy for patients who have failed traditional agents. Risks include the possibility that these modalities are not effective. There are also surgery-related risks of infection and anesthesia involved with these modalities. At screening, study clinicians will discuss benefits and side effects of these alternative treatments with subjects compared to the risks and potential benefits of study participation.
16.0 Potential Benefits to Participants*
The direct benefits of study participation will include receiving a psychiatric and medical evaluation, including standard blood and urine-based laboratory tests and MRI scan. Subjects will also have the chance to contribute to a scientific investigation, which may be of benefit to future patients. Benefits to others may include gaining significant knowledge regarding the role of inflammatory activation in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression and potential for use of novel dopaminergic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. As a result of this knowledge, this study may contribute to personalization of therapeutic strategies for patients with major depression. Given the low risk involved with blood drawing, psychiatric assessments and fMRI scanning and the use of an intervention with only a mild side-effect profile and that has the potential to have some clinical benefit, we feel that the risks of the study are reasonable in relationship to the benefits of study participation.
17.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality
17.[ADDRESS_416374] Size Estimations for Power and Go/No-Go Criteria: The relationship 
between VS-vmPFC FC and anhedonia from our previous dataset (n=48)[ADDRESS_416375] size (ES) for Go/No-Go 
criteria and power calculations. Mean FC scores for patients with high ( ≥5) 
versus low (<5) anhedonia scores indicated a 50% difference in FC scores. 
Of note, a 50% difference for FC in patients with low compared to high anhedonia was stable across the low and high ends of the 95% confidence interval of the means, as determined by 1000-repetition bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_337063]. Therefore, we expect that L-DOPA will produce 
≥50% increase in 
FC, corresponding to a mean difference of ~3 points on the anhedonia 
scale. We also anticipate a ~30% placebo response, consistent with the placebo response rate in MDD
145 and with the percent change in FC after 
acute placebo administration in our preliminary data in patients with high 
CRP (32%). Therefore, we expect to observe a ≥20% separation between 
the L-DOPA and placebo responses, which will serve as Go/No-Go criteria 
for the R61. Based on a 20% difference in FC response between placebo and L-DOPA and the estimated standard deviation of this change based on 
 PROTOCOL TITLE:   Dopaminergic Therapy for Inflammation-Related Anhedonia in Depression.
Page 30 of 54 VERSION:  #9: August 23rd, 2023.
our preliminary data involving acute L-DOPA and placebo administration to 
high CRP patients (~1.5 x the mean difference between L-DOPA and placebo), an ES (Cohen’s d
z for standardized differences) of 0.65 is 
anticipated. 
Power Analysis for R61 Go/No-Go Criteria: Based on our estimated ES of 
dz=0.65, 21 patients would be required for 80% and 28 patients would be 
required for 90% power. To account for uncertainty and bias, clinical covariates (age, sex, race and BMI) were also considered. Although none of the covariates exerted significant effects in the model, per se (all p-values >0.05), they did improve the ES for the mean difference in placebo versus L-DOPA in our preliminary data. Based on this improvement, an ES 
d
z=0.97 is estimated for the proposed separation of the means by ≥20% 
when including covariates in the model. A graphical analysis of the sample 
size across a full range of power at the proposed ESs (with and without covariates) is provided in Figure [ADDRESS_416376]  comparisons of FC response 
to L-DOPA versus placebo in the R61 phase. Sample size (x-axis) and 
power values (y-axis) for ES (d z) of 0.97 (with covariates) and 0.65 (without 
covariates) are provided. Relevant to the power analysis of the study based on Go/No-Go criteria for difference in response to L-DOPA versus placebo, both the treatment effect alone and the treatment effect plus covariates will exhibit power >0.8 with the proposed sample size of 30 (dashed line).
A sample size of n=30 will also provide sufficient power for collecting 
preliminary information about the relationship between change in behavior and target engagement in the brain. For example, based on the correlation between EEfRT and change in VS-vmPFC FC after acute L-DOPA in our prelim data of r=0.6, we will have >95% power to detect significant correlations with 30 patients.

Target Engagement in the Brain:  VS-vmPFC FC using an objective, a 
priori analytic strategy, will serve as the target for physiologic response and functional improvement in the brain after administration of L-DOPA versus placebo. The relationship between VS-vmPFC FC and anhedonia from our previous dataset (n=48)
[ADDRESS_416377] size (ES) for Go/No-Go criteria and power calculations (see Milestones ). 
Milestone for Brain Target : At least 1 dose of L-DOPA will cause a 
mean increase in FC that is ≥20% higher than placebo. 
Power Analysis and Sample Size EstimationSample size was estimated to have adequate power to observe statistical 
significance based on our preliminary data and the proposed Go/No-Go criteria described above (see Power Analysis  section for detail). For the 
R61 Phase, the proposed threshold criteria for the primary outcome of 
target engagement in the brain (VS-vmPFC FC) is a mean change with L-
DOPA from baseline of ≥20% greater than that of placebo. Based on the 
means and standard deviations from our previous work, a ≥20% difference 
in mean change in FC corresponds to a effect size (ES) of 0.65, indicating that with a 2-sided alpha=5%, a total of 30 patients (out of 35 that will be studied to account for potential drop-outs) will be required to have >90% power for statistical analysis (see Figure 1  in the Power Analysis  section 
of Human Subjects  for detail). Based on our preliminary data on the 
relationship between change in EEfRT performance and change in VS-vmPFC FC after acute L-DOPA of r=0.6, we will have also have >95% power to detect correlations between change in FC and improvements in motivation, a secondary outcome to be explored.
Statistical AnalysisTarget Engagement in the Brain for R61 Go/No-Go Criteria:  Targeted 
VS-vmPFC connectivity will serve as the primary outcome and will be assessed for determining the Go/No-Go Criteria. Targeted fMRI FC will be calculated as the degree of correlation in activity using an a priori defined seed in VS and region of interest (ROI) in vmPFC (per the literature and our previous studies). This method will ensure rigor and reproducibility and application of results to potential future trials because the seeds and ROI cluster are predefined as opposed to those derived from whole-brain and data-driven analyses which are determined based on the specific patient sample. FC Z-scores will be extracted and the change in mean FC values after each dose of L-DOPA or placebo compared to baseline will be assessed. We expect that at least one dose of L-DOPA will increase VS-vmPFC FC by ≥20% greater than placebo. If more than [ADDRESS_416378] on 
behavior (% change in behavior, EEfRT > anhedonia), or lowest dose 
meeting all of the above criteria, will be chosen. Statistical significance, ES 
or sensitivity analyses may be used to assist with selection of the optimal target dose of L-DOPA foe the R33 phase.

Additional Analyses for Publication and Scientific Dissemination : 
Brain Target- Targeted FC Z scores (as described above) will be entered 
into linear regression models including clinical covariates and both conservative (Bonferroni) and powerful (Fisher LSD) post-hoc analyses to asses change in FC across the 4 doses of L-DOPA compared to baseline, placebo and to each other. Linear models will also be used to determine whether FC increases as a function of increasing plasma L-DOPA, and whether patients with low bioavailability exhibit low FC. Treatment resistance (as measured by ≥2 on the MGH-ATRQ) will also be assessed in 
linear models to determine whether it is associated with greater response to L-DOPA. In addition to the targeted FC that will be used to assess Go/No-Go criteria, hypothesis-driven and data-driven whole-brain analysis will also be explored and compared before and after L-DOPA. Consistent with our previous data, these analyses will include VS seed-to-voxel-wise comparisons of L-DOPA versus placebo, as well as network analyses using GBC and PBNA, as a secondary outcome measures and to identify other circuits that may be affected by L-DOPA. For all analysis, concentration of CRP and final dose will be explored as a linear predictor of response to L-DOPA. Clinical covariates such as age, sex, race and BMI will also be explored as potential confounders or mediators of L-DOPA effects on FC. As described for FC, linear regression models and post-hoc analyses will be used to asses change in behavioral outcomes across the 3 doses of L-DOPA compared to baseline, placebo and to each other, and whether response was modified by [CONTACT_337094] L-DOPA, CRP or cytokines concentrations or clinical covariates. Overall depression scores, SHAPS-C and MAP-SR will also be explored as an outcome. Integration of 
Brain and Behavior: Random intercept linear mixed models will be used to 
assess whether change in FC predicts change in anhedonia and motivation and in relation to clinical covariates. Overall depression scores and motor behaviors will also be explored as outcomes. Summary scores for dose-response (e.g. area under the curve) may be used to assess relationships among variables.
Integration of Brain, Behavior and Inflammatory Markers : Whether 
plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and their receptors at baseline, together in models with selection or when combined in a composite or principle component factor, predict FC and behavioral response with be assessed. There is some evidence that dopamine is anti-inflammatory, and change in inflammatory markers and their relationship with response to L-DOPA over time will also be examined. Gene transcripts will be entered into linear regression models in R with change in FC and behavioral measures, and identified genes will be assessed in bioinformatic platforms as described in the methods to determine additional biological and inflammatory pathways that are associated with L-DOPA response. Other behaviors (e.g. locomotor behavior) and imaging markers (e.g. white matter fractional anisotropy) will also be explored as factors that moderate L-DOPA-induced changes in FC, anhedonia and motivation, and depression scores.
17.2 Data entry forms will be developed using the REDcap database system 
developed at the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (CTSA). REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is an Oracle-based,

Page 33 of 54 VERSION:  #9: August 23rd, 2023.
secure, password-protected, HIPAA-compliant, web-based application 
designed to support data capture for research studies. REDCap provides: 1) an intuitive interface for data entry (with intrinsic data validation); 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R); 4) procedures for importing data from external sources; 5) Real-time data cleaning and validation; 6) Automatic field computation; 7) Data dropdowns for choice lists (including condition selections based on earlier responses); 8) Data entry warnings for out of range or missing values; and 9) Electronic scheduling. Data entry can be performed anywhere using the internet and provides 128-bit SSL security. All electronic and hard entry forms will include unique patient identifiers to maintain patient confidentiality and will not relate to the patient in any way. Any protected personal health information will be encrypted and stored separately. The only link between identifying information (e.g., name, contact [CONTACT_3031]) and project data will be in a key stored on a password-protected computer accessible only to the PIs and to the project coordinators, who will be making appointments and assigning research personnel to meet with the participant. Paper forms will be stored in locked 
file cabinets accessible only to study personnel
.
17.3 Data will be securely entered directly into REDCap. Data will be value 
checked with double entry. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I’s and their staff are currently using REDCap for their funded projects, and have extensive experience with its usage. No names or locating information will be entered in databases. Forms will be maintained in locked offices. Neuroimaging and neurocognitive data will be reviewed weekly and backed-up to local servers. Imaging data will be preprocessed using standard techniques to remove or control for artifact. Descriptive statistics will summarize central tendencies and variances of dependent variables, demographics and clinical characteristics. Log-transformation will be used for non-normally distributed data (i.e. inflammatory markers) and non-parametric tests will be used were appropriate.
17.4 De-identified plasma samples, immune cells and Tempus tubes for mRNA 
collected in this study will be stored in the -80-degree freezers in the Behavioral Immunology Program Laboratory on the 5
th Floor of Clinical B at 
Emory. Samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_337055], or sent to core laboratories within Emory University for analysis (i.e. the Genomics Core lab, Biomarker Core Laboratory). Samples will remain stored indefinitely to allow completion of all planned or future analyses. By [CONTACT_337121], we can do research for a long time without needing to ask for fresh samples from new patients. We anticipate transporting one sample per participant for each assay, but understand that there may be the need to repeat some analyses and additional tubes may need to be transported. Samples will be transported by [CONTACT_337122][INVESTIGATOR_337064]. In addition to analysis at Emory-affiliated core labs, we also expect to ship de-identified plasma samples to Brainsonline/Charles River (South San Francisco, CA) labs for measurement of concentrations of L-DOPA.

18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants*
Because study subjects will be receiving a pharmacological intervention as part of this study 
protocol, we have elected to utilize a Data and Safety Monitoring Board as part of our data and safety monitoring plan. This board is described below:
Composition of the Emory DSMB
The Emory DSMB consists of Ma rian Evatt, M.D. from the Depar tment of Neurology, Larry Tune, 
M.D., Chairman of the DSMB, [CONTACT_337140], [CONTACT_337141] and David Goldsmith, M.D. Each of these clinical researchers has agreed to serve as the external DSMB for investigator-initiated clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_337123] & Behavioral Sciences. No persons involved in the operation of this study will review DSMB reports for the study. The frequency of Emory DSMB review for this protocol will be once every 12 months based on IRB recommendations consistent with the assessed risk status of the study. 
Procedures and Responsibilities of the Emory DSMB
In advance of the DSMB meeting, the data manager/research coordinators will prepare a an 
annual report to be reviewed during that meeting. The report will include the number of participants who signed consent for the study and were randomized, the number of post-randomization dropouts, reasons for these dropouts, and any safety concerns, adverse events, etc. An up-to-date consent form will be provided, as well as a summary of measures taken to protect confidentiality (e.g. data storage, use of coded ID numbers, etc). The PIs will also prepare a report summarizing any new data/evidence that might alter the risk/benefit ratio for participating in the study (e.g., newly published studies, etc.). Data will be presented to the DSMB in such a way as to maintain patient confidentiality.Based on the information provided to the Emory DSMB, once every 12 months the DSMB will issue a report to the Emory IRB that summarizes the following:  All serious and unexpected 
adverse events or other unanticipated problems that involve risk to study participants, and whether these appear related to the study-based interventions or research assessment protocols. Reports will not specifically disclose the treatment arm of the study for relevant subjects unless this disclosure is required for safety reasons. Note that any serious adverse event (SAE) will be reported to the Emory IRB within [ADDRESS_416379] regulations.
The IRB defines a serious adverse event as: “any adverse experiences occurring that result in any 
of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. For the purposes of this policy, death is never expected.”
The PIs will take responsibility for reporting any serious and unexpected adverse events in a 
timely fashion directly to the Emory DSMB. The PIs will also report serious and unexpected adverse events or other unanticipated study problems or variances to the Emory IRB. Actions taken by [CONTACT_337124].
19.[ADDRESS_416380] completed an on-line course in human subjects’ protection for patient-related research with annual recertification. Each subject will be assigned a unique ID number that will be used in all data files and on all measures in place of personal identifiers.

system developed at the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational 
Research (CTSA). REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is an 
Oracle-based, secure, password-protected, HIPAA-compliant, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. All electronic and hard entry forms will include unique patient identifiers to maintain patient confidentiality and will not relate to the patient in any way. Any protected personal health information will be encrypted and stored separately. The only link between identifying information (e.g., name, contact [CONTACT_3031]) and project data will be in a key stored on a password-protected computer accessible only to the PIs and to the project coordinators, who will be making appointments and assigning research personnel to meet with the participant. Paper forms will be stored in locked file cabinets accessible only to study personnel .
19.2 Care will be taken to avoid bringing about undue psychological distress to 
participants, particularly during the neuropsychiatric interviews. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_337104] (clinicians) for all neuropsychiatric assessments. In the event that a subject becomes unduly distressed, Drs. Miller or Dunlop will be immediately contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and an appropriate clinical intervention plan will be developed.
19.3 Only research team members approved on this protocol are allowed to 
access any sources of information about a participant. Approved team members may do so by [CONTACT_337125], which are stored in locked file cabinets. The CRC, Director of Projects and Study physicians are also able to view a participant’s Emory Medical Record through Power Chart.

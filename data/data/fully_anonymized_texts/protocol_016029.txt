SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT INFORMATION 
This information gives you an overview of the research. More information about these topi[INVESTIGATOR_555006].  
1. WHAT IS THE STUDY ABOUT AND WHY ARE WE DOING IT?
This study is focused on assessing an online intervention, Veteran ACT for Chronic Pain 
(VACT-CP) with a waitlist control group, to evaluate whether VACT-CP is usable, acceptable, 
and potentially helps Veterans with chronic pain to improve their functioning and pain-related
symptoms. This study is being funded by [CONTACT_904929] R&D within the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. In addition to online website use,study activities related to completing 
assessments will take place, depending on your preference, either virtually or at the Bedford 
VAMC.
2. WHAT DOES THE STUDY INVOLVE AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?  
If you decide to participate in this study, you will be randomly assigned to an online therapeutic 
intervention or a waitlist control group. This process is like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin. 
For this study, you will have [ADDRESS_1270298]-CP program, you will participate in 7 20min online sessions. For both groups, 
there will be a midpoint assessment session where you wil take a series of surveys, which will 
take approximately 1.5 hours. After 7 weeks, both groups will fill out questionnaires and an 
interview that will take appximately 2 hours. One month later, we will ask you to answer several 
questionnaires on again. This follow-up study assessment session will take about 1 hour of your 
time. You will be given $[ADDRESS_1270299] study visit.You will be paid $40 for the midpoint surveys. 
You will also be paid $60 at the end of 7 weeks, and a final $[ADDRESS_1270300].

RESEARCH DETAILS
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?
You are invited to participate in a research study designed to evaluate a new, online therapeutic 
intervention to improve the functioning of Veterans with chronic pain called VACT-CP. You have 
been invited because you have chronic pain. With this research we hope to learn whether 
VACT-CP is helpful in improving the functioning and pain symptoms of Veterans with chronic 
pain.
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?
This research study is expected to take approximately [ADDRESS_1270301] IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Intake and Interview Procedures. If you decide to participate in this research study, you will 
have an in-person or phone screening with a member of the research team and you will be 
asked to complete questionnaires. We will ask you about your health concerns, pain levels, and 
technology experiences. You will also be asked questions about possible current and past 
psychological or emotional difficulties and substance use. This is done because such problems

information for people that you know that would help us be able to get in touch with you. If you
do not meet eligibility criteria during this in-person screening, you will be excluded from
participation. If you meet eligibility criteria, you will be asked to participate in the initial research
phase of the study.
Initial Research Phase. You will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to one of two 
groups (VACT-CP or Waitlist). The reason you will be randomly assigned to a group, rather than 
you choosing a group is so that researchers can determine the possible usefulness of the 
VACT-CP online intervention compared to a group who are not receiving this intervention. We 
expect that [ADDRESS_1270303]-CP Group A: (20 participants)
If you are assigned to VACT-CP, you will receive access to the online modules, which you will 
have [ADDRESS_1270304], and assessment of individual pain symptoms. Modules 2-4 will focus 
on values clarification, acceptance and willingness, mindfulness, with an emphasis on tolerance 
of pain-related experiences. Modules 5-6 will continue to this focus, and incorporate goal-
creation and committed action exercises. Module 7 will consolidate and provide feedback on 
goal-related achievements, and will focus on planning for the future.  All content will be 
presented interactively, through text-based conversations with Coach Anne that appear as short 
videos on your the screen. You will hear what Coach Anne “says”, and respond to her queries 
using forced-choice text options that will trigger different responses from Coach Anne as the 
conversation progresses, to allow the system to responsively interact in a personalized manner 
with you. During the course of VACT-CP, you will complete the following surveys at four time 
points: approximately [ADDRESS_1270305]-CP program and interview over 7 weeks, 1.5 hours for the mid-point 
survey at week 3, approximately 2 hours for the 7 week/post-intervention assessment, and
approximately 1 hour for the 1 month follow-up surveys. The online modules will take about 20
minutes of your time each week (7 modules total), and you will complete online exercises 
related to you pain, mood, values, and setting goals for the next week. A research staff member 
will also briefly check in with you at weeks 3 and 6 (approximately 15 minutes) to see if you are 
experiencing any concerns or issues with the technology that we can assist with.
Waitlist Group B: (20 participants)
If you are assigned to the waitlist, you will wait [ADDRESS_1270306]-CP online 
intervention – although it wil be your choice if you would like to use it at that time. During those 
11 weeks, you will complete the surveys at different time points. The duration of these surveys 
are the following: approximately 1.5 hour for baseline assessments, 1.5 hours for the mid-point 
survey at week 3, approximately 2 hours for the 7 week assessment, and approximately 1 hour 
for the 1 month follow-up surveys (week 11). In addition, you will be provided with a list of

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS OF TAKING PART IN THIS 
STUDY?
The intake, mid-point, and follow-up interviews and questionnaires will take time to complete.

yourself or others. If the research staff is concerned about your safety during the study, a study
clinician may evaluate you and refer you for further evaluation and/or treatment. If a clinician
determines that you are a danger to yourself or others, you may be held in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_904927]. These actions are to insure your safety and the safety of others.
At any point during the study, we will discharge you if we are concerned that staying in the study
may cause you physical or psychological harm. If the research team discharges you from the
study, we will contact [CONTACT_904930]. If you do not have a 
regular clinician, we will discuss possible sources of medical care and encourage you to seek 
treatment.

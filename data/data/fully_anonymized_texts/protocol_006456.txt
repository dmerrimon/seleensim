1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  
Study Description : This study will be a single -center,  randomized, parallel -assignment clinical 
trial to assess the efficacy of using single -use negative pressure wound 
therapy (NPWT) devices on free flap donor sites . Subjects will be 
randomized to one of two treatment arms  (NPWT single -use device  vs 
traditio nal wound dressing ).   
Objectives:  
 Primary Objective: To assess the progression of wound healing from 
Baseline through 30 days.  
Endpoint s: Primary Endpoint:  Progression of wound healing, as measured by 
[CONTACT_488333]- operative 
Day 5, post -operative Day [ADDRESS_627335] -operative Day 30. Percentage 
skin graft take will be evaluated on Day 30 by [CONTACT_11136], independent raters.  
Study Population:  It is anticipated that 20 subjects will be enrolled in this protocol. Potential 
subjects will be male or female adults over the age of 18 from the United 
States who are undergoing head and neck surgery requiring reconstruction 
with a free flap, for which the donor site will be covered with a split -
thickness skin graft (i.e., radial forearm free flap or fibula free flap).  
Phase : N/A 
Description of Study

[ADDRESS_627336] addressed the use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in free flap donor sites with mixed results. It is well  established that NPWT is safe and causes no harm, and no delay in 
healing. A previous study performed at UAB showed that NPWT in complex Head & Neck Surgery reconstruction is safe, including free flap donor sites. There have been studies that state the ra te of 
tendon exposure is lower with NPWT in free flap donor sites, and studies that conclude there is no difference in complication rates. Current clinical practice is varied, often within a single institution.  
 
While no studies of NPWT in free flap donor sites have noted inferior results with its use, a primary 
reason cited for not using it is cost. Traditional NPWT using canister- based vacuum devices adds 
significant cost. The PI[INVESTIGATOR_64429] -use NPWT device (Smith & Nephew) is a relatively inexpensive, low-
profile dressing that does not require attachment to an external canister. It is battery -powered and 
disposable. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_488320] -thickness skin -grafting to free flap donor sites 
shows good results with minimal intra- operative ef fort compared to traditional bandaging. We would 
like to prospectively investigate the use of this low- cost NPWT device and compare it directly to the 
traditional post -op dressing method.

PI[INVESTIGATOR_488327] a small, lightweight, portable  suction 
device consisting of an electric motor driven, twin -diaphragm, vacuum pump  connected to a super -
abso rbent, gentle adhesive dressing. The pump, dressing and secondary  fixations strips are supplied 
sterile and single use. The dressing is applied to the wound and  secondary fixation strips are placed over 
the outside edges to help hold the dressing in place.  When the suction pump is turned on, air is pulled 
out of the dressing creating negative  pressure and drawing excess fluid from the wound into the 
dressing. The pump is battery  operated and is supplied with two AA lithium batteries which provide up 
to 168 hours (7  days) of battery life depending upon leak rate. The batteries can be replaced if required. 
The pump is programmed to stop working after 168 hours (7 days) of use and will not re -start after this 
time, even with new batteries. Negative pressure wil l not be applied at this point.

5.2 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 (parallel assignment) into the two treatment groups. The next subject to be randomized into a trial will receive the treatment corresponding to the next free number in the 
Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.[ADDRESS_627342] to the randomized part of the trial has been confirmed.  
 
5.3 STUDY INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE  
Define how adherence to the protocol (e.g., administration of study intervention, use of device, ) will be 
assessed, and verified (if applicable, e.g., plasma assays , electronic monitoring devices, daily diaries ). 
Include a discussion of what documents are mandatory to comple te (e.g., participant drug log) and what 
source documents/records will be used to calculate study intervention compliance.   
 
For both the Treatment Group and the Control Group , the dressings will remain in place until post -op 
day (POD) #5. Following dressing removal on POD #5, participants in both groups will be given identical wound management instructions. Photographs of each participant’s healing wound will be obtained on 
POD #5 (+1 day) and on their first post -op clinic visit, approximately POD #14 -21, and at POD #30 (+7 
days). Participants who do not come to their designated follow -up appointments will be dropped from 
the dataset.  
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PAR TICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
 
6.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
Discontinuation from the study intervention  (PI[INVESTIGATOR_488328])  does not mean discontinuation 
from the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated  by [CONTACT_17143].   If a clinically sig nificant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from 
baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in 
participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an adverse 
event (AE).  
 
The data to be collected at the time of study intervention discontinuation will include the following:  
• Wound photograph  
• Assessment of adverse events  
• Assessment of concomitant medications  
 
6.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  or withdraw a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation  in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
participant  
Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized an d 
receive the study intervention , and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued  from the 
study  will not be replaced.  
Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.[ADDRESS_627343] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
• The site will  attempt to contact [CONTACT_488335]/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
These contact [CONTACT_13140] ’s medical record or study file.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason o f lost to follow -up.

7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
7.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).]  
 
7.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investiga tor or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• a life-threatening adverse event (of note, the term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• inpati ent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug depe ndency or drug abuse.  
 
7.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AE s) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severi ty.  
 
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.0 
 21 Nov 2017 
  9 • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATI ONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention  assessed  by [CONTACT_237357]/her clinical judgment. 
The degree of certai nty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the 
study product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonab le possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset,  or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21190] ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
7.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs 
occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  deteriorates at any 
time during the study, it will be recorded as a n AE.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The S tudy Coordinator  will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs 
since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.[ADDRESS_627345] 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evi dence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed until s atisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_488329]. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
Primary Endpoint(s): Progression of wound healing, as measured by [CONTACT_488336] -operative Day 5, post -operative Day [ADDRESS_627346] -operative Day 30. 
Percentage skin graft take will be evaluated on Day 30 by [CONTACT_11136], independent raters.  
 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
Our statistics indicate that assuming an 80% graft take, the number of patients needed for an appropriately powered study (80%) would be 44 patients in each group ; however, we p lan to only 
recruit 20 participants total, making this more of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_488330]’s worthwhile to pursue a larger, prospective randomized controlled trial, given the costs associated with the devices to be used in this 
study.  
 
 
9 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
9.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1.1  INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS PROVIDED TO 
PARTICIPANTS 
Consent forms describing in detail the study intervention , study procedures, and risks are given to the 
participant  and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study intervention .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Consent forms will be Institutional 
Single -Use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for Free Flap Donor Sites  Version 1.[ADDRESS_627347] ( IRB)-approved and the participant  will be asked to read and review the document. T he 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant  and answer any questions that may arise. 
A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the  particip ant’s comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions 
prior to signing.  The participant s should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant  will sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study.  Participant s must be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice.  A copy of the in formed consent document will be given to the participant s for their records. 
The informed consent process will be conducted and  documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participan t undergoes any study -specific  procedures.  The rights 
and welfare of the participant s will be protected by [CONTACT_21223].  
9.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This stud y may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable 
cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_488337].  If the study is prematurely 
terminated or suspended, the  Principal Investigator ( PI) will promptly inform study participants, the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or 
suspension.  Stud y participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study 
visit schedule.  
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable  
• Determination that  the primary endpoint has been met  
• Determination of futilit y

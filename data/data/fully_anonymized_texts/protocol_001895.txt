This clinical study will engage approximately  16clinic sites to enroll approximately  
160 subjects with approximately  10 - 15 subjects per site. 
Subjects will be expected to attend 4

Follow -
up, M onth 1 Follow - up, and Month 3 Follow up/Exit. The total expected duration of 
participation for each subject is approximately  3-[ADDRESS_361296].  
 
Subjects will wear the lenses while awake in a daily wear modality . CLEAR CARE will be

Data from a subset of subjects in the CL Y935 -C010 study  will be com bined with data from 
this study . This combined set will serve as the basis for all planned analy ses for the primary  
and secondary  effectiveness objectives. Subjects in CL Y935 -C010 will be included in the 
combined set only  if they satisfy  the following crit erion:

12.2 Analysis Sets
12.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y anal ysis set on a treatment -emergent basis.
As such, the safety  anal ysis set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any stud y lenses
evaluated in this study , 
For treatment- emergent safety analy ses, subjects/ey es will be categorized 
under the actual study  lenses exposed.
12.2.2 Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (F AS) is the set of all randomized subjects who are exposed to any  study
lenses evaluated in this study , , and who have at least one 
post-baseline ( post-Dispense) CL CDV A.

The per protocol (PP) analy sis set is a subset of F AS and excludes all data/subjects that have 
met any  of the critical deviation or evaluability  criteria identified in the DEP .
12.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic information, recent lens -wearing experience (including wear modality  and 
wear success), and habitual lens information will be presented b y lens group and overall.
Counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables such as sex, age group, 
race, an ethnicity . Number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum will 
bepresented for continuous variables such as age.
12.4 Effectiveness Analyses
This study  defines 1 primary , 1 secondary ,  
 
 
 
 
 
 
12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint(s)
The primary  effectiveness objective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y of 
 compared to 
Biofinity  in mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow-up.
The primary  endpoint is the mean CL CDV A at Week 1 Follow- up. The corresponding 
assessment is collected with study  lenses, in Snellen, for each ey e. Conversion will be made 
to the logMAR scale. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(in logMAR scale) for noninferiority :
H0: μ(T)− μ(C)≥ 0.10
Ha: μ(T)− μ(C)< 0.10

where μ(T)andμ(C)denote the Week [ADDRESS_361317] lenses, respectively , on the logMAR scale .
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Methods
A mixed ef fects repeated measures model will be utilized to t est these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit (Dispense, W eek 1 Follow -up, Month 1 Follow -up, and 
Month 3 Follow -up), and lens -by-visit interaction as fixed ef
fects,  
 Within-subject correlation due to eye will 
also be accounted for in the model. Lens dif ference ( minus Biofinity) and the 
corresponding two- sided 95% CI  will be computed for 1 -Week Follow -up. Noninferiorit y in 
CLCDVA will be declared if the upper confidence limit is less than 0.10.
12.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints
The secondary  effectiveness o bjective is to demonstrate noninferiorit y of 
 compared 
to Biofinity  in the percentage of subjects achieving distance V A 20/20 or better ,in each ey e, 
at Week 1 Follow -up.
The corresponding endpoint is the percentage (proportion) of subjects with CL CDVA of 
20/20 or better , measured monocularly , in both OD and OS at Week 1 Follow -up.
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.10 
(10%) for noninferiorit y.
H0: P(T)– P (C)≤ -0.10
Ha: P(T)– P (C)> -0.10

Week1 Follow -up in each ey e (OD and OS) for and Biofinity  contact [CONTACT_13276], 
respectivel y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Methods
A binary  variable will be defined for each subject to indicate whether the CLCDV A at Week 1 
Follow -up is no worse than 20/20 in both OD and OS, and the corresponding proportion will 
be computed for each lens using the number of subjects as the denominator .

Device Deficiencies
There are no safet y hypotheses planned in this study . The focus of the safet y anal ysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of AE as well as the other listed

All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs informed consent to study  exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular

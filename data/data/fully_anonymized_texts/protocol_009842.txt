Amendment Rationale  
The quantification of radium -223 radioactivity in Xofigo ® is based on the primary 
standardization performed by [CONTACT_194650] (NIST).  
The NIST Standard Reference Material is used to calibrate the instruments in production and 
quality control of both the drug substance and  drug product.  Additionally, the calibrated 
instruments in production at the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE, Norway) are used to 
prepare the NIST traceable radium -223 reference material, which are then sent to the treatment 
sites (e.g., nuclear medi cine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial setting of their dose 
calibrators, to allow verification of the patient dose.  A reassessment of the primary 
standardization was initiated by [CONTACT_194651].  A discrepancy of approximately 10% between the 
published NIST primary standardization (Cessna, 2010, NIST 2010) and current measurements 
was confirmed and a revised NIST primary reference standard has been issued (Zimmerman, 
2015, NIST update).  As a result of the revised NIST primary standardization, an a daption of the 
numerical description of patient dose and the description of radioactive concentration of the drug 
product solution becomes necessary.  This concerns Xofigo® for commercial use and product 
used in clinical trials.   
After the implementation of the new standard (NIST update) the numerical description of the 
patient dose will be adjusted from 50 kBq/kg to 55 kBq/kg, and the numerical description of the 
radioactivity in the vial will be changed from 1,000 kBq/mL to 1,100  kBq/mL  
The values in this protocol have been revised as per the [LOCATION_002] National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization update.  
Bayer has submitted a variation application to the FDA.   The current standard (NIST 2010), dial 
setting and dose will remain in effect  for this study until  Bayer has confirmed  the unique 
implementation date in the 2nd quarter of  2016 as agreed with FDA and notified  the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_194606]:

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol Title : A Randomized Phase 2 Study of Sipuleucel -T With or Without Radium -223 IN 
Men With Asymptomztic or Minimally Symptomatic Bone -Metastatic Castrate -Resistant 
Prostate Cancer  
 
Protocol Number : 
 
Phase: II 
 
Study Centers: 4-[ADDRESS_230894], Dosage Form, Route, and Dose Regimen:  
 
Radium -223 (Xofigo®) is an alpha -emitting radioisotope developed by [CONTACT_194652].  Radium -
223 is  indicated for treatment of men with castrate -resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) with 
symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease . The approved dose and 
schedule of radium -223 is 50 kBq  (or 1.35 microcurie) (55 kBq/kg (or 1.49 microc urie)) after 
implemen tation of  the NIST update)  per kg  body weight  intravenous (IV) infused at 4 week 
interval for 6 injections.  
 
Sipuleucel -T (Provenge ®) is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to 
stimulate an immune response against prostate cancer. Sipuleucel -T is indicated for use in 
patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic CRPC (mCRPC).  A dose of 
sipuleucel -T is prepared using PBMCs from a single leukapheresis procedure. A minimum of 50 
million antigen presenting cells ( APCs , the biologically active component of sipuleucel -T) are 
administered via a single IV infusion. A complete treatment of sipuleucel -T will inc lude 3 doses 
of autologous cells, infused at approximately 2 -week intervals.  
 
Primary Objective   
 
• To determine whether addition of radium -223 to sipuleucel -T enhances immune response 
to sipuleucel -T measured by [CONTACT_194653]2024 -specific T -cell prolifera tion compared 
with sipuleucel -T alone in men asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic bone -metastatic 
CRPC  
 
Secondary Immune Objectives  
 
• To evaluate peripheral antigen -specific T -cell proliferation over  time 
• To evaluate peripheral antigen specific T-cell activation  to sipuleucel -T over time

The values for radium -[ADDRESS_230895] standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 • To evaluate antigen specific antibody response  to sipuleucel -T over time  
• To evaluate the  sipuleucel -T product immune parameter s 
 
Secondary Clinical Objectives  
 
• To evaluate  safety of combined  use of radium -223 and sipul eucel -T.  
• To evaluate PSA50 response (at least a 50% decline in PSA)   
• To evaluate time to radiographic  or clinical progression .  
Study Design and Duration:  
 
This is a randomized  study designed to assess the antigen -specific immune response of 
sipule ucel-T when administered with or without radium -223.   
 
Eligible subjects will be registered and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sipuleucel -T 
and radium -223 or sipuleucel -T alone ; 
 
Arm 1 : 6 infusions of radium -223 with 3 infusions of sipuleucel -T starting after second  
dose of radium -223 
 
Arm 2: [ADDRESS_230896] 1.5 to 2.0 blood volume leukapheresis, followed 
approximately 3 days later by [CONTACT_194654] -T. This process will  occur a total of 3 
times at  approximately 2 -week intervals . Subjects in Arm 1 will receive a total of 6 infusions of 
radium -223 at IV dose of 50 kBq/kg  (55 kBq/kg after implementation of the NIST update)  at 4-
week interval  
  
Research visits  will be schedu led at screening, at each  radium -223 infusion, prior to each 
leukapheresis (preleukapheresis visit), and week 32, 45 and 58 for Arm 1 (radium -223 and 
sipuleucel -T combination arm) and at screening, prior to each leukapheresis (preleukapheresis 
visit), and  week 6, 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 for Arm 2 (sipuleucel -T alone arm)  for physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECOG performance status, adverse event (AE) monitoring, anticancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], first opi[INVESTIGATOR_194607] -related pain, and  laboratory tests. Serum  PSA will be  
assessed at baseline, and week  16, 32, 45, and 58 for Arm 1 and at baseline, and week 10, 26, 39, 
and 52 for Arm 2.  There is a ±  [ADDRESS_230897] (bone scan) or Na -F PET or C11 acetate PET 
and abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI will be obtained at screening and week 16, 32, 45, and [ADDRESS_230898] study visit , imaging 
studies will be obta ined according to the participating institution’s standard and/or at the 
investigator’s discretion.

 Statistical Considerations   
 
The study is designed to test the null hypothesis of no difference  in immune response to 
sipuleucel -T evaluated on the basis of PA2024 -stimulated T cell proliferation via 3H-thymidine  
uptake between sipuleucel -T alone  and sequential administration of radium -223.  
 
For primary endpoint, PA2024 -specific 3H-thymidine uptake was selected because it has 
demonstrated the highest signal to noise ratio and showed the strongest correlation with OS of all 
cellular and humoral assays evaluated in prior studies of sipuleucel -T.

 1.[ADDRESS_230930] common malignancy in men in the [LOCATION_002], with estimated 238, 
590 new cases and 29,720 deaths in 2013  [3]. Approximately 80% of prostate cancer cases are 
diagnosed when the cancer is still confined to the primary site  (localized prostate cancer) . But 
12% prostate cancers are diagnosed as locally advanced  stage and 4% as metastatic disease.   
 
Localized prostate cancer  can be treated with various local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194612]. However, approximately 20% to 40% of patients who have 
been treated with a curative intent develop disease recurrence  [4]. While some select ive patients 
with PSA -only recurrence with no evidence of disseminated disease can be treated with local 
salvage therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], majority of patients with recurrent disease require systemic therapy such as 
ADT with or without concomitant  antian drogen agents. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_194613] , virtually all patients will progress  to metastatic disease, the disease condition called 
metastatic castrate -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). When patients develop mCRPC, the 
disease is considered noncurable an d lethal with a median  survival around [ADDRESS_230931] been approved by [CONTACT_7214] (FDA) for the 
treatment of mCRPC. While the approval of multiple agents have resulted in increased overall 
survival and improved quality of life  and provided wider therapeutic options for the patients , it 
has created challenges of establishing the optimal use of these therapeutics including the optimal 
sequence and possible combination of those agents.      
 
Sipuleucel -T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy product designed to stimulate a n immune 
response against prostate cancer . Sipuleucel -T has improved survival in patients with 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC in 3 phase III trials  [5-7]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_194614], majority of patients treated with sipuleucel -T do not experience radiographic or PSA 
response, making the assessmen t of treatment response difficult . Furthermore, there is no 
established clinical or molecular marker  to predict the response to sipuleucel -T immune therapy. 
However recently published analysis of immune responses from these 3 trials showed that 
antigen -specific immune responses to sipuleucel -T, both humoral and T -cell response s, correlate 
with survival benefit  [8], confirming the immune -based mechanism of action of sipuleucel -T and 
also suggesting  the possibility that producing a stronger immune response may translate to the 
better clinical outcome.  
 
It has been suggested that immune modulation can be enhanced by [CONTACT_194657]  a 
variety of mechanisms . Radiation -induced cell deat h has been shown to stimulate tumor -specific

The values for radium -[ADDRESS_230932] standardization

 immune responses by [CONTACT_194658]  [9]. This synergistic a ntitumor effect of 
combined immune therapy and radiation therapy has been evaluated in various cancer types. In 
prostate cancer, a  phase I/II study of i pi[INVESTIGATOR_194615] m CRPC  
showed a promising antitumor effect including PSA de cline and radiographic tumor reduction .  
 
Similar  to external  radiotherapy , radiopharmaceutical agent also has shown to upregulate tumor 
antigen s in prostate cancer model s. In a study by [CONTACT_194659], al., the exposure to  beta particle 
emitting radiopharmaceutical, s amarium -153-ethylenediaminetetrame -thylenephosphonate 
(153Sm-EDTMP), resulted in upregulation of the prostate cancer antigens, such as PSMA and 
PAP [10]. Such 153Sm-EDTMP -induced phenotypic changes in tumor cells rendered these tumor 
cells more susceptible to T cell –mediated killing.  
 
Radium -223 is  an alpha-emitting radioisotope which is a bone -seeking calcium mimetic. It 
selectively  targets the area with increased bone turnover , especially within the microenvironment 
of osteoblastic or sclerotic metastases  [11]. It has been approved by [CONTACT_194660][INVESTIGATOR_194616]  [12]. Unlike  beta particl e 
emitting radiopharmaceutical s, radium -223 emits high -energy alpha particles of short range 
(<100 μm) thus saving the  surrounding healthy tissues  and significantly reducing unwanted 
myelotoxicity  [13]. 
 
Based on the immune -modulatory effects of radiotherapy  and radiopharmaceutical  shown in the 
previous studies , we hypothesized that combined use of radium -223 and sipuleucel -T can 
enhance the sipuleucel -T-induced immune response, which translates to better clinical outcome. 
Since more than 90% of patients with  mCRPC have bone metastases  [14], this approach can be 
widely applied to early stage of mCRPC when patients are asymptomatic or minimally 
symp tomatic from the bone lesions when the greatest clinical benefit can be obtained with 
immune -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  [15].

 Sipuleucel -T was approved in the [LOCATION_002] in 201 3 for the treatment of men with 
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076] D9902B (IMPACT), 512 
patients were randomized 2:1 to receive sipuleucel -T (N=341) or control (N=171)  [7]. Overall 
surviva l was longer in the sipuleucel -T group (median of 25.8 months versus 21.7 months; 
hazard ratio (HR) =0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.62, 0.98; P=0.03). More than 3,339 
infusions of sipuleucel -T and control (a product manufactured from PBMCs without a ctivation 
with the PA2024 antigen), have been administered to men with prostate cancer in clinical trials.  
 
Clinical data to support the safety of sipuleucel -T are provided from 904 subjects (sipuleucel -T, 
N=601; control, N=303) who participated in 4 multi center, randomized, double -blind, controlled 
Phase 3 studies. Three of these studies were conducted in men with mCRPC (studies D9902B, 
D9901, and D9902A), and 1 study was conducted in men with androgen dependent prostate 
cancer (ADPC)  [5-7;16] . In the 4 randomized Ph ase 3 studies, AEs reported in ≥ 20% of all 
subjects were chills, fatigue, pyrexia, and back pain. The most common AEs (observed in ≥ 5% 
of sipuleucel -T subjects as well as at least twice the rate of that in control subjects) included 
chills, pyrexia, head ache, myalgia, influenza -like illness, and hyperhidrosis. The majority of 
these events occurred within 1 day of infusion; were grade 1 or 2 in severity; and were generally 
of short duration (i.e., resolved in ≤ 2 days). Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in  27.6% of 
subjects in the sipuleucel -T group, compared with 28.4% in the control group.  
 
1.2.2   Radium-223 
 
Radium -223 ( Bayer Pharmaceuticals, NJ) is a calcium mimetic which localizes to bone at areas 
with increased bone turnover. Radium -223 decays via a chain of short -lived daughter nuclides to 
lead, producing four alpha -particles  [13]. The high energy of alpha particle induces effective 
double stranded DNA breaks with short range of less than 100 μm, minimizing  
myelo suppression and causing limited effects on normal tissue.  
 
Radium -223 was approved by [CONTACT_55257] o n Ma y 15, 2013  based on the interim results from a 
Phase III randomized trial, the ALSYMPCA study (Alpharadin in the treatment of patients with 
symptomatic bone metastases in castration -resistant prostate cancer). In this trial, 921 patients 
who had receiv ed, were not eligible to receive, or declined docetaxel were randomly assigned in 
a 2:1 ratio to receive six injections of radium -223 (at a dose of 50 kBq per kilogram of body 
weight intravenously  (55 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST standard update)  every 4 weeks 
or matching placebo. At the interim analysis, which  involved 809 patients, radium -223, as 
compared with placebo, significantly improved overall survival (median, 14.0 months vs. 11.2 
months; HR =0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; two -sided P=0.002).  The updated analysis involving 
921 patients confirmed the radium -223 survival benefit (median, 14.9 months vs. 11.3 months; 
HR=0.70; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.83; P<0.001). The rate of AEs was consistently lower in the radium -
223 group than in the placebo group f or all AEs (93% vs. 96%), grade 3 or 4 AEs (56% vs.

 62%), and serious AEs (47% vs. 60%).  There w ere no clinically meaningful differences in the 
frequency of grade [ADDRESS_230936] 5% of patients in the radium -223 group or the placebo group, the respective 
frequencies were as follows: disease progression (11% and 12%), bone pain (10% and 16%), 
anemia (8% and 9%), and spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377] (4% and 5%). Also a significantly higher 
percentage of patients who received radium -223 had a meaningful improvement in the quality of 
life according to the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Prostate (FACT -P) total score 
during the period  of study -drug administration (25% vs. 16%, P=0.02).

5.0   STUD Y TREATMENTS  
 
5.1   Radium -223 
 
5.1.1   Dosage Forms and Strength  
 
Radium -223 is available in single -use vials containing 6 mL of solution at a concentration of 
1,000 kBq/m L (27 microcurie/mL)  (1,100 kBq/mL  (29.7 microcurie/mL) after implementation 
of the  NIST update)  at the reference date with a total radioactivity of 6,000kBq/vial  (162 
microcurie/vial)  (6,600 kBq/vial  (178 microcurie/vial)  after implementation of the NIST update)  
at the reference date.  
 
5.1.2   Preparation  
 
Radium -223 is a ready -to-use solution and should not be diluted or mixed with any solutions. 
Each vial is for single use only.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container 
permi t. 
 
5.1.3   Dosage  
 
The dose regimen of radium -223 is 50 kBq  (1.35 microcurie) (55 kBq /kg (1. 49 microcurie /kg) 
after implementation of the NIST update)  per kg body weight, given at 4 week intervals for 6 
injections.

Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -[ADDRESS_230956] standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
  
The volume to be administered to a given patient should be calculated using the:  
 
– Patient’s body weight (kg)  
– Dosage level 50 kBq/kg body weight (55 kBq/kg after implementation of the NIST 
update) or 1.35 microcurie/kg body weight  (1.[ADDRESS_230957] update)  
– Radioactivity concentration of the product (1,000 kBq/mL ; 27 microcurie/mL  (1,100 
kBq/ mL after implementation of the NIST update ;29.7 microcurie/mL) at the reference 
date 
– Decay correction factor to correct for physical decay of radium -223. 
 
The total amount ( volume to be drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a patient should be 
calculated as follows:   
 
Volume to be administered (mL) = Body weight (kg) x dose (50 kBq/kg b.w)a 
                                                          DK factor x 1,000 kB q (0.027 mCi)/mLb 
 
a 55 kBq/kg after implantation of the NIST update  
b 1,100 kBq  (29.7 microcurie i)/mL after implantation of the NIST update  
 
Decay Correction Factor Table  
 
 
 
The Decay Correction Factor Table is corrected to [ADDRESS_230958] Time (CST). To 
determine the decay correction factor, count the number of days before or after the reference 
date. The Decay Correction Factor Table includes a correction to account  for the 7 hour time

 difference  between 12 noon Central European Time (CET) at the site of manufacture and [ADDRESS_230960], which is 7 hours earlier than CET.  
 
Immediately before and after administration, the net patient dose of administered  radium -223 
shou ld be determined by  [CONTACT_101429] a National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST) traceable radium -
[ADDRESS_230961] ( a new reference vial will be sent to each center correspondi ng to the updated NIST 
reference material ) and corrected for decay using  the date and time of calibration. The dose 
calibrator must be calibrated with nationally recognized standards, carried out at  the time of 
commissioning, after any maintenance procedur e that could affect the dosimetry and at intervals 
not to exceed  one year.  
 
Each center must perform the Radium Ra 223 dichloride dial setting on their relevant dose 
calibrator(s) (upon notification by [CONTACT_194662]). The current dial settings are to remain in effect until 
Bayer obtains FULL approval from the FDA for implementation. In preparation for 
implementation of the NEW dial setting, the clinical study center will recei ve a sealed vial 
labeled NIST standard containing a Radium Ra [ADDRESS_230962] Standardization Update  
 
The qualification of radium -223 radioactive in Xofigo (radium -223 dichloride; BAY 88 -8223) is 
based on the primary standardization performed by [CONTACT_101430]. National Institute of Standards 
and Technology prepares the standard reference material (SRM) using an official dial setting 
(primary standardization) as published [20]. The NIST SRM is used to calibrate the instruments 
in production and quality control for both the drug substance and drug product. Additionally, the 
NIST SRM is used to prepare the NIST traceable Ra -223 reference materials which are then sent 
to the en d-users (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial -setting of 
their dose calibrators, to allow verification of the patient dose.  
 
In 2014, NIST performed a re -assessment of the primary standardization based on preliminary 
infor mation suggesting a potential discrepancy of approximately 8 -10% between the published 
NIST primary standardization [20] and results obtained by [CONTACT_101431] 
([LOCATION_008], [LOCATION_013], Japan). After completion of the re -assessment, NI ST reported their 
findings [21] and had issued a revised NIST SRM in 2015. The discrepancy in the NIST

The values for radium -[ADDRESS_230963] standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 standardization was determined to be -9.5% between activity values obtained using the old 
reference standard relative to the new primary standardization.  Consequently , the current 
numerical values need to be corrected by [CONTACT_3450] +10.5%  
 
The current NIST standard for radium -[ADDRESS_230964] standardization for radium -223 dichloride, 
which should be d ocumented on the appropriate study forms.  
 
The change in the numerical description of the patient’s dose, product strength and labeled vial 
activity does not impact the safety or efficacy of Xofigo. The change in the NIST radium -[ADDRESS_230965]  on subjects; dose subjects are receiving, and will continue to receive. 
Subjects will receive the same actual dose and volume that was studied in Study [ZIP_CODE] (BCI -06 
dosimetry study) and is associated with the proven safety and efficacy of radium -[ADDRESS_230966]. 
The formula for the calculation of the volume to be administered has to be changed respectively. 
(see dose section) Subjects who are on -treatment at the  time the new NIST reference standard 
goes into effect should be notified of this change and should be required to sign a Patient 
Information Sheet to acknowledge that they have received information on the updated NIST 
standard calibration. All patients ra ndomized after the new reference standard is in effect should 
sign a revised Informed Consent Form that contains the updated NIST standardization.  
 
5.1.5   Administration  
 
Radium -223 should be administered by [CONTACT_90009] 1 minute. The IV access line or 
cannula should be flushed with isotonic saline before and after injection of radium -223. 
 
5.1.6   Handling  and Patient Protection  
 
Radium -223 is primarily an alpha emitter, with a 95.3% fraction of energy emitted as alpha -
particles. The fraction emitted as beta -particles is 3.6%, and the fraction emitted as gamma -
radiation is 1.1%. The external radiation exposure associated with handl ing of patient doses is 
expected to be low, because the typi[INVESTIGATOR_194618] 8,000 kBq (216

 used in connection with the prep aration or administration are to be treated as radioactive waste 
and should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. The gamma radiation associated 
with the decay of radium -[ADDRESS_230968] to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organization.  
 
Radium -223 should be handled by [CONTACT_30799] a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate asepti c precautions should be taken.  
 
Radiation protection  
 
The administration of radium -223 is associated with potential risks to other persons (e.g., 
medical staff, caregivers and patient’s household members) from radiation or contamination 
from spi[INVESTIGATOR_194620], feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection 
precautions must be taken in accordance with national and local regulations.  
 
For drug handling  
 
Follow the normal working procedures for the handling of radiopharmaceuticals and use  
universal precautions for handling and administration such as gloves and barrier gowns when 
handling blood and bodily fluids to avoid contamination. In case of contact [CONTACT_194663], the 
affected area should be flushed immediately with water. In the e vent of spi[INVESTIGATOR_194621] -223, 
the local radiation safety officer should be contact[CONTACT_194664]. A complexing agent such as 
0.01 M ethylene -diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution is recommended to remove 
contamination.  
 
For patient care  
 
Whenever possible, patients should use a toilet and the toilet should be flushed several times 
after each use. When handling bodily fluids, simply wearing gloves and hand washing wi ll 
protect caregivers. Clothing soiled with radium -223 or patient fecal matter or urine should be 
washed promptly and separately from other clothing.

5.2.[ADDRESS_230972] Quality assessment   
 
Prior to infusion, small samples (3%  to 4%) of cellular components from pre and post -culture 
(PA2024) cells will be used to assess product potency as part of the normal sipuleucel -T 
manufacturing process. Sipuleucel -T quality assessments include total TNC count, CD54+ cell 
count and CD54 upr egulation.  
 
5.2.4   Sipuleucel -T Infusion  
 
Each sipuleucel -T dose is released for infusion approximately 3 days following the leukapheresis 
procedure. Subjects will be infused according to the infusion guidelines (available at; 
http://www.dendreon.com/pre scribing -information.pdf ). 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_230973]’s leukapheresis procedure fails, sipuleucel -T does not meet quality 
release specifications, or infusion is not possible for any other reason, the subject may be 
scheduled to undergo a repeat leukapheresis procedure. A minimum of [ADDRESS_230974] be  repeated within the 5 days prior to the next leukapheresis

study site/institution. A record of patients who fail to meet entry criteria (ie, screen failures) will 
be maintained by [CONTACT_194674]. Patient registration must be complete before beginning 
any treatment or study activities.  
 
Prior to prot ocol enrollment and initiation of treatment, subjects must sign and date an IRB -
approved consent form.  To register a patient, the following documents must be completed a nd 
faxed or emailed to the Lead Center Program Coordinator:  
 
• Signed patient consent fo rm 
• Registration Form  
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_194627], baseline laboratory studies including CBC 
with differential, liver and kidney function tests, testosterone, PSA , and CT/bone scan .  
Other materials may also be sent if considered pertinent for confirming patient eligibility.  
 
The Lead Center will review the documents to confirm eligibility.  To complete the registration 
process the Lead Center will:  
 
• Assign a patient study number  
• Register the patient on the study with SKCCC’s Clini cal Research Office  
• Fax or e -mail the patient study number to the participating site

unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal la boratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the treatment, whether or not considered related to the treatment. 
Adverse events include exacerbation of a pre -existing illness, an increase in frequency or 
intensity of a pre -existing epis odic event or condition, a condition detected or diagnosed after 
product administration (even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study) or a 
continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at screening that worsen following the sta rt of 
the study.  
 
7.1   Categories for Ranking Severity of Adverse Events  
 
The NCI CTCAE [2] will be used to score AE severity. In general, the following general severity 
definitions apply:  
 
48 
 
Version 4.0 Date: 08/21/2020                                                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
The values for radium -[ADDRESS_231029] standardization 
update (agreed on 17 Mar 2015)  
 Mild (Grade 1):  The AE results in mi ld, easily tolerated symptoms, or is asymptomatic 
with clinical or diagnostic observations only. Intervention is not 
usually indicated.  
Moderate (Grade 2):  The AE produces moderate symptoms with discomfort sufficient to 
interfere with some aspect of the s ubject’s normal daily activity. 
Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is required.  
Severe (Grade 3):  The AE is medically significant but not immediately life threatening, 
results in discomfort or disability which is incapacitating and prevents 
most  normal daily activities, clearly damaging to the health, requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194632].  
Life Threatening  
(Grade 4):  The AE could reasonably result in death unless immediate medical 
intervention is undertaken.  
Fatal (Grade 5):  The AE results in death.  
 
7.2   Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Treatments  
 
The following categories will be used to determine related ness of AEs to study treatments:  
 
None:  The AE is clearly related to other factors, such as the subject’s clinical

Adverse event information will be collected continuously throughout the duration of the study . 
Participants will be instructed to notify their treating provider of any new signs or symptoms, and 
providers will actively assess patients for adverse events at each visit (including by [CONTACT_194679]). The investigator will assess eac h AE for its severity and for its relationship to 
the study drug, and all events Grade 1 or higher will be documented on CRFs and then reported 
as described above within the required time frame. Any AE occurring while a patient is on study 
(i.e. after info rmed consent has been signed) or within [ADDRESS_231032] keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_194635], including 
correspondence with the IRB and/or FDA, for as long as required to comply with national and

7.4   Serious Adverse Events  
 
An SAE is defined as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life threatening adverse drug experience, subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194636], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a 
congenit al anomaly/birth defect. An important medical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical o r surgical intervention  
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.

SI and use these data in a t test to compare the two groups.   
 
A secondary analysis will look at the trends in SI over time.  This analysis will consist of a 
repeated measurement analysis of immune response over time evaluated using PA2024 -
stimulated T cell proliferation via 3H-thymidine uptake based on the immune res ponse 
population. The logarithm of response will be used for analysis. Fixed -effect terms in the model 
will include treatment arm, visit as a class effect, and a treatment -by-visit interaction. The 
correlation of responses across time within a subject will  be modeled using several candidate 
variance -covariance structures including unstructured, compound symmetry, heterogeneous 
compound symmetry, autoregressive, and heterogeneous autoregressive. The variance -
covariance structure providing the smallest Bayesi an information criteria will be selected for the 
final model. Fixed -effect terms in the model will be tested for significance using type III sums of 
squares. The formal test for difference between the studies will be based on the p -value for the 
treatment effect unless we find a significant treatment -by-visit interaction (p < 0.05), in which 
case by -visit treatment comparisons will be made using appropriate contrast statements.

Subjects who are on -treatment at the time the new NIST reference standard goes into effect 
should be notified of this change and should be required to sign a Patient Information Sheet to 
ackno wledge that they have received information on the updated NIST standard calibration. All 
patients randomized after the new reference standard is in effect should sign a revised Informed 
Consent Form that contains the updated NIST standardization.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_231066] Confidentiality  
 
Patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health information generated 
from this study may be used for research purposes. After this discussion, they will be asked to 
sign a Notice of Privacy Practice res earch authorization/HIPAA form. The original signed 
documents will become part of the patient’s medical records, and each patient will receive a copy 
of the signed documents. The use and disclosure of protected health information will be limited 
to the ind ividuals described in the research authorization form. The research authorization form 
must be completed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_194643].  
 
9.7   Good Clinical Practice  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH for GCP and the appropriate regulatory 
requirement(s).  The investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the 
study drug as described in the protocol and Investigator’s Brochure.   Essential clinical 
documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the integrity of the 
data collected.  Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for 
the duration of the study and retained acc ording to appropriate regulations.   
 
9.8   Ethical Considerations  
 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP guidelines established by [CONTACT_194688], and the ethical standards set forth in the Declar ation

medical record). Source documentation will be made available to support the patient research 
record. Study monitors will review entries on the CRFs at regular intervals, comparing the 
content with source documents.  
 
10.5   Study Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
 
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan (12/6/2012). The 
SKCCC Compliance Monitoring Program will provide external monitoring for JHU -affiliated  
sites in accordance with SKCCC DSMP (Version 6.0, 02/21/2019). The SMC Subcommittee will  
determine the level of patient safety risk and level/frequency of monitoring.  
The Clinical Research Office will perform an audit after the first subject has been treated and 
then periodically depending on the rate of accrual and prior audit results. All trial monitoring and 
reporting will be reviewed annually by [CONTACT_194690].  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_194644]. Data must be reviewed to assure the 
validity of data, as well as, the safety of the subjects. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_194645], review safety reports, and clin ical trial efficacy endpoints and to confirm that the safety 
outcomes favor continuation of the study.”

investigator will maintain all source documents, study -related d ocuments, and the CRFs.  
 
Because the length of time required for retaining records depends upon a number of regulatory 
and legal factors, documents should be stored until the investigator is notified that the documents 
may be destroyed. In this study, rec ords are to be retained and securely stored for a minimum of 
7 years after the completion of all study activities.  
 
10.8   Publication policy  
 
Bayer recognizes the right of the investigator to publish results upon completion of the 
study.   All Investigator  Initiated studies are the property of the investigator and publications 
generated from such studies are at the discretion of the investigator. Bayer strongly encourages 
investigators to publish the results of all studies supported through the Investigator  Initiated 
Research (IIR) Program.  
As an important milestone to the IIR, we encourage all investigators to submit  a draft manuscript 
of the supporting publication(s) or abstract to submission for a courtesy review  prior to 
submission of the final version for publication or congress presentation.   This will be reviewed 
promptly and will not be withheld unreasonably.  All relevant aspects regarding data reporting 
and publication will be part of the contract between Bayer and the investigator/institution  
The P rincipal Investigator should ensure that the information regarding the study be publicly 
available on the internet at www.clinicaltrials.gov .

 INTRODUCTION  
 Background  
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition where gastric content reflux es 
into the esophagus and causes troublesome symptoms and/ or complications.[ADDRESS_1244787], the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)  does not close properly, allowing 
acid and other contents  of the digestive tract to move up (reflux) into the esophagus.  
GERD, which primarily manifests as heartburn, reg urgitation, or both, is a chronic 
disorder associated with substantial morbidity,  potential malignanc y and a major adverse 
impact on  quality of life.2  In industrialized nations the disease has become increasingly 
common, with an estimated prevalence  of 7% in the general population based on the 
presence of  daily symptoms.[ADDRESS_1244788] is a cid suppression with proton- pump 
inhibitors (PPIs) .  PPIs are a group of drugs  whose main action is a pronounced and 
long-lasting reduction of gastric acid  production. They are the most potent inhibitors 
of acid secretion available.  Although PPIs remove most of the acid from the reflux, 
these medications do not eliminate reflux.  As a result, PPIs are most effective for 
heartburn and progressively less effective for regurgitation, chest pain and extra -
esophageal symptoms.[ADDRESS_1244789] failed PPI [CONTACT_497231]  (single -dose)  with confirmed 
abnormal esophageal acid exposure by [CONTACT_889067] .4,[ADDRESS_1244790] shown patients who are prescribed a higher dose of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_889044] “step down” the dose without return of symptoms  or decrease in quality of 
life.5   
In the case of persistent symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_889045], anti -reflux surgery is an alternative.  The 
LINX® Reflux Management Sy stem (LINX) is indicated for patients with abnormal 
esophageal pH testing who have persistent symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_379997].  The 
device was approved  by [CONTACT_889068] 22, 2012.  In clinical studies, 
the LINX has demonstrated improved reflux control through reduction in esophageal acid 
exposure, elimination of regurgit ation, improvement in GERD -related quality of life 
scores,  and free dom f rom daily dependence o n PPIs , while minimizing the side effects 
commonly associated with Nissen fundoplication.9-[ADDRESS_1244791] symptoms while on 
single -dose PPI s.  This  study will provide clinical data to compare the clinical outcomes 
of two different approaches for managing persistent reflux symptoms:  increased acid 
suppression therapy versus mechanical augmentation of the LES.  Since acid suppression 
does not eliminat e reflux but rather decreases the acidity of the refluxate, a mechanical 
approach may provide better reflux control and symptom improvement.15-17  The 
scientific rationale for the design of the LINX  device is based on the premise that an 
incompetent (weak)  LES will remain susceptible to gastroesophageal reflux until the LES 
barrier function is restored.  The LINX  is designed to augment the LES function and is 
placed, via a laparoscopic approach, on the external aspect of the esophagus in the region 
of the L ES.  The device is comprised of a series of titanium beads with magnetic cores 
that are linked together with independent titanium wires.  As a series, the device forms an 
annular shape  (See Section 4.1 for device description).  Based  on the premise that th e 
origin  of GERD is largely a mechanical issue of a weak or incompetent LES unable to 
prevent abnormal reflux, which may lead to  troublesome symptoms, the LINX addresses 
the mechanical dysfunction of the LES with a mechanical approach.  The commercial 
availability of PPIs and LINX is at least [ADDRESS_1244792] . 
 
Doc. No. 4959 Rev. 1 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 31 
 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to assess if LINX in comparison to double -dose 
PPIs provide s superior elimination  of moderate and severe regurgitation at 6 months  in 
patients who were refractory to single -dose PPI s at baseline . 
 Secondary Objectives  
Secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following between the randomized 
arms:  
• Impedance measurements at 6 months  
• Presence of m oderate or severe regurgitation at 12 months  
• Esophageal pH measurements  at 12 months  
• Gastroeso phageal Reflux Disease- Health Related Quality of Life (GERD -HRQL)  
scores  at 6 and 12 months  
• Reflux D isease Q uestionnaire (RDQ)  scores  at 6 and 12 months  
 
 STUDY DESIGN 
• Prospective, multicenter , randomized controlled, cross -over trial conducted at up to 
20 centers in the U.S.  
• Subjects will be randomized to either LINX or double -dose PPIs  (twice a day  dosing ) 
• Randomization 2:1 and enrollment of approximately 150 subjects (100 double -dose 
PPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 50 LINX)  
• Subjects will comp lete follow -up at 6-  and 12- months after randomization  or LINX 
implant 
• Primary endpoint evaluation will be based on 6- month data per the subject’s 
randomization assignment  
• After the [ADDRESS_1244793] symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_889046].  The device received FDA 
approval March 22, 2012.  The LINX device is a permanent implant placed at the area of 
the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and is designed to augment a weak LES and 
minimize or eliminate GERD -related symptoms.  
The LINX device consists of a series of titanium beads each with a magnetic core 
connected together with independent titanium wires to form an annular shape, whe n 
implanted (Figure 1) .  The attractive force of the magnetic beads is designed to provide 
additional strength to keep a weak LES closed.  During swallowing, the magnetic beads 
slide away from each other on the independent titanium wire “links” to allow es ophageal 
distention as the bolus passes by  (Figure 2) .  After 6 Month

The LINX System allows a surgeon, using existing laparoscopic techniques and 
instruments, to augment a weak sphincter and restore the barrier function of the LES.  
The mechanism of action for the LI NX device is to augment the sphincter’s capacity to 
resist gastric pressure by [CONTACT_711133].  For reflux to occur following 
implantation of the LINX device, gastric pressure must overcome both the native 
sphincter resistance and the magneti c bond between the LINX beads .  At rest, the LINX 
device encircles the LES with each bead resting against an adjacent bead, which avoids 
compression of the esophagus and allows the patient to belch or vomit as necessary.  
Upon swallowing, the magnetic bond betwee n the beads is overcome by [CONTACT_889069], and the device expands to accommodate a 
normal swallow (Figures 3 -5).  See Appendix A  for Instructions for Use .

LINX device creates resistance 
with magnetic forces to prevent 
the LES from opening.  Higher pressures from swallowing 
overcome the magnetic forces, 
causing the device to expand.  LINX device does not compress the 
esophageal wall.  
 
Doc. No. [ADDRESS_1244794]. The American 
Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the American College of Gastroenterology 
(ACG) recommend PPIs as first -line therapy for the treatment of severe GERD- related 
symptoms or erosive esophagitis (EE).18,19  In current clinical practice, seven PPIs are 
available and considered roughly equal in effectiveness and safety.  For the pur pose of 
standardization, all subjects in this study  random ized to  double -dose PPIs will be treated 
with omeprazole 20 mg BID (twice a day) .   
Omeprazole is a selective and irreversible proton pump inhibitor. It suppresses stomach 
acid secretion by [CONTACT_164945] H+/K+ ATPase system found at the secretory 
surface of g astric parietal cells .  The inhibitory effect of omeprazole occurs within [ADDRESS_1244795] of omeprazole on acid 
secretion will plateau after 4 days of repeated daily dosing.20  See A ppendix  B for Drug 
Information  for Omeprazole .

 Methods  of Assigning Subjects to Treatment G roup  
The study management team (Torax Medical) will allocate treatment based on a pre -
specified randomization sequence of sealed envelopes  or other method, generated by [CONTACT_889070] s group, using the study center as  a stratification parameter.  Study centers  will 
be blinded to the determinants for the randomization sequence (block size, stratification, 
etc.) 
After eligibility is documented based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the study center 
will complete and submit the “Request for Randomization” form to the st udy 
management team ( Appendix C ).  The study management team will review to confirm 
eligibility.  The next sequentially assigned sealed envelope for the study center will be 
selected and opened to conduct the randomization.  The treatment assignment will be 
documented on the Request for Randomization form and returned to site along with a 
copy of the r andomization envelope.  
All subjects randomized are irrevocably in the study, whether or not they are 
subsequently found to be eligible or actually receive the allocated treatment, and they 
should be followed until the end of the study.  
The allocated treatm ent should take place as soon as possible after randomization (on the 
same day for double -dose PPIs and  within 6 weeks for LINX).  
 
 MEASUREMENT OF CLINI CAL OUTCOMES  
 Efficacy  
6.1.[ADDRESS_1244799] elimination of moder ate or severe 
regurgitation per the Foregut Symptom Questionnaire  at 6-months compared to 
subjects treated with double -dose PPIs.  
  
 
Doc. No. 4959 Rev. 1 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 31 6.1.2 Additional Efficacy Outcomes  
• Elimination of moderate  or severe regurgitation at 12 months . 
• Esophageal pH at 12 months  (% of subjects with normalization or 50% 
reduction in total % pH<4 compared to baseline; summary statistics of 
DeMeester components at follow -up compared to baseline) . 
• GERD- HRQL total score  at 6 and 12 months  (% of subjects with at least 
50% reduction in total score compared to baseline off PPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005]; summary 
statistics of GERD -HRQL score at follow -up compar ed to baseline on and 
off PPIs).  
• RDQ score at 6 and 12 months  (summary statistics of scores at follow -up 
compared to baseline on and off PPIs) . 
• Impedance at 6 months (summary statistics of number of reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]; 
% of subjects with normal number of reflux epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) . 
 
 Side Effects  
The GERD -HRQL , Foregut Symptom Questionnaire  and RDQ  include questions to track 
potential side effects (such as diff iculty swallowing, gas/bloat, nausea, etc.).  The data  
from these questionnaires  will be analyzed to evaluate differences between the LINX and 
double -dose PPIs at 6 months  as well as stepped -down dose of PPI s at 12 months . 
 Safety  
Rate of occurrence of s erious adverse events (SAEs) related to LINX or  PPIs will be 
evaluated throughout the duration of the study. No formal statistical hypothesis test will 
be conducted.  Number of related events, number of study subjects with events, and the 
percent of subjects with an event will be summarized.  Because the LINX is a surgical 
procedure, there are inherent risks not applicable to medical therapy (PPIs).  An 
acceptable level of risk has been documented for the LINX procedure.  It is expected that 
re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_889051] 6% (upper confidence limit of 
12.6%) at the 12 -month visit based on the clinical experience from the LINX Pi[INVESTIGATOR_889052], which established this level of risk did not outweigh 
the benefit of treatment with the LINX device.

 Study Center Selection and Participation 
Study centers interested in participating in this study will be assessed for their ability to 
fully and appropriately participate in the study.  In general, study centers  will be selected 
if patient volume is adequate to support enrollment of patients into the study and the 
participating physician(s) are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training and surgical experience.   
No site will enroll more than [ADDRESS_1244800]  
This protocol , informed consent form  (ICF) , and authorization for the use and disclosure 
of health information (as applicable) must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_188528]’s IRB before any study patient is enrolled.  Changes to the protocol must be 
approve d in writing by [CONTACT_711145] (as applicable) before the change is 
implemented.  
Prior to study patient enrollment, a signed copy of the IRB approval letter addressed to 
the Investigator and the final approved ICF must be submitted to Torax Medi cal.  The 
letter should reference this protocol by [CONTACT_60733], date or  number/revision number as well as 
the approved ICF and HIPAA Authorization (as applicable).  Investigators are 
responsible for submitting and obtaining initial approval and continuing approval from 
the IRB and forwarding copi[INVESTIGATOR_889053].  The original 
letters are to be kept in the study center’s regulatory file designated for this study.  
The Investigator will notify the S ponsor  within five (5) working days of w ithdrawal of 
IRB approval.  
 Informed C onsent  
Prior to IRB submission, the Investigator or designee will prepare an ICF in accordance 
with this study protocol and all regulatory requirements (e.g. where applicable, 21 CFR 
Part 50 and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki) using the sample ICF 
provided ( Appendix D ).  A copy  of the final IRB approved ICF must be submitted to 
Torax Medical and a site must be activated by [CONTACT_889072].   All study patients (or their legal guardian) must do cument 
their consent by [CONTACT_10001] -approved ICF prior to completing any protocol -specific 
assessments that are not considered standard of care.   
 
Doc. No. [ADDRESS_1244801] s until the Sponsor provides notification 
that the site has provided all required study start -up documents and completed training .  
At minimum, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_889054] 
“Site Activation”  when start -up activities have been complete d.  Upon receipt of this 
notification, the study center may begin enrolling subjects.   
 Standard of Care  
As part of screening/baseline , all patients will undergo an anti -reflux surgery work -up in 
the event of randomization to LINX.  This work- up can be used in the event of  cross -over 
to LINX as well, provided subjects have not had significant changes to their health.  The 
anti-reflux surg ery work -up used for the study enrollment should be completed within the 
1-year time period prior to signing of the study ICF.  Subjects who cross -over to LINX 
after the 6 months visit are not required to repeat the anti -reflux surgical  work -up, unless 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737].  
For purposes of the study, the questionnaires (GERD -HRQL, Foregut Symptom 
Questionnaire , and RDQ) will be considered standard of care to facilitate pre- screening 
of patients.  However, only questionnaires completed by a subject who has provided 
informed consent for the study will be accessible to the Sponsor.   
 Schedule of Data Collection  
The Screening/Baseline visit will determine the eligibility of a subject to be randomized 
to either LINX or double -dose PPI s.  After randomization, subjects will be followed at 6 
months and 12 months.  All f ollow -up assessments should be completed during an offi ce 
visit, with the exception of the questionnaires, which may be completed by a phone call 
or electronically mailed  as needed.  Sample case report forms are provided in Appendix 
E.  Table 1  shows the schedule of data collection.

• Presence of m oderate or severe regurgitation reported  on the 6- month Foregut 
Symptom Questionnaire completed  on double -dose PPIs  
• Patient consents to LINX procedure  
If a subject crosses -over to LINX, the implant procedure must be completed within [ADDRESS_1244809] has met the cross -over criteria.  Timing of the 12 -
month visit for cross -over subjects will be 6 months ( +30 days)  after the cross -over LINX 
 
Doc. No. 4959 Rev. 1 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 31 implant procedure date.   See Section 8.15 for additional information about LINX implant 
procedure . 
 PPI [CONTACT_185756] -Down  
If cro ss-over criteria are not met,  double -dose PPI [INVESTIGATOR_889061] -down to single -dose 
(Omepra zole 20 mg QD).  Four weeks after steppi[INVESTIGATOR_889062], symptom 
assessment by [CONTACT_889075].  Double -dose PPIs may 
be resumed or other GERD medications started at the discretion of the Investigator.     
 PPIs after LINX  
Subjects  in the LINX arm may resume PPIs or other GERD medications after the LINX 
implant procedure as directed by [CONTACT_889076].  PPIs 
should be used at the lowest frequency and dose necessary for symptom relief .   
 Supplemental GERD Medication 
As needed  for symptom manag ement , subjects  may take  other supplemental GERD 
medications .  GERD medications other than PPIs , H2 receptor antagonists  (H2 b lockers ) 
or antacids are not allowed during the study.  
 Adverse Events  
For all subjects  starting at the time of r andomization and proceeding throughout the 
duration of the follow -up period, the Investigator will closely monitor each subject for the 
development of device and/or procedure or GERD -medication -related adverse events  
(AEs).  For the purposes of this study, a reportable event  will be defined as any untoward 
medical occurrence which has a strong relationship to the LINX device and/ or implant 
procedure or PPI [INVESTIGATOR_889063] . 
The Investigator  must decide whether each event meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE).   All device and/or procedure related serious adverse events  (SAE) 
must be reported immediately (within 5 day s of discovery) to Torax Medical .  SAE 
reporting to the IRB i s per institutional policy . 
An AE is considered serious  if it meets one or more of the following criteria: 
• Is life -threatening or results in death  
Note:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe.  
• Requi res subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] > 24 hours  
• Requires prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 
Doc. No. 4959 Rev. 1 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 31 • Results in fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital anomaly or birth 
defect  
• Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage  
 
The following definitions for rating the severity of adverse events will be used:  
 
Mild  Awareness of signs of symptoms, but easily 
tolerated; are of minor irritant type; causing no 
loss of time from normal activities.  
Moderate  Discomfort intense enough to cause interference 
with usual activities.  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to do work or usual 
activities.  
 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device or Drug Effects  
Unanticipated adverse device or drug  effects (UADEs) include any serious adverse 
effects on the health or safety of a study subject or any life -threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, the LINX device or Omeprazole that are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
associated with the procedure, devi ce or drug .  All unanticipated adverse effects must be 
reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1244810] of his/her request to withdraw consent.  If the site staff is unable to 
obtain written documentation, all information regarding the subject’s withdrawal must be 
recorded in the subject’s medical record.   
On completion of the study (either by [CONTACT_711147]), the Withdrawal/Completion CRF  will be completed .  
A subject may withdraw (or be withdrawn) from the study prematurely for the following 
reasons:   
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_1130]  
• Adverse event (Adverse Event Log or SAE CRF must be completed)  
• Protocol deviation 
• Lost to follow -up (In case of early withdrawal of a subject, at least three 
(3) documented attempts should be made to contact [CONTACT_711148]).  
 
Doc. No. 4959 Rev. 1 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 31 • Termination of study by [CONTACT_1034]  
• Investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject 
• Other (must be specified)  
 
 RISK ANALYSIS  
 Potential Risks  and Benefits  
The LINX Reflux Management System has been previously studied and known risks 
associated with the surgical procedure and device implant can be found in the 
Instruction s for Use (Appendix  A).  Risks associated wit h Omeprazole can be found in 
the Drug Information (Appendix B) .  The study will monitor the subjects through the 
duration of the subject’s participation for adverse events .  
The potential benefit s to subjects are the  reduction  or elimination of GERD- related 
symptoms  that were not effectively managed with once daily PPI . 
 
 STATISTICAL  PLAN  
 Subject Population for Analysis  
All randomized subjects who either start double -dose PPIs or undergo the implant 
procedure will rep resent the study population for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis  
at 6 months  (Treatment Group) .  Analyses will also include inte nt-to-treat (ITT) at 6 
months for elimination of moderate or severe regurgitation ( all randomized subjects, 
whether treatment was started or not ).  All o ther analyses will be performed on availabl e 
data at the follow -up visit .   
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be elimination of moderate or severe regurgitation 
assessed by [CONTACT_889077] 6 months.  The prima ry efficacy 
endpoint will be analyzed for the Treatment Group .  Subjects not evaluable at 6 months 
due to early withdrawal or missing data will be counted as failures of the primary 
efficacy endpoint. The randomized groups will be compared for the primary efficacy 
objective according to the following hypotheses:  
H0: ΠL ≤ Π P 
HA: Π L > Π P  
where Π L is the percent of study patients randomized to LINX with elimination of 
moderate or severe regurgitation and Π P is the percent of subjects randomized to the PPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_889064].  The percent of randomized 
 
Doc. No. 4959 Rev. 1 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 31 subjects with a successful elimination of moderate or severe regurgitation will be 
compared between groups using a Pearson’s chi -square test.  The required sample size 
was calculated using SAS v9.3 under the following assumptions:  
• Type I error = 5%  
• Assumed success rate in LINX group = 70%  
• Assumed difference in success rates = 30%  
• Power = 85%  
Under these assumptions, a minimum of 108 subjects enrolled and foll owed to 6 months 
are required.  The study will enroll approximately 150 subjects . 
 Additional Efficacy O utcomes  
Summary statistics will be used to display results of other efficacy out comes at each 
study time point.  For categorical parameters, this includes the number and frequency; 
and for continuous parameters, the mean, median, standard deviation, range .  
 Safety  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_121156] (number and percent age of subjects experiencing)  
treatment -related adverse events after randomization and throughout the study to 12 
months.

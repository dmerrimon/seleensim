I. Purpose, Background and Rationale  
A. Aims and Hypotheses  
 
Nearly [ADDRESS_126269] ive potential and dependence, and decreases the likelihood of cessation. These 
effects are particularly felt in the African American (AA) community where targeted marketing has resulted 
in ≈85% of AA versus ≈20% of White smokers using menthol cigarettes. T he FDA’s decision to advance 
the rulemaking process to  ban menthol cigarettes is an important step toward closing the gap in tobacco -
related disease and death disproportionately experienced by [CONTACT_113214]. The agency’s regulatory action 
stopped short of inc luding menthol -flavored e -cigarettes (ECs) and debate continues about whether more 
comprehensive enforcement priorities inclusive of menthol flavored e -liquids should be enacted. While a 
ban on menthol flavored EC liquids may reduce youth and young adult i nitiation, it may also discourage 
adult menthol smokers to switch from tobacco cigarettes to EC. This could slow harm reduction and result 
in a negative public health impact that would be concentrated in racial/ethnic minority communities 
already dispropor tionately burdened by [CONTACT_7634]. FDA has identified the impact of EC flavoring on smoking 
patterns as a research priority area, and there is an urgent need  for studies that examine tobacco 
regulatory actions with a specific focus on possible unintended conse quences that may increase tobacco -
related health disparities. To date, a  prospectively designed randomized clinical trial (RCT) has not been 
conducted; therefore, the efficacy of menthol -flavored versus tobacco -flavored EC to facilitate switching 
from comb ustible cigarettes to EC in adult menthol smokers is not known.  Our experienced, multi -
disciplinary team is one of the only groups in the country exclusively focused on tobacco -related health 
disparities intervention research in the AA community. Our recen tly completed RCT provided menthol EC 
or tobacco EC to AA and Latinx adult smokers. Among menthol smokers, post -hoc analyses found 
equivalent  rates of switching from tobacco cigarettes to EC, tobacco harm reduction, EC product use, and 
acceptability betwee n those who used tobacco EC versus menthol EC, although the study was not 
prospectively designed for this purpose and is limited by a small sample size for these comparisons. These 
data are consistent with observational studies that have found that nicotin e – not flavor – drive use in 
adult EC users and provide strong preliminary evidence to support restrictions on menthol flavored EC 
given potential benefit to youth and lack of evidence of harm to smokers. However, to empi[INVESTIGATOR_113169], a fu lly powered RCT is needed.  
The objective of this application  is to provide much needed data to the FDA to guide regulatory action 
on EC flavoring. Menthol smokers (n=800), stratified by [CONTACT_113215], will be randomized 1:1 into a 
12-week open label, no n-inferiority trial comparing a 4th generation nicotine salt -based pod -system EC in 
menthol - versus tobacco -flavored e -liquid. Follow -up will continue through week 26. The central 
hypothesis  is that tobacco EC are not inferior to menthol EC at facilitating  a switch to EC in menthol 
cigarette smokers.  
 
Our specific aims are:  
1) Compare the effectiveness of menthol versus tobacco EC at facilitating switching at week 
12. Hypothesis 1:  Participants randomized to tobacco EC (versus menthol EC) will demonstrate 
non-inferior rates of complete and predominant switching to EC (primary outcome). Complete 
switching is defined as exclusive use of EC, confirmed with CO < 6 ppm, and predominant 
switching is defined as use of EC with > 50% reduction in CPD. Rates of complete and predominant 
switching will also be compared separately by [CONTACT_19313].  
2)  Compare tobacco harm reduction of menthol versus tobacco EC at week 12. Participants 
randomized to tobacco EC (versus menthol EC) will demonstrate comparable (i.e., no statistically 
significant differences) change in CO, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], lung function, blood pressure, and 
tobacco -related quality of life from baseline to week 12.  
3) Compare the acceptability of menthol versus tobacco EC at week 12 . Hypothesis 3:  
Participants randomized to tobacco EC (versus menthol EC) will consume comparable amounts of 
study provided e -liquid (measured in grams) and demonstrate comparable reductions in cigarette -
related withdrawal, craving, and dependence. Subjective effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113170].  
4) Examine the long -term effectiveness of menthol versus tobacco EC at week 26. Switching 
patterns at week 26 will be compared to examine long -term maintenance of EC and smoking 
patterns under naturalistic conditions (EC only provided up t o week 12).  Hypothesis 4: There will 
be no statistically significant difference in rates of complete or predominant switching at week 26 
between those randomized to menthol versus tobacco EC.   
 
B. Background and Significance  
 
Electronic cigarettes as a harm  reduction strategy for adult cigarette smokers . Tobacco, but 
primarily cigarettes, remains the leading cause of preventable disease in the US, claiming 480,000 lives 
per year and affecting an additional 16 million smokers who suffer from smoking -related c hronic 
diseases.(1) Eliminating tobacco use in adult cigarette smokers remains the primary end -game for reducing 
tobacco’s public health burden,(2) but tobacco harm reduction has emerged as an important complement 
to these efforts.(3) Specifically, the availability of potentially less harmful products has led to increased 
focus on replacing all forms of combustible tobacco with noncombustible nicotine products that deliver 
nicotine but fewer tobacco toxicants to adults who cannot or are not ready to quit cigarettes. Central to 
harm reduction is the fact that nicotine contributes relatively little harm compared to the deleterious 
effects of combustible tobacco.(4)  
 Electronic cigarettes (ECs) have emerged as an effective harm re duction strategy for individuals who 
smoke cigarettes who cannot or will not quit using FDA -approved cessation methods.(5) EC are used by 
[CONTACT_113216](2, 6)  and are now the most common assi sted method of quitting 
cigarettes.(7) Exclusively switching from cigarettes to ECs optimizes harm reduction relative to continued 
smoking(8-12) and growing evidence indi cates that partially switching to EC reduces cigarette consumption, 
is a marker of EC acceptability, and might also be associated with reduced harm, particularly for cancer 
and COPD.(10, 13, 14)  In our RCT that di rectly informs the current study, partial switchers replaced > 75% of 
their cigarettes with EC, resulting in a decrease of 70 cigarettes per week from baseline and significant 
reductions in the potent lung carcinogen, NNAL, carbon monoxide, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_23908].(15) Current 
estimates indicate that 6.[ADDRESS_126270] if adult cigarette smokers switched to EC.(5) 
Menthol flavoring in cigarettes.  Menthol is a flavor additive with a minty taste and aroma that, when 
added to cigarettes, increases appeal and addictive potential, reduces the irritation and harshness of 
smoking, leads to greater depth of inhalation of to bacco smoke and its harmful constituents, facilitates 
dependence, and decreases the likelihood of cessation.(16) Targeted tobacco industry marketing of menthol 
cigarettes to African American (AA) communities since  the 1940s has led to disproportionately higher 
rates of menthol cigarette use.(17-19) Today, 85% of all AA smokers smoke menthol cigarettes compared to 
20% of Whites.(20) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_113171], smoking on fewer days, and lower overall levels of 
daily cigarette consumption,(21-23) AAs are two to three -times more likely to die of tobacco -related  
illnesses, including cancer and heart disease, than other racial/ethnic groups; (24-26) menthol cigarettes are 
believed to be a major reason for this disproportionate suffering among AA smokers.  Simulation modeli ng 
estimated that if the US had implemented a menthol cigarette ban in 2011, 190,[ADDRESS_126271] been averted by 2050.(27) The FDA’s monumental decision to advance 
the rulem aking process to ban menthol cigarettes is an important step toward closing the gap in tobacco -
related disease and death disproportionately experienced by [CONTACT_113214]. 
Menthol flavoring in EC. The FDA’s regulatory action on April 29, [ADDRESS_126272] prospectively designed study to directly compare the efficacy of menthol 
versus tobacco EC at facilitating switching from tobacco cigarettes to EC in adult menthol smokers 
transitioning to EC. We anticipate enrolling > 80% racial /ethnic minorities (primarily AA and Latinx) into 
the current study, thereby [CONTACT_113217] .  
 
C. Rationale  
Innovation in this application lies in the methods applied to the research quest ion and the population 
studied. The status quo as it pertains to understanding the role of EC  flavoring in adult smoker’s tobacco use 
behaviors is to conduct observational and lab -based studies. (35, 37, 38, 40, 41 , 45, 46)  (42) These designs contribute 
important information about the association between EC flavors and switching, but they cannot determine 
causality and are limited by [CONTACT_6270] -selection bias.  To definitively an swer the question about the efficacy and 
acceptability of menthol EC versus tobacco EC at facilitating switching in adult smokers, an RCT is needed to 
establish if the observed associations are due to self -selection or are truly causal.   In that regard, th e 
research proposed in this application is innovative, because it represents a departure from the status quo by 
[CONTACT_113218].  
Results from our preliminary studies (see  C3) suggest comparable rates of switching from tobacco 
cigarettes to EC, tobacco harm reduction, EC product use, and acceptability between adult menthol 
smokers who used tobacco EC versus menthol EC and, in doing so, provide compelling evidence for 
conduc ting a fully powered RCT comparing menthol and tobacco EC. In addition, racial/ethnic minorities in 
the US are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes and will be most impacted by [CONTACT_113219] a characterizing EC flavor, yet these groups  are underrepresented in existing observational and 
lab-based studies examining the role of EC flavoring on adult smoker’s tobacco use behaviors. The research 
proposed in this application is further innovative, as it represents a departure from the status quo in that we 
will conduct the largest intervention trial of racial/ethnic minority  menthol smokers ever done. We anticipate 
> 80% representation from racial/ethnic minority groups, primarily AA and Latinx. Results have the 
potential to shift paradigms. S pecifically, based on our strong preliminary data, we expect that both menthol 
and tobacco EC will be acceptable and result in high rates of switching and improvements in tobacco -related 
health effects. The study will provide critical data to the FDA to in form regulatory action of menthol EC that 
could slow youth and young adult initiation with no resulting negative impact on switching in adult 
combustible cigarette smokers transitioning to EC and no unintended consequences in a priority 
population of predo minately AA and Latinx smokers.  
 
II. Research Plan and Design  
 
A. Study Objectives  
This study will examine the short - and long -term effectiveness, tobacco harm reduction, and acceptability 
of menthol versus tobacco EC in adult menthol smokers not interested in qu itting nicotine but interested in 
switching from cigarettes to EC.  
 
B. Study T ype and Design  
 
Menthol smokers (n=800), stratified by [CONTACT_113215], who are not interested in quitting nicotine will be 
randomized 1:[ADDRESS_126273] y of EC 
5% nicotine concentration in either menthol or Virginia tobacco and will complete 4 check -in sessions t o 
facilitate switching to EC.  The primary outcome is the proportion who make a complete or predominant 
switch to EC at week 12, where complete switching is defined as exclusive use of EC, biochemically 
confirmed with CO < 6, and predominant switching is d efined as use of EC with > 50% reduction in CPD.  
Secondary outcomes include acceptability and long -term effectiveness. Follow -up will continue through 
week [ADDRESS_126274] use and smoking behavior under naturalistic 
condi tions. Participants will be recruited and enrolled in collaboration with The University of Kansas Health 
System and Swope Health Central (Swope), a federally qualified health center serving a predominately AA 
population, that has been the site for our prev ious trials.  
 
Why a non -inferiority trial?  Non-inferiority trials are executed when one product is anticipated to be 
‘not unacceptably worse than’ a comparator product and have value when it is feasible to sacrifice some 
degree of benefit to gain advantage s provided by [CONTACT_113220].  53,[ADDRESS_126275] is needed.  
 
 
C. Sample size , statistical methods,  and power calculation  
Sample size calculation.  The aim of this non -inferiority trial is to establish that tobacco EC are not inferior 
to menthol EC in terms of the primary outcome, which is the proportion of menthol smokers who make a 
complete or predominant switch to EC, defined as use of EC along with a > 50% reduction in cigarettes from 
baseline to week 12. We assume 1) based on our RCT, that 73% in the menthol EC group  will be complete 
or predominant switchers at week 12. We arrived at the 73% estimate at week [ADDRESS_126276]. Specifically, we noted a 12% reduction in switching from week 
2 to week 6 and assumed that a similar trend would continue through week 12. Given an 85% switch rate in 
the menthol EC group at week [ADDRESS_126277] and assuming a 12% reduction in s witching from week 6 to 12, 
gives us a 73% switch rate at week 12. We also assume 2) to prove non -inferiority, the proportion in the 
tobacco EC group  that are complete and partial switchers at week 12 will be similar to the menthol EC as 
long as it is grea ter than 64% . So, we can assume that P1=the proportion in the tobacco EC group that will 
be complete or predominant switchers at week 12=0.64 and that P2=the proportion in the menthol EC 
group that will be complete or predominant switchers at week 12=0.73.  Then to test for noninferiority we 
have the following hypotheses: H0 (null hypothesis): P1 -P2 < -0.09 and H1 (alternative hypothesis): P1 -P2 
> -0.09. Following these assumptions 400 per group gives us 82% power with a Type 1 error rate of 2.5% 
using a nor mal approximation test for non -inferiority. Sample size calculations were done with PASS 16.0.4. 
Basis for sample size calculations.  Estimates for non -inferiority trials are guided by [CONTACT_113221] a priori difference threshold. The FDA and other regulatory bodies have 
established an effectiveness ratio of > 80% to indicate bioequivalence (i.e., non -inferiority ).[ADDRESS_126278] used a difference threshold 
of 15%.133 134 Using this 15% threshold and our estimate of a 73% complete or predominant switch rate in 
the menthol EC group gives us an effectiveness ratio of 79% (.58/.73), which is under the criteria set by 
[CONTACT_8415].  Raising the difference threshold t o 14% would give us an effectiveness ratio of 81% (.59/.73). While 
this meets FDA criteria for non -inferiority, we felt that a difference of 14% was too large. Rather, we have 
gone with a more stringent difference threshold of 9%; at this threshold the pro posed effectiveness ratio for 
our study is 88% (.64/.73), meaning that tobacco EC will be assumed to not be inferior to menthol EC if 
they are at least 88% as effective at facilitating a complete or predominant switch as menthol EC. This 
criterion places u s well above the equivalence threshold set by [CONTACT_113222] -inferiority studies, which we believe is a strength of this study. Missing 
data.   We expect minimal (<5%) lost to follow -up at week [ADDRESS_126279] will be considered as non -complete or predominant switcher and will be imputed as such.  
 
Statistical evaluation of study aims  
 
Aim 1. Compare the effectiveness of menthol versus tobacco EC at facilitating switc hing at week 
12. Primary hypothesis. Participants randomized to tobacco EC (versus menthol EC) will demonstrate 
non-inferior rates of complete and predominant switching to EC (primary outcome). Complete switching is 
defined as exclusive use of EC, biochemi cally confirmed with CO < 6 ppm, and predominant switching is 
defined as use of EC with > 50% reduction in CPD. We will test this hypothesis by [CONTACT_70849] 95% 
confidence interval for the difference in P1 -P2, as defined above. To show noninferiority th e upper limit of 
the confidence interval must be greater than or equal to 0.[ADDRESS_126280] not specified an a priori difference threshold for these analyses and, 
therefore, they are not testing noninferiority and should be considered exploratory. What these analyses will 
provide is an estimate of the proportion of complete swit chers in the tobacco EC versus menthol EC group 
and, separately, an estimate of the proportion of predominant switchers in the tobacco EC versus menthol 
EC group.  
 
Aim 2. Compare tobacco harm reduction of menthol versus tobacco EC at week 12. Hypothesis 2 . 
Participants randomized to tobacco EC (versus menthol EC) will demonstrate comparable (i.e., no 
statistically significant differences) change in CO, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], lung function, blood pressure, and 
tobacco -related quality of life from baseline to  week 12.  Each of these measures are on a quantitative scale 
and, given the sample size, we can assume the central limit theorem will hold. Thus, we will calculate the 
mean change and standard deviation of the change for each of these measures from baselin e to week [ADDRESS_126281] comparing the means between the groups while also 
reporting the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Given that we expect to show noninferiority and 
comparable effects between groups, we  except to fail to reject each of these tests and thus each confidence 
interval for the difference between groups will contain 0.00.  However, if any of these variables are different 
when noninferiority is seen – i.e., Aim 1 is supported, meaning tobacco E C are found to be non -inferior to 
menthol EC on rate of switching –  we will then utilize logistic regression analyzes to identify any phenotypic 
or consumption patterns that may predict why these variables differ in the face of noninferiority. For 
example , we may find that tobacco -related quality of life differs by [CONTACT_113223].  In this case, factors such as gender, age, 
socioeconomic status, study -related side effects, advers e events, change in CPD, cigarette -related 
withdrawal, craving, dependence, EC usage and grams of e -liquid consumed, subjective effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
baseline smoking history, or psychosocial factors may explain this difference and the regression analyses 
undertaken will illuminate the potential reasons for the difference. If noninferiority is not seen – i.e., Aim [ADDRESS_126282] to see a difference in one or more of these measures.  
 
Aim 3. Compare the acceptability of menthol versus tobac co EC at week 12. Hypothesis 3. 
Participants randomized to tobacco EC (versus menthol EC) will consume comparable amounts of study 
provided e -liquid (measured in grams) and demonstrate comparable reductions in cigarette -related 
withdrawal, craving, and dep endence. Subjective effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113172]. 
Each of these measures are on a quantitative scale and, given the sample size, we can assume the central 
limit theorem will hold. Thus, we will calculate the mean e -liquid consumpt ion over [ADDRESS_126283] and calculate the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Given that 
we expect to show nonin feriority in tobacco EC versus menthol EC, we expect to find no difference in e -liquid 
consumption and, therefore, the confidence interval for the difference between groups will contain 0.00. If 
noninferiority is not seen, then we may see a difference in t he e-liquid consumption by [CONTACT_19313]. For change in 
cigarette -related withdrawal, craving, dependence, and subjective effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], we will calculate the 
mean change and corresponding standard deviation for each of these measures by [CONTACT_19313].  We will then 
conduct the two -sample t -test comparing the means between the groups while also reporting the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Given that we expect to show noninferiority in tobacco EC versus 
menthol EC, we expect to find no difference in cigarette -related withdrawal, craving, dependence, or 
subjective effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This means that we expect to fail to reject each of the t -tests and expect that 
each confidence interval for the difference between groups will contain 0.00. However, as described in Aim 
2, if any of these variables are different when noninferiority is seen, we will then utilize logistic regression to 
identify any phenotypic or consumption patterns – e.g., gender, age, socioeconomic status, study -related 
side effects, adverse events, c hange in CPD, cigarette -related withdrawal, craving, dependence, EC usage 
and grams of e -liquid consumed, subjective effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], baseline smoking history, or psychosocial 
factors -- may explain this difference and the regression analyses undertaken will illuminate reasons for the 
difference.  
If noninferiority is not seen, then we would expect to see a difference in one or more of these measures.  
 
Aim 4. Examine the long -term effectiveness of menthol versus tobacco EC at week 26.  We will 
compare swit ching patterns at week 26 to examine long -term maintenance of EC and smoking patterns 
under naturalistic conditions (EC only provided up to week 12).  Hypothesis 4. There will be no statistically 
significant difference in rates of complete or predominant s witching at week 26 between those randomized 
to menthol versus tobacco EC.  For this aim we will calculate the proportion of complete and predominant 
switchers as defined above but at week 26.  We will then calculate the corresponding 95% confidence 
interv al on the difference in these proportions. The lost to follow -up rate at month [ADDRESS_126284] that forms 
the basis for this proposal was < 10%.  We do not expect the lost to follow -up rate to exceed 20% at month 
6; however, given that we are not sure of our loss to follow -up rate we will report complete and 
predominant switching at month [ADDRESS_126285] Criteria (See Vulnerable Populations appendix, if appl icable)  
Participants will be adults [ADDRESS_126286]

EC (Weeks 0 -12). Participants will be provided a 12 -week supply of VUSE 5% nicotine concentration in 
either menthol or Virginia tobacco that will be dispensed at the weeks 0, 4, and 8 in -person visits (4 -week 
supply @ each v isit).  One pod delivers the equivalent of one pack of cigarettes, with variability of [ADDRESS_126291] all EC. Bags will be returned at each visit during the 
intervention phase to confirm use of EC (i.e., grams of e -liquid consumed and count of pods) as well as

Initial Screening.  The ini tial screen will review inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those eligible will be 
scheduled to complete final eligibility screening within 21 days. All ineligible smokers will be 
referred to local resources  when applicable . 
 
Final Screening and Enrollment (Wk 0 ). Final eligibility screening will be conducted in person 
and will consist of a pregnancy test on women of childbearing age and obtaining informed consent.  
 
Electronic cigarettes  (Wk 0, 4, 8, 12).  Participants will be provided a 12 -week supply of VUSE  
5% nicotine concentration in either menthol or Virginia tobacco that will be dispensed at the weeks 
0, 4, and 8 in -person visits (4 -week supply @ each visit).  To aid in recall and assessment of 
fidelity to protocol, participants will be given dated bags to collect all EC. Bags will be returned at 
each visit during the intervention phase to confirm use of EC (i.e., grams of e -liquid consumed and 
count of pods) as well as protocol adherence.

effort. The EBC will be stored in 1 ml aliquots at -80˚C for subsequent analysis. Samples will be 
standardized by [CONTACT_113227]. EBC will b e used to measure inflammatory patterns using 
nanobiosensors.  
 
Retention . Retention is enhanced by [CONTACT_113228]. We have also developed a system of reminders and compensation for participant efforts 
that have resulted in impressive retention rates in our previous clinical trials. Reminders . Five days 
prior to each visit a reminder postcard, email, and/or text noting the scheduled appointment date 
and time will be sent. Participants will also be called, texted, or emailed (based on preference) up 
to [ADDRESS_126295].  They will 
receive  $40 at Wks 0 , 4, 8, 18, and 26  and $50 at Week 12  as compensation for their time/travel.  
To encourage use of the study provided EC , an additional $[ADDRESS_126296] therapy 
and which are performed solely for research purposes.   
 
All tests, procedures, and visits are being performed solely for research purposes and are not 
billable to insurance companies.  
 
Describe the fate of any body component (blood, CSF, bone marrow, etc.) used in the 
study, emphasizing confidentiality of labeling of the sample and the s ample’s destruction 
or storage.  
 
Samples will be labeled only with a unique study identification number and only members of [CONTACT_113239]  and Toren’s  team will have access to the samples. For participants who have agreed to have 
their biospecimens stored for  future testing, s amples will be stored indefinitely.  
 
 
F. Risk/benefit assessment  
 
Physical risk  
The most common side effects related to EC include cough, dry mouth, shortness of  
breath, mouth and throat irritation, headache, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and increased heart  
rate/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. In rare instances, severe pulmonary disease associated with EC use and death have 
been noted, but these incidents have primarily occurred in a black -market product that contained  
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, in combi nation with vitamin E acetate. These additives are not present in 
the EC used in this study .  
 
Psychological risk  
Risks for participants also include those associated with the inconvenience of participation including 
answering surveys, providing saliva , urine, and participating in follow -up visits and assessments. To 
minimize the inconveniences associated with study participation we will review all data collection 
instruments and study procedures to minimize the number of items in our instruments and improv e the 
accessibility and convenience of our study procedures.  We anticipate using several methods to enhance 
convenience to participants, including offering study visits in the evening and on weekends and offering 
patients a choice of where they will be se en (KUMC or Swope). Another risk is feeling pressured to be in 
the study, which we will track in order to monitor and will report this as an adverse event.   
 
Social risk  
None 
 
Economic risk  
None 
 
Potential benefit of participating in the study  
There  are also no direct benefits to participating in this study except that researcher s hope that the 
information from this research study may be useful in informing the FDA’s regulatory action on menthol 
flavoring in EC . 
G. Location where study will be performed:  
The study will take place at The University of Kansas Tobacco Treatment Center at Swope , [ADDRESS_126297] , in Kansas  City, Missouri (hereafter referred to as Swope)  or at the KUMC 
CRU in Fairway, Kansas based on the preference of each part icipant.  All data will be directly entered 
into an electronic data capture system (i.e., RedCap or CRIS), therefore minimizing the use of paper 
records.  If paper records are generated, they will be stored in locked file cabinets at Swope .  Only 
study sta ff will have access to the locked records at Swope  and the secure online electronic data 
capture system.

L. Assessment of Subject Safety and Development of a Data and Safety Mon itoring Plan  
 
The current study involves an EC that is publicly marketed and commercially available for purchase 
to anyone over the age of 21.  ECs are a tobacco product and are being provided for non -therapeutic 
purposes. ECs are no more harmful than conv entional cigarettes,  and various studies suggest that 
they may offer reduced harm . 
 
This study does not involve more than minimal risk.  We will protect participants and minimize risks 
by [CONTACT_113230] (AEs). AEs  will be 
tracked during regularly scheduled visits or through spontaneous reports made by [CONTACT_4317].  [CONTACT_113239]  will be made  aware of unexpected or serious AEs within [ADDRESS_126298] report by 
[CONTACT_4317]; all other AEs will be reviewed weekly by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nollen.  SAEs will be reported to the KUMC 
IRB, FDA, and NIDA  within [ADDRESS_126299]. Greiner  (or the treating provider) will determine 
relatedness for each reported AE. SAEs will be defined as any event experienced by a study subject 
while on the study medication that is fatal, life -threatening (subject was at risk of death from the 
event as it occurred), disabling or incapacitating, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a 
current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is a congenital anomaly in the offspring of a su bject who received the study 
medication, or required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage .  
 
 
III. Subject Participation  
 
A. Recruitment : 
 
Participants will be recruited through clinic and community -based efforts. F lyers will be placed 
around Swo pe and KUMC  for patients to take and providers will be asked to refer patients by 
[CONTACT_113231]. We will use the KUMC HERON database an d the 
Swope electronic medical records to identify smokers and will ask their physician to send their 
patient a letter informing them of the study.  We will also use the Frontiers registry to identify adult 
smokers who have agreed to be contact[CONTACT_33632]. We will use radio , TV, bus  and Facebook ads 
and word of mouth, as needed, to recrui t participants. Finally, smokers are currently being screened 
for other research studies being conducted by [CONTACT_2296] (i.e., active studies being conducted Dr s. 
Nollen , Cox, or Leavens ). Those who are found to be ineligible for these studies will be informe d 
about the current study and offered the opportunity to be screened . Recruitment letters, 
advertisements, and flyers are in the process of being developed. They will be submitted to the IRB 
for approval before any participants are enrolled.   
 
B. Screening I nterview/questionnaire  
 
The screening interview will take place over the phone or in person and be conducted by a member 
of the study team. The screening questionnaire will address the general inclusion/exclusion criteria in 
the Eligibility Criteria table above. Only participants who have express ed interest will be screened.  
  
C. Informed consent process and timing of obtaining of consent  
 
Consent will be obtained prior to participant involvement. Individuals interested in the proposed 
study will meet the rese arch assistant at Swope  or the CRU. Each individual will be given a copy of 
the consent form and as much time as they need to review its contents. After the consent form is 
read, both the individual and the research assistant will review the co nsent form t ogether and the 
potential participant will be encouraged to ask questions. Each individual will be reminded that 
participation in the study is completely voluntary and their decision to participate will not affect their 
current or future medical care at th e treating facility . The consenting process will take place in a 
private location . 
D. Alternatives to Participation  
Alternatives to participating in the study are continue to smoke cigarettes as usual or switch to other  
alternative sources of nicotine, includ ing purchasing nicotine gum or patches from the pharmacy or 
obtaining a  prescription for nicotine inhaler, nicotine nasal spray, or nicotine lozenge.  
 
E. Costs to Subject s 
There are no costs to subjects. All tests, procedures, and visits are being performed s olely for research 
purposes and are not billable to insurance companies.  
 
F. How new information will be conveyed to the study subject and how it will be 
documented  
 
 We have plans to publish data from this study in aggregate but will not provide any individu alized 
feedback to participants.   
 
G. Payment, including a prorated plan for payment  
Participants will be given a $ [ADDRESS_126300]  at Wks 0 , 4, 8, 12,18, and 26 as 
compensation for their time/travel.   To encourage use of the study provided EC, an additional $[ADDRESS_126301] complete the visit to receive the reimbursement associated with that time point.  
Participants may receive $ 20 for e ach referral who is eligible and enrolls in the study.  Participants 
may complete up to 3 different referrals for the study for a total of $60.  Travel costs will not be 
reimbursed.   
 
H. Payment for a research -related injury  
N/A  
IV. Data Collection and Protecti on 
A. Data Management and Security  
 
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_19917] a study identification number and 
numerically coding all data. The association of the ID -code and the participant’s name [CONTACT_60169] 
[CONTACT_113232] a lock ed file cabinet. The screening questionnaire and all survey data will be directly 
entered into RedCap or CRIS and accessible only by [CONTACT_464]. Any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_113178] a locked filing cabinet in offices that are kept locked when unocc upi[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Only summaries of 
group data will be reported in any publications or presentations, with no identification of individuals.  
Because identifiable information will be collected, participant privacy will be maintained throughout the 
duration of the st udy by [CONTACT_113233].  More 
specifically, identifiable information will not be released without written authorization of the 
participant.  Mobile devices will not be used for data collection or storage. Ide ntifiable data will not be 
sent outside of KUMC.  
 
B. Sample / Specimen Collection  
No more than [ADDRESS_126302] Clinical Research Center u nder the direction of 
Paul Toren , PhD .  Samples will be accessible only to members the study team. Results from analyses 
will be de -identified and shared only with members of the research team. Any resulting publications 
will present the data in aggregate;  individual participants will not be identified. For participants who 
agree to future testing, samples will be stored indefinitely.  
 
C. Tissue Banking Considerations  
 
For participants who agree to future testing, samples will be stored indefinitely. New biomarkers of  
tobacco -related harm and exposure  and genetic differences in nicotine metabolism are being 
discovered and the stored biological samples would be used for analysis of these new markers.  All 
samples stored for future biomarker analyses will be de -identified and accessible only to members of 
the study team.  Results from these analyses will be de -identified and shared only with members of the 
research team. Any resulting publications will present the data in aggregate; individual participants will 
not be identified.    
 
D. Procedures to protect subject confidentiality  
Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_19917] a study identification number and 
numerically coding all data.  All biological  samples and survey data will be labeled with the study 
identification number and never with the participants name [CONTACT_113238].  The 
association of the ID -code and the participant’s name [CONTACT_60169] [CONTACT_113232] a locked file 
cabinet and will only be accessible to members o f the study team.  
 
E. Quality Assurance / Monitoring  
 
All data will be directly entered into our electronic data capture system (i.e., RedCap or CRIS) that 
contains edit checks to control the quality and completeness of data entry. Completeness of data entry 
will be automatically verified before each assessment is completed. The electronic data capture system 
is behind the KUMC secure firewall with role -based access that is HIPAA and human subjects 
compliant. There are no plans for ongoing third -party monitori ng. 
 
V. Data Analysis and Reporting  
A. Statistical and Data Analysis  
See II.C. above (Sample Size, Statistical Methods, and Power Calculations)  
 
B. Outcome  
EFFECTIVENESS  (Aims 1 & 4).   
Switching (Primary Outcome). The primary outcome is the proportion of menthol s mokers who make 
a complete or predominant switch to EC, defined as use of EC along with a > 50% reduction in cigarettes 
from baseline to week 12.  The 7-day Timeline Follow Back Interview (TLFB)  will be used to assess 
participants cigarette and EC use patte rns each day for the past 7 days at each visit (weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 
18, 26). The primary endpoint is, however, fixed at week 12. The TLFB is a reliable and valid way of 
collecting information about substance use quantity and frequency and, in tobacco resear ch, has been 
corroborated against interactive voice response, butt counts (storing and returning the butts of 
cigarettes smoked), and biological measures for cigarettes smoked and puff topography for EC,  
supporting the strong validity of this self -report m easure compared to other ‘gold standard’ measures.  
For each of the last 7 days participants will be asked to recall the number of cigarettes smoked and EC 
sessions vaped; following standard practice, an EC session is defined as at least 15 puffs or lasting  
around 10 minutes. For each EC session, participants will be asked to specify the device used (i.e., study 
provided versus something else) and the flavor (i.e., menthol, Virginia tobacco, something else).* For 
non-study provided EC, detailed information w ill be collected about the type of EC (e.g., brand, pod -
based, disposable, refillable), flavor, nicotine concentration and, if available, whether the product is 
nicotine salt -based. To aid in recall and corroborate self -report, participants will be given d ated bags to 
collect all EC. Bags will be returned at each visit during the intervention phase and used to confirm use 
of study provided EC (i.e., grams of e -liquid consumed) and protocol adherence (i.e., the number of 
pods vaped in the study provided vers us non -study provided flavor). Complete switching  is defined as 
any use of EC and no use of cigarettes in the past 7 days (i.e., 100% reduction in CPD from baseline), 
biochemically confirmed with an expi[INVESTIGATOR_113179] < 6 parts per million (ppm). CO is used  for 
verification because cigarettes produce carbon monoxide as a by[CONTACT_113234], while heating an 
e-liquid does not generate CO. The < 6 ppm CO cutoff is more conservative than the < [ADDRESS_126303] ate of knowledge for detecting recent cigarette 
smoking. Predominant switching is defined as those who report any use of EC along with a > 50% 
reduction from baseline in CPD.  A > 50% reduction has been selected because it is a measure of 
acceptability of the EC products and is associated with substantial reductions in biomarkers of harm 
and exposure relative to continued smoking and is a common endpoint used in tobacco harm reduction 
studies. Partial switching  will be defined as those who report any use of  EC along with a < 50% 
reduction from baseline in CPD.  No switching (i.e., exclusive cigarette user) will be defined as those 
who reported no use of ECs and any use of cigarettes in the past [ADDRESS_126304] include tobacco harm reduction and EC acceptab ility. These constructs  may 
be measured by [CONTACT_716]:  
 
TOBACCO HARM REDUCTION  (Aim 2). Tobacco harm reduction is a global topic of interest among 
those transitioning from cigarettes to EC and is largely driven by [CONTACT_113235]. We expect 
comparable  rates of switching between groups and, therefore, comparable rates of tobacco harm 
reduction, defined as change in each of the following constructs from baseline to week 12.  
• Tobacco Quality of Life Impact Tool (TQOLIT™v1)  will be used to assess was used t o assess the 
impact of smoking/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113180] -related quality of life.  
• Carbon Monoxide.  Carbon monoxide will be measured in parts per million (PPM) using a coVita 
Bedfont Micro+ Smokerlyzer at each study visit.  
• Blood Pressure.  Systolic and diastolic bl ood pressure will be measures with an Welch -Allyn blood 
pressure cuff.  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_113181] a primary concern among EC users and, therefore, we will 
carefully monitor respi[INVESTIGATOR_113182]:   
• Lung function will be assessed via spi[INVESTIGATOR_038] .  We will summarize all values returned from the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (i.e., FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC%, PEF) but will focus our attention on FEF 25 -75%,  the 
pulmonary function test of small airway disease that is most sensi tive to effects of cigarette smoking.   
• American Thoracic Society Questionnaire  (ATSQ) will be used to assess common respi[INVESTIGATOR_037] (e.g., cough first thing in the morning, wheezing, shortness of breath, etc.). This measure 
was selected because it con tains items relevant to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_113183].  
• Leicester Cough Questionnaire  (LCQ)  is a valid, repeatable measure of chronic cough which is 
responsive to change, especially the onset of cough in established cigarette smokers when they initiate 
EC.  
It is not within the scope or budget of this study to examine additional biomarkers of exposure or 
potential harm, but we will collect urine and saliva samples from all participants at weeks [ADDRESS_126305] include:  
• cotinine  
• total NNAL (for nicotine -derived nitrosamine ketone - 
NNK);  
• 2-hydroxyethylmercapturic acid (HEMA) (for ethylen e 
oxide);  
• 2-hydroxy -3-butenyl -mercapturic acid and isomers 
(MHBMA) (for 1,3 -butadiene);  
• 3-hydroxy -1-methyl propyl -mercapturic acid (HMPMA) 
(for crotonaldehyde);  
• 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (3 -HPMA) (for 
acrolein);  • S-phenylmercapturic acid (S -PMA) (for  benzene);  
• 2-cyanoethylmercapturic acid (CEMA) (for 
acrylonitrile);  
• 2-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid (2 -HPMA) (for 
propylene oxide)  
• pyrene (1 -OHP) 
• matrix metalloproteinaise -8 (MMP8) and interleukin -9 
(IL9) for airway epi[INVESTIGATOR_113184]  
• 8-Epi-prostaglandin F2α (oxidative stress)  
• 11-Dehydrothromboxane B2 (platelet activation)  
• soluble intercellular adhesion molecule -1 (sICAM)

 ACCEPTABILITY (Aim 3).  Detailed assessment of EC product use, effects on withdrawal, craving, 
and dependence, and subjective a nd sensorial effects will be evaluated at all study visits to compare 
acceptability by [CONTACT_19313] (menthol versus tobacco EC).  
Grams of study e -liquid consumed (weeks 4, 8, 12). Use of the study EC in the flavor provided 
will be objectively measured by [CONTACT_7939] p articipants to bring all used, unused, or partially used pods to 
the weeks 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_126306], 95%, 92%, and 98% of participants returned their pods at weeks 2, 4, and 6, respectively, 
and there was no evidence of cheating – i.e., returned pods were in the flavor provided by [CONTACT_1758] -
- suggesting that participants used only the st udy provided pods throughout the intervention phase. 
For unreturned pods, we will conservatively assume [ADDRESS_126307] (r=0.58, p < .001).  
Flavor usage (all visits). Based on our RCT, we expect low rates of non -study EC product use, but 
we will conduct rigorous assessments of adherence to EC flavoring during the intervention phase and 
continued use during the lo ng-term follow -up phase. From the TLFB, we will summarize the 
proportion of total EC that were in the study provided versus a non -study provided flavor. From pod 
counts , we will summarize the number of pods returned by [CONTACT_113236] (i.e., menthol, Virginia tobac co, 
other) and derive an estimate of the proportion of total pods returned that were in the study provided 
flavor (versus non -study provided flavor).   
Craving (all visits). Craving for cigarettes will be assessed using the Questionnaire on Smoking 
Urges -Brief (QSU)  and its companion, the Questionnaire on Vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113185] -Brief (QVC)  will be 
assessed at each visit and compared between groups . Both measures yield a total score and two 
factor scores: desire to smoke/vape and intention to smoke/vape. The QVC yie lds a third factor, 
positive outcome of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . 
Withdrawal (all visits) .The Minnesota Tobacco Withdrawal Scale will be used to rate eight 
withdrawal symptoms in the past 24 hours: anger, anxiety, concentration, craving, hunger, sadness, 
and sleep.  Items ar e rated from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Scores will be 
summarized overall and for each construct.  
Dependence (all visits) . Following guidance from the TCORS dependence workgroup, we will 
include a compendium of dependence measures, valid ated for use in assessing both cigarette and EC 
related dependence, to cover all components of dependence (i.e., quantity and frequency of use, 
tolerance, perceived benefits, withdrawal symptoms, cravings/urges to use, use despi[INVESTIGATOR_38581], 
impaired control, a utomaticity, preferred over competing rewards, and sensory dependence.)  We 
have intentionally selected cigarette dependence measures that have parallel EC dependence 
measures to allow for direct comparison in dependence across products by [CONTACT_19313]. These meas ures 
include:  
• Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Nicotine Dependence 
Item Bank  107-109 and its companion the E-Cigarette Dependence Scale .  
• Penn State Cigarette Dependence Index  (PS CDI) and its companion the Penn State Electronic 
Cigarette Dependence Index PS ECDI)   
• Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (WISDM)  and its companion the E-Cigarette 
Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (eWISDM).  Dependence will b e summarized for 
the WISDM total score as well as the average score on the Primary Dependence Motives (i.e., 
Automaticity, Loss of Control, Craving, and Tolerance.  
• Time to First Cigarette  and Time to First EC of the Day . This single item from the Fagerstro m 
Cigarette Dependence Scale is the best indicator of dependence in a sample of mostly light smokers 
(< 10 CPD).   
Subjective effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (all visits).  The [ADDRESS_126308] satisfaction and subjective 
and sensorial effects of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113186] (menthol versus tobacco EC). Questions are answered on 7 -
point scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (extremely) and assess vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113187] ( was vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113188] – HRPP - 03/12/2015   Page 16 of 23
  
 
 satisf ying, did the e -cigarette taste good, did you enjoy vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), enjoyment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_113189] ( did you enjoy the sensations in your throat and chest), psychological reward ( did 
vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113190], did vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113191], did vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113192], did vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113193]), craving reduction  (did vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113194] a cigarette), and aversion ( did vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113195], did vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113196]). 
The single item, “Did the e -cigarette t aste good?” will be used as a proxy for flavor liking as has 
been done in previous studies. The 23 -item Sensory E -cigarette Expectancies Scale,  particularly the 
subscales related to taste/smell (‘I like the taste of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’, ‘I like the smell of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007],’ ‘ I like the 
flavor of vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’) and  pleasure/satisfaction (‘I like how vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113197],’ ‘I like 
the feeling of satisfaction that I get from vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’) will be administered for secondary assessment of 
product satisfaction and acceptabilit y.  
OTHER CONSTRUCTS OF INTEREST  
Safety and tolerability  
• Side Effects.  A symptoms checklist will be used to assess participants experience (yes/no) of 
common smoking/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113198], including cough, dry mouth, shortness of breath, mouth 
and th roat irritation, headache, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and increased heart rate/palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. 
For each side effect reported, participants will be asked whether they attribute the side effect to 
cigarettes, EC, or both.  
• Safety. Adverse events observed or  reported will be recorded at each in -person visit. Assessments 
as to seriousness, severity, and the relationship to treatment and other causes will be made. Serious 
adverse events will also be captured in the centralized database. AEs and SAEs will be rep orted to the 
appropriate regulatory agencies.  
Descriptive measures (Week 0)  
• Demographic variables  include gender, age, marital/cohabitation status, socioeconomic status, 
psychiatric history, depressive symptoms (PHQ -9), and symptoms of generalized anxiety  (GAD -7). 
• Psychosocial variables  include individual - (federal poverty level, financial strain,  home 
ownership, housing stability) and area -level socioeconomic disadvantage (neighborhood social 
cohesion and trust, safety, and incivilities), race consciousne ss, experiences of discrimination, 
perceived stress, resilience,  and history of trauma (i.e., adverse childhood experiences). These 
factors influence differences in smoking outcomes in racial/ethnic minority and socioeconomically 
disadvantaged smokers and were chosen for that reason.  
• Cigarette use history  will include cigarettes per day, age when started smoking regularly, length of 
time as a smoker, number of [ADDRESS_126309] quit 
attempt, other smokers/vapers in the home, smoking/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_113199]/family members.   
 
C. Study results to participants   
Study results will not be shared with participants.  
 
D. Publication Plan  
We plan to publish results in appropriate tobacco journals – e.g., JAMA, JNCI, Journal of General 
Internal Medicine, Addiction, Annals of Behavioral Medicine, Nicotine & Tobacco Research, Cancer 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], Biomarkers, & Prevention.

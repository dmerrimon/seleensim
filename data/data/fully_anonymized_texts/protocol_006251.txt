 Background:  
 Benign esophageal strictures can be challenging  condition to treat. The mainstay of 
treatment is endoscopic dilations. However, 30 to 40% of these strictures recur despi[INVESTIGATOR_457694]
1. Although a consensus definition does not exist, a stricture is typi[INVESTIGATOR_457695] a 
refractory benign esophageal stricture (RBES), when there is a failure to maintain luminal 
patency after at least [ADDRESS_584707] commonly the sequelae of radiation, surgery, caustic agent ingestion, peptic injury, photodynamic therapy, or endoscopic mucosal resection
3. Hypertrophy of scar tissue is the 
underlying mechanism leading to re-stenosis4.  
Patients with RBES are extremely difficult to manage and the current armamentarium 
includes repeated endoscopic dilations, corticosteroid or mitomycin C injections, incisional therapy, and/ or temporary stent placement
5-10. These procedures are costly, their efficacy can be 
short- lived, and are associated with great burden both for the patient and clinician. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_457696], patients often still fail and go on to require enteral nutrition support. The largest study on the natural history of RBES found that the mean dysphagia free interval was 3 months, and only 2.4 months for patients treated with endoscopic stenting. The clinical success rate for patients treated with stenting was only 12.5%.
11   
Esophageal self -dilation therapy (ESDT), where the patient learns to pass a polyvinyl 
dilator orally on a routine basis, has been in practice since at least the 1970s, however, no prospective studies have evaluated the outcomes ESDT.  The lar gest study to date on ESDT 
retrospectively studied [ADDRESS_584708] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_406176].   Hypothese s: 
 Amon g patients with refractory benign esophageal stricture who were treated endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], we 
hypothesized the following: 
1. Compared  to an endoscopy as needed approach, esophageal self -dilation therapy decreases 
the number of endoscopic dilations and prolongs dysphagia free intervals 
2. Esophageal self -dilation therapy is a safe and well tolerated therapy  
3. ESDT significantly lower s health cost in managing refractory esophageal stricture 
 
Primary Aim s: 
 
1. Assess the clinical efficacy of ESDT for patients with RBES defined as number of endoscopic interventions  6 months following serial dilation  
 Secondary  Aim s: 
1. Length of intervention free interval and dysphagia score  
2. Evaluate factors which could influence clinical success of ESDT incl uding etiology and  
location of the stricture  
3. Assess the safety of ESDT by [CONTACT_457700], bleeding and pain.  
4. Assess acceptance of ESDT by [CONTACT_457701] 
5. The cost saving in ESDT compared to the current standard of care (repetitive endoscopic dilation)  
6. Evaluate long term outcomes of self-dilatation at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months following participation in the 6 month randomized or prospective observational trial  
 
 Methods : 
Study Design: 
 This is a prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating the outcomes o
 f self -dilation. 
Patients who present  to the esophageal clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster MN and Mayo Clinic Phoenix, AZ  
with refractory benign esophageal strictures who undergo standard clinical care of serial endoscopic dilation to achieve an esophageal diameter of at least 10-[ADDRESS_584709] clinical care consisting of endoscopic dilation as needed  vs self -
dilation  therapy .  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 for Patients : 
1. [ADDRESS_584710] once a week  
 Exclusion Criteria   
1. Patient  with malignant esophageal stricture  
2. Angulated stricture which prevents safe passage of Maloney dilator in office setting  
3. In ability to achieve an esophageal diameter of 10 mm with endosocpic dilatiation 
4. Known significant esophageal motor disorder ( i.e. achalasia, aperistalsis, functional 
obstruction, jackhammer, dis tal esophageal spasm) * 
5. The presence of esophageal stent  
6. Inability to learn self -dilation  secondary to blindness or cognitive dysfunction 
7. Use of chronic anticoagulants   
 
Study Flow and Recruitment  
  1. Patients referred to the esophageal clinic with dysphagia secondary to RBES will be asked to complete  the Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire (MDQ-30). Th e MDQ will be completed 
before obtaining informed consent. Quality of life will also be measured at the beginning at end of the [ADDRESS_584711] 10-12 mm 
3. After informed consent , participants will be randomized to one of two groups using a block 
randomization approach; Group 1) self -dilation , group 2) observation with repeat endoscopy 
and dilatio ns as needed at symptoms recurrence.  
4. Patients  randomized to self- dilation  who refuse self -dilation  will be assigned to the 
observation group and will be counted in the ESDT failure   
5. Patients randomized to ESDT will be taught ESDT immediately following th e last 
endoscopic dilation. ESDT teaching will take over 1-[ADDRESS_584712] clinical care group will be offered self -dilation .  
10. At any point of the study if patients decide to crossover to the other group, this will be allowed but counted as treatment failure 
11. Close supervision and follow up will be performed via weekly phone calls from a member of the study personnell Patients will be asked to complete the MDQ -30 monthly and at the end 
of the study.  
12. Patients who decline participation in the randomized study will be offered both treatments  
clinically  then will be followed prospectively and their data will be collected. These patients 
will be asked to fill the dysphagia score to assess symptoms regardless of the method of treatment.  
13. At the conclusion of the 6 months randomized or observational  study duration patients will 
be offered the following: 
1. All patients  who participated in the randomized or observational study will be offered 
to continue prospective follow up with phone calls to obtain the MDQ -30 score and 
need for endoscopy at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after conclusion of the initial 6 month 
duration of the study  
Rem uneration:   
1. Patients in the  randomized self -dilation group will be provided with the self -dilator  free of 
charge.  
2. Patients in the  randomized observation group will receive endoscopic dilation as needed with 
charges to  the patients and their health insuran ce as appropriate since this is the standard of 
care 
3. Patients in both groups will receive stipend of $25 for each questionnaire for the time spent in completing the dysphagia questionnaire during the randomized 6 month study duration 
4. Patients who participa te in the prospective observational study, and who either chose self-
dilation or observation will receive stipend of $25 for each questionnaire for the time spent in completing the dysphagia questionnaire 
Patients who agree to the prospective extension study will receive a stipend of $[ADDRESS_584713] questionnaire s. 
Statistical Analysis:  
Sample Size Estimation:  
Based on the current knowledge from our prior experience, the clinical success of ESDT 
appears to be 80%. The clinical success of repetitive endoscopic dilation is reported in the literature to be 30%. Assuming a 50% improvement in clinical success with ESDT and using 1:1 randomizing, t he estimated  minimum number of patients needed is 30 patients ( 15 in each 
group). Given the extreme paucity of data on self dilation and ambiguity about the potential improvement we intend to recruit 40 patients across the two sites ([COMPANY_002]ster and Phoenix).This estimated number will provide  at least  80% power of finding a significant difference at a P value 
of 0.05  
Up to 40 patients who chose not to participate in the randomized trial, but who agree to 
be followed in the prospective observational group wil l be recruited.  
 
 The following table summarizes the key questions and corresponding approaches to be addressed by [CONTACT_15365].    Primary Endpoint: 
1. Compare the number of endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_457697] a [ADDRESS_584714] clinical care.  
 
Secondary Endpoints: 
 
1. Determine t he length of intervention free interval 
 
2. Dysphagia score   
3. Number of clinically significant adverse events including perforation, bleeding and pain   
4. Cost of ESDT compared to the current standard of care (repetitive endoscopic dilation)

Aim of the Study  
The primary aim of thi s research is to determine the accuracy of smartphone pulse 
oximeters in detecting blood oxygen saturations, epi[INVESTIGATOR_820025] , and heart rate by 
[CONTACT_820027] a Masimo© hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -grade pulse oximeter.   
 
Introduction  
Digital innovations have made it possible for consumers to use mobile devices for 
medical purposes. They can be used to  monitor physiological parameters  such as  blood pressure, 
heart rate, blood oxygen satura tion, and body temperature. They can also be used  to conduct 
diagnostic tests , request  prescription  refills , and relay medical information to physicians .1 
Consequently, the h ealthcare  sector is being profoundly affected  by [CONTACT_820028] .1,2 
A frequen t reliance on mobile devices  has been reported among  healthcare practitioner s (HCP s) 
and students, with 85% reporting the use of a mobile device at least once daily for clinical 
purposes. The most common use was  for information,  time management , or communication 
relating to education and patient care.3 In 2010, approximately 50 percent of physicians used a 
mobile phone or a smart  mobile  device as a part of his or her practice. In 2015, that number 
increased to approximately 70 percent.  The overall growth of applications (apps)  was 38.[ADDRESS_1136341] five years ; in regards to medical apps, the growth  
was documented at  41.[ADDRESS_1136342]  not yet been established.  
 
Smartphone pulse oximeters and other mobile health (mHealth) apps are examples of 
new and evolving technology, which if developed accurately  and used correctly , may make a 
difference in  the lives of  many individuals . A study conducted by [CONTACT_820029] d be available on mobile phones  many global infectious diseases, such as 
pneumonia in children, could be treated faster and mortality rate would thus decrease due to 
prompt detection of changes in vital signs  alongside quicker treatments .5, 6 Studies from both 
Canada and Uganda regardin g the Phone Oximeter  prototype (a device interfacing pulse 
oximeters and smartphones)  provide an  overall usability scores of 82 percent and 78 percent 
respectiv ely, indicative that a phone could  be a functional oximeter interface.7 A usability score 
of  > 75% is considered appropriate as a functional interface. Additionally, a blinded randomized 
control trial in Australia, revealed that self -monitoring of oxygen saturation via a telehealth app 
Breathe -easy© reduced exacerbations of asthma in pregnant women.[ADDRESS_1136343] lung function.8 
 
 3 Alexander et al compared four different smartpho ne application -based monitors: Instant 
Blood Pressure, Instant Blood Pressure Pro, Pulse Oximeter, and Pulse Oximeter Pro . Three 
different parameters were measured using these four devices: heart rate, blood pressure , and 
SpO 2. The comparison revealed a la rge degree of variance in the values between the Instant 
Blood Pressure, the Instant Blood Pressure Pro, the Pulse Oximeter, and the Pulse Oximeter 
Pro.[ADDRESS_1136344] of th ree different mobile pulse oximeter devices, all interfaced to Apple iPod 
Touch devices : the Nonin Xpod, the Masimo OEM inline module, and an Audio Phone Oximeter 
prototype . The study showed that there was more motion artifact at lower saturations for all three 
of the devices. The most valid measurements was found with Masimo’s mobile device at 
readable values of approximately [ADDRESS_1136345] SpO 2 and heartrates on smartphones is emerging and 
widely available , there is n o evidence supporting its use in patients with lung disease . 
Smartphone pulse oximetry could be useful in individual s with acute or chronic lung disease ; 
however , device inaccuracies could be harmful  if desaturations are not detected  immediately . It 
is not  known how accurately these devices detect oxygen saturation /desaturation  in patients with 
acute or chronic lung  conditions . This study will be used to evaluate the accuracy of smartphone 
pulse oximeters in patients that will be undergoing a six -minute walk test in a pulmonary 
function lab.   
 
Experimental  Design  and Methods  
This is a prospective, observational study conducted  at the pulmonary function laboratory at 
Rush University Medical Center. Subjects  (n=48) will be selected if they are of [ADDRESS_1136346] , and  agree to participate. The 
following information will be  collected:  
 First name  
 Last name  
 Date of Birth  
 Age 
 Height  
 Gender  
 Race/Ethnicity  
 Oxygen use and frequency (if they are already on oxygen)  
 Pulmonary Disorder s 
 Borg’s Dyspnea Scale  
 Heart rate (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -grade pulse oximeter and  external and built -in smartphone pulse 
oximeter; pre - and post - test) 
 SpO 2 (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -grade pulse oximeter and external and built -in smartphone puls e oximeter; 
pre- and post - test) 
 
Procedures  
For every patient that meets inclusion criteria, demographic  information such as: age, 
race, and gender will be collected. Weight will be measured in the pulmonary function clinic by 
[CONTACT_820030][INVESTIGATOR_105489]. Heart rate and SpO [ADDRESS_1136347] ( before and after t he test) . Parameters  will be measured 
 4 using an iPhone attached external pulse oximeter (Kenek Edge, LionsGate Technologies, 
Vancouver, Canada),  a Samsung S8 (Samsung Electronics Co. Inc., Seoul, South Korea) built -in 
pulse oximeter, and  a Masimo© (Masimo C orporation, Irvine, [LOCATION_004]) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -grade pulse 
oximeter. Readings will be obtained before and after the test. All three devices will be used to 
obtain readings from a single  arm, consecutively. Each reading will be recorded manually by 
[CONTACT_820031]. Each reading will be  recor ded using RedCap software and later 
transferred to SPSS software for data analysis. All data  placed  on the  RedCap software and SPSS  
will only be accessible by [CONTACT_202287].  
 
Subject Population  
Inclusion criteria  
Ambulatory patients, [ADDRESS_1136348]  (n = 30)  that agree to participate.  
Exclusion criteria  
 
Patients wh o are under the age of 18  years or  patients with high blood pressure above 
180/90 mm  Hg or pressure below 70/[ADDRESS_1136349] severe headaches, if SpO 2 at or below 85% on  supplemental oxygen or if  patients 
are on  oxygen greater than [ADDRESS_1136350] will be 
used to determine any significant association between age, gender, diagnosis, weight, and 
oxygen use (p< .05). Alpha will be used as 0.05 and beta will be used as 0.20. It can be predicted 
that these tests will be parametric. A  scatter plot will be used to assess bias and validity.

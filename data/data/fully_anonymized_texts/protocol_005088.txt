[ADDRESS_232031] of 
UVA light. The device has a timer that allows a precise 30 -minute exposure of the 
corneal tissues.  The irradiation field of the UVX system produces UVA light with a 
uniform irradiance of 3 mj/cm2 at the corneal surface.        
 
The FDA has classified this technology as a combination product wit h two components.  
First is the UV -X light source, which has an LED source and is calibrated and rendered 
uniform by [CONTACT_195546].  The second component is a riboflavin 
ophthalmic solution.  This solution is used to saturate the cornea l stroma prior to its 
photochemical activation .  
 
 This combination product has been studied in a FDA -approved, randomized, placebo -
controlled, multi -center trial that has enrolled patients.  Financial problems led to 
suspension of this trial (IND [ZIP_CODE]) .  In addition, the system has been the subject of a 
prospective double blind study in Australia and the preliminary report on the first [ADDRESS_232032] frequent 
indication for corneal transplantation and accounted fo r 21% of the transplanted co rneas 
supplied by [CONTACT_195547] 2008 (2008 Eye Banking Statistical 
Report, available at www.restoresight.org).  Corneal transplantation has inherent risks 
that could result in permanent loss of vision and significantly impact the p atient’s quality 
of life during the surgical recovery phase, with lost work time, and often permanent 
changes in lifestyle.  Moreover, corneal transplantation permanently weakens the eye 
leading to a lifetime of increased risk of perforation from minor tra uma and loss of the 
eye.[ADDRESS_232033] of eyes and can lead to the need of 
glaucoma surgery to control intra -ocular pressure.4 Filtration surgery, and to a lesser 
degree, the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_195531]. African -Americ ans in particular, may be at 
increased risk of immunologic graft reactions based on the rejection rate encountered in a 
variation of corneal transplantation, Descemet’s strippi[INVESTIGATOR_195532].[ADDRESS_232034].  
 
Based on the available data, corneal collagen cross -linking offers th e only alternative to 
the relentless progression of optical degradation that leads to vision loss and surgical 
corneal transplantation.  The practice of having treatment overseas is not ideal.  While the 
patient’s immediate needs are met, their follow up i s uneven and there is no attempt to 
capture the clinical data associated with their case.   
We are experienced in the use of this technology, as we have been a part of the multi -
center placebo -controlled trial.  Furthermore, we are conducting an independen t 
investigator -sponsored investigational plan for this technology that is being used to study 
the effect of this photochemical interaction on corneal infectio ns (IND 104,456).  Our 
 
4 
 center is unique in that we perform approximately 1% of all corneal transpl ants in the 
[LOCATION_002], and many keratoconus patients are referred to our busy tertiary referral 
center for treatment.  
Rationale  
Previous studies of corneal collagen cross -linking have employed riboflavin dosing 
regimens of [ADDRESS_232035] the effective depth of the 
treatment. This study is a prospective randomized study to evaluate potential dosing 
effects.  
Clinical Experience  
 
UVA/ribo flavin corneal collagen cross -linking was first used clinically in 1998.6  (Unless 
specified otherwise, the treatments referenced below all used UVA light (365 -370 nm, 3 
mw/cm2, 30 minutes) with photosensitizing riboflavin 0.1% (10 mg in 10 ml dextran -T-
500 20% solution) applied after a central corneal abrasion, beginning at least 5 minutes 
before irradiation and continuing every 2 -5 minutes during irradiation.)  
 
Wollensak et al. treated [ADDRESS_232036] of cross -linking on 
patients with moderate or advanced keratoconus. The mean preoperative maximum K -
value (Kmax) was 50.93 D, and the mean preoperative progression of Kmax was 1.42 D 
(±1.18 D) in the before cross -linking.  After cross -linking, there was a mean decrease in 
Kmax of  2.01 D (p=0.001) with follow -up of 3 to 47 months (mean 23.2 ±12.9 months).  
In five of the untreated contralateral eye controls, the mean Kmax progressed an average 
of 1.[ADDRESS_232037] spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) improved by [CONTACT_5554] 1.26 lines 
(p=0.026) and manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) improved by [CONTACT_191457] 1.14 D (p=0.03) in the treated eyes.  No adverse events occurred.  The postoperativ e 
healing process was unremarkable except for slight transient stromal edema during the 
first 3 postoperative days.  Corneal and lens transparency, intraocular pressure (IOP), and 
endothelial cell density (p=0.45) were unchanged after treatment compared to  baseline.  
 
Similarly, Caporossi et al. reported a 3.6 line increase in uncorrected visual acuity 
(UCVA), a 1.66 line improvement in BSCVA, a mean reduction in Kmax of 2.1 D 
(±0.13), and a 2.5 D reduction in MRSE at 3 months after cross -linking in a serie s of 10 
eyes in 10 patients with progressive keratoconus.7  There were no changes in endothelial 
cell density or IOP.  
 
Patients treated in an ongoing clinical study at the University of Dresden (Dresden, 
[LOCATION_013]), have experienced outcomes similar to those  reported by [CONTACT_195548].  A 
preliminary analysis of the Dresden keratometry data shows a 1.25 D reduction in

 maximum corneal curvature (K -max) in those eyes that have reached the [ADDRESS_232038] is significant 
through 5 years after the CCCL treatment and the trend cont inues to be observed as long 
as 7 years after cross -linking.

Kohlhaas presented results for 127 of these eyes at the 2005 Congress of the German -
Language Society for Intrakularlinsen Implantation and Refraktive Surgery with a 
follow -up of up to 60 months.  Progression of keratoconus was stopped in all the eyes, 
and 81.7% of them showed a mean decrease of 2.87 D in Kmax.  No opacification of the 
lens or change in endothelial cell density was seen in any patient.  Long term follow -up 
results in a subset of 60 eyes in the Dresden Clinical Study that underwent cross -linking 
3-5 years ago confirm the lasting effects of cross -linking in that there has been no 
progression of keratoconus in any of the eyes and 51.2% (31/60) of the eyes have a slight 
reversal and flattening of the Kmax. Kohlhaas et al. also reported a patient who 
developed bilateral keratectasia at 4 weeks after LASIK and underwent UVA/riboflavin 
cross -linking [ADDRESS_232039] been enrolled in an Australian randomized study of 
observation -only control versus cross -linking in eyes with progressive keratoconus.1  
Maximum K -readings taken before and at 6 and 12 mont hs after cross -linking showed a 
mean decrease of –0.92 diopters and -1.45 diopters in the treatment group (P=0.002).[ADDRESS_232040], the untreated control eyes show a statistically significant increase of 0.60 D and 
1.28 D in K -readings at 6 and 12 months a fter randomization.1  The treatment group also 
showed an improvement in BSCVA, while BSCVA in the control group worsened.

 Similar to the Dresden experience, these data lead to the conclusion that corneal cross -
linking halts, and even reverses, the progres sion of keratoconus.  
 
The only adverse event reported after epi[INVESTIGATOR_195533] a pretreatment corneal thickness of approximately 300 microns, 
presumably caused by [CONTACT_195549]. Subs equent experiments 
led to the conservative recommendation that corneas not be treated with UVA/riboflavin 
unless they are thicker than [ADDRESS_232041] formation as a result of 
UVA/riboflavin treatment.  Most of the UVA light is absorbed within the first [ADDRESS_232042] lens (approximately 100 
microns thick) can be applied to the cornea when necessary to  increase the minimum 
thickness .[ADDRESS_232043] wavelength of UVA used. Therefore we do not anticipate a ny significant level of 
UVA light reaching the crystalline lens.  
 
Using confocal microscopy, Mazotta et al. evaluated 10 patients treated with 
UVA/riboflavin for progressive keratoconus and found normal epi[INVESTIGATOR_195534] 5 days 
after cross -linking.  Nerve regeneration was observed at 1 month and nerve fiber 
recolonization was complete at 6 months with restoration of corneal sensitivity.  No 
changes were observed in th e peripheral untreated area at any time.  Recently, Seiler et al. 
described a thin corneal stromal demarcation line that was detectable by [CONTACT_195550] a depth of approximately 300 microns 2 weeks after cross -linking in 14 of 
16 eyes evaluated. This demarcation line is believed to be due to a difference in the 
refractive index or reflection properties of untreated and cross -linked corneal stroma.  
When epi[INVESTIGATOR_164622] (approximately 50 microns) is taken into account, the 300 
micron demarcati on line observed by [CONTACT_195551]. is consistent with the studies and 
theoretical principles that the selected parameters for UVA/riboflavin treatment produce 
maximal cross -linking to a depth of about 200 microns and that 94% of the UVA light is 
absorbed in  the anterior [ADDRESS_232044] corneal meridian is identical to the 
findings reported from the FDA approved American multi center trial as summarized in 
data shown at professional meetings.

 Risks  
 
Riboflavin, also known as Vitamin B2, is a naturally occurring photosensitizer.  It is the 
precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), two 
coenzymes that are crucial for the met abolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins into 
energy.  Riboflavin is an essential constituent of all living cells.  It is water -soluble and 
only a trace amount is found in the human body.  Riboflavin is non -toxic and it is used as 
a coloring agent in fo od and pharmaceuticals.  The intake of riboflavin from food and diet 
supplements ranges from [ADDRESS_232045] concentration of riboflavin used in the riboflavin/UVA treatment is 0.1%.  
The maximum amount of riboflavin to which a patient is exposed durin g treatment is 
estimated to be  1.6 mg based on the volume of one drop being 0.05 ml and 1 drop 
being instilled every 2 minutes during the 30 -minute pre -treatment, and every 2 or 5 
minutes for 30 minutes during the UVA light irradiation. This amount is be low the 43 mg 
“safe” limit by [CONTACT_195552].  
 
The potential cytotoxicity of UVA light and the UVA/riboflavin exposure on keratocytes 
and endothelial cell function have been characterized in a series of in vitro  experiments. 
In each of these experim ents, UVA exposure (370 nm, 30 minutes) and riboflavin 
(0.025% solution; equivalent to the corneal concentration after diffusion of a 0.1% 
solution) were administered to mimic conditions of clinical usage. Irradiance levels were 
varied to determine the irr adiance threshold for cytotoxic effects. Keratocyte toxicity was 
evaluated in porcine keratocyte cell cultures after exposure to riboflavin alone, UVA light 
alone (irradiance range 2 to 9 mw/cm2), and UVA light plus riboflavin (irradiance range 
0.4 to 1 mw /cm2). Riboflavin alone had no cytotoxic effect on keratocytes.  The cytotoxic 
threshold for inducing cellular necrosis or apoptosis was 5 mw/cm2 for UVA light alone 
and 0.5 mw/cm2 for the UVA/riboflavin treatment.  Using the Lambert -Beer equation, in 
huma n corneas the cytotoxic keratocyte UVA irradiance of 0.5 mw/cm2 is reached at a 
stromal depth of 300 microns.  The potential for endothelial cell toxicity was evaluated 
on endothelial cell cultures obtained from porcine cornea that were exposed to riboflav in 
alone and to various UVA irradiances (range 0.1 to 1.6 mw/cm2) with and without 
riboflavin. An abrupt cytotoxic threshold was observed at an irradiance of 4 mw/cm2 for 
UVA light alone and was ten -fold lower with an irradiance threshold of 0.35 mw/cm2 for 
the UVA/riboflavin treatment.  No endothelial cell damage was observed in the cells 
treated with riboflavin alone.  Endothelial cell damage in the UVA groups is believed to 
 
8 
 be due to oxidative damage caused by [CONTACT_195553] (singlet o xygen, 
superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide) that are generated by [CONTACT_195554].  
 
The lower cytotoxic thresholds observed for the UVA/riboflavin combination in the 
keratocyte and endothelial cell toxicity studies are consistent with the increase in UVA 
absorption in the presence of riboflavin. For example, 94% of incident UVA light is 
absorbed in the anterior 400 microns of the corneal stroma in the presence of riboflavin, 
as depi[INVESTIGATOR_195535], whereas only 32% is absorbed within that depth in 
the absence of riboflavin.  
 
UV-X™ Illumination System  
 
The UV -X™ Illumination System is a portable electronic medical device. The device’s 
light emitting diode (LED) is used to deliver a metered dose of UV -A light to a targeted 
treatment area for illu minating the cornea during corneal collagen cross -linking.  
Components of the UV -X™ System include the LED light source, UV light detector, UV 
detector sensor probe and adapter, wall power supply with DC cord, transportation case, 
safety goggles (to be wor n by [CONTACT_45907]), mechanical stand (C -clamp, cross clamp, rods), and 
an instruction manual. System specifications are as follows:  
 
Light Source  High Power UV -grade LED; LED Laser class 3R (EN [ZIP_CODE] -1) 
(Mfg. Nichia Co. LTD; Tokyo, Japan)  
Wavelength  365 nm (± 10  nm) 
Optical Power  Maximum [ADDRESS_232046]  
Intensity Setting  3.0 mw/cm2 (±0.3 mw/cm2) 
Safety Class  Class II Equipment (EN [ZIP_CODE] -1) 
Medical Device Class  Class Imia according to MDD 93/42/EEC  
EMI.EM C Class  Class B (EN [ZIP_CODE] -1) 
Power Supply  SELV (Safety Extra Low Voltage)   9V;   max. 1.7A  
 
The Light Source  houses the UVA irradiation mechanism.  The LED is preset by [CONTACT_195555] a wavelength of 365 nm at an intensity of 
3 mw/cm2 (±0.3 mw/cm2). UVA light emission is controlled by [CONTACT_195556], which controls the electrical current used to drive the UV -LED.  No UV 
light will be emitted in case of processor or LED failure. The diameter of the Light 
Source beam aperture is [ADDRESS_232047] with an approximate diameter 
of 7.5 mm, 9.5 mm or  11.5 mm, which is controlled by [CONTACT_195557]. An intensity of 3 mw/cm2 and irradiance time of [ADDRESS_232048] surface dose of 5.4 J/cm2 surface exposure. The Light 
Source has an integrat ed timer that automatically shuts off the light emission after [ADDRESS_232049] powers the Light Source.  The On/Off switch (On =  
 
9 
 ready mode) powers the device; the Start/Stop button controls UVA emission; and, status 
display lights (Red - Internal error, yellow -UV emission, Green -Device is powered, but no 
UV emission) indicate the status of the UV -X™ device. A battery operated UV Light 
detector , with a  built-in low battery warning, is used to check the UV light irradiation in 
the treatment plane before patient treatment.  The UV Light detector consists of a Sensor 
Probe and an indicator.  The Sensor Probe Adapter  with a Sensor Probe is permanently 
mounte d to the UV -light illumination system to shield the beam aperture and should only 
be removed for treatment.

the study  
 
Vulnerable Populations:  
 
11 
 Non-English Speaking  
This study plans to exclude any person who does not speak English as this is an 
unfunded study and there are no available funds to provide for a translator at each 
study visit or to translate the consent form in the patient’s native language.  
 
Minors:   
If a person not of age of legal consent (18), but who is at least 10 years  of age meets 
all inclu sion/exclusion criteria for the study, parents will be given a copy of the 
consent form and will be given time to read it, ask any questions of the investigator 
and staff, and explain it to the underage subject. The parent will then determine 
whether the s ubject voluntarily decides to participate in the research.  The minor will 
sign the consent with the parent providing assent.   
 
Decisionally Impaired:   
All subjects will be evaluated for capacity to consent through the use of the Cornea 
Research Foundatio n of America Evaluation to Sign a Consent Form.  Any subjects 
who answer all questions satisfactorily will be permitted to provide informed consent.  
If the enrolling physician or designated staff member determines that a potential 
subject is not competent  to provide a research informed consent, it will be determined 
whether or not the subject has a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR).  If the 
subject does not have a LAR, they will not be permitted to enter the study.  If the 
potential subject has a LAR , both the subject and LAR will be given a copy of the 
consent form and will be given time to read it and ask any questions of the 
investigator and staff.  The LAR will then be given time to explain it to the subject. 
The subject will sign the consent with  the LAR providing assent.   
    
Pregnant Women : 
Pregnant women will not be enrolled into this study because hormonal changes 
during pregnancy can sometimes temporarily alter the shape of the cornea.  
Examination Schedule:  
The patients will be followed to 6  months.  The following examination schedule will be 
followed:  
 Preoperative ( -60 to day 0; any routine exam proce dures that we performed within 
[ADDRESS_232055] to be repeated at the screening visit)  
 Operative (Day 0)  
 Day 1 (1 -3 day s) 
 Week 1 or duration to healing of epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]  
 Month 3 ( 7 to 16  weeks)  
 Month 6 ( 16 to 40 weeks)  
Screening Eye Examination:  
Potential candidates will undergo a complete eye examination to determine their 
eligibility for treatment.  A complete ocular history , medical history and medication 
history will be obtained.  The complete eye examination and ocular history will include:  
 History of contact [CONTACT_13279]  
 
12 
  Family history of keratoconus  
 History of eye rubbing  
 History of refractive surgery  
 UCVA (distance)  
 BSCVA (distance)  
 Manifest refraction  
 Pentacam analysis  
 Optical coherence tomography (OCT)  
 Corneal topography  
 Intraocular pressure (by [CONTACT_178578])  
 Slit lamp examination of the cornea, anterior chamber and lens  
 Dilated fundus examination  
 
Rando mization  
 
Subjects will be classified as having keratoconus, post -refractive ectasia, or pellucid 
marginal degeneration. In addition those with keratoconus will be classified as mild (flat 
keratometry reading < 51.00D), moderate (flat keratometry reading o f 51.25 to 56D or 
astigmatism  8D), or severe (flat keratometry reading >56D). Block randomization will 
be employed to ensure representation of each classification in both treatment groups.   If a 
subject has both eyes affected by [CONTACT_195562], the first eye treated will be randomized 
and the fellow eye will not.  Fellow eyes will not be included in the efficacy analysis and 
will be dosed at [ADDRESS_232056] to be treated will undergo the following procedure:  
Treat ment:  
Subjects will be prepared for treatment in accordance with the instructions for use in the 
UV-X™ Illumination System Operator’s Manual, including the administration of the 
riboflavin and preoperative medications (e.g. topi[INVESTIGATOR_12866]).  
 
Prior to the treatment, the presence of an informed consent for it will be confirmed.  
Patients will receive a therapeutic contact [CONTACT_195563]. An 
operative report or chart note will be placed in the subject’s medical records documenting 
the procedures used for each patient. Selected treatment information, including the 
riboflavin administration, irradiance settings, and duration of irradiation exposure will be 
documented.  
 
The subject will lie on a surgical table or chair with the head supp orted in a headrest. The 
bed will be adjusted so the subject can lie flat or recline comfortably for the duration of 
the procedure without moving.  The skin around the eye and the conjunctival surfaces 
will receive a surgical cleansing.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_195538] a lid speculum 
will be placed between the lids of the eye to be treated.  The surgeon will remove  the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_195539] a circular area approximately [ADDRESS_232057] lens (approximately 100 microns in thickness) may be applied to increase  the 
minimum  thickness to  at least 375 microns  before starting the irradiation .  
 
During irradiation, instillation of riboflavin will be continu ed every 2 minutes or every 5 
minutes, depending on the group to which the patient was randomized.    
 
Prior to use, the UV -X™ illumination system will be assembled and tested according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions.  The UV irradiance dose is the pro duct of the irradiance 
intensity and the exposure time.  The intensity is a fixed parameter of the device. It is 
checked during the light test and cannot be changed by [CONTACT_28024].  
 
The eye will be aligned under the UV -X™ light with the treatment plane at a w orking 
distance that is 50 mm from the UV -X™ beam aperture.  The correct aperture setting will 
be selected for the size of the eye (7.5, 9.5, or 11 mm), and the eye will be irradiated for 
30 minutes, during which time instillation of riboflavin will contin ue (1 drop every 2 
minutes or every 5 minutes, depending upon the randomization).  At the end of [ADDRESS_232058] and reviewed prior to discharge. The following postoperative eye 
drops will be prescribed:  
1. antibiotic drops gtt 1 qid until; 24 hours after epi[INVESTIGATOR_195540].   
2. Prednis olone 1% ophthalmic suspension (PredForte® or generic 
equivalent) [ADDRESS_232059]'s chart.  Other 
prescription or nonprescription medica tions may be taken as needed throughout the 
treatment.

A treatment flow chart summarizing the follow -up examination schedule and required 
procedures to be performed at each treatment visit is provided in Ap pendix A. All 
subjects will be seen at 1 day, 1 week,  3, and 6 months.  If a study participant is unable to 
return to the study site for the 1 -week exam, they may see a local doctor and efforts will 
be made to obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_195541].

The following w ill be performed at each visit unless noted otherwise.  
 UCVA distance  
 BSCVA distance (omit on Day 1 and Week 1)  
 Manifest refraction (omit on Day 1 and Week 1)  
 Pentacam measurements (omit on Day 1 and  Week 1) , including  
o Pachymetry  
o Scheimpflug photography  
 Corneal topography (omit on Day 1 and Week 1)  
 Intraocular pressure (by [CONTACT_178578] (omit on Day 1)  
 Slit lamp examination of the cornea, anterior chamber and lens  
 Optical coherence tomography (OCT, omit on Day 1)  
 
Reasonable effort will be made by [CONTACT_195564] a 
scheduled follow -up visit.  
Retreatment  
Any subject who is at least [ADDRESS_232060] both eyes treat ed; however, o nly the first treated eye per patient 
will be considered for the efficacy analysis. All treated eyes will be included in the safety 
analysis.  Fellow eyes can be treated on the same or a different day as the randomized 
eye; this decision will  be made by [CONTACT_195565].   
Safety Monitoring  
During the CXL treatment procedure, subjects will be observed closely to detect the 
occurrence of any adverse events or complications.  On the day of treatment and at each 
follow -up visit, the subjects will be questioned to determine whether any adverse events 
might have occurred since the last examination.  The presence or absence of adverse 
events or complications will be documented.  
 
Ophthalmic safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_195566], 
measurements of refraction, and measurement of visual acuity.  In the case of an adverse 
event or complication, the frequency of the examinations will be increased until the 
problem is resolved.  Any complications or vis ual adverse events will be recorded in the 
medical record and reported to the FDA.  
UV-X and Riboflavin Accountability  
All use of the UV -X™ Illumination System and Riboflavin  Ophthalmic Solution  will be 
under the direct supervision of the designated study coordinator.  The use of the 
Riboflavin solution will be maintained in a clinical treatment program log.

Data Analysis  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS software.  All enrolled subjects will be 
included in t he safety analysis. Testing will be 2 -sided and P -values < 0.[ADDRESS_232061] will be included in the efficacy analysis.  
 
Ethical and Regulatory Considerations  
 
This treatment will be conducted in accordance with FDA’s Good Clinical Practice 
regulations.  
Informed Consent  
In accordance with the provision of [ADDRESS_232062] 
is defined as “any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a drug or device if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of in cidence in the 
investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a drug or 
device that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of subjects.” Since CDER has primary 
jurisdiction for the regulation of this combination product,  serious and unanticipated 
 
16 
 adverse device effects will be reported to FDA and the IRB in accordance with the 
reporting requirements described above.

 7 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE  
 
The trial will be carried out in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and the following :  
• [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) applicable to clinical studies (45 
CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, 21 CFR Part 312 , and/or 21 CFR Part 8 12)  
 
NIH-funded investigators and clinical trial site staff who are responsible  for the conduct, 
management, or oversight of NIH -funded clinical trials  have completed Human Subjects 
Protection and ICH GCP Training.  
 
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will 
be submitted to the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) for review and approval. Approval of both 
the protocol and the consent form must be obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any 
amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by [CONTACT_52590]. In addition, a ll changes to the consent form will be IRB -approved; a n 
IRB determination will be made regarding whether  a new consent needs to be obtained from 
participants who provided consent using a previously approved consent form .  
  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191450] shown that the organism ( Borrelia burgdorferi ) may 
persist in animals after antibiotic therapy and can be detected by [CONTACT_165078] 
(Ixodes scapularis ) to acquire the organism through feeding (xenodiagnosis). Whether this 
occurs in humans is unknown. Currently available tests for human Lyme disease do not allow 
determination of persistent infection after antibiotic therapy.  
 
We performed the first study of the use of  I. scapularis  larva  for the xenodiagnosis of B. 
burgdorferi  infection in humans . Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_165049]  (AEs) . The most common AE was mild itching at the site. In this 
small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], xenodiagnosis for B. burgdorferi  was positive in [ADDRESS_191451] therapy; compare the 
rate of detection of B. burgdorferi  by [CONTACT_165079] -
treatment Lyme disease symptoms; identify subject characteristics related to the likelihood of 
detecting B. burgdorferi  by [CONTACT_165080]: time from infection, time between infection 
and therapy, time from therapy; a nd continue to assess the safety of xenodiagnosis in humans.  
 
The results of study have the potential to resolve this long -standing controversy in Lyme disease 
pathogenesis.  While xenodiagnosis is unlikely to be widely used in clinical practice due to the  
labor intensity and speed of testing, if our study shows a linkage between positive 
xenodiagnostic testing and persistence of symptoms after B. burgdorferi  infection, it may prove 
to be a useful tool for testing new strategies for treatment and for correl ation with more generally 
applicable diagnostic markers. Understanding the pathogenesis of persistent symptoms following 
Lyme disease , and identifying reliable diagnostic tests for determining the success of antibiotic 
therapy , is critical to the medical m anagement of these patients.   
 
 
 
  
  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191452] common vector borne disease in the [LOCATION_002] 1. It is transmitt ed to 
humans via the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. At the tick bite site, Borrelia burgdorferi , the 
causative organism of Lyme disease, enters the skin, often resulting in the characteristic 
erythema migrans (EM) rash. From the original entry site, the or ganism spreads to distant 
locations affecting the heart, joints and central nervous system. Many studies have shown that 
Lyme disease is treated successfully with antibiotics in the majority of cases, and patients with 
objective evidence of treatment failu re are rare with currently recommended regimens  2-5. 
Patients with late manife stations can have a slower response to therapy, sometimes taking weeks 
or months to recover 6-14. 
 
A portion of patients treated for Lyme disease will have persistent or relapsing non -specific 
symptoms (such as fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints)  after receiving an 
adequate course of antibiotic therapy, a condition that is called post -Lyme disease syndrome.  
The best estimates of the prevalence of post -Lyme disease syndrome come from studies o f 
patients with erythema migrans who received appropriate antibiotic treatment. 10 -40% of such 
patients have persistent or intermittent subjective symptoms of mild to moderate intensity [ADDRESS_191453] -
Lyme disease symptoms seems to correlate with disseminated disease, a greater severity of 
illness at presentation, and delayed antibiotic therapy 3,20-24. The pathogenesis of these symptoms 
(whether due to persistent infection, immunologic dysfunction , or other mechanism) remains an 
area of great controversy.  
 
A major conce rn has been that the symptoms of post -Lyme disease syndrome may represent 
persistent infection with B. burgdorferi . Hunfeld et al. 25 reported a 50% recovery rate of B. 
burgd orferi  from erythema migrans skin biopsies done before therapy in 3,421 patients, and 
1.7% of skin biopsies of patients (19 out of 1148) remained B. burgdorferi  positive by [CONTACT_921] 2 
months (range 1.3 -3 months) after antibiotic therapy. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_165050]. Objective evidence of Borrelia  infection in 
patients with post -Lyme disease syndrome has not been found using polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR ) 26,[ADDRESS_191454] -Lyme disease syndrome include changes in C6 
antibody l evels 30 and antibodies in immune complexes 31. Current serologic testing for 
antibodies to B. burgdorferi  remains positive for years after therapy and declines very slowly 
making it essentially useless for confirmation of successful therapy. There are many anecdotal 
reports of patients with different persistent symptoms improving with prolonged antibiotic 
therapy (and worsening with cessation), but randomized controlled trials to date have not shown 
significant, sustained benefit from antibiotic therapy 26,27,32. The question of whether patients 
continue to harbor B. burgdorferi  after antibiotic therapy has become a very contentious issue33.  
 
Although the prevailing belief in the scientific and medical establishments is that pat ients do not 
continue to harbor B. burgdorferi  and that long -term antibiotics are of no value, recent animal 
  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191455] now been replicated by [CONTACT_165081] . 38-
40,46,47 
 
The use of a natural vector (i.e., I. scapularis)  to detect the presence of an organism is called 
xenodiagnosis. Xenodiagnosis has been used in the diagnosis of human infections in instances 
where other diagnostic testing is difficult either due to difficulties/risks of obtaining proper 
specimen s for testing or due to difficulty in cultivating the organism. Xenodiagnosis has long 
been used in Lyme disease research to provide definitive evidence of a host's infection status. 
For Lyme disease, tick saliva has been shown to be a chemoattractant for the organism and thus 
feeding ticks have the potential to aggregate and concentrate bacteria from a wide area, 
improving sensitivity 48.  
 
Xenodiagnosis by [CONTACT_165082] a 
minimally invasive  method for determining the persistence of B. burgdorferi  after antibiotic 
therapy. We have performed the first study of the use of  I. scapularis  larva  for the xenodiagnosis 
of B. burgdorferi  infection in humans. The primary goals of this study were to dev elop 
procedures that could be used in xenodiagnostic testing of patients after antibiotic therapy with 
Lyme disease and to determine the safety of tick xenodiagnosis in humans.   
 
We have performed xenodiagnosis in [ADDRESS_191456] common  AE was mild itching at the tick attachment site. Results from 
the initial 36 participants are described in our manuscript “ Xenodiagnosis to detect Borrelia 
burgdorferi  infection: A  first-in-human study”, which has been published in the Clinical 
Infectious Diseases  journal49.  
 
Participants who underwent xenodiagnosis included [ADDRESS_191457] -treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), 5 patients with acute eryt hema 
migrans after completion of antibiotic therapy, one patient with erythema migrans on therapy 
(who also underwent xenodiagnosis after antibiotic therapy), and 10 healthy volunteers. Seven 
patients underwent more than one xenodiagnosis procedure.   
 
As no previous protocol for xenodiagnosis with I. scapularis  larva in humans existed, we 
developed a retention dressing using the LeFlap ™ (Monarch Labs, Irvine, CA)  dressing, which 
was modified for use with ticks. Participants  enrolled early in the trial had f ewer ticks feed 
successfully due to issues with the tick retention dressing that resulted in entrapment of the ticks 
in the adhesive.  
  Protocol Version  10 
22 Mar 2021  
 
 11 After modifying the dressing by [CONTACT_1583] a foam ring to create a barrier between ticks and 
adhesive, we were more consistently able to get between 30 and 50% of ticks to feed 
successfully.  
 
Xenodiagnosis was well tolerated. All participants  successfully completed the tick placement and 
there wer e no withdrawals during the study. The most common AE was mild itching at the site, 
which was seen in 58% of participants , with a median duration of [ADDRESS_191458] 
common complaint. There were no serious AEs associated with the procedure. Although not a 
primary goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we did find 2 participants  that tested positive and 2 participants  
who tested indeterminate for the presence of B. burgdo rferi in the xenodiagnostic ticks.   
 
In this Phase 2 study, we plan to expand our study of xenodiagnosis for Lyme disease in humans. 
Xenodiagnostic evidence that B. burgdorferi  survives in humans after antibiotic therapy may 
fundamentally change the approa ch to patients with persistent symptoms and provide physicians 
and researchers with a new tool with which to study the mechanisms of disease.

site PI) , and 5) Stony Brook University , Stony Brook, NY ([CONTACT_165127] , site PI) . 
  
All investigators are well -recognized experts in the field of Lyme disease and have prior  
experience in research.  Up to 240 participants  will be enrolled across all sites.

 12 3.2 Inclusion C riteria  
Criteria for the diagnosis and therapy for Lyme disease can be found at “The clinical assessment, 
treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: 
clinical practice guidelines by [CONTACT_165085]”  5. 
 
Patients with Lyme disease, po st-therapy (N=100)  
1. Age 18 or older . 
2. Lyme disease diagnosed in the previous 13 months, fulfilling the case definition of confirmed 
or probable Lyme disease by [CONTACT_165086] ( CDC )  
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/lyme -disease/case -definition/2017/  . 
3. Completion of [ADDRESS_191460] 12 months from initial treatment (N=40)  
1. Age 18 or older . 
2. Diagnosed with confirmed or probable Lyme disease fulfilling the case definition of Lyme 
disease by [CONTACT_165087]://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions /lyme -disease/case -definition/2017/  . 
3. Received recommended antibiotic therapy  for Lyme disease [ADDRESS_191461] 12 months between the 
end of the initial antibiotic therapy and the xenodiagnostic procedure.  
4. Persistent or recurrent symptoms that began or worsened within 6 months o f the diagnosis 
and treatment for Lyme disease.  
 
Acute EM (N=40)  
1. Age 18 or older.  
2. EM diagnosed by [CONTACT_5989].  
3. Receiving antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease for less than 48 hours.  
 
Lyme Arthritis (N=40)  
1. Age [ADDRESS_191462] not receive d antibiotic therapy for the disease.  
 
Healthy volunteers (N=20)  
1. Age 18 or older . 
2. No prior history of Lyme disease . 
3. Negative whole cell enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA ) or C6 -based antibody test 
for Lyme disease . 
 
Patients with recently diagnosed (acute) EM (within 48 hours of starting antibiotic therapy) and 
patients with untreated Lyme arthritis will be recruited in an attempt to increase the chances of 
finding a positive result by [CONTACT_165088] (an attempt of a “positive control”). While patient s 
with acute untreated EM would be the best positive control group, it would be unethical to 
withhold therapy in these patients for the few days required for tick feeding, due to the risk of 
dissemination of the organism and possible morbidity. Patients wi th untreated Lyme arthritis will

Borrelia  in the skin and xenodiagnosis may be able to recover the bacteria (but culture of skin 
biopsies from patients with EM become negative very quickly  - within one dose  - on antibiotic 
therapy) .  
 
While treatment for Lyme disease will not be offered under this protoc ol, it may be available via 
different clinical research protocols or regular medical care at the study site. If not, treatment will 
be prescribed by [CONTACT_102]’s primary care.  For patients with untreated early Lyme disease 
(erythema migrans), antibiotics can be started at the same day of tick placement. For patients 
with untreated Lyme arthritis, antibiotics can be started after collection of xenodiagnostic ticks 
(usually 4 -5 days, up to 7 days). For patients with Lyme arthritis, i f less than 14 ticks fed 
successfully and if the participant agrees, antibiotic treatment can be delayed until after the 
repeat procedure  (see Section 4.7). 
 
Patients with acute EM and untreated Lyme arthritis will be able to re -enroll as Patients with 
Lyme disease, post -therapy . Therefore, in case of positive results, we will be able to compar e 
between the procedures.   
 
Negative control patients will include healthy volunteers from Lyme endemic areas who have 
never been diagnosed with Lyme disease and have a negative B. burgdorferi  ELISA and C6 
antibody titer.

4. Inability to maintain the dressing for any reason .  
5. Pregnancy or lactation . 
6. Unwillingness to use an effective method of birth control for the duration of participation in 
the study (women of child -bearing potential only)  and for at least [ADDRESS_191465]

unsuitable for enrollment or could interfere with the patient participating in and completing 
the study.  
11. Refusal to partici pate in specimen collection and storage for future study related use. 
3.4 Exclusion from Skin Biopsy Part of the Protocol  
1. History of forming large thick scars  (keloids)  after skin injuries or surgery . 
2. History of excessive bleeding after cuts or procedures .  
3. Currently taking anticoagulants .  
4. History of allergy to lidocaine . 
3.5 Special Populations  
Children: Children are excluded from this protocol as there is no direct benefit to the 
participants, the risk from the skin biopsies is small but above min imal, the procedure is invasive 
and can be stressful for children, and there is concern over their ability to maintain the LeFlap 
dressing.  
 
Women:  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from trial participation  as there is no 
direct benefit to the participants . 
 
Adults who lack capacity to consent:  Adults lacking decision -making capacity to provide 
informed consent are excluded at screening  as there is no direct benefit to the participants . 
Enrolled participants who permanently lose the ability to c onsent during participation will be 
monitored for safety but will have no additional research procedures performed . 
 
NIH staff:  NIH staff and family members of study team members may be enrolled in this study 
as this population meets the study entry criter ia.  Neither participation nor refusal to participate 
as a subject in the research will have an effect, either beneficial or adverse, on the participant’s 
employment or position at NIH.  
Every effort will be made to protect participant information, but such  information may be 
available in medical records and may be available to authorized users outside of the study team 
in both an identifiable an unidentifiable manner.  
The NIH Information Sheet on NIH Staff  Research Participation will be made available .  Ple ase 
see S ection  [ADDRESS_191466] a history and a physical 
examination performed. Blood will be drawn and tested for Lyme serologies (approximately 8 
mL of blood) . Patients with acute EM will also have blood collected for culture, PCR, and other 
direct tests for B. burgdorferi  (approximately 50 mL). These tests may be performed at NYMC, 
NIH, and Tufts laboratories . This initial visit may or may not be combined with the tick 
placement visit (see below).  
  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191467] abnormal vital signs ( temperature >38. 0°C, a pulse greater than 105  beats per minute , 
systolic blood pressure >1 60 mm/Hg or diastolic blood pressure >95  mm/Hg , in at least  2 
measurements ) and  these individuals will be asked to follow up with their personal physician.  
They may be re -evaluated for tick placement at a subsequent time when the vital signs are within 
acceptable limits . 
 
Skin Biopsy  
Eligible participants  (acute EM, untreated Lyme arthritis and PTLDS) who agree to undergo the 
optional skin biopsy will have two 2 or 3  mm skin punch biopsies performed outside the site of 
the tick placement.  The skin will be cleansed and anesthetized with 2 percen t lidocaine with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  Each biopsy will be performed using a “punch” - a small disposable tubular knife. 
The wound will be closed, if necessary, with steri -strips or (rarely) with 1 or 2 interrupted nylon 
sutures. A bandage will be applied and partic ipants  will receive the instruction sheet regarding 
follow up procedures ( Appendix 1 ). If suture(s) are placed, patients will be asked to return in [ADDRESS_191468] the suture(s ) removed. Biopsies will not be done on face, neck, scalp, or over the 
tibia. One biopsy will be used for B. burgdorferi  culture and/or PCR. A second biopsy will be 
stored for future  study related  research .  
 
If the Initial Visit and the Placement Visit do  not occur together, the  initial  skin biopsy may be 
performed at either visit, accordingly to the preference of the participant and study personnel.  
 
Xenodiagnosis  
Between [ADDRESS_191469] been aged and are known to be ready to attach will be 
placed ( Figure 1). The area chosen for the placement will be as close as possible to the site of the 
previous EM, if possible. Ticks will not be attached to head, neck or genitalia. If necessary, body 
hair will be shaved at the site. The ticks will be placed inside the Cr eature Comforts II LeFlap ™ 
dressing which has been modified for tick use with the addition of a foam inner layer.  The 
LeFlap is a pre -assembled confinement dressing that is used with medical maggots. Participants  
will be requested to keep the dressing dry for the duration of the attachment. Participants  will 
receive an instruction sheet with instructions regarding care of the dressing and a Diary Card. 
The subject will be asked to complete a diary card daily starting the date of placement of the 
ticks throu gh 30 days after tick removal.

“punch” - a small disposable tubular knife. The wound will be closed, if necessary, with steri -
strips or (rarely) with 1 or 2 interrupted nylon sutures. A bandage will be applied and participants  
will receive the instruction sh eet regarding follow up procedures ( Appendix 1 ). If suture(s) are 
placed, patients will be asked to return in [ADDRESS_191471] the suture(s) removed. Biopsies 
will not be done o n face, neck, scalp, or over the tibia. One biopsy will be used for B. 
burgdorferi  culture and/or PCR. A second biopsy will be stored for future  study related  research .  
 
The study team will contact [CONTACT_6992] [ADDRESS_191472] -tick removal to determine if they are 
experiencing any AEs. The participants  will also be instructed to call the study staff if any new 
symptoms occur during the period when the ticks are attached and for 30 days after  tick removal . 
A 30 -day window was chosen for the following reasons: 1) Adverse reactions to tape or the tick 
bites are expected to resolve within 2 weeks after removal of the ticks; 2) in the very unlikely 
event that there is an as yet unidentified infection that is transmit ted by [CONTACT_165089], all of the known 

  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191473] will be reviewed at this visit.  
 
Participants will also be followed at 3 months (±2 weeks) after the mesh is removed. This visit 
may be in person or by [CONTACT_648]. Participants  will be questioned about any intercurrent illnesses. 
They wil l complete the symptom scales, the SF -36v2 questionnaire and fatigue scales.  Forms are 
self-administered and can be administered in paper form or computer , including online . If the 
visit is in person, approximately [ADDRESS_191474] treatment group will also be contact[CONTACT_6811] 12 
months (±4 weeks) after the start of their antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. This visit may be 
in person or by [CONTACT_648]. If the visit is in person, approximately 40 mL of blood will be drawn and 
a urine sample may be collected for storage for future  study related  research.  Self-reported 
symptoms will be characterized using symptom scales, the SF -36v2 que stionnaire and fatigue 
scales.  Forms are self -administered and can be administered in paper form or computer, 
including online.  
4.6 Early Discontinuation/Withdrawn from the Study  
If a participant decides to withdraw from the study, the investigator may ask the participant  who 
is withdrawing whether the participant  wishes to provide continued follow -up and further data 
collection subsequent to their withdrawal from the interventional portion of the study.  
Participants  that undergo tick placement and discontinue  study participation by [CONTACT_978]’s wishes 
will continue to come to visits for subject safety assessments  or may be asked to provide vital 
safety information over the phone . Attempts will be made to contact [CONTACT_165090].

 18 4.7 Repeat of Xenodiagnosis Procedure  
 
All repeats of the xenodiagnosis procedure are optional.  
 
Repeat of the xenodiagnosis procedure can be offered to participants in 3 situations:  
a. Participants  in whom the xenodiagnosis procedure failed to recover at least [ADDRESS_191475] engorged ticks are not recovered, 1 additional 
xenodiagnosis procedure (placement of ticks) will be offered. This does not require re -
enrollment.  Based on our experience with the phase [ADDRESS_191476] that this may occur in up 
to 50% of the placements. Xenodiagnostic procedure will not be offered to participants with 
acute erythema migrans, as they will have started antibiotic therapy at the tim e of the initial tick 
placement.  
 
For participants in whom the xenodiagnosis procedure is positive, re -enrollment will likely be  
required , due to the time necessary for results from the t esting of the xenodiagnostic  ticks to be 
finalized , as participants will likely have completed the follow up phase of the study . The study 
procedure s will be repeated as described above, including the skin biopsy (optional) and follow 
up visits.  
 
Participants who completed the study as Acute Erythema Migrans  or Lyme Arthritis  patients , and 
are eligible to participate as Patients with Lyme disease, post -therapy , will be enrolled as part of 
the new patient group and a new study number will be assigned. The study procedure s will be 
repeated as described above, including the skin biopsies  (optional) and all follow up visits.  
 
Therefore, the maximum number of xenodiagnosis procedures offered to a participant  for each 
group and situation, a nd the expected time period for the procedures are described in the Table 1 
below.

5 Healthy volunteers  Up to 2   No Up to 2  2 weeks  
* Repeat will not be offered , as patients will have received antibiotic therapy at this point  and 
results would not be comparable . 
 
The d ate of each  visit will be determined by [CONTACT_165091]. In case there is 
overlap of visits, visits may be combined. Participants  will be followed until completion of the 
protocol from the time of the last xenodiagnosis procedure. Lyme serologies will be repeated if 
performed more than 2 mon ths from the placement. Approximately 40 mL of blood will be 
drawn and a urine sample may be collected  for storage for future study related research  at the 
repeat Tick Placement visit if the repeat xenodiagnosis procedure is more than 21 days from the 
initial tick placement.   
 
Research bloods (approximately 40 mL of blood) will be drawn at the repeat tick removal visit  
for future study related research .  
 
• The tick placement site may be the same or a different site, depending o n individual 
preferences.  
• For participants  repeating because of less than [ADDRESS_191480] fed only on 
specific pathogen free laboratory animals that were purchased from  established vendors . Larval 
and nymphal ticks  will be maintained on CB17 SCID mice, which are highly susceptible to many 
infections since they are immunodeficient. Mice that serve as hosts to tick colony material are 
screened monthly by [CONTACT_165092] R for the main deer tick -transmitted agents.  
 
B. burgdorferi , Babesia microti,  and Anaplasma phagocytophilum  (human pathogens known to 
be transmitted by I. scapularis  ticks) are not transmitted transovarially (from mother to larvae). 
Deer tick virus, a fl avivirus closely related to Powassan virus, has been linked to rare cases of 
human encephalitis 54,55. Deer tick virus is inherited; however, its presence is readily detected in 
  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191481] (⅓)  of the larvae from each egg mass 
will be crushed and tested by [CONTACT_165093] B. 
burgdorferi , B. microti, A. phag ocytophilum, B. miyamotoi, Bartonella spp., deer tick virus and 
orbiviruses. In addition,  a representative number of larvae from each batch (not less than 25) will 
be tested at [CONTACT_165123]’s laboratory using a panel of broad -range primers targeting a wide 
range of genera including Spi[INVESTIGATOR_165054] (all Borrelia  species), Francisella , Bartonella , Anaplasma , 
Ehrlichia , Rickettsia  and Babesia . Any egg mass that tests positive for any of these organisms 
(but for the Rickettsia  endosymbiont of I. scapularis , see below) will be discarded.  Production of 
additional ticks will be halted until a root -cause analysis of the source of the positive samples has 
been performed and the data presented to the Medical Monitor (MM ) and the site PIs .  
 
Although our ticks are tested to be free of all known human pathogens, the ticks are not sterile 
and do carry commensal organisms. Almost all I. scapularis  ticks carry a rickettsial symbiont 
60,61. At this point, there is  no known disease associated with this symbiont. Anecdotally, batches 
of larvae have fed on one individual 3  separate times (as many as 40 at a time). The individual 
has remained seronegative for antibodies to spotted fever group and typhus group rickettsi ae, and 
has not experienced any illness associated with feeding larvae ([CONTACT_165128], personal 
communication). Screens of mice serving as hosts for larvae, in the past, have never 
demonstrated antibody to spotted fever group rickettsiae, suggesting that  the endosymbiont does 
not exit the tick by [CONTACT_50458]. We test the xenodiagnostic ticks for Rickettsia  sp. in order to have 
baseline information about their infection in case future issues arise.  
 
Recently, Tokarz et al. performe d high -throughput sequencing  to identify viral sequences in the 
I. scapularis  genome.62 In addition to deer tick virus described above, they identified sequences 
that partially aligned with viruses of the genus Nairovirus  (named South Bay virus ( SBV)  and 
the genus Phlebovirus  (named  blacklegged tick phlebovirus, BTPV) . For both, the assemble d 
sequences showed low similarity to other members of the genus. Moreover, they were unable to 
identify any sequences representative of potential M segments (the glycoprotein -coding 
segments ). Attempts at virus isolation by [CONTACT_165094] I. scapularis  SBV  PCR -positive pools in 
Vero, Cos7, C6/36, and [ADDRESS_191482] similarity (17%) 
observed with the Nyamanini and Midway viru ses.  
 
We have extended our testing panel to include additional assays for these potential viral entities 
that currently are known only from cognate nucleic acid sequences ( BTPV , SBV , and deer tick 
Mononegavirales ). We have screened 5 different samples of ticks (2 different lineages) that were 
used for the previous study from 2010 -2013 and found that 5/5 were  positive for cognate 
sequences matching SBV , 4 of 5 for BTPV , and 0/5 for deer tick mononegavirales . We conclu de 
that inasmuch as these batches of ticks were used for the Phase 1 safety trial even though they 
contained cognate sequences that matched putative viral sequences, like the rickettsial 
  Protocol Version  10

 21 endosymbiont of I. scapularis  (REIS, now known as Rickettsia buchneri )63, there is no evidence 
of ill health resulting from the feeding o f these ticks on study subjects. SCID mice have 
remained uniformly healthy after feeding ticks and we do not suspect any adventitious agent in 
our tick colonies that would compromise safety, regardless of the possibility of putative agents 
that have recently been or rem ain to be described. We will follow this general strategy as new 
agents that are not know n human pathogens are identified. If a new pathogen is identified or a 
previously non -pathogenic organism is identified as a pathogen, use of ticks in xenodiagnosis 
will be halted until we develop a test to identify the presence of that pathogen or its products.   
4.9 Testing of the Xenodiagnostic Ticks  
Recovered larval ticks will be tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi  by [CONTACT_954], culture, and/or 
direct immunofluorescence . Other techniques with high sensitivity and specificity to detect B. 
burgd orferi and/or other tick -borne pathogens may be used as they become available.   
4.[ADDRESS_191483] results. Skin biopsies will be 
offered before the placement of ticks (either during Initial Visit or Tick Placement Visit) and 
after tick removal in patients with acute EM, untreated Lyme arthritis and PTLDS, and only after 
tick removal for participants in the Lyme disease, post -therapy group and for healthy volunteers. 
The reason for offering before and after placement for  patients w ith acute EM, untreated Lyme 
arthritis and PTLDS is to be able to compare the results of the biopsy before and after and the 
result s from the xenodiagnostic ticks, as tick feeding may increase the chance of finding B. 
burgdorferi in the skin site. Study re sults have shown that spi[INVESTIGATOR_165055] [ADDRESS_191484].   
 
5 RISKS  
5.1 Xenodiagnosis  
Anticipated risks to the participants  include:  
1) The developme nt of allergic dermatitis from surgical tape used for sealing the mesh; or  
2) The development of a mild or moderately pruritic or painful local reaction to the tick bite, 
which does not require medical attention.   
 
From our experience with the [ADDRESS_191485] common AE was mild itching at the site, 
which was seen in 58% of participants , with a median duration of 3 days. Repeat of the 
xenodiagnosis procedure (performed in 7 participants ), was similarly well tolerated with mild 
itching at the site being the most common complai nt. There were no  SAE s associated with the 
procedure. All these AEs resolved and did not require any intervention.  No ticks escaped from 
the dressing.  
 
Problems which may also occur and be serious but are not anticipated (and are therefore 
reportable as U nanticipated Adverse Device Effects  [UADEs] ) include:  
 
A) the development of a skin infection (cellulitis) from scratching or skin breaks secondary to 1 
or 2 (above) or  
B) the remote possibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_165056]  
C) the remote possibility of in fection with a yet unknown pathogen  
D) the remote possibility of developi[INVESTIGATOR_165057] -limited with removal of the allergen (tape). Recovery may be 
aided by [CONTACT_165095][INVESTIGATOR_8826].  
 
A minority of patients who have been bitten frequently by [CONTACT_165096] a localized reaction with a granuloma. These reactions are self -
limited.  
 
Breaks in the skin caused by [CONTACT_165097]. Development of cellulitis secondary to allergic dermatitis or scratching 
is a very rare event, but could require either oral or intravenous antibiotic therapy.  
 
Although the ticks are tes ted for all known human diseases that  are transmitted by I. scapularis , 
the ticks are not sterile and do carry commensal organisms , and t here is a possibili ty that a new, 
unknown pathogen  may be carried by [CONTACT_165089]. If a new pathogen is identified or a pr eviously 
non-pathogenic organism is identified as a pathogen, use of ticks in xenodiagnosis will be halted 
until we develop a test to identify the presence of that pathogen or its products.  
 
Tick paralysis is a rare complication of tick bites. Patients pr esent with acute symmetric 
ascending flaccid paralysis that generally begins in the lower extremities. Paralysis can ascend to 
the upper extremities, followed by [CONTACT_165098][INVESTIGATOR_165058], if the tick is not removed. Occa sional patients may present with focal weakness or 
a cerebellar presentation. Removal of the tick is the definitive therapy, and patients will usually 
improve quickly after  removal ; however , symptoms can progress after tick removal (most 
commonly in Austra lian cases, associated with I. holocyclus ). Most cases in North America are 
associated with the bites of Dermacentor andersoni  (the wood tick) and D. variabilis  (the dog 
tick), occur in children under the age of 10, particularly girls (probably because lon g hair make 
difficult to notice the feeding tick), and the tick is attached to the head or neck. I. holocyclus  is 
the predominant species causing tick paralysis in Australia 65. I. scapularis  is not associated with 
this disease, although a case associated with I. scapularis  was reported in Mississippi 66. 
Assuming the tick identification was correct, it seems to be a highly unusual complication when 
  Protocol Version  10 
22 Mar 2021  
 
 23 compared with the v ery high number of deer tick bites that occur yearly.  A neurotoxin produced 
in the saliva of female ticks causes the paralysis. The I. holocyclus  toxin has been identified and 
is named holocyclotoxin. The transcriptome analysis of over 8000 expressed seque nce tags from 
6 different salivary gland cDNA libraries from I. scapularis  showed only a poor match with 
holocyclotoxin, suggesting the toxin is not found in I. scapularis 67. Therefore, it is highly 
unlikely that patients in this study will develop tick paralysis as a complication of tick placement, 
as I. scapularis  is not associated with this disease, ticks being used are in the larval stage (adult 
female ticks are usually the stage associated with tick paralysis), and patients in the study are 
adults.  
 
There has been an association between serious allergic reaction s to red meat (including delayed 
anaphylaxis) and tick bites in some susceptible individuals 68,69. It is caused by [CONTACT_165099] -α-1,3-galactose (alpha -gal). Individuals with red meat allergy often 
reported a more severe local reaction to tick bites, with significant itching and  redness around the 
bite. It is unknown if this allergy can develop after I. scapularis  bites. The association has been 
described in Australia with I. holocyclus  68. It has also been described in patients in the southern 
US 70. A study suggested that as many as 20% of the population in Virginia, North Carolina, and 
Tennessee states, region s where Amblyomma americanum  is common, have serum IgE 
antibodies to alpha -gal69. Individuals in the southeastern US (where Amblyomma  is more 
prevalent) are more likely to have antibodies against alpha -gal than individuals from [LOCATION_011] and 
Scandinavia 69. Patients with a history of severe reactions to tick bites are excluded from 
participation in the protocol, but it is possible that exposure to ticks may trigger a future allergic 
reaction in susceptible individuals. No reports of meat allergy were seen in the Phase I trial of 
Xenodiagnosis.  
 
Anaphylaxis following a tick bite has rarely been reported [ADDRESS_191486] acquisition of 
Lyme disease on Block Island, Rhode Island, showed that among 610 participants, 52% reported 
at least 1 tick bite (mean 2.2, 95% CI 2.0 –2.4), and 32% reported itch with any tick bite. N one 
reported anaphylaxis associated with tick bite. The probability of itch doubled as the number of 
reported tick bites increased from 1 to 2 (21%  to 46%, respectively) and doubled again from 2 to 
4 reported bites (46% to 97%, respectively; linear trend p  < 0.001).  There was an inverse 
relationship between tick itch reaction and development of Lyme disease. The likelihood of 
Lyme disease infection decreased with >3 reports of tick -associated itch (odds ratio 0.14, 95% CI 
0.94–0.03, p = 0.01). The possible mechanisms include a heightened awareness by a person of an 
attached tick with removal of the potentially infecting tick before pathogen transmission can 
occur, premature detachment of ticks before pathogen transmission can occur, or neutralization 
  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191487]’s yard or surrounding area, would not pose a 
threat to other humans, wildlife or add a new species into the environment. Ixodes  ticks are 
highly prevalent in rural and suburban [LOCATION_005], Rhode Island, Connecticut,  [LOCATION_001],  
Maryland, and Virginia.  
5.2 Blood Drawing  
The two hazards associated with blood drawing are those of venipuncture and those associated 
with blood loss. Risks of venipunc ture are pain at the site of the needle stick, the potential 
formation of hematoma at the site of the needle stick, and a small potential for infection and/or 
inflammation at the site of the needle stick. Occasionally, individuals may faint as a result of 
vasovagal reactions to the procedure. The major risk of repeated blood drawing is anemia. 
Current guidelines for maximum amount of blood drawn for research will be followed.  
5.[ADDRESS_191488] a low incidence of infection, bleeding, non-healing , or significant scarring 
78,60. Rarely, there may be injuries or damage  to the structures beneath the skin site (such as an 
artery or a nerve). Patients rarely may have local allergic reactions to the tape. Severe allergic 
reactions (anaphylaxis) to lidocaine are very rare.

asymptomatic individuals.  Self-reported symptoms will be characterized using sympto m scales,

measurement to assign symptomatic and asymptomatic status to the participants.79

 25 While the majority of the patients with Lyme disease who were treated with antibiotic therapy 
were negative by [CONTACT_165100] 1 study, the number of patients tested in each gro up 
was small and the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval of each proportion is relatively high 
(up to 46%). Also, an important caveat is that the number of tested xenodiagnostic ticks per 
participant in general was also small, and the number of engo rged ticks that are tested for each 
individual is an important variable, as the more engorged ticks tested, the larger the probability 
of detecting a positive. For example, if the true sensitivity for a single engorged tick to detect the 
bacteria is 1/10 ( based on results of the mice studies), then one would need to recover [ADDRESS_191490] 75% sensitivity and [ADDRESS_191491] 90% sensitivity.  
 
Based in our very preliminary data, the upper limit of the exact 95% confidence interval for the 
proportion of positive xenodiagnosis in symptomatic patients (10%) was 0.445. Table 2 shows 
the sample size needed for 80% power, with a Type I error rate  of 0.05, assuming varying 
assumptions for the true prevalence rates for asymptomatics (p 1) and symptomatics (p 2). For 
exam ple, with a total sample size of 86 individuals, there would be 80% power to detect a 
between -group difference in the positivity rate if the true prevalence is 5% or less in the non -
symptomatics and at least 30% in the symptomatics, assuming equal numbers between the 2 
groups, (43 non -symptomatics and 43 symptomatics).

Assuming a 10 to 20% rate of missing data due to failed screenings, assays or participant drop -
out, we plan to recruit up to [ADDRESS_191492]-Lyme disease syndromes  (PLDS ), acute EM, and untreated Lyme 
arthritis, the precision w ith which the rates can be estimated from the observed data depends on 
the true underlying response rate and the sample size. Exact Clopper -Pearson 2 -sided 95% CIs

positive individuals are shown in Table 3. Healthy volunteers (negative controls) results will be

Data will be collected for any positive tests by [CONTACT_165088]. Because there is no gold standard 
test among those we will employ, comparative positivity rates between the tests will be 
determined. Summaries of patient characteristics will be assessed by s tudy group. For categorical 
variables, the numbers and proportions will be tabulated; for continuous variables, the mean, 
median, SD, and interquartile range will be reported. Fisher’s exact text will be used to examine 
the association of 2  categorical var iables. For continuous variables, t -tests and nonparametric 
methods, such as the Wilcoxon or Spearman’s correlation coefficient, may be used to assess 
associations between subgroups of patients.  
 
AEs related to xenodiagnosis will be tabulated and summarie s with numbers and proportions will 
be given.  
7.[ADDRESS_191493], we included private practice physicians who 
were to enroll participants . In the absence of a study infrastructure at the priv ate practice sites, 
we found that enrollment from these sites was minimal. We are now changing our procedure so 
that the study coordinator will review the chief complaints of patients scheduled in clinic and be 
responsible for alerting the physician and th en making informational calls to the patient. Patients 
who agree to enroll will be scheduled in groups and the study coordinator will travel to the 
physician’s office to assist the physician with entry and enrollment.  
 
An anticipated problem is the possibility of re -infection with B. burgdorferi  after antibiotic 
therapy. Because these participants  live in endemic areas with repeated exposures to ticks, it is 
possible that they may become re -infected through a new tick bi te after the antibiotic treatment. 
Re-infection is a relatively uncommon event, especially in the first year after the original 
infection.  Our questionnaire will specifically ask participants  about occurrence of EM lesions or 
other signs of Lyme disease in  the interval between antibiotic therapy and evaluation for 
enrollment in the study . It is also worth noting that, even in the unlikely event a reinfection 
occurs for one of our study participants , a positive xenodiagnostic test in this group would be an 
important finding as these would be missed by [CONTACT_165101].

8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
8.1 Documenting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events  
This trial is being conducted in compliance with 21 CFR 812 [FDA/IDE] regulations. Safety 
Reporting for this study includes additional events definitions and requirements set forth by [CONTACT_11707].  
 
At each contact [CONTACT_1155], information regarding adverse events will be elicited by 
[CONTACT_4524]:  
• immediately documented in the subject’s medical record/so urce document,  
• recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form (AE CRF), and  
reported as outlined below (e.g., Sponsor, IRB, FDA).  
8.2 Definitions  
 
The NIAID Clinical Safety Office (CSO) is responsible for sponsor safety oversight of this 
study, and the definit ions below comply with CSO requirements.  
 
ADVERSE EVENT (AE)  - An adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical 
occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation 
in the research, whether or not considered related to the research.  
 
ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT (ADE):  A subset of AEs, as defined above, that are specifically 
related to the use of an investigatio nal medical device.  
 
SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  - an AE resulting in any of the following  outcomes:  
• death  
• is life threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life)  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• congenital anomaly /birth defect  
• is Medically Important*  
 
* Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised when  deciding whether expedited 
reporting is ap propriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not  be 
  Protocol Version  10 
22 Mar 2021  
 
 28 immediately life threatening or result in death or result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_165059]. These 
should also usually be considered serious.  
 
UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENT  - any AE (including SAEs and ADEs, as defined in this 
protocol) , that occurs at a level of specificity or severity that is not consistent with the protocol.  
Expected means that  the event has previously been observed with  the study procedure and is 
identified and/or described in the protocol.  
 
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
An Unanticipated Problem is any event, incident, experience, or outcome that : 
 
1.  is unexpected in ter ms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to : 
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents; and  
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and  
2. possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and  
3. places participants  or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or  recognized. (Per the I DE Sponsor, 
an AE with a serious outcome will be considered increased risk.)  
 
Serious Unanticipated Problem (UP):  A UP that meets the definition of a Serious Adverse 
Event or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or o thers.  
  
Unanticipated problem that is not an Adverse Event (UPnonAE ): An unanticipated problem 
that does not fit the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], involve risk to the subject, affect others in the resea rch study, or significantly 
impact the integrity of research data. These events may involve a greater risk of social or 
economic harm to subjects or others rather than physical/psychological harm. Such events would 
be considered a non -serious UP. Examples of a UPnonAE include a breach of confidentiality, 
accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted -for study drug.  
 
UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT (UADE)  – “Any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death  caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other u nanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.”  (21 CFR 812.3)  In summary, UADEs are serious, 
unanticipated , and related (possibly, probably or definitely) to the device.  
 
Anticipated AEs related to the study device (xenodiagnosis) include the following:  
• allergic dermatitis from surgical tape,  
• mild or moderate pruritic local reactions and mild or moderate painful local reactions to 
the tick bite that do not require medical intervention.  
 
All AEs and ADE s that are identified from the time the xenodiagnostic ticks are placed through 
  Protocol Version  [ADDRESS_191495] use of the device (ticks) will be documented in the subject’s medical record 
and will be recorded in the study database.  
 
NOTE:  AEs and ADE s of any severity could be considered serious (e.g. , medically important) 
based on the medical judgment of the investigator. For example, cellulitis of any severity grade 
should be considered serious.  
 
Protocol Deviation : Any change, divergence, or depa rture from the IRB -approved research 
protocol.  
1. Major Deviation – Deviation from the IRB -approved protocol that have, or may have the 
potential to, negatively impact, the rights, welfare or safety of the subject, or to 
substantially negatively impact the s cientific integrity or validity of the study.  
2. Minor Deviation – A Deviation that does not have the potential to negatively impact the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects or others, or the scientific integrity or validity of the 
study.  
 
Non-compliance: Failure of an investigator to follow the applicable laws, regulations, or 
institutional policies governing the protection of human subjects in research, or the requirements 
or determinations of the IRB, whether the failure is intentional or not.  
• Continuing Non-compliance – A pattern of recurring non -compliance that either has 
resulted, or, if continued, may result in harm to subjects or otherwise materially 
compromise the rights, welfare and/or safety of subjects, affect the scientific integrity of 
the study  or validity of the results. The pattern may comprise repetition of the same non -
compliant action(s), or different non -compliant events. Such non -compliance may be 
unintentional (e.g. due to lack of understanding, knowledge, or commitment), or 
intentional (e.g. due to deliberate choice to ignore or compromise the requirements of any 
applicable regulation, organizational policy, or determination of the IRB).  
• Serious Non -compliance – Non-compliance, whether intentional or not, that results in 
harm or otherwis e materially compromises the rights, welfare and/or safety of the subject. 
Non-compliance that materially affects the scientific integrity or validity of the research 
may be considered serious non -compliance, even if it does not result in direct harm to 
research subjects.

All clinical AEs that are not listed in the toxicity scale will be assessed for severity and classified 
into one the categories below:  
 
• Grade 1 (Mild) : Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social & 
functional activities or represent mild increase over baseline  
• Grade 2 (Moderate) : Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual 
social & functional activities or represent moderate increase over baseline   
• Grade 3 (Severe) : Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social & functional 
activities or represent severe increase over baseline.  
• Grade 4 (Life threatening) : Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self -care 
functions OR Medical or operative int ervention indicated to prevent permanent 
impairment, persistent disability, or death  
• Grade 5 (Death)  
 
8.3.2 Causality  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_165102]. A causal relationship (possible, probab le, or definite) means that a research procedure or 
the study device caused or is reasonably likely to have caused the AE.  
 
The best estimate of the causal relationship between the study device  and an AE will be made 
by [CONTACT_165103] g causality categories:  
 
Definitely Related  
• reasonable temporal relationship  
• follows a known response pattern  
• clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship  
• there is no alternative etiology  
 
Probably Related   
• reasonable temporal relationship  
• follows a suspected response pattern for the procedure or the device  
• no evidence of a more likely alternative etiology  
 
Possibly Related  
• reasonable temporal relationship  
• little evidence for a more likely alternative etiology  
 
Unlikely Related   
• does not ha ve a reasonable temporal relationship OR  
• good evidence for a more likely alternative etiology

to the known complications associated with the study procedure (xenodiagnosis) a nd the 
presence of concurrent medications or concurrent illnesses.  Upon determination of any Grade 4 
AE or any 2 Grade 3 AEs (in different participants ) thought to be definitely, probably, or 
possibly related to the study procedure, the study will be halted (no new enrollments and no 
further use of the study procedure by [CONTACT_473]) and a UADE report will be submitted to 
the local IRB and to the OCRPRO  Safety Office.  Approval by [CONTACT_165104].  
 
The IRBs, the NIAID, the FDA, or other government agencies, as part of their duties to ensure 
that research participants  are protected  may discontinue the stud y at any time. Subsequent review 
of UADEs  by [CONTACT_1201], the Sponsor, the FDA, and other regulatory authorities may also result in 
suspension of further trial interventions/administration of the study procedure at a site. The FDA, 
other regulatory authorities , and the Sponsor retain the authority to suspend additional 
enrollment and Study Agent/Intervention administration for the entire study as applicable.   
 
9 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 
The P I will monitor protocol data (through regular communication with  the study teams at the 
other sites) that could affect subject safety or confidentiality by [CONTACT_165105] -arranged 
intervals with the Site PIs. Information to be shared includes AEs, documentation of subject 
evaluation, treatment and disposition, an d coding of subject samples and data. Serious and other 
AEs will be reported to the site’s IRB and the CSO  as outlined above.   
 
  Protocol Version  10 
22 Mar 2021  
 
 33 9.1.1 Safety Review and Communications Plan  
A Safety Review and Communications Plan (SRCP) has been developed for the protocol. The 
SRCP is an internal communications document between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_40663], which delineates 
the safety oversight responsibilities of the PI, the CSO, and other stakeholders. The SRCP also 
includes the overall plan for conducting periodic safety surveillance ass essments.  
 
9.1.2  Sponsor Medical Monitor  
A SMM, representing the Sponsor (OCRPRO), has been appointed for oversight of safety in this 
clinical study. The SMM will be responsible for performing safety assessments as outlined in an 
SRCP.  
 
A monthly (or other specified frequency) conference call with the SMM, the PI, and members of 
the study teams from all sites will review all AE safety data (Grade 1 or higher)  as specified in 
the SRCP . A safety report will be prepared for distribution to t he safety team, and will include 
data elements specified in the SRCP.  
 
10 REPORTING PROCEDURES  
10.1 Investigator Reporting Responsibilities to the IRB  
Each site will report A Es to their local IRB according to their IRB’s policy.  
10.1.1  Reporting Procedures at the NIH

[ADDRESS_191506] access to the 
research records, unless required by [CONTACT_2371]. The investigator (and/or designee) will make study 
documents (including source medical records) readily available for ins pection by [CONTACT_1036], 
the FDA, the site monitors, and the Sponsor for confirmation of the study data.  
 
13 INTENDED USE OF THE SAMPLES/SPECIMENS/DATA  
 
Blood , urine, and skin samples  collected under this study may be used to test for known and yet 
unknown pathogens, immunological and inflammatory markers, and host reactivity to tick 
salivary protein. Patients may choose not to have their specimens  stored or used for research on 
unrela ted diseases and conditions.  
 
Samples and data collected under this protocol will be used to study Lyme disease and related 
disorders.  No human  genetic testing will be done on these samples .  
 
How samples/specimen/data will be stored  
Access to research sa mples will be limited using either a locked room or a locked freezer. 
Samples and data will be stored using codes assigned by [CONTACT_165106](s). 
Data will be kept in password -protected computers.  The key linking the study code to ident ifiers 
will be maintained at each site  and will only be accessible to investigators or designees at that 
site.  
 
How samples/specimen/data will be tracked  
Samples will be tracked using Excel or BSI databases. Samples may also be stored and tracked 
utilizin g the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) repository operated 
by [CONTACT_10069], Inc.   
 
What will happen to the samples/specimen/data at the completion of the protocol?  
In the future, other investigators (both at NIH and outside) may wish to use these samples and/or 
data for research purposes. If the planned research falls within the category of “human subjects 
research” on the part of the NIH researchers, NIH IRB review and approval will be obtained. 
  Protocol Version  10 
22 Mar 2021  
 
 35 This includes the NIH researchers sending out coded and linked samples or data and getting 
results that they can link back to their subjects. .  
 
What circumstances would prompt the PI [INVESTIGATOR_165060]/specimen/data?  
Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples or data (for example, due to freezer 
malfunction) that meets the definition of a reportable event  will be reported to the NIH IRB 
according to NIH HRPP Policy 801 . 
 
Any loss or unan ticipated destruction of more than 30% of samples or data that compromises the 
scientific integrity of the study will be reported to the IRB.  
 
14 DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Study data will be collected at the study site(s) and maintained on standardized electronic or 
paper case report forms (CRFs), or an electronic data system. Research data may also be kept 
using Excel (with appropriate controls to protect data integrity and subject confidentiality) as 
well as multiple programs for statistical analysis.  
 
These form s or systems are to be completed on an ongoing basis during the study.  The CRFs and 
instructions will be distributed to the site(s) by [CONTACT_165107]. Data entries on paper CRFs must be completed legibly with black 
ballpoint pen.  Corrections must be made by [CONTACT_1022] a single line 
(taking care not to obliterate or render the original entry illegible) and entering the correct 
information adjacent to the inco rrect entry.  Corrections to paper CRFs must be initialed and 
dated by [CONTACT_36324].  Data entered into electronic CRFs or data systems 
shall be performed by [CONTACT_4539].  Corrections to electronic CRFs or data systems 
shall be tracked electronically (password protected) with time, date, individual making the 
correction, and what was changed.   
 
The Investigator is responsible for assuring that the data collected is complete, accurate, and 
recorded in a timely manner.  Source docum entation (the point of initial recording of information) 
should support the data collected on the CRF, and must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_165108]/or reviewing the data. All CRFs should be reviewed by [CONTACT_165109], as appropriate. Source documents include all 
recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities, and all reports and records necessary 
for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical trial.  Source docum ents include, but are not 
limited to, the subject’s medical records, laboratory reports, ECG tracings, x -rays, radiologist’s 
reports, subject’s diaries, biopsy reports, ultrasound photographs, progress notes, pharmacy 
records, and any other similar reports  or records of procedures performed during the subject’s 
participation in the study. Data from CRFs , CRIMSON  Data System , or other electronic database  
will be collected directly from participants  during study visits and telephone calls, or will be 
abstract ed from participants ’ diaries and medical records.  The subject’s medical record must 
record his/her participation in the clinical trial and, what medications (with doses and frequency) 
or other medical interventions or treatments were administered, as well  as any adverse reactions 
experienced during the trial.  
 
  Protocol Version  10 
22 Mar 2021  
 
 36 Study results: Each subject will receive a letter at the completion of the study to discuss the 
findings of the study. The letter will be prepared and submitted to the IRB for approval before 
distri bution.  
 
[ADDRESS_191507] RECRUITMENT  
 
Lyme disease affects persons in all age groups, with peaks occurring for children aged 5 -9 years 
and adults 55 -59 years. Males and females are nearly equally affected in all age groups. The 
racial breakdown of persons with Lym e disease, according to the national surveillance data from 
1992 to 2006 [54], shows a preponderance of white (94.1%). This reflects the demographic 
profile of the population at risk, both by [CONTACT_165110]. Current 
scienti fic evidence does not indicate that the natural history of Lyme disease differs based on 
gender or racial minority status. All efforts will be made to recruit patients whose gender or 
minority represents the general population. Only adult participants  will be recruited for this 
study . Patients may self -refer or be referred by a physician to the protocol. At this point, no 
advertisement is planned,  but may be used in the future. If that is the case, it will be submitted to 
each site’s IRB for approval.  
 
Participants will be recruited at 5 study sites, 3 of which (NIH, Tufts and Mansfield) participated 
in the Phase 1 xenodiagnostic study. The current study sites  include the NIH Clinical Center, 
Tufts Medical Center, Mansfield Family Practice, Stony Brook Unive rsity (State Universi ty of 
[LOCATION_001]), and NYMC .  
 
The NIAID Lyme disease program at the NIH Clinical Center has evaluated more than [ADDRESS_191508]. Marcos  is an infectious diseases physician at Stony Brook Univers ity De partment of 
Medicine. He is the current director for the outpatient clinic for tick borne diseases overseeing 
more than 400 patients with any tick borne disease in Suffolk County.

 37 16 CONSENT PROCEDURES  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continuing throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of 
risks and possible benefits of this therapy  will be provided to the participants  and their families. 
Consent forms describing in detail the study interventions/products, study procedures, and risks 
are given to the subject and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to 
starting intervention/administering study product. Consent forms will be IRB -approved and the 
subject will be given the opportunity  to read and review the document. Upon reviewing the 
document, the investigator or designee will explain the research study to the subject and answer 
any questions that may arise. The participants  will sign the informed consent document prior to 
any procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants  should have the 
opportunity to discuss the study with their surrog ates or think about it prior to agreeing to 
participate. The participants  may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. 
A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants  for their records.  
 
Consent for NIH st aff will be obtained as detailed above with following additional protections:  
Consent from staff members will be obtained by [CONTACT_165111]’s 
team whenever possible.  Otherwise, the consent procedure will be independently mon itored by 
[CONTACT_165112].  
 
17 STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
The investigator is responsible for retaining all essential documents listed in the ICH GCP  
Guideli ne. All essential documentation for all study participants  is to be maintained by [CONTACT_164509] a secure storage facility f or a minimum of 3  years . The FDA requires study 
records to be retained for up to 2 years after marketing approval or disapprov al (21 CFR 
812.140), or until at least [ADDRESS_191509] elapsed since the formal discontinuation (terminated or 
completed) of clinical development of the investigational agent for a specific indication.  These 
records are also to be maintained in compliance wit h IRB/EC, state, and federal medical records 
retention requirements, whichever is longest. All stored records are to be kept confidential to the 
extent provided by [CONTACT_1032], state, and local law. It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] s ource documents until receipt of written notification to the contrary from the 
OCRPRO  of the NIAID. No study document should be destroyed without prior written 
agreement between OCRPRO /NIAID and the PIs. Should the investigator wish to assign the 
study records to another party and/or move them to another location, the investigator must 
provide written notification of such intent to OCRPRO /NIAID with the name [CONTACT_165121] t responsibility for the transferred records and/or their new location. NIAID must be 
notified in writing and written NIAID permission must be received by [CONTACT_165113].  
 
18 PROTOCOL MONITORING  
 
As per ICH -GCP  5.18 and FDA 21 CFR 812.43(d) clinical protocols are required to be 
adequately monitored by [CONTACT_12925]. This study monitoring will be conducted according 
  Protocol Version  10 
22 Mar 2021  
 
 38 to the “NIAID Intramural Clinical Monitoring Guidelines.” Monitors under contract to the 
NIAID /OCRPRO  will visit the clinical research sites to monitor all aspects of the study in 
accordance with the appropriate regulations and the approved protocol. The objectives of a 
monitoring visit will be: 1) to verify the existence of signed informed consent  documents for 
each monitored subject; 2) to verify the prompt and accurate recording of all monitored data 
points and prompt reporting of all SAEs; 3) to compare abstracted information with individual 
participants ’ records and source documents ( participan ts’ charts, laboratory analyses and test 
results, physicians’ progress notes, nurses’ notes, and any other relevant original subject 
information); and 4) to ensure protection of study participants , investigators’ compliance with 
the protocol, and completen ess and accuracy of study records. The monitors also will inspect the 
clinical site regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements (Office for Human Research 
Protections [OHRP] as applicable) and applicable guidelines (ICH -GCP and FDA 21 CFR 812) 
are being followed. During the monitoring visits, the investigator (and/or designee) and other 
study personnel will be available to discuss the study progress and monitoring visit.  
 
The investigator (and/or designee) will make study documents (e.g., consen t forms, and pertinent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893] ) readily available for inspection by [CONTACT_1036], the site monitors, 
and the NIAID staff for confirmation of the study data.  
 
A specific protocol monitoring plan will be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_165061]. The plan will outline the frequency of monitoring visits based on such factors as 
study enrollment, data collection status and regulatory obligations.  
 
[ADDRESS_191510] access to research records to refuse to 
disclose identifying information on research participation in any civil, criminal, administrative, 
legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level. By [CONTACT_165114] m being compelled to disclose information that would identify 
research participants, Certificates of Confidentiality help achieve the research objectives and 
promote participation in studies by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_21783].

1. Keep the area dry and the dressing on for the first 24 hours.  
 
2. Thereafter, remove the dressing prior to showering.  
 
3. If adhesive steri -strips (which look like small pi[INVESTIGATOR_165070]) were used to close the 
incision, do not remove them. They will gradually fall off on their own.  
 
4. If sutures were placed, r eapply  Vaseline and a Band -Aid daily  as needed . You will return 
4 to 7  days following the procedure for removal of the sutures.  
 
5. If you experience discomfort at the biopsy site, you can take acetaminophen (brand name: 
[CONTACT_165122]), two 325  mg tablets every 4 to 6 hours as needed (do not take more than 12 
tablets in 24 hours) or ibuprofen (brand names: Advil, Motrin), one to two 200  mg tablets 
4 to 6 hours as needed (do not exceed 6 tablets in 24 hours).

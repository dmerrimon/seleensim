Main Eligibility 
Criteria  • Clinical lvPPA or imaging -supported lvPPA  
• Age 45 years  and older   
• Structu ral brain MRI  done within  the 3 years prior to enrollment.  
Study Rationale  The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is a  
neurodegenerative disorder often referred to as the ‘language form’ 
of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).  The current conceptual disease 
framework assumes a relatively widespread neurodegeneration 
which causes patients to continue to use pre- existing, specific neural 
areas with declining efficiency . 
tDCS  is a non-invasive, painless brain stimulation technique that 
appears to  enhance language production when delivered during 
language training.  To date, studies  utilizing tDCS in lvPPA patients  
have been limited to conventional montages that are not suitable for 
focal  targeting of brain tissue. High-Definition  tDCS (HD- tDCS) is a 
recent ly developed system that allows for more focal stimulation 
based on increased c urrent focality and intensity, and the 
individual ized modelling of the patient’s brain tissue.  
Considering this, use of HD -tDCS to ta rget the most consistent 
neural correlate of lvPPA (the left posterior temporo- parietal cortex ) 
should be explored .  
Primary Objectives  Determine the efficacy of HD -tDCS for the improvement of  
language performance in lvPPA .  
Secondary Objectives  (ii) evaluate the effects of HD -tDCS on functional connectivity using 
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and (iii) elucidate 
its effects on spontaneous neuronal oscillatory patterns using 
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) .  
Endpoints  • Primary outcome meas urement s: Language performance  
changes  as assessed at baseline and after  tDCS  stimulation 
procedures (time frame: 2 weeks).  
• Secondary outcome measurements: (ii) Changes in brain 
functional connectivity as assessed  at baseline and after tDCS 
stimulation (time frame: 2 weeks)  (iii) Changes in abnormal 
patterns of neuronal frequencies and synchronizations as

PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    5 
 1. STUDY  OBJECTIVES 
The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is an untreatable neurodegenerative disorder that 
is often referred to as the ‘language form’ of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).  Transcranial  Direct Current Stimulation 
(tDCS) has emerged as a safe and potentially effective tool that appears to enhance language production when delivered during language training (Tippet et al., 2015). This technology provides a critical opportunity to  conduct 
disease intervention. In this study, we will test our hypothesis that High -Definition tDCS (HD -tDCS) will 
improve performance on language tasks by [CONTACT_632995]. T he rationale for this project is that a determination of the therapeutic 
efficacy and the associated neural mechanis ms of HD -tDCS in lvPPA is likely to offer a scientific framework 
whereby [CONTACT_632996], conditions, and target sites can be deciphered.   
 
1.1. Justification of Selecting lvPPA  Subjects for HD- tDCS Treatment   
The sparse number of studies done so far presuppose a conceptual framework predicated on the idea that because of relatively widespread neurodegeneration, these patients do not remap language functions to novel 
networks, but that instead they continue to use pre -existing neural areas with declining efficiency (Rogalski et 
al., 2011). This stands in contrast to the working models for post -stroke aphasia recovery where the assumption 
is that patients will engage in the recruitment of unaffected brain areas as  an important compensatory mechanism 
(Abel et al., 2015). The aforementioned ‘neurodegeneration’ model would suggest that in the case of lvPPA an 
appropriate neuromodulation approach would lead to the tailored and narrow stimulation of disease- specific 
affected brain regions. Notwithstanding the biological plausibility of this model, all the published studies on lvPPA 
and other PPA subtypes have used conventional tDCS montages, a method incapable of focally targeting specific brain regions. High- Definiton t DCS (HD- tDCS) on the other hand, is a recently developed system that 
allows for more focal stimulation based on increased current focality and intensity (Villamar et al., 2013). What 
remains lacking is knowledge of the therapeutic efficacy and neural mechanisms of HD- tDCS when used in 
lvPPA. There is, therefore, a critical need  to evaluate the effects on language performance and the underlying 
neural mechanisms of active HD -tDCS aimed at the left posterior temporo- parietal cortex (TPC), the most 
consistent neural correlate of this condition (Gorno- Tempi[INVESTIGATOR_49954]., 2011). Without such information the promise 
of disease -specific and personalized tDCS procedures for the treatment of this neurodegenerative aphasia will 
likely remain limited.  
 1.2. Objectives   
To determine whether active HD- tDCS targeting the dominant posterior TPC can improve language performance , 
increase language network  functional connectivity, and improve abnormal patterns of resting state neuronal 
frequencies and synchronizations .   
 Specific Aim 1.  Determine changes in language performance after 10 HD-tDCS stimulation sessions  (QD)  
lasting [ADDRESS_845135] our proposed hypothesis:  
 
• Primary outcome measures:  Language performance as assessed at baseline and post -stimulation 
procedure (time  frame:  2 weeks)  
• Secondary outcome measures:  Language network  resting state changes after stimulation procedure 
(time  frame:  2 weeks)  
• Tertiary outcome measures: Resting -state neuronal frequencies and synchronizations  changes  after 
stimulation procedure (time frame:  2 weeks)  
PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    [ADDRESS_845136] prominent cognitive impairment 
in approximately 27% of patients with early onset Alzheimer’s Disease  (Mendez et al., 2012) .  If this mechanistic 
approach is successful, we will lay a conceptual framework for the future develop ment of  optimal 
neuromodulation avenues for the rehabilitation of multiple neurodegenerative aphasias and other related 
conditions . We hope the technique will effectively  enhance l anguage production for this population.  
 
2. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
2.1. Background  
lvPPA is a neurodegenerative condition with no known effective treatment despi[INVESTIGATOR_632966]. The disorder is typi[INVESTIGATOR_632967], word and sentence repetition deficits, and overall, by a type 
of language impairment that leads to a disturbance of the phonemic buffer for words (Meyer et al., 
2015).   Alzheimer’s disease is the most common underlying neuropathology, and in accordance with the role of 
the posterior perisylvian region in phonological processing (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_632968]., 2014), focal degeneration of the 
dominant posterior TPC is the most frequently identified pattern of brain involvement (Gorno -Tempi[INVESTIGATOR_49954].,  
2008).   
 
With the advent of tDCS as a promising therapeutic and rehabilitation tool in both post -stroke and 
neurodegenerative aphasias, it seems likely that these conditions will differ in their optimal neuromodulation 
approach as a direct result of their distinct underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms: Stimulation of spared 
perilesional and contralateral areas in the former, and of disease- specific and growingly inefficient brain regions 
in the latter. Our overall scientific premise  is strongly supported by [CONTACT_632997], with stroke -
related studies showing major neuroanatomical reorganization after the initial injury (Dancause et al., 2005; Abel 
et al., 2015), and PPA studies revealing early reductions in language- specific effective connectivit y and  relatively 
rapid neurodegenerative changes, two findings consistent with the absence of any major reorganizational 
changes of brain functional networks (Sonty et al., 2007; Rogalski et al., 2011). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_632969], all published studies of tDCS in PPA have relied on the broad stimulation of left 
hemispheric structures using conventional montages, and none of them have sought to use HD -tDCS to focus 
the stimulation on the more discretely affected brain areas tha t typi[INVESTIGATOR_632970]. (i.e. left TPC in 
lvPPA, the left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG) in the non- fluent/agrammatic variant, and the left temporal pole in the 
semantic variant). Correspondingly, an additional element of our overall scientific premise  is the fact that HD -
tDCS as a technique, can increase current focality and intensity (Datta et al., 2009; Muthalib., 2017). This focality 
is robust to tissue (modeling) parameters (Datta et al., 2012) , and clinical neurophysiological studies have 
confirmed the focal current delivery (Edwards et al.,  2013). E ven though no published literature exists on the use 
of HD -tDCS in the PPA population, its feasibility, tolerability, and its non- inferiority to tDCS have been 
documented in patients with chronic post stroke aphasia (Richar dson et al., 2015). HD -tDCS has  also been 
shown to produce longer lasting after -effects when compared to conventional tDCS (Kuo et al., 2013), and others 
have already speculated about its potenti al role in the rehabilitation of neurocognitive impairments resulting from 
localized brain injury (Hogeveen et al., 2016).   
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_632971], knowledge of its mechanism of action and a demonstration of its 
therapeutic effectiv eness in this population are still critically needed. In the absence of such knowledge, 
realization of the therapeutic potential of this cutting- edge technique will likely remain difficult, not only in the 
case of PPA, but also for the treatment and rehabi litation of other related neurodegenerative conditions.  
 
2.2. Significance  
If this mechanistic study succeeds, we will be able to 1)  provide conceptual proof that language performance 
can be improved by [CONTACT_632998].  2) 
determine whether stimulation intervention reaches specific neural network targets and assess the network level 
responses; 3) predict if the network activity modulation can concurrently improve language performance;  and 4) 
provide essential information needed to prepar e future pi[INVESTIGATOR_632972] .

3. RATIONALE  
3.1 Scientific Premise  
Aim #1. Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of HD -tDCS.  Anodal (positive) tDCS appears to increase both the 
amount and the speed of learning by [CONTACT_632999] -term potentiation (Fritsch., 2010). From a 
behavioral perspective, these changes in synaptic activity seem to outlast the initial period o f stimulation only 
when the stimulation is delivered ‘online’ during  a behavioral training task (Monti et al., 2008; Baker et al., 2010; 
Marangolo et al., 2013), and when compared to the ‘offline’ method, only ‘online’ tDCS was capable of reducing 
vocal r esponse times in a study of elderly adults (Fertonani., 2014). These findings are in support of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_632973] : that ‘online’ HD -tDCS is preferable in elderly persons with aphasia.  
Only a small number of  tDCS studies exist in t he the PPA population; some excluded the lvPPA subpopulation 
altogether (Cotelli et al., 2014; Teichmann et  al., 2016) and another  included lvPPA patients, but with what we 
believe are relative weaknesses in its design: The use of a conventional tDCS montage without individualized 
modelling of current delivery, the use of a ‘locked’ target site without consideration of the specific PPA variant at 
hand, and a relatively short 2 -month “wash out” period as evidenced by [CONTACT_633000] 2- month follow up (Tsapkini et al., 2014). An additional small number of studies that included lvPPA patients 
have been published, all of them relying on the use of conventional tDCS, a single stimulation target for all PPA 
subtypes, or the absence of a sham condition for comparison (e.g. McConathey et al., 2017; Hung et al., 2017). 
Based on the support from the discussed studies our scientific premise  is that  tDCS when combined with 
language training interventions can improve language performance in PPA. Neverthessless, what remains 
unknown are the effects of using ‘online’ HD -tDCS when tailored to each PPA variant and guided by [CONTACT_633001].  
 
Aim # 2. Identify the effects of HD -tDCS on language network functional connectivity. We hy pothesize that 
tDCS is able to modulate abnormal neuronal processing in patients with aphasia as measured by [CONTACT_40394]. This 
premise is supported by a recent study of post -stroke aphasia in which patients named pi[INVESTIGATOR_632974]. In this experiment anodal tDCS selectively enhanced the activity in a larger language- related network, but not in other 
task-related components (Darkow et al., 2017 ). Of note, the authors themselves mentioned that the use of 
conventional tDCS (and not HD -tDCS) made it impossible to dissect the exact source of the neural modulation.  
In the specific case of PPA, all PPA syndromes are associated with distinctive functional neuroanatomical profiles 
of abnormal language processing relative to healthy older individuals (Hardy et al., 2017). The syndromic 
signatures found in this particular study were in accord with prior predictions and as  expected, the logopenic 
variant was characterized by [CONTACT_633002] -scan behavioral testing. What remains lacking is knowledge of the effects of tDCS in 
general, and HD- tDCS in particular, on measures of brain functional connectivity in the PPA population.   
 
Aim # 3. Determine the effects of HD -tDCS on spontaneous neuronal oscillatory pattterns. tDCS can 
reshape brain networks and increase global connectivity in healthy adults as measured by [CONTACT_548621] (e.g. Garcia-Cossio et al., 2016). In the case of PPA a recent MEG study demonstrated a distinct spatiotemporal pattern of 
altered functional connectivity that was unique to each individual variant (Ranasinghe et al., 2017). Wha t remains 
to be elucidated is the effect that HD -tDCS has on these neurophysiological signatures of network -specific 
neuronal dysfunction.

patients will range in age from 45–85 years .  Recruitment efforts will be conducted exclusively in the MCW 
Neurology  and Geropsychiatry  clinic s initially but  may be expanded to in clude the greater metropolitan 
Milwaukee , WI area if needed.  The Medical College of Wisconsin ( MCW ) Dementia Research Team  has 
extensive experience recruiting patients from the clinic and the Milwaukee community, using flyers , press 
releases, and community presentations.    
 
5. STUDY VISIT S AND PROCEDURES  
5.1. Schedule of V isits 
A screening (Visit -1) session will be  conducted . This could take place  after a routine clinic visit , or by [CONTACT_648] , 
to perform the Informed C onsent (I FC) discussion,  review inclusion criteria, collect demographics and basic 
medical history, and begin MRI safety screening.  The Language Battery will also be completed as part of the 
screening visit.  Additionally  (in the case  of those meeting criteria) , patients might visit the Tosa Health  Center  or 
Medical College of Wisconsin for stimulation planning.  This would entail  the use of a Transcranial Magnetic 
Stimulation (TMS) neuronavigation system . The Language battery and TMS can occur on two separate days 
prior to the first treatment visit  of Treatment Period 1.  Subjects will also  be invited to baseline  (Visit 1). At 
baseline, the study team will  complete fMRI and MEG scans and randomize participants to a treatment group.  
Procedures within Visit -[ADDRESS_845142] treatment visit of Treatment Period 1.  At Visit 1 , subjects will receive tDCS while 
simultaneously completing the  reading and repetition “trained  tasks . Subjects will then return for 9 additional 
treatment sessions (Visits 2 -10) where they will receive stimulation or sham, along with trained task 
administration . At Visit [ADDRESS_845143] assessment session (Visit 1 1), in which  the Language 
battery, including the trained tasks will be repeat ed.  Subjects will then return 8 weeks later to begin the second

about potential adverse events  (AE) and remind subjects about their 8- week assessment visit and first Tx Period 
[ADDRESS_845146] will also be maintained during the 8- week  period between the end of Tx period 2 and 
the final assessment . Subjects will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] 4 and 8 weeks  after Tx period 2. During these calls the study 
coordinator will inquire about potential AE and remind subjects about thei r 8-week final assessment. The study 
staff will follow the data and safety monitoring plan described below  to monitor AEs .  
 
Subjects will be compensated for participation in the study. We will pay no stipend for the screen visit, $30 for 
visits 1, 10, 12, and 21, $7 for visits 2 -9 and 13 -20, and $17 for visits 11 and 22. The total stipend if all visits are 
completed is $266.  
 Subjects  may be reimbursed for any reasonable travel  expenses  as needed to attend study visits.  If subjects live 
[ADDRESS_845147]  MCW travel rate  of 
$0.56/mile.   
 If a study visit requires an overnight stay, subjects  will receive a $25 meal reimbursement per night.  
 
Subjects may be eligible to lodge at Kathy’s House if they  reside at a permanent address 50 miles or greater 
from Milwaukee. Kathy’s House is located on the Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632975] f or research 
subjects who require a stay greater than 3 days.  
 
Payment for lodging at Kathy’s House will be arranged and covered by [CONTACT_3476]. Care givers are expected 
to lodge with subjects to the extent possible.  
 
With the subject’s verbal consent, a referral can be sent by [CONTACT_633005]’s House. The following 
personal information will be included in the referral to Kathy’s House: subject and care giver name, date of birth, 
gender, city, state, zip code, phone number, email address, and reason for visit.  
 
Upon reception of the referral, Kathy’s House will conduct a formal background check using TruthFinder.com. 
The subject and caregiver’s names and birthdates will be used to check for any criminal charges associated with 
either person. Kathy’s House has the right to reject any referral based on this background check.  
 
The study team does not plan to reimburse for any other type of lodging.  
 5.3. Early Termination Visit  
If a subject decides  to exit the study, a termination visit will be scheduled. This will include all Language 
assessments normally performed at assessment  visits. In addition, any incidental imaging findi ngs will be 
addressed.  
 5.4. Study Procedures  
5.4.1. Informed Consent  
Participants will provide written informed consent  at the Visit -1. When feasible, informed consent will  be obtained  
right after a routine  clinic visit . The consent process will involve distributing a full consent form to the potential 
study participant and a thorough presentation of  the purpose and risks of the study, and an explanation of study 
procedures by [CONTACT_278373]. Sufficient  time for questions, discussion, and the subject’s 
decision will be allowed for proper informed consent by [CONTACT_2299]. Once the participant fully understands the study protocol as outlined in the consent form, he/she will acknowledge his/her consent w ith a signature [CONTACT_633019]32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    11 
 is placed directly below the text on the consent form. Each participant will receive a complete copy of the signed 
consent form for his/her personal records. The study coordinator will keep the original signed copy for study 
records.  
 5.4.2. Demographics, Medical History, and MRI Safety Screening  
Demographic information,  basic  medical history , and MRI safety screening begin at the screening visit  and are 
completed at baseline prior to any study participation by [CONTACT_423].  Data are collected from participants 
including demographic information (age, gender, race, ethnicity), medical and surgical history, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_632976], medications and  supplements, and family history of illness. We will also ask questions pertaining to 
fluency in languages, education,  history of dyslexia or other developmental learning disabilities
, and work history .   
 
5.4.3 . Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)  neuronavigation  
The TMS can be used to determine optimal electrode positioning. Each patient’s individual head and brain 
anatomy can be modeled along with a  de-identified structural  brain MRI obtained prior to the visit. Once optimal 
electrode positions are determined, the patient’s structural MRI and the coordinates of the electrode positions 
will be uploaded into a neuronavigation software; the electrode positions can be converted into 3D spheres, 
which can then be loaded into the software. The neuronavigation software comes equipped with automatic 
segmentation algorithms that allow cortical and surface (3D curvilinear and skin) reconstructions based on the 
patient’s raw structural MRI. The electrode locations are then ov erlaid onto the reconstructed curvilinear brain.  
 
5.4.4. Language and Cognitive Assessments and Language Tasks  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_320516]. A standardized set of 160 pi[INVESTIGATOR_632977] (80 for each treatment period). The pi[INVESTIGATOR_632978] a set of rules to provide consistency of pi[INVESTIGATOR_632979]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_632980] a computer sc reen and at the start of the task patients will be asked 
to name [CONTACT_633020]. Each pi[INVESTIGATOR_365538] a period of up to [ADDRESS_845148] production resulting from the tDCS stimulation procedure. (Snodgrass & Vanderwart.,1980) . 
 
Alternatively, we will use the Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (NAB) naming sub -test. The NAB naming 
sub-test involves showing the examinee color photographs of objects, as opposed to black and white line 
drawings. The NAB naming test has fewer items (31), and all items are administered to test -takers, with no 
setting of a basal  level or discontinue criteria. Patients are allowed 10 seconds to freely recall the name [CONTACT_633021], and then are given 5 s after the semantic cue and 5 s after the phonemic cue, for a total of 20 possible 
seconds per item (Stern & White, 2003).  
Approximat e total testing time will be [ADDRESS_845149] will be used (one for each 
treatment period).

Kaplan Executive Function System (Delis et al., 2001a) . This subtest will require  the individual  to randomly 
generate words based on given parameters such as words beginning with the letter F. This test is based on the 
original FAS  verbal fluency test. The test  builds upon this by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a semantic  fluency test  that requires  
generating boy’s names and animal names .   
Estimated testing time: [ADDRESS_845151] (DSF) 
and digit span backwards (DSB) subtests of the Wechsler memory scale –Fourth edition (Benson et al., 2010). 
The task was chosen due to its reliance on phonological short -term memory (STM), a function often impaired in 
lvPPA (Meyer et al. 2015). With this test we seek to detect changes in phonological STM resulting from the tDCS 
stimulation procedure.  
Estimated testing time: [ADDRESS_845152] assesses the capacity to retain speech sound information in a 
short -term memory store across a  5-second maintenance interval. The m aterial  is presented in the form of  
PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    12 
 digitally recorded na tural utterances  by a single talker , with syllable trains containing 1- 5 syllables (24 trials per 
length condition) . Participants will be asked to identify:  same pairs = first train followed by a different recording 
of the same items , versus different pairs = first train followed by a train differing in a single syllable . Testing will 
include a total of 120 items (60 for each treatment period), and responses will be selected by [CONTACT_137610] a 
touch screen system (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_632968]., 2017). This experimental measure complements the more standard Digit Span 
test by [CONTACT_633006] -term memory w ithout the articulatory demands of the Digit Span test.  
Estimated testing time: [ADDRESS_845153]  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_632968]., 2014 ) or nonword (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_632968]., 2017, 2018)  prior to articulation. Each trial consists of a sample 
word  or nonword  presented in the center of a computer display with two similar choice ite ms below the sample.  
The patient's task is to select the item that rhymes with the sample.
 Trials ar e constructed such that phonologic  
similarity is uncoupled from orthographic similarity  (e.g., does snow  rhyme with plow  or blow).  
Word rhyme matching: [ADDRESS_845154]- triads (20 for each treatment period). [ADDRESS_845155] rhyme matching: [ADDRESS_845156]-like nonwords (36 for each treatment period). M atched on length 
and orthographic neighborhood size with the word triads used  in the word rhyme matching portion.  
Estimated testing time: 10 minutes.  
 
Spontaneous Speech Sample.  This task consists of pi[INVESTIGATOR_632981] (“Cookie Theft Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]”), in which the participant is asked to “Tell me everything you see going on 
in thi s pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].” Responses will be digitally recorded and later transcribed and analyzed. Since diagnostic criteria 
for lvPPA includes changes to spontaneous speech, obtaining an objective measure of discourse can detect 
subtle changes to speech and language that may be clinically meaningful (Ahmed et al., 2012; Wilson et al., 
2010). Specifically, through automated analyses we will measure semantic content, speech fluency, and timing 
measures such as words -per-minute (Ahmed et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2017).  
Estimated testing time: [ADDRESS_845157] uses a speech output task in 
which the examinee orally describes a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a family scene (Stern & White, 2003). 2 different versions of the 
family scene will be used (one per treatment condition).  
Estimated testing time: [ADDRESS_845158] that 
requires the examinee to demonstrate reading comprehension of single words and of sentences by [CONTACT_633007]  (Stern & White, 2003). [ADDRESS_845159] will 
be used (one for each treatment peri od).  
 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).  MoCA  is a widely used screening assessment for detecting cognitive 
impairment. It is a one- page 30- point test administered in approximately 10 minutes (Nasreddine et al. 2005). [ADDRESS_845160] in English, and 2 will be used for each patient (one per treatment condition).  
 ‘Trained’ tasks . This includes  items tested at baseline and after treatment periods, with half of them also practiced  
(i.e. trained)  during all stimulation procedures (either sham or real  tDCS ). It will include the reading of words and 
non-words  and the repetition of non- words ( approximately  480 items , a total of 2 88 items for reading and 192 for 
repetition, divided across two treatmen t periods ). Non -word tasks were selected due to their reliance on the kind 
of phonologic mechanisms subserved by [CONTACT_633008]- parietal cortex and impaired in lvPPA  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_632982]., 2017).  We will test vocal reaction times and the data will be analyzed using a Matlab custom script.  
Estimated testing time: [ADDRESS_845161] datasets that include resting- state fu nctional MRI (rs -
fMRI) , diffusion MRI (dMRI), and resting state magnetoencephalography ( rsMEG).  
 
PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    13 
 MRI Acquisition Protocols  
All lvPPA patients will undergo four 60 -minute 3T MRI scanning sess ions (total 4  hrs), including high- resolution 
T1 and T2 structural MRI, dMRI,  and rs -fMRI as summarized below. In the case of left handed participants  
(approximately 80% are left hemispheric dominant) , they will undergo a quick  fMRI test (~ 6 min) to confirm  their 
left hemispheric dominance (Binder et al. 1995).  
 
3T MRI Hardware:  Scanning will be done on GE MR 750 3T clinical scanners (50 mT/m & 200 T/m/s gradients) 
with a Nova 32- channel neuroimaging phased array receive head coil and whole- body rf transmission.  
 
3T MRI Pulse Sequences: fMRI and diffusion MRI acquisitions will use prototype GE pulse sequences from the 
"ProtoPak2" software package, made available to us by a research agreement with GE. These state- of-the-art 
sequences provide multi -band acquisition of fMRI and dMRI data, greatly accelerating the acquisitions and 
allowing reductions in voxel size and repetition time to match those of the HCP protocol.  
 
Resting -State FMRI (rs -fMRI) Protocol.  The rs -fMRI parameters will be  identical to the HCP Lifespan protocol, 
including an eyes -open fixation task, 30 minutes of rs -fMRI data divided into six 5-minute runs, and a 50:50 
alternation of phase encoding direction.   
 
Structural MRI Protocol.  T1-weighted structural images will be acquired using the GE "BRAVO" pulse sequence 
and "Cube" with "ARC" for T2- weighted images, which is a 3D fast spin echo sequence using GE’s autocalibrated 
parallel imaging technology. These vendor -supplied sequences provide comparable image quality to those of 
the HCP at the same 0.8 mm isotropic voxel size.  
 
Prior to fMRI scans, subjects will undergo MRI safety screening and, as detailed in sections 7.3. and 7.4., 
respectively.  
 
MEG Acquisition Protocol  
MEG offers relatively good spatial localization of neural activity sources together with millisecond temporal 
resolution not possible with hemodynamic imaging methods. All lvPPA patients will undergo resting state MEG 
recordings.  
 Our MEG is a V ectorview whole- head 306- channel system (Elekta Neuromag Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) that 
combines [ADDRESS_845162].  
 Continuous Recognition Memory  task, (CRM task) : To be performed during MEG acquisition. The stimuli consist  
of 5 target words and 40 distractor words  repeated in 4 consecutive blocks , which are  read by a digitized native 
English speaker . The auditory stimuli  will be presented using E -Prime 1.2 software (Psychology Software Tools, 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA) and delivered binaurally to the patient using Tubal Insert Earphones (TIP -300, Nicolet 
Biomedical, Madison, WI). Prior to the start of the MEG recording, the [ADDRESS_845163]. Alternatively, we may ask the patients  to press a button in order to document 
responses (Raghavan et al. 2017).  
Approximate duration: 30 minutes.  
 5.4.5. Randomization, Treatment  Dosing and Administration  
An unblinded member of the study team  will randomize participants to the treatment conditions .  Study Group 
assignment will be based on random number generation (in blocks of 4) followed by [CONTACT_633009].  
 
In Tx Period 1, study participants will receive either  stimulation (up to 2 mA in the targeted cortical tissue ) or 
sham ; in Tx Period 2, all subjects will crossover and receive the other treatment. This is a double- blind study, so 
PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    14 
 both the participants and the study team  members involved in language training, tDCS delivery,  and assessment 
of outcomes will be blind to the treatment received.  
 
The Soterix MXN -9 High -Definition stimulator will be used for focal current delivery; this device is cur rently 
housed at the ‘Computational Neuroscience and Neurotechnology lab’  at MCW (See Images 1 and 2).  
 
                                       
 
Images 1 and 2 : To the left (Image 1) , 9-channel HD -tDCS device (MXN -9, Soterix Medical Inc.). To the right (Image 2),  Soterix Medical 
HD-Cap  showing 4 X 1 High Definition montage.   
 When conducting HD-tDCS, specially designed insets, electrodes, stimulation pr otocols, and conductive gels 
will be  used. Appropriate instrumentation, electrode design, and protocols are considered important for HD -tDCS 
safety and comfort. All materials were purchased from Soterix Medical ([LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_003]) . A flexible plastic EEG 
cap or a latex swim cap will be  placed on  each participant’s head.  The EEG cap will be held in place with a chin 
strap and if using a  swim cap, the latex material snuggly fits the participant’s head without a strap . To guarantee 
individualized targeting of the left  posterior  TPC, we will follow t he steps below with minor variations as required:  
1) The Soterix HD -Targets and/or  HD-Explore software programs  can be used to determine the optimal 
electrode positioning and stimulation current  based  on the identif ied brain target and the subject -specific 
predicted current flow . For this purpose, each patient’s individual head and brain anatomy can  be 
modeled by [CONTACT_205445]  (prior to visit using the de-identified structural  brain  MRI obtained prior to 
enrollment as part of rou tine, clinical standard of care (see Image 3).  There are  freely available software 
packages such as SimNIBS 2.1 (Saturnino et al., 2018 bioRxiv) that can also be employed for 
individualized current  modeling. We will explore these alternative packages  to de termine the electrode 
positions and for current flow simulations. Guidelines from prior HD -tDCS modeling studies (Alam et al., 
2016) will also be considered for improving the focality of stimulation.  
2) Once optimal electrode positions are determined, the pa tient’s structural MRI and the coordinates of the 
electrode positions will be uploaded into a neuronavigation software; the electrode positions can be 
converted into 3D spheres, which can then be loaded into the software. The neuronavigation software 
comes equipped with automatic segmentation algorithms that allow cortical and surface ( 3D curvilinear 
and skin) reconstructions based on the patient’s raw structural MRI. The electrode locations are then 
overlaid onto the reconstructed curvilinear brain.  
3) During one of the pre -stimulation (baseline) visits, the cap will be  fitted to the patient and using the optical 
tracking tools and the neuronavigation software, we will navigate to the electrode locations from the brain 
surface onto the patient’s scalp. A permanent marker will be used to mark the electrode locations directly 
on the cap.

The electrode casings  or holders  will be secured in the cap at the marked locations. The skin preppi[INVESTIGATOR_632984]. (2013) will be followed: separating the hair inside the electrode casings  until the scalp 
is exposed, removing hair products and dirt on the scalp using an alcohol swab and then filling the electrode 
casings with 3 mL of Signa Gel (Parker Laboratories, NJ)  or HD -GELTM (Soterix Medical)  with more applied if 
needed. The electrodes will be placed on a platform inside the casings so that they are completely immersed in 
the gel. M ore gel will be applied to cover the electrodes and then they will be held in place with the casing caps. 
Impedance values will be examined for each of the 5 electrodes  (4 X 1 montage seen on image 2 ) and will all  
be verified to be <2 quality units (Turski  et al., 2017).  
 Stimulation sessions will consist of daily 20 -min sessions with a current of  up to 2 mA (sham or anodal) to the 
targeted cortical tissue for five consecutive days per week and for 2 consecutive weeks (10 sessions in total) .  
The device contains a double- blind switch  that can be turned to ON or OFF from the back of the device. Once  
the double- blind  mode is turned  ON, the device will not show any sham settings on the front and will not display 
any true current that is being delivered.  
 
Before treatment begins , a blinded member of the study team will fit the  cap, prep skin, and place  and immerse  
electrodes  into casing using gel . The  blinded study team member may be a research coordinator and/or research 
assistant, who are trained in the theory and application of the HD -tDCS device. An unblinded member of the 
study team  will program the device for each stimul ation setting,  turn the double- blind switch ON, and then leave 
the room. A blinded member of the team  will then deliver the stimulation without knowing if it is an active session 
or a sham session. The safe delivery of tDCS, even by [CONTACT_105] -professional caregivers, has been previously 
documented  (see Im et al, 2019) .  
 
Auto-sham automatically calculates and produces a sham waveform based on the indicated “real” waveform. 
For example, for a corresponding real waveform of 1.5 mA and 20 minutes, auto -sham will provide a ramp 
up/down to 1.5 mA at the start of stimulation  (for 30 seconds), and again after 20  minutes with the timer 
automatically adjusted such that the total run time is exactly matched to the real case (Poreisz et al.,  2007) .   
 
6. DATA MANAGEMENT  
6.1. A secure  web-based  system  will be used to enroll patients  and obtain the rando mly assigned treatm ent 
group.  Data forms will be printed,  completed, an d entered  into the database using  a secure  web-based  
application.  The database will be monitored for completeness,  consistency,  accuracy, and  timeliness. No  patient-
identifying information  will be stored in the database.  To ensure that data  are secure  from external  violation, 
computer sy stems containing study  data will be  password  protect ed, and physical access to the computer 
systems will be limited .  
 
6.2. Determination of c hanges in Language Function and Concurrent Improvement in Network Activity.  
The language and MRI/rfMRI  datasets will be obtained at baseline (before sham/active tDCS administration) and 
on the last day of each 2- week treatment period. These two time points will be denoted t = 1, 2. The two 10-

PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    [ADDRESS_845164] groups, both of which will receive both sham and active tDCS at different treatment phase, will be denoted 
g = 1, 2. The set of Language (LG)  scores for subject s, from group  g, at time t will be denoted LG (s,g,t), where 
s = 1, …, 10 ; g = 1 , 2; and t = 1, 2. The Language -Network functional connectivity ( LFC) calculated between the 
left posterior temporal and inferior parietal  cortex for subject s, from group  g, at time t  will be denoted L FC(s,g,t).  
 
6.3. Language Changes Due to Stimulation.  Scores across all tests within the language battery will be 
combined into one composite measure to facilitate assessment of overall language performance across 
domains.  All seven  scores will be normalized to  a Z-score by [CONTACT_633010]. Then, Z-scores of each test will be averaged 
to obtain an individual composite language Z-score (McConathey et al., 2017) . We will employ  age, years of 
education, gender, and gray matter (GM) volume as time -invariant covariates to obtain res idual variables to 
determine the LG  changes due to stimulation. We will model the LG score as a function of these nuisance 
regressors . This regr ession will be performed using all the data (i.e., all subjects, all groups, and all times) : 
 
 
Define  𝜟𝜟𝜟𝜟𝜟𝜟� (𝒔𝒔,𝒈𝒈,𝒕𝒕)≡ 𝑹𝑹𝑹𝑹𝒔𝒔(𝒔𝒔,𝒈𝒈,𝒕𝒕). We will test the residuals 𝜟𝜟𝜟𝜟𝜟𝜟� (𝒔𝒔,𝒈𝒈,𝒕𝒕) using a three -factor crossed -nested 
ANOVA, with fixed factors group and time, and random factor subject  nested within group. We will test for group 
and time main effects, as well as the group × time interaction. If we find significant main effects or interactions, 
we will perform post hoc procedures to determine which time and group combinations are significantly different .  
 
6.4. Functional -Connectivity Changes Due to Stimulation.  We will use the well established Human 
Connectome Project (HCP) fMRI processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_632985]. Binder's group at MCW, which include 
state -of-the-art noise removal, spatial normalization, and surface- based cortical parcellation methods.  
 
Func tional connectivity matrices will be computed by [CONTACT_633011] 
(ROI), averaging the preprocessed fMRI signal over each ROI, and then computing the Z- transformed correlation 
coefficient between every ROI pair . The functional connectivity of a number of different parcellation schemes will 
be examined. This includes anatomical atlas based parcellation, such as the Harvard Oxford atlas, a validated 
probabilistic atlas implemented in FSL that divides each hemisphere into 56 regions corresponding to portions 
of cortical gyri and subcortical gray matter nuclei; combined anatomical and functional parcellation of regions 
that tend to co- activate during resting state, as implemented in S tatistical Parametric Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (Tzourio -Mazoyer, 
N., et al., 2002)  and purely functional delineations such as the Crad- 200, a constrained spectral clustering of 
resting state fMRI data into 200 parcels encompassing both cortical and subcortical regions, and a high model 
order Independent  component analysis ( ICA), as advocated by [CONTACT_633012]. Targeted exploration of 
connectivity driven by [CONTACT_633013].  
We will employ  age, years of education, gender, and gray matter (GM) v olume as time- invariant covariates to 
obtain res idual variables to determine LFC  changes  due to stimulation. We will model the L FC as a function of 
these nuisance regressors, using the following multiple linear regression equation, and retain the residuals as 
𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅+(𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡) for further analysis:  
 
 
where 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹+� (𝑠𝑠,𝑔𝑔,𝑡𝑡)≡ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑠𝑠(𝑠𝑠,𝑔𝑔,𝑡𝑡). This regression will be performed using all  of the data (i.e., all subjects, all 
groups, and all times). We will test the residuals 𝐿𝐿𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹+� (𝑠𝑠,𝑔𝑔,𝑡𝑡) using three -factor crossed -nested analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) , with fixed factors of group and time and a random factor of subject  nested within group (i.e., 
all subjects will be tested at all times, but the sham and stimulation groups will contain different t reatment phases. 
We will test for both group and time main effects, as well as for the group × time interaction. If we find significant 
main effects or interactions, we will perform post hoc procedures to determine which time and group (i.e., sham 
Vs. stimulation) combinations are significantly different.  
 6.5. Prediction of Changes in C orrelation Between LFC and LG  Before and After tDCS . A multiple linear 
regression is used to model LG as a linear function of LFC and test the difference in slope and intercept between 
the active stimulation and sham  groups. If the subject  is in the active stimulation  group, A(s,g) = 1; if the subject 
is in the sham  (placebo)  group,  A(s,g) = 0.

Here, LFC(s) represents baseline LFC for subject s (for simplicity, nuisance regressors are not shown).  
 
6.6. Changes in Spontaneous Neuronal Oscillatory Patterns and synchronizations due to Stimulation   
The rsMEG  datasets will be obtained at baseline (before sham/active tDCS administration) and on the last day 
of each [ADDRESS_845165] 
(ECP) MEG methods, currently used at MCW.  A scalp digitization will be generated during each session of the 
MEG procedure that includes anatomical landmarks and localizer coils.  The MEG data will be co -registered to 
the MRI  using a minimization of the distance from the digitized headshape to the MR I derived scalp surface.   
The localizer coils will provide the position of the patients head relative to the MEG sensors.  Sensor level activity 
will be projected to the cortical surface using minimum norm based spatial filters with anatomical priors.  The  
cortical surface will be downsampled to approximately 8000 vertices; the orientation and location will act as priors 
on solving the transformation from sensor space to source space, known as the inverse solution.  Data from the 
cortical surface will be sp atially averaged over the anatomical parcellations.  These parcellated timeseries will 
be used to calculate band- limited connectivity measures.  Targeted exploration of connectivity driven by [CONTACT_633014].  
 
Connectivity between all ROI -pairs w ill be calculated in the theta (4- 8 Hz), alpha (8- 12 Hz), beta (13 -30 Hz), and 
low-gamma (30- 55 Hz) frequency bands using three different metrics: coherence (COH), phase lag index (PLI), 
and debiased weighted phase lag index (d- wPLI). Mean connection strengths w ithin 3 intra -hemispheric 
language- specific ROI -groups, and those between all intra -hemispheric ROIs will be  computed. We will also 
compute  mean connection strengths between language ROI -groups and all remaining brain ROIs, and those 
between each hemispher ic ROI and all other brain ROIs.  
 The same multiple linear regression models used for the analysis of rsfMRI data will be used for the analysis of 
rsMEG data (for simplicity, regression equations are not shown). See above for details.  
 
6.7. Expected Resul ts, Deliverable,  and Problems  
Through this study , we expect to realize two goals: Scientifically,  we will demonstrat e that active HD -tDCS can 
increase language- network functional connectivity and  improve abnormal patterns of resting state neuronal 
frequencies and  synchronizations .  Clinically, we expect that the changes in network activity  after the [ADDRESS_845166] retention, and safety for future pi[INVESTIGATOR_632986].  
 
6.8. Data Sharing  
Subjects  will provide written informed consent via an addendum consent form, noting their  permission for the 
study team to share all data collected throughout their participation in the study  with UW-Madison collaborator 
PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    [ADDRESS_845167]. Mueller in a secure and protected manner : 
• Study ID number  
• Dates of visits and consent  
• Demographic information, such as age, year of birth, sex, handedness, race, ethnicity, educational 
history, and childbearing potential  
• Medical history, such as medical/neurological diagnoses and medications  
• Randomization information 
• Adverse events  
• TMS Neuronavigation data 
• Performance on cognitive and language tests  
• Voice recordings and speech samples  
• Images from MRI scan 
• Recordings from MEG scan  
 
Once data analysis and statistical support are complete, [CONTACT_187296] send results back to the study team, 
where they will be stored for the duration of the study.  
 
The data we provide will not contain any information that can directly identify  subjects.  
 7. DATA SAFETY  MONITORING PLAN  
An appointed DSMB will  discuss the ethical conduct of the trial, review event definitions and the subject ICF 
form, and further develop plans for monitoring the data and safety of the trial.  The DSMB  will meet at least 
annually  to review the course of the trial.  The DSMB agrees to communicate with institutional review board 
(IRB)/human subject committees to provide reassurances, as appropriate . There will be three DSMB members 
with th e following areas of expertise:  
 
• Neural mechanism underlining language and memory  disorder s.  
• Neuroimaging 
• Psychology of Language and Memory Loss .  
 
7.1. Safety Plan 
The safety issues in  this study are related to use of HD-tDCS and acquisition of fMRI  and MEG  data. This study 
uses a well-known HD-tDCS montage at a safe dose of current .  Previous studies on the safety and tolerabi lity 
of tDCS have shown that a  2-mA current applied for 20 minutes is associated with no serious AEs  (Brunoni et 
al., 2011 ).  The AEs most often associated with HD -tDCS are not associated with long -term, deleterious effects , 
and instead are typi[INVESTIGATOR_632987]. The most commonly reported AEs are itching, tingling, mild 
headache, mild fatigue and localized burning sensation  at the site of stimulation.  (Brunoni et al ., 2011) .  We will 
assess AEs using a customized questionnaire ( Attachment 1).  The questionnaire will be performed immediately 
after each tDCS session and during the phone follow -up calls scheduled between treatment periods.   
  
7.2. MRI Safety  
The MRI scanner device is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-cleared device for safe and noninvasive 
imaging of the interior of the human body. The GE MR75 [ADDRESS_845168] as it does for all other scans. Thus, the scanner 
PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    19 
 with the software fully engaged operates, from a technical design and functional standpoint, as a nonsignificant 
risk device in accordance with 21 CFR 812. By [CONTACT_573211], the operating conditions of the MRI 
device are generally deemed, in and of themselves, to make the MRI device a nonsignificant r isk device.  
 
The Nova Medical 32- channel head coil (model number NMSC075- 32-3GE-MR750) is an investigational device 
that is not approved by [CONTACT_573212]. This coil device includes multiple features for safe operation involving 
human studies. The 32 -channel coil is designed and constructed as a receive- only detector of RF signals that 
are emitted by [CONTACT_633015], which is FDA approved. During the RF excitation by [CONTACT_218862], the coil device is decoupled (made inactive) through 
redundant circuitry; thus, the coil device never transmits RF to the subject and, therefore, it has no impact on 
subject risk or safety.  
 
More specifically, the coil design and construction include the follow ing safety features: 1)  High-voltage 
breakdown (>2  kV) UL -94V0 flame retardant housing. 2) Rugged  construction to ensure safe operation in case 
of rough handling. 3) Active detuning circuitry providing greater than 35 db  isolation per element. 4)  High power 
passive  detuning circuits in case primary detuning circuitry fails. 5)  Multiple common mode traps in all receive 
coil cables. 6)  Minimum of [ADDRESS_845169].  
 Additionally, the c oil was designed and manufactured under an ISO [ZIP_CODE] certified quality management system. 
As part of this quality system, Nova Medical has conducted  a failure means and effects analysis (FEMA) of this 
produc t, and we feel that it is a  nonsignificant risk under foreseeable normal conditions when used on the 3T GE 
X750 MRI scanners at MCW . 
 7.3. MRI Safety Screening 
MCW -specific magnetic resonance ( MR) safety screening procedures will be followed. All participants will be 
screened for medical devices, implants, and metal prior to undergoing MRI, first at  the screening  and baseline 
visits (Visit s -1 and 1 ) and again prior to V isits 10, 12, and 22.  If it is necessary to review medical records to 
confirm contraindication, a review of medical records (e.g., previous surgeries) will take place prior to the 
scheduled visit. During the screening process, participants will also be questioned abou t their ability to 
temporarily remove transdermal patches (such as birth control or nicotine patches). Women of child- bearing 
potential will be asked to confirm that they are not pregnant when signing the ICF. If a woman has concerns or 
is uncertain of her  pregnancy status, she will be excluded, as the risks of an MRI scan to pregnant women are 
currently unknown. The risks related to an MRI are minimal for a properly administered visit. The MR technicians are trained and prepared to deal with any problems t hat may arise.  
 7.4. Incidental Findings  by [CONTACT_633016]. Sometime s, however, a few incidental 
abnormalities may be found in study subjects, s uch as brain tumors, vascular lesions, moderate to severe white 
matter lesion load, and other neuroradiological abnormalities that would preclude subjects from being included 
in the analysis, or that are clinical abnormalities requiring follow -up. These subjects will be advised to see their 
physicians for formal assessment. [CONTACT_633022] is a board -certified neurologist  at MCW . He will consult with 
the subjects in such cases.  
 
7.5 Magnetoencephalography (MEG) Risks:  
There are no health risks associated with MEG, but there is some risk of discomfort. During MEG recording, due 
to restriction of head movements and being in a small room, some people may experience an unpleasant feeling 
of confinement or discomfort from sitting still for a long tim e. 
 7.6. Subject Safety  
Due to the duration and low dose of stimulation,  we anticipate this study to present  minimal risk to subjects . We 
do not expect frequen t or sever e AEs to occur . Subjects will be instru cted to call the study site concerning any 
adverse events or illnesses  that may occur . The DSMB will review the frequency and severity of any AEs. 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_632988] s are reported above the 5% threshold. Subject 
safety will be closely monitored during the study period, and individual participation in the study may be 
PRO32037 – HD-tDCS in lvPPA [ Protocol v 5.0]    [ADDRESS_845170] protected  and encrypted to further ensure safety.  
 
7.7. Data   
The time frame for data analysis will be at the time point when 50% of subjects have been recruited. AE  data 
analysis will be performed every [ADDRESS_845171] in notification of the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_632989].  
 
7.8. Efficacy   
Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_31093], two feasibility outcomes will be included: Consent rate and treatment 
completion rate. Only four  patients are sufficient to calculate a 90% exact binomial confidence interval of (.56, 1) 
if all four are observed to complete treatment.  Thus, this sample size would be large enough to potentially  
exclude completion rates of 56%  or lower. The collection of pi[INVESTIGATOR_632990]. This information will then be used for the more formal calculations of power 
and sample size necessary to conduct a future trial.  
 
7.10. Feedback Mechanism   
Evaluation and response to any subject  complaints will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9288] B. The IRB will be notified of 
protocols violations  and emergence of unexpected AEs at  any time during the study. In addition,  a report by [CONTACT_633017].

 Introductory Statement 
Peri-implantitis is a serious emerging new disease with a prevalence of 22% in patients 
with dental implants. (Derks and Tomasi 2015). Although early stage mucositis may be 
controlled non-surgically, established peri-implantitis lesion s are still a challenge to 
manage due to the unpredictable results (Suarez-Lopez Del Amo et al. 2016) . Studies 
have evaluated the effectiveness of different methods for implant surface 
decontamination, as well as several bone grafting materials attempting to regenerate 
peri-implant bony defects (Claffey et al. 2008) . Among the available approaches for 
decontamination, laser therapy (especially Er:YAG laser) has been proven to reduce 
ba
cterial load without damaging the implant surface (Goncalves et al. 2010; Yamamoto 
and Tanabe 2013). In animal models, there are several studies showing that with the 
Er:YAG laser treatment in preparation for bone grafting procedure , there is an increased 
regenerated bone- to-implant contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a better regenerative outcome (Nevins et al. 
2014; Takasaki et al. 2007) . Many studies also have shown the benefits of laser to 
improve wound healing, better hemostasis, and positive biostimulation effects  (Aoki et 
al. 2015) . However, there is limited human randomized clinical trials assessing the 
clinical benefits of using Er:YAG laser (Schwarz et al. 2013; Schwarz et al. 2011) . It is 
still of great interest to critically evaluate whether laser can assist in traditional 
mechanical debridement to promote regenerative therapy. The purpose of the study is 
to evaluate if Er:YAG laser ca n assist in mechanical debridement and enhance the 
outcome of a regenerative therapy for resolving peri-implant infection and restoring 
bony defects.  
 
General Investigation Plan 
 
This study involves one center and a double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial 
is planned. Twenty-four adult patients in the need of surgical treatment due to peri-
implantitis infections will be included. A signed written informed consent will be obtained 
after he or she has been given verbal and written information describing the nature and 
duration of the study. Subjects will not be screened or treated until an informed consent 
has been obtained. Subject information will be protected according to the privacy

Study Protocol  
I. Introduction  
Peri-implant diseases are similar to periodontal diseases and can be classified into 
two different entities, including peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Peri-implant 
mucositis corresponds to gingivitis and peri-implantitis corresponds to periodontitis in 
natural teeth. As defined by [CONTACT_449387], (Peri-implant 
mucositis and peri -implantitis: A current understanding of their diagnoses and clinical 
implications  2013) mucositis represents a disease in which the presence of 
inflammation is confined to the soft tissue surrounding an implant without signs of bone 
loss following initial bone remodeling during healing; while peri-implantitis is an 
inflammatory reaction around an implant, which includes both soft tissue inflammation 
and loss of supporting bone beyond biological remodeling. Regarding the treatment of 
these arising diseases, it has been proven that mechanical non-surgical therapy could 
be effective for peri-implant mucositis. However, when aiming to treat peri-implantitis, 
non-surgical treatment was found not to be effective (Renvert et al. 2008) .  
Dental implants are not immune from mechanical or biological complications 
(Aljateeli et al. 2012) and as implant therapy becomes more widely used, peri-implant 
diseases arise with it. It has been reported that 22-28% of implants patients had at least 
one implant with progressive bone loss and 12.4% had bone loss extend beyond 1/3 of 
the implant thread (Atieh et al. 2012; De Bruyn et al. 2013; Fransson et al. 2005; 
Marrone et al. 2012).  
There are currently different techniques available for the treatment of peri-
implantitis, including but not limited to: citric acid, chlorhexidine, local and systemic 
antibiotics, hydrogen peroxide, air powder abrasive treatment, laser and photodynamic 
therapy, as well as implantoplasty. Nevertheless, even though a great variety of studies 
attempted to evaluate the efficacy of these treatment options, no conclusions could be 
made due to most studies differed markedly in design and the surface debridement 
treatment that was performed in combination of various regenerative techniques 
 
Version 9 Page 6 
 (Claffey et al. 2008). Nonetheless, one of the key steps to achieve a favorable outcome 
is to properly detoxify the contaminated implant surface. 
Laser therapy in general, specifically Er:YAG laser  has demonstrated to be an 
effective treatment in peri-implantitis, due to the high bactericidal potential without 
causing detrimental alterations of the fixture surface (Kreisler et al. 2002; Quaranta et 
al. 2009). More recently, it has been demonstrated that Er:YAG laser at 100 mJ/mm2  
irradiation power represents a safe and effective setting to remove the contaminated 
surface without alteration or melting the implant surface. In addition, implant 
temperature did not reach harmful levels when water was used during laser irradiation 
and thus osseointegration was proved to occur in an animal model after treatment 
(Yamamoto and Tanabe 2013) . Given its potential benefits from several in-vitro and in-
vivo studies, a well-controlled randomized clinical trial is warranted. 
 
II. Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using Er: YAG 
laser to assist in peri-implant defect debridement and implant surface decontamination 
prior to regenerative procedures in the treatment of peri-implant infections. To test this 
objective, three specific aims were developed and clinical measurements will be used 
as the primary outcome [including probing depths (PD) , gingival index (GI), bleeding on 
probing (BOP), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque-index (PI), radiographic bone fill 
(RBF), and 11 points Numeric Rating Scale (11-NRS), see Appendix A for more details] . 
Bacterial profile (BAC) and peri -implant crevicular fluid (PI[INVESTIGATOR_62724]) biomarkers will be 
assessed as a secondary exploratory outcome to determine the dynamic change and 
the stability of the treatment.  
 
Specific Aims/Hypothesis: 
Specific Aim 1:  To compare the clinical benefit of Er:YAG laser-assisted peri-
implant defect debridement and surface detoxification with conventional 
mechanical debridement for regenerative therapy. 
 
Version 9 Page 7 
 Null Hypothesis (H 0): Er:YAG laser-assisted surgical debridement combined with 
regenerative therapy significantly improves  clinical outcomes (PD, BOP, CAL, RBF)  
compared to conventional mechanical debridement alone. 
Alternative Hypothesis (H 1): Er:YAG laser- assisted surgical debridement combined with 
regenerative therapy does not give additional clinical benefits compared to conventional 
mechanical debridement alone. 
 
Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate whether Er:YAG laser-assisted regenerative surgical 
therapy can decrease bacterial load and alter microbial profile. 
Null Hypothesis (H 0):  Er:YAG laser-assisted surgical therapy significantly decreases 
bacterial load and alter microbial profile compared to mechanical debridement alone. 
Alternative Hypothesis (H 1):  Er:YAG laser-assisted surgical therapy does not 
significantly decrease bacterial load and alter microbial profile compared to mechanical 
debridement alone. 
 
Specific Aim 3: To analyze whether Er:YAG laser-assisted regenerative surgical 
therapy can impact the molecular profile of the peri-implant crevicular fluid (PI[INVESTIGATOR_62724]) 
and the stability of the treatment. 
Null Hypothesis (H 0):  Er:YAG laser-assisted regenerative surgical therapy significantly 
alter the molecular profile of the PCIF compared to mechanical debridement alone. 
Alternative Hypothesis (H 1):  Er:YAG laser-assisted surgical therapy does not alter the 
molecular profile of the PIC F compared to mechanical debridement alone. 
 
Specific Aim 4 : To analyze whether the granulation tissue within the peri-implant 
defect can provide prognostic immunoscore for regenerative outcome and if 
Er:YAG laser has an impact on the landscape of the immunoscore. 
Hypothesis: Peri-implant defect has a specific immunoscore that can predict the 
outcome and stability of the regenerative therapy 
 
 
 
 
Version [ADDRESS_1119575] debridement could be 
easier with the aid of the laser and it could potentially stimulate better healing . A better 
understanding of the effects using laser therapy over the titanium surface and osseous 
de
fects, will help to establish an evidence-based protocol to manage peri-implantitis. 
Patients can benefit from reestablishing a healthy condition over a previously 
contaminated implant. This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial will allow us 
to potentially develop an effective new protocol for the treatment of peri-implantitis 
infections.  
 
III. Materials and Methods

care. The test group will be treated the same as the control group with the aid of the 
laser application (Er:YAG), which is also routinely used in such treatment for clinicians 
who have access to dental lasers.

D. Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized into one of the two groups. Twelve subjects will be 
allocated to the test group and another [ADDRESS_1119579] digit of the chart number (odd number goes to Group A and even 
number goes to Group B) but if one group has two subjects more than the other group, 
the next subject will automatically be enrolled in the lesser number group to ensure 
timely even distribution. The assignment of control or experimental group to Group A or 
B will be written by [CONTACT_96193] (Principle Investigator) in a concealed envelop 
before recruiting patients. This ensure the clinical examiner be blinded throughout the 
study. This randomization will prevent any operator bias.  
 
 
Version [ADDRESS_1119580]’s prior diagnosis. In addition, a set of intraoral photographs will be taken , 
one standardized peri-api[INVESTIGATOR_68990], and maxillary and mandibular impressions will 
be taken. Articulating paper will be used to check the occlusal contact [CONTACT_809606], if there is obvious heavy contact [CONTACT_809607], occlusal adjustment will 
be made. 
 
F. Surgical procedure V2 
The subject will be asked if they are still willing to participate in the study and their 
medical history will be reviewed. The subject’s vitals of blood pressure and heart rate 
will be taken. During this visit, intraoral photos will be taken and  all surgeries will be 
performed under local anesthesia using one or more of the following medications:  
 Lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], (Xylocaine 2%®-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:100,000 and 
1:50,000, Dentsply Pharmaceutical, York, PA, [LOCATION_003]). 
 Articaine (Septanest 4%®-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:100,000, Dentsply Pharmaceutical, 
York, PA, [LOCATION_003]). 
 Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Polocaine 2%®-Levonordefrin 1:20,000, Dentsply Pharmaceutical, 
York, PA, [LOCATION_003]). 
After local anesthesia, the width of the keratinized tissue around the implant will be 
measured by [CONTACT_809608]-implant mucosa will be 
measured with endo file and stopper.  
1) Test and Control group procedures 
Open flap debridement and regenerative approach will be the treatment of choice for 
both groups. Intrasulcular incisions will be performed with a 15-C scalpel around the 
 
Version [ADDRESS_1119581] the same treatment as the control group, but the laser will 
be used as a tool to aid in tissue debridement. In control group, the laser will also be set 
up for a fake application. 
 
(A) Control group: 
After the reflection of the flap, removal of the granulation tissue and mechanical 
debridement of infrabony defect and the implant surface with mechanical scalers will be 
performed. 
(B) Test group:  
The same protocol for the control group will be completed with the addition of the 
Er:YAG laser application to assist in mechanical debridement of the osseous defect and 
detoxify the implant surface.  
 
The granulation tissue within the peri-implant defect will be collected during the surgical 
debridement will be stored for Immunoscore analysis: 
Next-gen RNA sequencing will be performed on the peri-implant granulation tissue. This 
additional protocol serves two important scientific goals. First, we have built a novel 
machine learning tool, characterization of immune cell subsets using RNA-Seq data (Ci-
Seq). We will utilize Ci- Seq to comprehensively annotate the immune landscape of the 
granulation tissue. Specifically, we will resolve the percentages of different immune cell 
subsets and determine the weighted impact of each immune subset on the overall 
regenerative potential. Second, we will perform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) 
and differential genes expression profiling to identify key pathways that modulate 
patients’ response to regenerative treatment. 
 
2) Bone Graft and Membrane Placement (Both groups) 
After detoxification of the implant surface, mineralized bone allograft will be applied to 
both groups to fill the peri-implant defects. After the graft material is properly placed, an 
 
Version [ADDRESS_1119582] of care procedure. 
 
3) Site closure 
Soft tissue will then be sutured with PTFE sutures ( Cytoplast - PTFE suture) using 
either a simple interrupted technique or a criss-cross technique. Primary closure of the 
site will be attempted. The main objective of the sutures will be the stabilization of the 
wound. Sutures will be removed 10-14 days after.  
 
5) Post-Operative Care 
 All subjects will be prescribed 500mg of amoxicillin to take [ADDRESS_1119583] is allergic to Amoxicillin, they will be prescribed 250 mg of Zithromax 6 
tablets total /sig. [ADDRESS_1119584] day and Q.D. (1 x per day) until gone. In addition, the 
subject will be prescribed [ADDRESS_1119585]-op pain assessment. 
Exploratory measures will include biomarker profile and microbiological examination. 
 
2 (± 1) Week Follow-Up (V3) 
 
Version [ADDRESS_1119586] will return in 2 weeks (±1 week) for follow up care. The subject will be 
asked if they still are willing to participate in the study and their m edical history will be 
reviewed . The removal of the sutures or partial removal will be determined depending 
on
 the healing. .  The intensity and duration of post-operative pain assessment will be 
based on patient-reported days and scores using a 11-point numeric pain rating scale 
(NRS-11) (Jensen et al. 1989; Matys and Dominiak 2016). In addition, a standardized 
radiograph and intraoral photographs will be taken, BAC and PI[INVESTIGATOR_809595], and 
clinical measurements of GI and PI [INVESTIGATOR_809593]. 
 
4 (± 1) Week Follow-Up (V4) 
The subject will return in 4 weeks (±1 week) for follow up care. The subject will be 
asked if they still are willing to participate in the study and their medical history will be 
reviewed. If sutures are present, they will be removed. Intraoral photographs will be 
taken. BAC and PI[INVESTIGATOR_809596]. The subject will be mailed a  compensation of a $40 check from HSIP at the 
conclusion of this visit.   
 
12 (±1) Week Follow-Up (V5)  
The subject will return in 12 weeks (±2 week) for follow up care. The subject will be 
asked if they still are willing to participate in the study and their medical history will be 
reviewed. Intraoral photographs will be taken. A prophylaxis or a perio maintenance will 
be completed. In addition, BAC and PI[INVESTIGATOR_809597], BOP , CAL, PI, and GI will be taken. The subject will be mailed a  
compensation of a $40 check from HSIP at the conclusion of this visit.   
 
Re-evaluation (±2) 24 Week Follow-Up (V6) 
The subject will return in 24 weeks (±2 week) for follow up care. The subject will be 
asked if they still are willing to participate in the study and their medical history will be 
 
Version [ADDRESS_1119587] will be mailed a  
compensation of a $40 check from HSIP at the conclusion of this visit.   
  
 
 
Radiographic assessment of the alterations in alveolar bone fill and crestal level will be 
done through the use of standardize peri-api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] x-rays . One peri-api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] x-ray may be 
taken at the screening visit (V0), if there is no current x-ray to reference or if inclusion 
and exclusion criteria cannot be determined. Standardized peri-api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] x-rays will be 
obtain ed at three different time points (before surgery (V1), two weeks post-surgery 
(V3), and at the re-evaluation 24 week visit (V6). The ridge dimensions obtained from 
these x-rays will then be compared to the baseline measurements to identify changes.  
 
II) Microbial profile (BAC) and Peri-implant crevicular fluid (PI[INVESTIGATOR_62724]) analysis 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_809598]-surgical Preparation (V1), 2 week (V3), 4 w eek 
(V4), 12 week (V5) and re-evaluation-24 week (V6) . These samples will be used for 
bacterial DNA and biomarker analysis. Samples will be collected with sterile paper  point 
and strips. The sites sampled will be isolated with cotton rolls to keep the area dry and 
free of salivary contamination. A gentle air blow will be applied perpendicularly before 
sampling. For biomarker analysis, a perio strip will be inserted into the crevice until mild 
resistance is felt and left for [ADDRESS_1119588] with other tissues and to avoid trauma to the site. The 
samples will then be transferred to sterile micro centrifuge tubes containing protease 
inhibitors and stored at – 80 °C until further processing of the biomarkers ana lysis. All

 the sampling procedures are established and published by [CONTACT_27156] (Kinney et al. 
2014; Wang et al. 2016). 
 
 
Examiners calibration 
Calibration of the examiner will be performed through a training exercise with a 
calibrated examiner prior to the beginning of the study.  The calibrated examiner will 
observe and confirm the accuracy of the clinical measurements of PI, GI, and PD of the 
study examiner (>0.8 agreement between examiners will be considered calibrated). 
 
 
IV. Statistical Analysis:   
Sample Size 
This study will have a sample size of 24 subjects, 12 in each of the groups.    
The study power was calculated using the software nQuery Advisor v7.0 (Statistical 
Solutions, Saugus MA, [LOCATION_003]).  A difference of 2.0mm between groups was considered 
as clinically significant.  The power value was evaluated for probing depths at 6 months 
after the surgery.  A “p” value of less than 0.[ADDRESS_1119589] for the patients 
included in the study. Three free dental cleaning and $120 compensation will be given 
to the patients. 
 
 
Study reporting  
1. Adverse events  
Any adverse event, including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or 
symptoms, are to be recorded on the Adverse Event Case Report Form.  The intensity 
of the adverse event will be characterized as mild, moderate or severe as follows:  
 MILD events are usual transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subjects daily activities.  
 MODERATE events traditionally introduce a low level of inconvenience of concern 
to the subject and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by 
[CONTACT_14212].  
 SEVERE events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and traditionally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment.  
When intensity changes occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum intensit y 
for the event should be listed.  If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then these mini-events or changes should be recorded separately (i.e. having distinct 
onset days).  
The investigator will determine the relationship of the adverse event to the study test 
material.

The investigator will not deviate from the protocol without obtaining written approval 
from the IRB.  In medical emergencies, the investigator will use medical judgment and 
will remove the participant from immediate hazard, then notify the IRB regarding the 
type of emergency and course of action taken.  Any other changes or deviation in the 
protocol will be made as an amendment to the protocol and must be approved by [CONTACT_809611].  
6. Reports  
The investigator will make an accurate and adequate written progress reports to the IRB 
at appropriate intervals not exceeding one year.  
 
Version [ADDRESS_1119595] millimeter. Bleeding on probing will be recorded 
dichotomously as 0 or 1 (0=no, 1=yes). Patient –reported outcome will also be 
assessed using the 11 points Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) for the post-operative 
pain assessment. 
 
PD and BOP will be recorded at six sites per implant (mesio-buccal, buccal, disto-
buccal, mesio-lingual, lingual, disto-lingual).  A bleeding index for each patient will be 
determined by [CONTACT_809612] (O’Leary et al 1972) will be measured at six surfaces of each tooth. A PI [INVESTIGATOR_809604] Löe (Löe 1967) 
with the following scores: 
 Score 0: Normal gingiva. 
 Score 1: Mild inflammation, slight change in color, slight edema, no bleeding on 
probing.

  Score 2: Moderate inflammation, redness, edema, glazing, bleeding on probing. 
 Score 3: Severe inflammation, marked redness, edema, ulceration and tendency to 
spontaneous bleeding.

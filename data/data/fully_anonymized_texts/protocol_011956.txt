This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the statistical methods and data handlings to 
be employed for the analysis of the study Protocol 1615R2132, Version 4 dated 22 
February 2019. Table, listing and figure mo ck-ups are provided in the TLF shells 
prepared separately. Details of the analys es of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics are 
not addressed in this SAP.  
All the analyses described in the SAP will be performed in the Biometrics, Shionogi Inc. 
Any deviations from the SAP will be doc umented in the clinical study report. 
2. OVERVIEW 
This clinical trial is performed as a global (North America, South America, Europe, and 
Asia-Pacific), multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study with stratified 
randomization using the infection diagnosis  (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired bacterial pneumonia 
[HABP]/ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia [VABP]/healthcare-associated 
bacterial pneumonia [HCABP]) and Acute P hysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 
(APACHE II) score ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 16) as allocation factors, using meropenem as a 
comparator. Study drug is initiated in subjects with documented nosocomial pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_6907]-negative bacteria. 
Subjects meeting eligibility criteria and a ssessed by [CONTACT_152932] 7 to 
14 days of intravenous treatment in the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_152916] (1:1) to either 
cefiderocol, 2 g, administered intravenous ly over 3 hours, every 8 hours (q8h) or 
meropenem, [ADDRESS_176165] nously over 3 hours q8h. Linezolid will be 
administered to subjects in both arms to provide coverage for methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and to maintain the study blind and, in the cefiderocol 
arm, to provide coverage for Gram-positive bacteria. 
The study design and study events table are shown in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2, 
respectively. 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES 
3.1 Primary Objective(s) 
The primary objective  of this study is:

4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Study Blinding and Randomization 
This is a double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, active-controlled study in 
approximately 300 subjects with documented nosocomial pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_6907]-
negative bacteria. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria and assessed by [CONTACT_152933] 7 to 14 days of intravenous treatmen t in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152916] (1:1) to 
either cefiderocol, 2 g, administered intravenously over 3 hours, q8h or meropenem, 2 g, administered intravenously over 3 hours, q8h. Li nezolid will be administered to subjects 
in both arms to provide coverage for MRSA and to maintain the study blind and, in the 
cefiderocol arm, to provide coverage for Gram-positive bacteria. 
The investigator, site personne l, the sponsor, and the sponsor’s designees involved in 
blinded monitoring, data management, or othe r aspects of the study will be blinded to 
treatment assignment. The site pharmacist or qualified designee who will prepare the 
                                                 
1 TOC is defined as End of Treatment (EOT) + 7 days (± 2 days). 
2 EA is defined as start of treatment + [ADDRESS_176166] day of study treatment.

Confidential Page 14 of 46 intravenous infusion solution will be unblinde d so that he/she may obtain the assigned 
drug and prepare the intravenous dosing solutions. The drug supply itself will not be 
blinded.  
Since this is a blinded study, cefiderocol will be prepared and administered within the 
same timeframe after preparation as merope nem. For comparability of the study drug and 
the comparator drug meropenem, the dosing solutions will be normal saline and dosed 
within the time limits established for meropenem. Linezolid will not require blinding. 
The treatments will be randomized to subjec t identification numbers by [CONTACT_152934] (IRT) provider in a 1:1 fa shion to cefiderocol or meropenem. The 
IRT will be used to assign subjects to id entification numbers for which treatment has 
already been randomly assigned. Randomiza tion will be performe d by [CONTACT_152935] (HABP, VABP, and HCABP) and 
APACHE II score ( ≤ 15 and ≥ 16) as allocation factors. 
In the event of cases where incorrect allocations factors for clinical diagnosis and 
APACHE II scores were used by [CONTACT_152936], for 
analysis purposes the as randomized values will be used for the primary and secondary 
efficacy analyses. For patient baseline characteristics summarie s as well as subgroup analysis the actual 
values of the stratification f actors APACHE II score and clini cal diagnosis will be used.   
4.2 Sample Size 
The study design and the primary objective are based on the hypothesis that cefiderocol is 
noninferior to meropenem for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia; this will be 
established based on a 12.5% noninferiority margin to exclude the possibility that 
cefiderocol is more than 12.5% inferior to meropenem for the endpoint of all-cause 
mortality at Day 14. The 12.5% noninferiority margin for a limited use indication was 
discussed with and agreed to by [CONTACT_152937], Division of Anti-
Infective Products at a Type C meeti ng on October 13, 2015 and again with a 
communication dated April 25, 2016.  
A sample size of 244 evaluable subjects (122 evaluable subjects in the cefiderocol group 
and 122 evaluable subjects in the meropenem group) is required to have 90% power with 
a 1-sided significance level of 0.025, assuming a 10% all-cause mortality rate at Day 14 
in both groups with a 12.5% noninferiority margin. It is further estimated that approximately 20% of randomized subjects w ill be non-evaluable and therefore excluded 
from the primary population because they have  not received any doses of a study drug 
treatment or they had a bacterial pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_152938]/or Gram-positive aerobic bacteria only. Therefore, it is expected that it will be necessary to randomize up to [ADDRESS_176167]

5. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
5.1 Intention-to-treat Population 
The Intent-to-treat (ITT) population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at 
least 1 dose of a study drug trea tment. This population will be analyzed according to the 
treatment the subjects were randomized to, regardless of treatment the subjects actually 
received.  
5.2 Modified Inten t-to-treat Population 
The Modified ITT (mITT) population is define d as all subjects in  the ITT population who 
meet either of the following: 
 Those who have evidence of a Gram-nega tive infection of the lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_152917] a culture, Gram stain, or other diagnostic test. 
 Those who have evidence of a lower resp iratory tract infection, but culture or 
other diagnostic tests do not provi de a microbiologi cal diagnosis. 
Note: Subjects with a bacterial pneumonia caused by [CONTACT_6907]-positive aerobic or anaerobic (Gram-positive or Gram-negative) bacteria only will be excluded from the mITT Population. 
This population will be analyzed according to the treatment the subjects were randomized 
to, regardless of treatment the subjects actually received. 
The primary population for efficacy an alysis will be mITT Population.  
5.[ADDRESS_176168] 1 dose of 
the study treatment (ITT population). The popula tion will be analyzed according to the 
treatment that the subjects actually received, rather than  the treatment to which the 
subjects were randomized. If a wrong treatm ent is given and later corrected to the 
appropriate randomized treatment upon discove ry of the error, the subject will be 
classified into the corrected treatment group. This population will be used in all safety 
analyses. 
5.4 Micro-evaluable Per-protocol Population 
The Micro-evaluable Per-protoc ol (ME-PP) population is defi ned as all subjects in mITT 
population who do not have major protocol vi olations and have a culture confirmed 
diagnosis of a Gram-negative bacterium. These deviations will be determined prior to 
unblinding of the study.

Confidential Page 16 of 46 5.5 Pharmacokinetic Concentration Population 
The Pharmacokinetic (PK) Concentration population includes all subjects who undergo 
plasma sampling and have at least 1 eval uable PK assay result for cefiderocol.  
This population will be used for the concentr ation listing, plotting of the concentration-
time data, population PK analyses, PK/PD an alyses, and the concentration summary.

AND HANDLINGS 
6.[ADDRESS_176169] deviation (SD), median, minimum, 
and maximum values as summary statistics; ca tegorical variables wi ll be summarized by 
[CONTACT_152939].   
Subject study data, including data not appearing in tables, will be presented in by-subject 
data listings. In general, all tables and associated graphics will be presented by [CONTACT_6490]. Individual subject data, PK data and any derived data will be presented by [CONTACT_68592]. 
All analyses will be performed using SAS Ve rsion 9.2 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC, [LOCATION_003]). 
6.2 Statistical Testing a nd Multiplicity Strategy 
Statistical testing will be pe rformed at the 2-sided significan ce level of 0.05 unless stated 
otherwise. A fixed-sequence approach will be applied for multiplicity adjustment with the 
primary and key secondary efficacy analyses : the primary noninferiority hypothesis will 
be tested first, and if satisfied, then move to (1) microbiological outcome at TOC, and 
then (2) the clinical outcome at TOC and (3) Day 14 all-cause mortality rates of S-
649266 with meropenem for superiority of cefiderocol 
6.3 Analysis Visit Windows 
For analysis datasets no reco rds after End of Study visit will be used for TLF purposes. 
Measurements for efficacy or safety endpoints will be performed according to the visit schedule and the procedures of the study as shown in Appendix 1. The following analysis 
windows ( Table 6-1 ) will be used for analysis at a part icular time point to be included in 
by-time-point summary statistics for the specif ied variables. Day [ADDRESS_176170] value will be used. Also, if 2 visits 

S-649266: Study 1615R2132  Shionogi Inc. 
Statistical Analysis Plan [ADDRESS_176171] value will be used. Also, if the differences between the observed time point and scheduled time point are the same among values, the earlier will be used. 
Measurements that are taken outside the visit window will be considered missing for 
analysis and will not be imputed.

These subjects would not be included in the numerator or denominato r in the calculation 
of all-cause mortality rate during treatment and the follow-up period (until EOS). If dates are missing or partial the following strategies will be employed. Adverse events 
that started on or after the first dose of the study drug and up to “End of Study” are 
defined as treatment-emergent. For the start date of each AE , the date will be confirmed and recorded and no imputation 
will be performed.  For classification of prior and concomitant  medications, if the medication cannot be 
classified into concomitant medications or pr ior medications due to a partial missing date, 
the rules below will be applied for the classification. For start date, 
If the year and month are observed but the day is missing, the first day of the

6.5 Definition 
6.5.1 Study Day 
Study Day is defined as the re lative day of the observation starting with the reference 
date as Day 1. Study Day 1 will refer to the date of initial dose of the study drug. In 
addition, dates prior to the reference date are decremented by 1, with the date preceding 
Day 1 designated as Study Day -1 (there is no Study Day 0).

all of them are considered as baseline pathogens 
The appropriate clinical specimen type is  sputum, tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) fluid, protected specimen brus h, pleural fluid, or lung biopsy. Specimen 
that was collected from other site may be considered as appropriate specimen. This will be determined by [CONTACT_7195].   
For the other efficacy and safety endpoints, ba seline is defined as the last measurement 
obtained prior to receipt of the first infusion of study drug. 
Eligibility of subjects into mITT analysis popul ation will be based on local lab results of 
baseline pathogens if the micr obiological culture results are not sent to central lab for 
confirmation or if central  lab results are missing. 
6.6 Handling of Microbiologic Data 
If a pathogen is identified fr om local laboratory data but it is not sent to central 
laboratory, the name [CONTACT_152966] [CONTACT_152940]. In this case, 
MIC will be treated as unknown. 
If a pathogen name [CONTACT_152967], the name [CONTACT_152968] . However, if the sample sent to IHMA was

8.3 Prior and Concomitant Medication 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary (September 2016). 
Prior medications are defined as medications that were taken prior to randomization for 
the study. During blinded review of the da ta it was found that a few subjects had 
randomization date different from first dos e of study medication. Hence for purpose of 
analysis prior medications are defined as medicat ions that were taken before the first dose 
date and time of th e study medication. 
Concomitant medications are defined as medicati ons that were taken on or after first dose 
date and time of study medication. The number and percentage of subjects taki ng prior antibiotic medications will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_152945] (A TC) and preferred term for each treatment 
group and in total for the Safety populati on and the mITT population. Although a subject 
may have taken two or more medications, th e subject is counted only once within an 
ATC classification. The same subject may contribute to two or more preferred terms in 
the same classification. Concomitant antibiotic medications, concomitant non-antibiotic medications, and prior non-antibiotic medications will be summarized in the same manner.  
All prior and concomitant medications will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].

9.1.1 Primary Analysis 
The study hypothesis to demons trate noninferiority (NI marg in of 12.5%) of cefiderocol 
to meropenem on all-cause mortality (ACM) at Day 14 can be written as follows: 
Null hypothesis        H 0:  π1 - π2 > 12.5% 
Alternative hypothesis   H1:  π 1 - π2 ≤ 12.5% 
where π1 is the ACM rate for cefiderocol and π2 is the ACM rate on meropenem. 
All-cause mortality rate at Day 14 by [CONTACT_152946] 14. The 
adjusted estimates of the difference in the all-cause mortality at Day 14 between 
cefiderocol and meropenem will be presented along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)

score (≤ 15 and ≥ 16) as the stratified factor.  Si nce we expect only a limited number of 
events based on our assumption of 10% morta lity in both treatment groups we are likely 
to see sparse data including zeros in cert ain [ADDRESS_176187] mortality well [ 1,2,3].  Noninferiority can be 
concluded if the upper bound of a 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in mortality at Day 
14 between the 2 treatment groups (cefiderocol – meropenem) is smaller than a noninferiority margin of 12.5%. The associated  2 sided p-value for non-inferiority testing 
will also be calculated. The all-cause mortality  at Day 14 will also be analyzed in ITT 
and ME-PP populations similarly.  
Superiority of cefiderocol over meropenem for the day 14 all-cause mortality endpoint 
can be concluded if the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in Day 14 all-cause mortality 
between the two treatment gr oups (cefiderocol and merope nem) lies completely below 
zero. The associated 2 sided p-value for supe riority testing will also be calculated.

and stratum j, respectively, where i = 1, 2 represents the treatment arm (cefiderocol vs. 
meropenem) and j = 1, 2  represents the stratum based on the  stratification factor: acute

Confidential Page 31 of 46 The clinical outcome at FU will be assessed by [CONTACT_152954]: 
 Sustained Clinical Cure:  Continued resolution or s ubstantial improvement of 
baseline signs and symptoms of pneumonia,  such that no antibacterial therapy has 
been required for the treatment of pneu monia in a subject assessed as cured at 
TOC.  
 Relapse:  Recurrence of signs and/or symptoms  of pneumonia, appearance of new 
signs and/or symptoms of pneumonia, or  new chest radiographic evidence of 
pneumonia in a subject assessed as cured at TOC.  
 Clinical Failure:  Clinical failure at TOC will be carried forward regardless of 
lost to follow-up. 
 Indeterminate : Lost to follow-up, such that a de termination of clinical sustained 
cure/relapse cannot be made, or subject received additional antibacterial therapy 
for the treatment of th e current infection.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Clinical Outcome per Subject at Early Assessment, End of 
Treatment and Test of Cure 
The clinical response rate at Early Assessmen t, End of Treatment and Test of Cure will 
be calculated as the proporti on of subjects who have a clinical outcome of cure. The 
adjusted estimate of the difference in the cure  rate between the 2 treatment groups will be 
presented along with the adjusted 95% CIs based on the CMH wei ghts: diagnosis and 
APACHE II score. In addition, the number and proportion of subjects having clinical 
outcome as failure and indeterminate will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Clinical Outcome per Subject at Follow-up 
The cure rate at FU will be calculated as th e proportion of subjects with clinical outcome 
of sustained clinical cure . In addition, the number and proportion of subjects having 
clinical outcome as relapse, clinical failure and indeterminate will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The same analysis method as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] above for clinical outcome per 
subject at EA, EOT and TOC will be performed for the clinical outcome per subject FU. 
The outcome will be tabulated for each treatment group. The adjusted estimate of the difference in the response rate between the 2 treatments arms along with the adjusted

All-cause mortality rate during treatment and follow-up period (until EOS) will be 
calculated as the proportion of  patients who experienced mortality regardless of the cause 
at or before EOS since the first infusion. If  a subject discontinues from the study before 
this period and survival information was not av ailable, then the survival status for this 
endpoint for the subject will be unknown.

Analyses of all-cause mortality during treatment and follow-up period (until EOS) will 
also be presented for the subgroup associated wi th the timing of last dose to death: 0 day 
(on the same day as last dose) , 1-[ADDRESS_176202] dose of study treatment, 8 – [ADDRESS_176203] dose of study  treatment and >= [ADDRESS_176204] dose of study treatment. The 
time will be calculated as death day – last dose of study drug day. 
The estimates of the difference in the all-cau se mortality rates between cefiderocol and

product. Where symptoms or signs form part  of a diagnosis, the diagnosis should be 
reported as AE instead of the individual symptoms and signs. 
Adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent through EOS for 
randomized subjects. Adverse events will be  classified by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC)

emergent. An overview of AEs will be provide d that summarizes subject incidence and 
the number of AEs, treatment-related AEs, SA Es, treatment-related SAEs, death due to 
AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, and treatment-related AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug. The incidence proportion of treatment-emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) will be calculated by [CONTACT_12922]. The incidence proportion will be 
calculated as the proport ion of subjects experiencing TEAEs to total subjects in the safety 
population. Difference in the incidence propor tion between cefiderocol and meropenem, 
and its 95% CI will be calculated using Wilson (score) method. Deaths due to AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leadi ng to discontinuation of study drug, treatment 
related AEs, treatment related SAEs, and treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will be  analyzed in a similar way. 
The number and percentage of subjects with  AEs will be summarized for each treatment 
group by [CONTACT_3592]. Subjects with more than 1 AE in the same SOC will be counted once for the SOC. Similarly, s ubjects with more than 1 AE in the same PT will be 
counted once for the PT. Difference in the in cidence proportions betw een cefiderocol and 
meropenem, and its 95% CI will be calculated using the Wilson’s (score) method. Treatment-related AEs, SAEs, treatment-relate d SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of 
the study drug will be summarized in the same manner.  
Summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_152956]. For th e summary of AEs by [CONTACT_764], 
missing severity will be assumed as “sever e.” For these summaries, subjects with 
multiple AEs will be counted only once by [CONTACT_152957]. All AEs including AEs not considered treatment-emergent, which have occurred before 
or after the first dose of the study drug, will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].

a If screening and randomization (Day 1) occur on the same day, the activities of screen ing and Day 1 should be completed, withou t duplication of assessments. 
b Additional assessment will be conducted on Day 14, if treatment dura tion is extended beyond 14 days to up to 21 days; survival will be recorded on Day [ADDRESS_176222] udy treatment; EOT can be any time after the subject had at least 1 dose of study tr eatment, duplication of assessments for a given 
day and EOT is not necessary. 
d Include a review of prio r/concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
e A complete physical examination, including measurement of body weight and height, will be performed at screening only. 
f A limited physical examination relevant to the subject’s current condition will be performed. 
g If EOS evaluation is by [CONTACT_648], physical examination, la boratory tests, and vital signs will not be performed.

Statistical Analysis Plan [ADDRESS_176223] radiographs will be performed if clinically indicated. Applicable only to [LOCATION_013] due to local requirements: In sites whe re chest radiographs after screening are part of 
the standard of care, ie, a ches t radiograph is clinically indicated by [CONTACT_152964], it can be  performed as usual w ithout a special informed consent. If a chest 
radiograph is not standard of care (no clinical indication), and is planned based on the study protocol, an informed consent fr om a conscious patient is mandatory. Chest 
radiographs without c linical indication cannot be perfo rmed in unconscious patients. 
i Most recent chest radiograph is used for the CPIS calculation. 
j Urine or serum pregnancy test only for females w ho are not postmenopausal or  surgically sterile. 
k The CrCl (the Cockcroft-Gault equation) and eGFR (the MDRD equa tion) will be calculated from th e serum creatini ne. For subjects  with eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
CrCl ≥ 120 mL/min at baseline and EA, urine samples will be collected a time interval as short as 2 hours or up to 8 hours. 
l Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic pressures), body temperature, pulse rate, and resp iratory rate. Once a day during screening,  and [ADDRESS_176224] respi[INVESTIGATOR_152925] (eg, ask subjects to cough, cough up sputum, or  conduct suction from endotracheal tube). 
o Two blood samples from separate venipunctures will be collected w ithin [ADDRESS_176225] culture is positive. 
p PK blood samples will be drawn on Day 3 or Da y 4 of study drug treatment;[ADDRESS_176226] pr ior to the infusion of the dose, 1 hour after start of infusion, before the end of 
infusion, and at 1 hour after the end of infusion. Subjects with  nonstable renal function resulting in a dosage adjustment afte r EA will undergo another blood PK sampling 24 
to 72 hours after their dosing adjustment. If  possible, a single blood draw should be performed as soon as possible (within [ADDRESS_176227] dose) in the case of premature EOT, 
which is defined as receiving < [ADDRESS_176228] udy. Mortality at Days 14 and 28 are study endpoint

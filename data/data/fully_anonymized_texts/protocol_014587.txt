Research Plan . Study Design/ Overview.   (See Figure 1: Flow Diagram, Appendix)  
Specific Aim 1:   To evaluate the compliance and tolerability of soy bread in patients with 
chronic pancreatitis enrolled in a Phase I dose escalation clinical trial.   A single group, open -
labeled dose escalation study  of soy bread intervention will be conducted in patients  with chronic 
pancreatitis . We hypothesize that the soy bread formulation will be well -tolerated with high 
compliance in CP patients.  This study will be guided by [CONTACT_49944].  The use of bread as a food -based delivery vehicle 
is advantageous as compared to administration of a supplement as it provides the opportunity for 
delivery of multiple complex bioactive agents in an appropriate matrix . This is the first study 
designed to d etermine the Grade 1 and 2 toxicities, (Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLTs ), compliance 
and tolerability of soy bread in human chronic pancreatitis. Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose 
(MTD ) or target dose is reached, 10 subjects will undergo a 4 week verification  study  [Section b, 
below] to confirm tolerance and safety .  Overall, this small clinical trial will provide the necessary 
clinical data required to move this intervention forward in the setting of a future placebo controlled 
trial for patients with CP.  In addition, it will provide us with valuable biologic mater ial to assess 
changes in inflammatory biomarkers relevant to CP and to facilitate future study of individual 
differences in soy isoflavone metabolism within this patient population.  
a. Dose Escalation Phase . (n=15 -25 CP subjects)   This dose escalation stud y of soy isoflavones 
will enroll chronic pancreatitis patients from a single academic medical center in Columbus, Ohio.  
All participants will be informed about the study and potential risks and required to provide written 
informed consent prior to undergo ing study -related pr ocedures.  Here a traditional 3+3 design will 
be used to determine the compliance, tolerability and dose limiting toxicities in this unique patient 
population. [Table 1: Dose Escalation; Appendix] Dose escalation with soy bread will be continued 
until dose -limiting toxici ties are observ ed in > 33% of the participants or the daily target dose of 4 
slices of bread [132 mg soy isoflavone] is reached.   [Table 2: Toxicity Grades; see Appendix] .   
Subject Enrollment . Succe ssive cohorts of patients (3 patients  / cohort) will b e started on a fixed 
dose of 33 mg isoflavones  (IF) for this study [1 slice  of soy bread; 33 mg isoflavones/ 85 gram  
slice] for 1 week .  CP patients will be accrued in cohorts of 3 and dose escalation will be increased 
by 1 slice of bread in each successive cohort based on a modified Fibonacci  sequen ce:  50% [2 
slices; 66 mg  IF], 33%  [3 slices; 99 mg  IF], 25%  [4 slices; 132 mg  IF] in which dose increments 
become gradual ly lowered until the target of 4  slices of bread or a MTD is determined.  Subjects 
will be enrolled in the study for 7 days and will be seen in the clinic on Day 0 and Day 7.  After 
enrollment  (Day 0)  subjects will start a legume free diet through the completion of their enrollment 
(Day 7).   
An estimated 15 -25 CP patients will be needed for this initial dose escalation phase.  
 
Monitoring.  Subjects wil l be monitored for toxicities defined based on type(s), grade(s) and 
duration (s) of symp toms  using a daily diary that will be reviewed by [CONTACT_49945].  Toxicities will be graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 3.0 
(CTC 3.0).  If the CTC 3.0 did not apply to an adverse event, it will be graded as mild, moderate 
or severe.  DLT will be defined as any CTC 3.0 Grade 3 or 4 adverse event determined to be 
related to the soy bread . Our prior experience in prostate cancer patients indicates Grade 1 -2 GI 
discomfort as primary adverse events following bread consumption.  
Dietary Soy Isoflavones in Chronic Pancreatitis      
If no DLTs are observed for 1 week  after administration of soy bread, a new cohort will be enrolled 
at the next planned dose level.  If DLTs are observed in one participant in the cohort, another 
three participants will be tr eated with the same dose level.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
will be defined as one dose level below the dose in which DLTs were observed in >33% of the 
participants  who are at least 80% adherent to the soy bread intervention, as evidenced by [CONTACT_49946] .  In other words if DLTs are observed  in a least [ADDRESS_52342]  a urine sample starting at 24 hours prior to Day 7 (Day 
6) and ending with the urine collected the morning o f their Day [ADDRESS_52343]’s enroll ment via 
a booklet and maintained in a secure case report form.  
 
Dietary compliance : Adherence to the soy bread diet and  legume restriction will be mea sured 
using daily diary entries (see DEG phase I SMc Appendix)  as well as a count of empty packets 
return ed. Additionally, isoflavone s in th e urine will be used to verify  the subject’s self -reported 
compliance. A detailed list of foods to avoid for the legume restricted (peas, beans, soy, sprouts, 
and foods made with these items as well as peanut butter limit ed to 1 tablespoon/week) diet will 
be provided. We have developed a checklist of the most common food sources of isoflavone -rich 
foods based on the USDA Isoflavone Database (release 2.0, September 2008 ) which will be 
included in the daily dairy. Subjects will be instructed on the proper storage, handling, and 
consumptio n of the soy bread slices (see Soy Bread Instruction  Appendix ).  
 
Three day diet record : Subjects  will be instructed by [CONTACT_49947] d quantities and record all foods and beverages 
consumed for three days during a given week. The three days will be assigned by [CONTACT_20234] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_49941]). Each participant will be provided 
with an instruction bookle t (see DEG phase I SMc Appendix) and examples of data collection.  
When subjects return for their visit, the study coordinator will review the three day diet record 
with the participant to ensure thoroughness and resolve any ambiguities.   Subjects enrolled  in 
this group will complete this one time over 3 days during their enrollment.  The dietary records 
will be used to assess compliance to the legume restricted diet and analyzed using the Nutrition 
Data System for Research (NDS -R; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN).   
 
Soy bread tolerability and consumer acceptance: Soy bread tolerability and consumer 
acceptance will be measured using the sensory evaluation questionnaire and visual analogue 
scale to determine satiety.  This will be completed at least once a day.

b. MTD Verification Phase  (n= up to 10). After the Ph ase I study has been completed, an 
additional [ADDRESS_52344] Enrollment: Subject enrollment will begin [ADDRESS_52345] two weeks of enrollment 
subjects will undergo a legume -free washout period and will be asked to refrain from eating 
legumes during this time.  Subjects will con tinue the legume free diet until they complete the study 
(total of 6 weeks).   Subjects enrolled in this phase will be asked to stop any multivitamins that 
they are taking and all will be asked to start a multivitamin with a mineral supplement (MVI) each 
day.  This multivitamin with mineral supplement will be provided to the subjects enrolled in this 
phase for consistency.  
  
Data Collection: Data and bio -specimen collection will be obtained at enrollment, when they start 
eating the soy bread and then weekly  through the end of the study .  Subjects will be seen in clinic 
at enrollment (Day -14), when they start eating the soy bread (Day 0), Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, 
and at the end of the study on Week 4.  A p hysical exam  and vital signs will be completed at each  
of these visits.  A blood draw for complete blood c ount with differential , cytokines testing, 
comprehensive metabolic profile  will be completed at Day [ADDRESS_52346] study visit (Week 4 visit) and ending 
with the urine collected the morning of the Week 4 visit. Urine isoflavones and their metabolites 
will be analyzed wi th this urine collection.  
 
Dietary adherence : Adherence and tolerability to the soy bread diet and  legume restriction will 
be measured using daily diary entries, sensory evaluation questionnaire, and visual analogue 
scale measuring the subject’s satiety (see MTD Phase II SMc Appendix)  as well as count of empty 
packets returned . Additionally, i soflavon es and th eir metabolites  in the urine will be used to verify  
the subject’s self -reported adherence . A detailed list of foods to avoid for the legume restricted 
(peas, beans, soy, sprouts, and foods made with these items as well as peanut butter limited to 
1 tablesp oon/week) diet will be provided. We have developed a checklist of the most common 
food sources of isoflavone -rich foods based on the USDA Isoflavone Database (release 2.0, 
September 2008 ) which will be included in the daily dairy , Appendix . Subjects will be instructed 
on the proper storage, handling, and consumption of the soy bread slices, Appendix.  
 
Three day diet record Subjects  will be instructed by [CONTACT_49948] a given week. The three days will be integrated into the 
booklets  (see MTD Phase II SMc Appendix)  provided . Each par ticipant will be given  written  
instruction s and examples of diet record data c ollection.  When subjects return for their visit, the 
study coordinator will review the three day diet record with the participant to ensure 
thoroughness and resolve any ambiguities.   Two 3 day diet records will be administered in the 
MTD phase, once betwe en enrollment (Day -14) and Day 0 and once between Week 3 and 
Week 4. The dietary records will be used to assess compliance to the legume restricted diet and 
analyzed  using the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS -R; University of Minnesota, 
Minneapolis, MN).   
 
Dietary Soy Isoflavones in Chronic Pancreatitis      
Soy bread tolerability and consumer acceptance: Soy bread tolerability and consumer 
acceptance will be measured using the sensory evaluation questionnaire an d visual analogue 
scale to determine satiety.  This will be completed at least once a day while subjects are eating 
the bread.   
 
Sensory testing of soy breads will be used to assess the acceptance and physical 
characteristics of the soy bread and will be conducted during the first day of soy bread 
consumption . The information gained will be used to assess the effects of soy bread consumer 
acceptance (liking) to soy bread . In our previous studies, acceptance of the soy bread was 
excellent surrogate measures  of adherence. Overall acceptance of the soy bread will be 
conducted using a nine point hedonic scale (1=dislike extremely to 9=like extremely) whereas a 
five point Just About Right (JAR) scale (1=much too little to 5=much too much) will be used to 
optimiz e the soy bread formulation  for future trials with this cohort , Appendix . Descriptive 
analysis will be used to characterize the organoleptic qualities (saltiness, sweetness, beaniness, 
hardness, and br own color) of the soy bread . A horizontal line scale (6  inch) ranging from [ADDRESS_52347] clinic appointment (week 4)  
general consumer questions regarding the soy bread  will be collected . 
 
The satiety scale will determine the subjects hunger levels after they eat the bread.  Measures 
of satiety (perceived fullness or lack of hunger) will be conducted using visual analogue scale 
(VAS) adapted from Hill and Blundell (1983 )[ADDRESS_52348] of satiety 
on soy bread compliance. Subjects will be asked to rate their satiety (hunger, fullness, 
satisfaction, and thoughts of food) as well rate their nausea, thirst, and energy. VAS will be 
completed prior to the first slice of soy bread consumed and immediately after bread 
consumption , [ADDRESS_52349] the absorption and metabolism 
of isoflavones within and among individuals  and over time their biological activity44. Therefore a 
standardized vitamin will be provided to participants in the MTD phase of the study as  well daily 
activity and daily exposure to smoking will be monitored .  
  
 
Specific Aim 2:   To determine the effect of soy bread intervention on pro -inflammatory 
cytokine expression in serum and urine  from patients with chronic pancreatitis. Cytokine 
and lipid biomarkers relevant to inflammation will be assessed at baseline and following soy bread 
intervention in patient s’ serum and urine . We hypothesize that dietary soy will be associated with 
reduced levels of key pro -inflammatory cytokines that drive t he pathogenesis of CP including IL -6, 
CRP , IL-1β and TNF -α, among others  
Blood  sampling .  At enrollment,  patients  will present for a blood  draw  at the Outpatient  Clinic.  In 
addition  to standard -of-care blood  work  ordered  by [CONTACT_099],  a phlebotomist  will collect 
another  30 ml (1 ounce)  into sodium -heparin  Vacutainer  tubes (Fish er) and a clean catch urine 
sample for our study. Blood  and urine will be immediately  processed, and  stored  at -80°C  for 
analyses.  The same  procedure  will be used on  1 subsequent visit  at the end of study , for a total 
Dietary Soy Isoflavones in Chronic Pancreatitis      
of two blood draws to monitor changes in cytokine profile over time.  Cytokine biomarkers will be 
assessed at [1] Baseline  and [ 2] upon completion of the study.   
Immune Biomarkers. Studies investigating the  effect of dietary soy on immune parameters in 
patients with CP are non -existent. This trial will fill a critical gap in understanding how dietary soy 
affects key biomarkers of inflammation in CP patients. Blood from patients will be processed via 
centrifu gation with ficoll -paque. Our primary objective will be to assess the change in three pro -
inflammatory cytokines (IL -6, CRP, IL-1β) known to be important in the pathogenesis of 
pancreatitis  via a Luminex -based assay (Affymetrix). However, our high -throughp ut analytical 
platform will allow for an assessment of other  factors  that regulate inflammatory processes 
including: [1] inflammatory cell mobilization expansion: G -CSF, GM -CSF;  [2] inflammatory cell 
trafficking: IP -10, MCP -1, M-CSF, MIG, RANTES, SDF -1; [3] Th1 -type CD4+ T cell responses: 
IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α;  [4] Th2 or Th17 -type CD4+ T cell responses: IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL -17; [5] 
Other measureable factors relevant to inflammation as they relate to pancreatic carcinogenesis: 
IL-11, IL -13, TGFβ, PGE 2, HMGB1.  Sufficient volume of samples will also be available for 
validation by a second method in the event interesting trends are observed (i.e. ELISA).  All 
samples will be analyzed in a batched manner to assess changes across the four individual time 
points per each patient. These data will provide  us with a comprehensive  understanding of how  
dietary soy alters the expression of  soluble factors  implicated in inflammatory processes.  
Lipid Biomarkers  Pro-inflammatory markers from adipose (adiponectin, lepti n, and resistin) and 
lipid metabolism (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL) will be collected  for subjects enrolled 
in the MTD group at enrollment (Day 0) and at the end of study visit (Week 4) , as they are related 
to pancreatitis and soy exposure .  This will be obtained from blood collected after a [ADDRESS_52350] . 
One serum separator (10 mL) will be collected for these analyses. Serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (total cholesterol, 
HDL, LDL, triglycerides, adipokines, and leptin) will be batch analyzed by [CONTACT_49949] 1000 (Siemens 
Medical Diagnostics, Decatur, GA.).    
 
Conclusion . We have assembled a multi -disciplinary research team  to assess compliance, 
toxicity and chan ges in pro -inflam matory cytokine expression from  a soy based dietary bread 
product using a classic 3+[ADDRESS_52351] s the pathobiology  of this debilitating illness .

Table 2:  Definition of Toxicity Grades  
 
a. Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) – Appearance of side effects during treatment that are 
severe enough to prevent further increase in dosage or strength of treatment agent, or to 
prevent continuation of treatment at any dosage level.   
b. Grade – a numeric scale used to rate the severity of toxicity  associated with a treatment. 
Each side effect is separately rated from "0" to "4." "0" = side effect not present. "1"= present but 
minor. "2"=present,  moderate effect. "3"= present, with significant effect. "4" = potentially life

Appendix  A 
Inclusion  criteria  
1. Diagnosis  of chronic  pancreatitis  by [CONTACT_49950]  (i.e., a or b or c):  
a. Presence  of pancreatic  calcifications  - Pancreatic  parenchymal  or 
ductal  calcifications  (≥1) seen  on abdominal  imaging study  
b. Suggestive  for chronic  pancreatitis – fulfillment  of any of the following 
3 criteria  (i.e., i or ii or iii): 
i. EUS demonstrating lobular appearing pancreas  (≥3 
continuous  lobules) and  ≥3 minor  EUS criteria  
1. Minor EUS  criteria  (aka Rosemont  criteria) include:  lobular  
appearing pancreas  (1-2 lobules),  hyperechoic  foci without  
shadowing,  cysts,  hyperechoic  stranding,  irregular main  
pancreatic  duct contour,  dilated side branches,  main  
pancreatic  duct dilation,  or hyperechoic  main pancreatic  duct 
walls  
ii. EUS demonstrating ≥ 5 minor EUS criteria  
iii. Presence  of ≥ [ADDRESS_52363] side branches  visualized  
on MRCP  or ERCP  (derived from  Cambridge  criteria for mild 
chronic  pancreatitis)  
c. Indeterminate EUS  findings  for chronic  pancreatitis  with evidence  
of exocrine  pancreatic  insufficiency  (EPI) (i.e., i + [ii or iii or iv or v]) 
i. Presence  of 3-4 minor  EUS criteria  (listed above)  
ii. Abnormal  fecal  fat collection  (>15g  fat per day) 
iii. Abnormal  endoscopic  pancreas  function  test (i.e., maximum 
duodenal  bicarbonate concentration  <80 meq/L)  
iv. Decreased serum  trypsin  (<20 ng/mL)  
v. Decreased  fecal elastase  level (<200  microgram/gram stool)  
2. Age ≥18 years  
 
Exclusion  criteria  
1. Inability  to provide  written  consent  
2. Inability  to comply  with the study  protocol  
3. Soy allergy  
4. Pancreatic  cancer  
5. History  of prior pancreatic  surgery  (this does  not include endoscopic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014])  
6. Comorbid diseases  characterized  by a chronic  inflammatory  state,  including,  but 
not limited  to rheumatologic  diseases,  chronic  kidney  disease,  extra -pancreatic  
malignancy  (these conditions  would  confound the measurement  of inflammatory  
mediators)  
7. Pregnancy  (based on verbal  history  alone;  the study  intervention  does  not have  
known  harmful  effects  to a mother  or fetus,  and therefore,  pre-study  pregnancy  
testing will not be  mandated).

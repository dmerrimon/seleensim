The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of two 
concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (A-101) solution (32.5% and 40%) when applied to 
individual seborrheic keratosis (SK) lesions (target lesions) on the face compared with a 
matching A-[ADDRESS_1076516] one target lesion on the face. 
 
A fu
rther objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two concentrations of A-101 
solution and its matching vehicle when applied to SK target lesions on the face. 
 
Methodolo
gy/Study Design: 
During this study, the investigator will identify [ADDRESS_1076517] ’s face. The target lesion will be treated a maximum of two times.  
 
Approx
imately [ADDRESS_1076518]
udy medication application, a visit 21 days later for an optional retreatment study 
medication application and an 84-day no treatment follow-up period. The final study 
visit
 (Visit 8) has a maximum allowable visit window of 4 days. Study visits are: 
 Visit 1  (Day -13 to 0) enrollment, start screening period 
 Visit 2  (Day 1) randomization; study medication application 
 Visit 3 (Day 8) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 4  (Day 22 ) follow-up visit where target lesions that meet the retreatment 
crit
eria will receive a second study medication application 
 Visit 5  (Day 29 ) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 6  (Day 50) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 7  (Day 78) no treatment follow- up 
 Visit 8  (Day 106 ) no treatment follow- up; end of study.

ation applications. 
 
At Visit 4, any target lesion that meets the retreatment criteria will receive a second 
s
tu
dy medication application (Section 5.7.6 ).  
 
Each subject will have the same study medication applied up to 2 times to the target 
lesion.  
 
Durati
on of Treatment: 
The planned treatment and study duration are: 
 Enrollment period: approximately 42 days 
 Subject participation period: up to 124 days 
 Study duration (first subject first visit through last subject last visit): 
approximately 166 days.   
 
Evaluations – Effectiveness: 
The 
investigator will evaluate the average overall severity of each subject’s SK target 
lesion using the Physician’s Lesion Assessment (PLA) and the subject will evaluate the 
target lesion using the Subject’s Self -Assessment (SSA). The investigator will measure 
the SK target lesion ’s Lesion Dimensions throughout the study. 
 
Evaluations – Safety: 
The 
investigator and subject, as indicated, will evaluate Local Skin Reactions (LSR) for 
the target lesion. In addition, clinical laboratory safety tests, vital sign readings, 
conc
omitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], urine pregnancy tests and adverse events (AEs) information will 
be asses
sed throughout the study. 
 
Evaluations – Other: 
St
andardized color photographs to document the status of the target lesion will be 
taken throughout the study at 1 selected investigational center. 
 
Statis
tical Methods: 
The primary effectiveness will consist of the mean change from baseline to Visit 8 PLA 
performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline PLA as the 
covariate.

2.1. Summary 
Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is one of the most common skin tumors in man. These benign 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_542799], increasing in 
prevalence with increasing age, and affect men and women roughly equally. While the 
growths may be solitary, they often occur in large numbers and typi[INVESTIGATOR_782803], elevated or “stuck -on” appearing papul es or plaques that may vary 
from flesh-colored, to shades of yellow, gray, brown, or black.  
 
Though benign, SK lesions are often cosmetically worrisome to patients, must 
sometimes be distinguished from other benign or malignant skin tumors and may 
become pruritic, irritated, bleed, and may be painful when traumatized particularly 
when located in areas prone to friction and trauma such as belt-lines and brassiere-strap 
lines.  
 
Patients often seek treatment of SK for cosmetic reasons, particularly if they are located 
in a highly visible (“cosmetically sensitive”) area such as the face, and especially if they 
are large, pi[INVESTIGATOR_49194], if multiple lesions are present, or simply because the lesions are 
commonly associated with “old age”. Removal may be medically in dicated, however, 
for lesions that become irritated, pruritic, inflamed, or painful, or for lesions that the 
clinician feels require histologic confirmation of the diagnosis. 
  
Numerous treatment options exist, and include a plethora of destructive/ablativ e 
modalities such as liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, lasers of various 
wavelengths (ablative and non-ablative), radio-frequency ablation, and surgical 
removal by [CONTACT_574144]. There is, however, a notable lack of well- 
controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy, complications and complication rates of 
these treatments. There is great variability among practitioners in the methods 
employed using each of these techniques ( e.g., variability in contact [CONTACT_782823]) with great variability of the results. None of 
these 
treatments is, in fact, approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for 
the treatment of seborrheic keratosis. While these methods can be effective, many 
require specialized training and /or the use of expensive equipment, they are painful 
and may require anesthesia and/or analgesia, and they are often complicated by 
[CONTACT_542821]. Both hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_542801], which 
may be transient, but are often permanent, are common, as is scarring at the treatment 
site, 
and the typi[INVESTIGATOR_17396]-surgical risks of bleeding and infection increase the risk that 
the result of the treatment of these lesions may be worse than the disease itself.

Date: 01-JUL-2014                                                                                                 Supersedes: 29- JUN-2014 Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is 
the simplest peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable 
household goods including chlorine-free bleaches, general-purpose cleaning products, 
and disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the oxidizing component in 
hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene products and tooth-whitening systems for 
many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater. In high 
concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to 
its 
use as an oral topi[INVESTIGATOR_160777], H 2O2 is widely employed at low 
concentrations ( e.g., 3%-6%) as a wound irrigant and topi[INVESTIGATOR_113380]/disinfectant, and 
has been
 in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by [CONTACT_160821] 
1858.  
 
H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects 
of reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by [CONTACT_46917] a complex 
antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, glutathione 
peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, lipoamine, lipid peroxidase 
and others, as well as non-enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and 
uric acid, tocopherol, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other water soluble 
groups.  The local application of supra-physiologic concentrations of H 2O2 may 
overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, allowing H 2O2 to act not only 
through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen species, 
and local lipid peroxidation, but also by [CONTACT_274294] O 2 that 
are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells. 
 
Data 
from a proof of concept study (A-101-SEBK-201) suggests that the topi[INVESTIGATOR_782804] A-101 Solution 40% and 32.5% to SK lesions has the potential to safely 
and effectively resolve SK lesions without the need for analgesia and/or anesthesia, and 
with a minimal risk of hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], or scarring. 
 
2.2. Study Rationale 
Clinical information from a previous study (A-101-SEBK-201) suggests that A-101 
So
lution 40% and 32.5% may safely and effectively resolve SK les ions on the back. A 
second currently ongoing study (A-101-SEBK-202) is evaluating the safety and efficacy 
of A
-101 Solution 40% and 32.5% to remove SK lesions on the trunk and extremities . 
The rationale for this study i s to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 concentrations of 
A-101 Solution ( i.e., 40% and 32.5 %) and it’s matching A-101 Solution Vehicle when 
applied to SK target lesions on the face. This study is designed to provide data to 
provide an understanding of the safety and efficacy of A-101 Solution for the removal of 
SK lesions on the face.

The main objective of this study is to evaluate the dose-response relationship of 2 
concentrations of A-101 Solution and its matching A-101 Solution Vehicle when applied 
to SK target lesions on the face. A further objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of 2 concentrations of A-101 Solution and its matching A-101 Solution Vehicle when 
applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_583077] 2 times to SK target lesions on the face.

o Position the subject in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_782816]. 
o Apply white petrolatum (100%) [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia (USP) along 
the orbital rim and at the medial and lateral canthi; gently stretch the 
periorbital skin between the thumb and forefinger at the time of 
petrolatum application to distend any periorbital rhytides ( e.g., “crow’s 
feet”) and ensure full coverage of the skin at the base of the rhytides to 
decrease the likelihood of tracking of the study medication towards the 
eye 
o Have the subject hold an absorbent pad in the appropriate area of the eye 
to absorb any excess study medication that might track away from the 
target lesion 
o Instruct the subject to keep both eyes closed during the entire study 
medication application procedure 
 After the subject is properly prepared and positioned, thoroughly cleanse the 
targ
et lesion by [CONTACT_160830] a cotton-tipped swab or absorbent wipe 
wett
ed with 70% isopropyl alcohol 
 Hold the study medication vial away from her/his face and from the subject’s 
face when opening and at all times 
 Using the supplied applicator: 
o Wet the applicator with a quantity of study medication sufficient to wet 
the target lesion with a thin film 
o Using firm pressure and an application technique that is appropriate for 
the target lesion size ( e.g., dab and roll the applicator on smaller lesions; 
rub 
using a circular motion on larger lesions) apply the study medication 
to the target lesion for approximately 20-30 seconds  
o Minimize exposure to the surrounding normal skin and sensitive areas; 
you may have the subject assist by [CONTACT_782829] ( e.g., clean 
absorbent wipe, clean paper towel, etc.) to prevent the study medication 
from migrating from the target lesion 
o During the application process remove excess study medication from the 
surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe 
o Ensure the target lesion is wet with study medication at the end of the 
20-30 seconds  
o Allow the target lesion to remain undisturbed for approximately 60 
seconds 
o After approximately 60 seconds repeat the application process 
o Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been 
applied to the target lesion 4 times.

[CONTACT_4490] a subject’s eye. Follow the instructions on the eyewash kit to cleanse both of the 
subject’s eyes. If you use the eyewash kit the  event must be reported as an adverse 
event of “eye irritation ” (Section 7.1.1 ). 
 
5.7.7. Dose compliance record 
At every study visit where a study medication application is performed, an 
investigational center staff member will document the study medication usage in the 
CRF. 
 
5.7.8. Dose modification 
Study medication applications will be performed at Visit 2, and if appropriate Visit 4, 
by t
he investigator or an investigational center staff member at the direction of the 
investigator. No study medication will be dispensed to the study subjects. 
 
If any 
subject refuses to allow the initial study medication treatment or a retreatment 
application, the investigator must report the visit number, visit date and the reason for 
the refusal on the subject’s Comments CRF page.  
 
If the 
subject’s refusal is associated with an AE, the investigator must report the event 
on the appropriate CRF (Section 7.2).   
 
Th
e subject must have the initial study medication application to the target lesion to 
remain in the study.  
 
The subject does not need to be removed from the study based solely on her/his refusal 
to have a study medication retreatment application on the target lesion.

Before breaking the blind the investigator should determine that the information is 
necessary (i.e. , that it will alter the subject’s immediate course of treatment). In many 
cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study medication-related, the 
problem may be effectively managed by [CONTACT_782830]-blinding.  
 
If deemed necessary to break the blind for a study subject, attempt to contact [CONTACT_782831], Inc. Medical Monitor (protocol page 1 and Section 7.2.2 ) to obtain 
concurrence. If it is not possible to contact [CONTACT_118233], contact 
[CONTACT_39420]/him as soon as possible after breaking the blind for a subject. 
 
To identify a subject’s study medication, locate the second panel of the tear -off label 
attached to the subject’s Label Page CRF and follow the instruc tions on the label. Record 
the date of un-blinding, the reason for un-blinding and the initials of the investigational 
center staff member who performed the un- blinding on the subject’s Label Page CRF.  
 
Any subject whose blind has been broken must be discharged from the study (Section 
4.6).  
 
At the end of the study, the original Label Page CRFs will be returned to Aclaris 
Therapeutics with a photoco py placed in the investigator’s study file. The original Label 
Page CRFs will be available, upon request, to the site if needed to respond to a 
regulatory audit. 
 
Any event that requires the use of an eyewash kit the investigator is required to 
break the blind for the subject and take appropriate action (Section 7.1.1 ).

The SSA is the subject’s assessment of the average overall severity of the target lesion at a 
particular time point and is not a comparison with the SSA at any other time point. The 
subject should NOT refer to any other evaluation to assist with these assessments.  
 
At Visits [ADDRESS_1076559] be provided with a handheld mirror and/or a wall mirror ( i. e., a mirror that 
provides an unobstructed view of the target lesion).  
 
To evaluate the target lesions an investigational staff member other than the investigator 
will identify the target lesion to the subject and direct the subject to assess the lesion. Th e 
staff member must not influence the subject’s assessment.

At Visit 1, at Visit 2 prior to randomization, at Visit 4 prior to any retreatment study 
medication application and at Visit 8 the investigator will measure the length, the width 
and, at
 Visit 1 ONLY, the thickness (height ) of the target lesion using the ruler 
provided, or an equivalent.  
 
The in
vestigator must measure the length and width of the target lesion as follows: 
 Length (i.e., the length of the longest axis) measured in millimeters (mm) and 
repor
ted to the nearest mm  
 Width ( i.e., the length of the longest axis perpendicular to the length) measured 
in mill
imeters (mm) and reported to the nearest mm.  
 
At Visit [ADDRESS_1076564]: 
 A length (longest axis) that is ≥7mm and ≤15 mm 
 A width (longest dimension perpendicular to the longest axis) that is ≥7mm and 
≤15mm . 
 
At Visit 2, and Visit 4, the length and width must be measured prior to any study 
medication application. 
 
At Visit [ADDRESS_1076565] measure the thickness (height) of the target 
lesion above the surrounding skin, in mm reported to the nearest 0.5mm. 
 
At Visit [ADDRESS_1076566] a thickness that is 
≤2.0mm.  
 
6.2. Safet
y Evaluations 
In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a 
designated and appropriately trained staff member or the subject, will perform study 
following safety assessments according to the schedules noted below.

The LSR assessment is the investigator’s assessment of the signs and the subject’s 
assessment of the symptoms associated with irritation at the target lesion site ( i.e., the 
target lesion and the skin immediately surrounding the target lesion exposed to study 
medication). The investigator and subject must NOT refer to any other evaluation to assist 
with these assessments. This is not a comparison with the assessment at any other time 
point.  
 
Local Skin Reactions: 
 Signs (assessed by [CONTACT_093]): 
o Erythema 
o Edema 
o Scaling/dryness 
o Vesicles/bullae 
o Crusting 
o Erosion 
o Ulceration 
o Post-inflammatory hyper-pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] 
o Post-inflammatory hypo-pi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (does not include the superficial 
transient skin blanching/whitening related to the action of the study 
medications) 
o Atrophy 
o Scarring. 
 
 Symptoms (assessed by [CONTACT_423]): 
o Stinging/burning 
o Pruritus (itch). 
 
At Visits 2- 8, the investigator and the subject will evaluate the LSR signs and the LSR 
symptoms at the target lesion site respectively.  
 
The investigator will assess the LSR signs for the target lesion site as follows: 
 Visits 2 and 4: 
o Report the average severity for all signs prior to any study medication 
application 
o For the treated target lesion 20 (±4) minutes after the Application 
Completion Time, report the average severity for the following signs: 
 Erythema 
 Edema  
 Scaling/dryness 
 Vesicles/bullae. 
 Visits 3 and 5-8: 
o Report the average severity for all signs.

 Visits 2 and 4: 
o Report the average severity over the previous 24 hours for all symptoms 
prior to any study medication application 
o For the treated target lesion, 10 (±4) minutes after the Application 
Completion Time, report the average severity of the LSR for all symptoms 
since completion of the study medication applications. 
 Visits 3 and 5-8: 
o Report the average severity over the previous [ADDRESS_1076568]’s assessment.  
 
The study staff member will report the LSR grade the subject indicates in the source 
document. Both the subject and the study staff member must sign/initial the source 
document to indicate the subject performed the LSR as instructed. 
 
The 
subject should report the one integer that best describes average overall severity of 
each LSR symptom for the targ et lesion site using the scale below: 
 
Local Skin Reactions  
Grade  Descriptor  
0 None  
1 Mild  
2 Moderate  
3  Severe  
 
6.2.2. Vital signs 
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member at Visit 1, Visit 2 prior to 
rando
mization, and at Visit 8. The following items will be measured: 
 Body temperature 
 Pulse rate 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] 
 Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits quietly for at least 5 
minutes 
 Height (at Visit 1 only) 
 Weight (at Visit 1 only).

relevant (CR ) must be recorded as history if found prior to the first study medication 
application or as an AE if found after the first study medication application begins 
(Section 7.1).  
 
A systolic blood pressure >140mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure >90mm Hg is 
cons
idered abnormal and therefore must be defined as CR or not clinically relevant 
(NCR) on the comments page of the CRF.  
 
A weig

on the comments page of the CRF.  
 
6.2.3. Clinical laboratory sampling 
Non-fasting samples for clinical laboratory analysis will be collected by a qualified staff 
member at Visit 1, at Visit 2 prior to randomization and at Visit 8. The following tests, at 
a minim
um, will be conducted: 
 
Chemistry Pan el Complete Blood Count  
Albumin  Hematocrit  
Alkaline phosphatase  Hemoglobin  
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  Platelet count  
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  Red blood cell morphology  
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)  Red blood cell count  
Bicarbonate  White blood  cell count  
Calcium  White blood cell differential

Sodium   
Total bilirubin   
Total protein   
Uric acid   
 
The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the laboratory’s standard 
reports. The investigator must note NCR or CR to define the clinical relevance of any 
result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must date 
and initial every laboratory report.

laboratory reports in a timely manner 
 
6.2.4. Urine pregnancy tests 
The investigator or designee will perform a urine pregnancy test for subjects who are 
WOCBP (Section 6.2.4 ) at Visit 1, at Visit [ADDRESS_1076571] a minimum sensitivity of 25-mIU ß-
HCG/mi
lliliter ( mL) of urine.  
 
Subjects who are WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test result at Visit [ADDRESS_1076572]’s pregnancy documented and followed 
(Section 8). 
 
6.3. Other Evaluations 
6.3.1. Demographics and medical history 
At Visit 1, the investigator or designee will interview each subject to obtain 
demo
graphic information including date of birth, sex at birth, Fitzpatrick skin type, race 
and, if appr
opriate, ethnicity.  
 
At Visit 1, the investigator must determine each subject’s Fitzpatrick skin type.  
 
The in
vestigator or designee will interview each subject to obtain medical history 
information related to all medical conditions and disease states that, at Visit 1: 
 Are ongoing 
 Require concomitant therapy 
 Are, i n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], relevant to the subject’s study 
participation.

The photographs are to document the appearance of the subjects’ target lesion.  
 
At study visits where a study medication application is performed ( i.e., Visit 2 and 
potentially Visit 4) the photographs must be taken prior to the study medication 
applic
ation. 
 
Care must be taken to ensure the same lighting, background, subject positioning 
relative to the camera and camera settings are used for each photograph.  
 
Equipment, supplies, training and detailed instructions for obtaining and managing the 
photographs will be provided to the investigational center prior to the initiation of 
subject enrollment.  
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study and immediately reported on 
the appropriate Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. AE CRF.   
 
7.1. D
efinitions 
7.1.1. Adverse events (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a study medication(s) and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the study medication.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign or symptom associated with the use of a study medication (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), whether or not related to the study medication.  
 
Thus
 any new, clinically relevant worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease, 
should be cons
idered an AE.

[CONTACT_274307], sunburn) for any such AE.  
 
Report any event that requires use of the eyewash kit (Section 5.7.6 ) as an AE for “eye 
irritation”. For all AEs of this type: 
 Contact [CONTACT_7195] (see contact [CONTACT_536270] 1, or in Section 
7.2.2 ) immediately (within 24 hours) 
 Unblind the study medication for the subject (Section 5.10.2 ) 
 Arrange for the subject to be transported to the most appropriate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322522] (ER) and provide the study medication identification 
information to the appropriate ER staff 
 Follow the course of the AE  
 Report the event as an SAE if appropriate (Section 7.1.2 ). 
 
Every new epi[INVESTIGATOR_519744] a chronic condition ( e.g., 
headaches, seasonal allergies, depression, and hypertension) should be reported as a 
separate AE, even if the condition is reported in the subject’s medical history.  
 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, 
symptoms or clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. 
Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the 
AE. 
 
Any CR abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication application should 
be reported as medical history, not as an AE.

A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is life threatening 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event. 
 
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it was more severe. 
 
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_782819]-patient basis, even if released the same day. Prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186]
n is defined as an additional night stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] 
a diagnostic test (even if related to an AE) or elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_782820] (signing the ICF) is not themselves reasons for an event to be 
defined as a SAE. 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but are clearly of major clinical significance and may 
jeopar
dize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
the SAE definition above. These should also usually be considered serious. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 
7.1.3. Unexpected adverse event 
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not 
listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
 
7.1.4. Adverse event reporting period 
The investigator must start reporting n on-serious AEs starting with the subject’s first 
study medication application and continuing until the end of the subject’s last stud y 
visit. Reporting for SAEs must start when the subject signs the ICF and continue until 
the end o
f the subject’s last visit.

judgment. 
 
Mild  – Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated 
Moderate  – Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity 
Severe  – Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity. 
 
7.1.6. Relationship to study medication 
The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the 
study medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical 
judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the 
event, the subject’s relevant medical history, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782821]) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The 
investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the study medication by [CONTACT_782832]: 
 
Related  – There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship 
between the study medication and the AE. 
 
Not 
Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal 
relationship between the study medication and the AE. 
 
The t
erm “reasonable causal relationship” means there are facts or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A). 
 
7.2. Reporti
ng Procedures 
7.2.1. Procedures for reporting adverse events 
At each post enrollment visit, the investigator will question the subject to elicit AEs 
using a non-directive question such as “Has there been any change in your health since 
the previous study visit?”   
 
Th
e investigator/designee will monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes after the 
Application Completion Time at Visit 2 and at Visit 4 to elicit AEs in a similar manner.

ions.  
 
Any A
E noted during the reporting period (Section 7.1.4 ) must be reported in the source 
documents and on the appropriate AE CRF.  
 
AEs that are defined as “Not Related” to the study medication s will be followed until 
they are resolved or until the subject’s last study visit . AEs that are defined as “Related” 
to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after 
the subject’s last study visit, until i n the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE reaches a 
clinic
ally stable outcome with or without sequelae. 
 
7.2.2. Proc
edure for reporting a serious adverse event 
Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or 
not related to the study medications, the investigator must: 
 
1. Take the appropriate medical action to ensure the subject’s safety  
2. Immediately inform the Medical Monitor of the SAE by [CONTACT_756]:

8. PREGNANCY 
WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not 
undergone successful surgical sterilization ( e.g., hysterectomy, hysteroscopy, bilateral 
tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral minilaparotomy) or is not 
postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as ≥12 months with no menses without an 
alternative medical cause. Women who are WOCBP and are using an active method of 
birth control, are practicing abstinence or where the partner is sterile ( e.g., vasectomy), 
should be considered to be WOCBP. 
 
All WO
CBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the 
study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Effective methods of birth 
control approved for use in this study are: 
 Implants 
 Injectable 
 Patch 
 Combined oral contraceptives 
 Barrier methods ( e.g., condom, diaphragm) with spermicide 
 ParaGard® and Mirena® intrauterine devices. 
 
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for a pregnancy.  The 
subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  During the 
trial all WOCBP will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_223782] ( e.g., missed or late menstrual period). 
 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
medication administration, the study medication must be withheld until the results of a 
pregnancy test are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive 
study medication and must be discharged from the study.  
 
If, follow
ing study medication administration, it is determined that the subject may 
have been or was pregnant at the time of study medication exposure (including at least 
2 days after study medication administration) the investigator must immediately notify 
the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Medical Monitor and record the event on a pregnancy 
surveillance form. While not an AE or SAE, the investigator must report every 
pregnan
cy using a pregnancy surveillance form and follow the reporting procedures 
described for SAE reporting (Section 7.2.2).

Other appropriate pregnancy follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated. 
In addition, the investigator must report to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. ’s Medical Monitor 
on the pregnancy surveillance form, follow-up information regarding the course of the 
pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a 
minimum of six weeks. 
  
9. STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
9.1. Statistical Analysis of Clinical Indices 
The primary effectiveness analysis will consist of mean change from baseline to Visit 8 
PLA performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline PLA as the 
covariate.  The analysis will be performed at each post-baseline visit with emphasis on 
Visit 8.  Comparisons between vehicle and each active treatment group will be 
performed within the model using least-squares means and the common error term.    
The primary efficacy analyses will be based on the per protocol (PP) population, 
defined as all randomized subjects who completed the study with no major protocol 
violation.  
 
A secondary efficacy analysis of a separate comparison between each active treatment 
group and the vehicle treatment group based on the proportion of subjects whose target 
lesion is judged to be clear on the PLA (PLA = 0) at Visit 8.  A separate Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_782833].   A secondary 
efficacy analysis will also be conducted using th is same methodology, but based on 
SSA.   
 
Secondary analyses will initially be performed on the PP population, but will also be 
performed on the intent- to-treat (ITT) population defined as all randomized subjects 
with non-missing data at baseline and at least one post-baseline visit.  As a secondary 
analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed using the ITT population.  For 
all ITT-population analyses, missing efficacy data will be imputed from the last non-
missing post-baseline visit carried forward to subsequent missing visits (LOCF).    
 
For
 all analyses, two-tail alpha will be set to 0.05 with no adjustment for multiple 
comparisons.  ANCOVAs will include Site in the model if doing so improves the 
sensitivity of the model for comparing treatment groups.  As a sensitivity analysis, th e 
primary efficacy analysis will also be run including Site and the Treatment- by-Site 
interaction.  If the interaction term is associated with p < 0.10 then treatment group 
means for each Site will be examined individually to understand potential site 
differences.  Sites with less than two completed blocks of subjects will be pooled with 
other such Sites to achieve new pooled analysis Sites that meet this criterion.  Sites will

9.2. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data 
Descriptive statistics will be calculated on the safety parameters using the ITT 
population. The proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events will be 
tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_160843] 
(MedDRA) System Organ Class. Vital signs, LSR scores and clinically relevant abnormal 
laboratory results will also be tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_160844]. No 
inferential testing will be performed. 
 
Data from all randomized subjects will be presented and summarized. Safety 
summaries by [CONTACT_782835], and changes from 
pre-application values in vital signs. Adverse event summaries will be presented by 
[CONTACT_458011], both 
overall and by [CONTACT_7204]. 
 
9.3. Sample Size 
The sample size of 32 subjects per treatment group completing the study (as defined for 
the PP population) is based on previous data suggesting that the proportion of subjects 
with a clear lesion (PLA=0) at Visit [ADDRESS_1076581] (a proportion of approximately 0.031) 
achiev
ing a clear lesion at Visit 8.  Under these assumptions this study would have 
approximately 87% power with two-tail alpha = 0.05, using the more conservative 
secondary efficacy endpoint. The ANCOVA analysis of the primary endpoint, mean 
chang
e from baseline PLA for the PP population, is expected to be more sensitive than 
the above endpoint, with power greater than 90% under similar assumptions.

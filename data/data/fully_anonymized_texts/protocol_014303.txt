SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA180406
Protocol Title :  Open -Label Single Arm Phase 2 Study Evaluating Dasatinib Therapy Discontinuatio n In Patients 
With Chronic Phase Chro nic Myeloid Leukemia (CP-CML) With Stable Complete Molecular Response (CMR) 
DASFREE
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Produ ct(s): At study entry , dasatinib will be discontinued in all enrolled patients. Dasatinib will be restarted if 
major molecular response is lost during the off-treatment period at the dose level received before study entry . The 
patient will remain on treat ment for the duration of the study. Dose adjustment for toxicity and response is permitted 
during the retreatment period based on protocol guidelines. Dosing above 180 mg QD of dasatinib is prohibited.
Study Phase:   Phase 2
Research Hypothesis: CP-CML patients with stable complete molecular response (CMR) who discontinue 
dasatinib treatment are able to maintain a sustained remission in the long-term, with undetectable or minimally 
detectable BCR -ABL residual disease.
Objectives : The primary objective of this study is to assess the rate of major molecular response (MMR ), defined 
as the proportion of subjects who maintain MMR (BCR -ABL transcripts < 0.1% on International Scale (IS)) at 
12month safter dasatinib discontinuation , without re-starting dasatinib treatment.
The secondary objectives of this study include assessment of the following: event -free survival (EFS) (defined as no 
loss of MMR) at 12 , 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after dasatinib discontinuation; relapse -free survival (RFS) at 6, 12, 
18, 24 months and ever y 6 months thereafter; BCR -ABL kinetics in those patients who experience intermittent loss 
of CMR (MR4.5) but no loss of MMR (ie, BCR -ABL blips); assessment of BCR -ABL kinetics in patients who are in 
CMR (MR4.5) or less when transcript levels are still measurable; rate of transformation to accelerated phase /blast 
crisis (AP/BC); progression free survival, and overall survival.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study Design:  This is an open -label, single -arm study  in adult patients with CP -CML who have received dasatinib 
as treatment for a m inimum of [ADDRESS_803387] confirmed dasatinib -induced complete 
molecular remission (defined as 4.5-log reduction of BCR -ABL transcript as determined by [CONTACT_104130]) 
ongoing for at least [ADDRESS_803388] achieved a 1 -log reduction in BCR -ABL 
transcript levels compared to base line as determined by [CONTACT_606439] 10% IS [International 
Standard]) at [ADDRESS_803389] study 
sponsored molecular analy sis assessment confirms CMR, the assessment will be repeated after 3months. Patients 
are eligible for enrollment if both assessments from the central lab confirm CMR (MR4.5).For any patient not 
eligible for enrollment on the basis of a central laboratory test that does not confirm CMR, rescreening is allowed 
9months (or longer) a fter the time of the last central lab screening failure.

Clinical Protocol CA180406
BMS -354825 Dasatinib
Once all entry criteria are met, patients will be enrolled. At the time of enrollment, dasatinib will be discontinued.
Patients will be monito red for maintenance of MMR (BCR -ABL transcripts < 0.1% IS). At the loss of MMR,  
dasatinib treatment will be resumed at the dose level the patient received before dasatinib was discontinued at study 
entry . Patients who have restarted treatment with dasatinib due to loss of MMR will remain on treatment for the 
duration of the study. Dose escalatio ns and adjustments in case of toxicit ies are permitted as described in 
Section.4.3.1.
A rise of PCR > 0.0032% (4.5 log reduction) IS after discontinuation of dasatinib should not trigger dasatinib 
re-initiation, if the BCR -ABL transcripts remain below 0.1% on IS. 
All patients on study  will be followed for [ADDRESS_803390] enrolled patient.
AP/BC =accelerated phase/blast crisis; CMR = complete molecular response.
IS = International Scale; SCT = stem cell transplant; Month = 30 days
CMR (MR4.5) defined as 0.0032% (IS) or 4.5 log reduction of BCR -ABL transcript as determined 
by [CONTACT_606440]: CP CML patients on dasatinib treatment for a minimum of 2 years with confirmed stable 
dasatinib -induced CMR (MR4.5) for a minimum of 12 months prior to enrollment and no prior accelerated 
phase/ blast crisis (AP/BC) or stem cell transplant (SCT). Eligible patients must have achieved a 1-log reduction in 
BCR -ABL transcript levels compared to baseline as determined by [CONTACT_104130], or less than or equal to 10% IS 
[International Standard]) at [ADDRESS_803391] meet all prescreening and screening criteria. 
Study Assessments : Safety assessments include: physical examination (including vital signs and performance 
status), signs and symptoms, serum chemistry, ECG (baseline and if clinically indicated) , echocardiogram ,and chest 
x-rayas(both as if clinically indic ated). Adverse events will be assessed throughout this study using the current 
version of the NCI CTCAE guide . Efficacy assessments include: complete blood count (CBC) with differential, 
platelets, cytogenetics (if clinically indicated) , and molecular analysis (qualitative polymerase chain reaction 
[Q-PCR]). Patient -reported outcomes will be assessed by [CONTACT_224957] -CML QOL questionnaire (severity and impact 
of cancer -related sy mptoms ) and the EORTC -QLQ -C30 questionnaire (self-reported measure of quality of li fe).The 
schedule of study assessments is presented in Section 5.1, Flow Chart/Time and Events Schedule.
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size: This is an open label single arm study with no comparative objective.

patients will ensure a 20% width for a 95% confidence interval. To accommodate an expected 5 % drop -out 
rate, a total of 79 patients will be enrolled i nto this trial.
Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the MMR rate at 12 months after dasatinib discontinuation. 
Secondary endpoints include event -free survival (EFS) at 12 months, relapse -free survival (RFS) at 6, 12, 
18, 24 months and every 6 months thereafter after dasatinib discontinuation, assessment of BCR -ABL 
kinetics, the rate of transformation to AP/BC ,progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Explo ratory  endpoints include identifying prognostic factors for maintaining MMR at 12 months after 
dasatinib discontinuation without re-starting dasatinib , e.g. age (years), gender (male/female), Sokal risk 
group, time from diagnosis (months), time in dasatinib -induced stable CMR (MR4.5) prior to 
discontinuation (months) , occurrence of BCR -ABL blips (changes in residual level that do not have clinical 
relevance and does not imply loss of MMR ) (Yes/No), history  of pleural effusion (Yes/No), history of 
lymphocy tosis (Yes/No) (lymphocy tes > 3.6 x 109 L ); the proportion of subjects who achieve molecular 
response and cytogenetic response after relapse ;time to molecular re-response (rMMR and rCMR ) and 
cytogenetic re-response (rCCyR and rPCyR) after re-initiating dasatinib in patients who lose MMR after 
discontinuation ; healthcare resource utilization that isincurred during discontinuation of study  treatment 
and during treatment (re-start of dasatinib); the frequency and CTCAE grade of adverse events during
discontinuation of study treatment and during treatment (re-start of dasatinib); and quality of life 
assessments: EORTC -QLQ -C30 and MDASI -CML (following disco ntinuation of study  treatment and 
during treatment).
Analyses:   No formal statistic al testing will be performed. Summary statistics will be provide d for subject 
disposition, baseline characteristics (demographics, medical history , etc.), dosing, efficacy, safety , and 
health outcome endpoints using the enrolled subject population .Also, efficacy will be summarized using 
the evaluable subject populatio n. Health resource utilization data will be assessed using descriptive 
statistics and will be reported in an analysis separate from the clinical study report.
Efficacy will be described foreach of the following subgroups: patients in CMR (MR4.5) 24 months or 
> 24 months prior to dasatinib discontinuation , patients’ with dasatinib asfirst line or second/third line
treatment .
MMR rate at 12 months will be summarized by [CONTACT_606441] -Pearson two-sided 95% 
confidence intervals. EFS at 1 2, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months, RFS at 6, 12, 18, 24 months and ever y 6 months 
thereafter, the proportion of subjects who achieve molecular response after relapse, rate of transformation 
to AP/BC , and rate of OS will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method.  
Time to event endpoints including EFS, RFS, time to re-gaining MMR and CMR for subjects who 
experience MMR loss and re-start dasatinib, PFS, and OS will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier 
estimates and Brookmeyer -Crowley methods. Censoring details are provided in the protocol and will be 
further specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).
Explo ratory analy sis to identify prognostic factors will be analyzed using Cox Proportional Hazard models. 
Interim Analysis: The Sponsor will conduct continuous review and reporting of safety  throughout the study as 
required by [CONTACT_606442]. 
In case of any progression from chronic phase through accelerat edorblast crisis during the discontinuat ion phase, 
the steering committee and the internal date monitoring committee (IDMC )will be consulted and the case will be 
discussed to decide potential early study termination.
An interim analy sis is planned when all patients have been followed until mont h 12 (calculated from discontinuation 
of dasatinib). This analy sis will assess specific safety and efficacy endpoints and will be detailed in the statistical 
analy sis plan.
Regular reviews (at least 2 times a year and ad-hoc as necessary) of safety and efficacy data listings and 
pharmacovigilance reports will be performed. These reviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_606443] (IDMC) made up of representatives who are independent from the study team. The structure, roles, and 
responsibilit ies of the IDMC, as well as the timing of analyses, monitoring guidelines, and content of the reports will 
be detailed in the charter of the IDMC.

1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Dasatinib has demonstrated a favorable risk-benefi t profile in patients resistant or intolerant to 
imatinib and in newly diagnosed patients with CP -CML.  
Although maintenance therapy  with imatinib or a second -generati on TKIs such as dasat inib, are 
generally well tolerated for most patients, chronic toxicities (even if low grade) can impair a 
patient’s daily qualit y of life.8In addit ion, there is pot ential for late -emerging toxi cities that could 
develop, given that the current experience wit h TKIs only spans litt le more than a decade.[ADDRESS_803400] ive with wo men of child bearin g potenti al on the importance o f 
pregnancy preventi on and the implicat ions of an unexpected pregnancy during treatm ent with 
dasat inib.
For these reasons, one crit ical goal of CML treatment is to ident ify those patients who may be able 
to achieve long- lasting disease remissio n, wi thout the need for ongoing treatment.
This tri al will generate data by  [CONTACT_606444] f or 5 y ears af ter treatm ent discont inuat ion, and 
assessing long-term stabilit y of CMR (MR4.5) achieved on dasatinib, recurrence rate, patients
qualit y of life off  dasatinib treatm ent and, important ly, the abili ty to regain a molecular response 
in those patients who relapse after treatment withdrawal.
Patients who have attained a sustained CMR (MR4.5) while receiving dasat inib [ADDRESS_803401] level 
of response achieved with dasatinib predicts better long-term disease contro l and outcom e and 
might theoreti cally cure some patients who are newly diagnosed wit h CP CML. Moreover, the risk 
of being off treatm ent is balanced by  [CONTACT_606445] y of life: in fact, drug -
related side effects,19even if manageable, impose an additional burden of morbidi ty and may be 
associ ated wi th reduced treatment compliance.8,20

3.3.3 Women of Childbea ring Potential
A wom en of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experi enced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilizat ion (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy ) and is not postm enopausal . Menopause is defined as [ADDRESS_803416] a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
>40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.*
*Wo men treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date: 24-Jul-[ADDRESS_803417] igators should use their judgment  
in checking serum  FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is >40 mIU/ml at any time during the 
washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopau sal.
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as lo ng as 6 months.
3.4 Concomitant Treatments
The prohibit ed and restri cted treatm ent sections are applicable throughout any period when 
dasat inib is prescribed, i.e., during screening and during the restart of dasatinib when the study 
drug will be administered unt il the end of the study.
3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restri cted Treatments
The following treatm ents are prohibited throughout any period when dasat inib is prescribed, ie, 
during screening and during the restart of dasat inib when the study drug will be administered until 
the end of the study .  
Medicat ions associat ed wi th QT interval pro longatio n that are prohibited in this study  include:
quinidine, procainamide, disopy ramide
amiodarone, sotalo l, ibutilide, dofetilide
erythromycins, clarithro mycin
chlorpromazine, haloperido l, mesori dazine, thi oridazine, pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]
cisapride, bepridil, droperi dol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine, domperidone, halofantrine, 
levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparflo xacin, lido flazine.
3.4.[ADDRESS_803418] igator believe that therapy  with a potenti ally QT prolonging medicat ion (other 
than the ones explicit ly prohibited) is vital to an individual subject’s care, then addit ional ECG(s) 
will be done at the invest igator’s discret ion to ensure the subject’s safety.
Cauti on is warranted when administering dasat inib to subjects taking drugs that are highly 
dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism  and have a narrow therapeuti c index. See Appendix 4 for 
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date: 24-Jul-[ADDRESS_803419] of commo n CYP3A4 substrates. Systemic exposures to these medicat ions could be increased 
while receiving dasat inib.21
Addit ionally , strong to moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
erythromycin, clari thromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin) may significantly increase concentrati ons of dasatinib and shoul d be used with 
cauti on when administered concurrently  with dasatinib or imatinib. Strong to m oderate CYP3A4 
inducers (eg, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]) may decrease the concentrati on of dasatinib and shoul d be used with 
cauti on when administered concurrent ly with dasatinib or imat inib. See Appendix [ADDRESS_803420] decreased solubilit y and absorpti on at pH 
> 4. Until further data are available, subjects should try to avoid taking proton pump inhibitors and 
H2antagonists. Short -acting antaci d agents (eg, aluminum  or magnesium hydroxide, calcium 
carbonate) m ay be taken, but i t is recommended that these not be taken 2 hours before or 2 hours 
after dosing o f dasat inib.
Based on pre-clinical data, dasatinib might increase the likelihood of bleeding. Hence, subjects 
undergo ing surgi cal procedures, including dental  procedures should be instructed to inform their 
doctors of this potential increased risk

regul ations, including any special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
Written procedures for on-site disposal  are available and followed. The procedures must be 
filed with the site’s SOPs and a copy  provi ded to BMS upon request.
Records are maintained that allow for traceabilit y of each container, including the date 
disposed of, quant ity disposed, and ident ification of the person disposing the containers. The 
method of disposal, ie, incinerator, licensed sanitary landfill, or licensed waste disposal vendor 
must be documented.
Accountabilit y and disposal  records are complete, up- to-date, and available for the Monitor to 
review throughout the clinical trial period.
If condit ions for destruction cannot be met the responsible Study Monitor will make arrangements 
for return of study  drug.
It is the investi gator’s responsibilit y to arra nge for disposal o f all empt y containers, provided that 
procedures for proper disposal  have been established according to applicable federal, state, local, 
and institutional guidelines and procedures, and provi ded that appropri ate records of disposal  are 
kept.

[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Cytogenetic Response 
Cytogenetic response (CyR) is based on the prevalence of Ph+ cells in metaphase from bone 
marrow (BM) sample. Ideally, [ADDRESS_803449] 20 metaphases fro m a BM sample should 
be evaluated.22
The cri teria for eval uation of CyR are as fo llows:22
Com plete Cy togeneti c Response (CCyR):   0% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM
Parti al Cytogenetic Response (PCy R):  1 to 35% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM22
Minor Cy togeneti c Response:  36 to 65% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM
Minimal Cytogenet ic Response:  66 to 95% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM
No Cytogeneti c Response:  96 to 100% Ph+ cells in metaphase in BM
Major Cy togeneti c Response (MCyR) is defined as CCyR plus PCyR
For the assessment o f CCyR, FISH of blood interphase cell nuclei can subst itute for bone marrow 
cell metaphases. CCyR is then defined by < 1% BCR- ABL1 –posi tive nuclei of at least 200 
nuclei.13,14,23
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Molecular Response
Molecular response will be assessed using BC R-ABL transcri pt levels measurement by  [CONTACT_5203]-time 
quant itative polymerase chain react ion (Q-PCR performed in a centralized lab and expressed in 
IS).
A major m olecular response (MMR) is defined as BCR-ABL transcripts < 0.1% IS.13
CMR is defined as 0.0032% or 4.5 log reduction of BCR -ABL transcript levels MR 4.5. The 
rate of MMR is defined as the proporti on of  subjects who m aintain MMR (BCR -ABL transcripts 
<0.1% (IS)) at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after dasatinib discont inuation, without restarting 
dasat inib at study entry. Also, the MMR rate will be estimated for the evaluable patients.
[IP_ADDRESS] Event -free survival
Event free survival  is defined as the time from the date of  dasatinib treatm ent discont inuat ion to 
the date of loss of MMR. Patients who do not lose MMR will be censored on the date of their last 
molecular assessment .
[IP_ADDRESS] Relapse (during off treatment period)
Relapse is defined as any of the following events while a subject is on study : the loss of MMR,
CCyR, CHR, or progressi on to advanced/blastic phase. Relapse -free survival (RFS) is defined as 
the time fro m dasatinib treatm ent discontin uation to the date of relapse. Patients who do not relaps e

6. ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condition in a clinical investigation subject admin istered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The causal relat ionship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relat ionship between study  drug administrati on and the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent repor ting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
resul ts in death
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198222] (see NOTE
below)
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or resul t in death or hospi [INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events includ e, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689].) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE.

Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by [CONTACT_186770], these event s must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpo int that is considered related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
NOTE: 
The fo llowing hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53913]: 
a visi t to the em ergency room  or other hospi [INVESTIGATOR_53914] < 24 hours, that does not resul t in 
admissio n (unless consider ed an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routi ne healt h assessment requiring admissio n for baseline/trending of healt h status (eg, routine 
colonoscopy )
medical/surgical admissio n other than to rem edy ill healt h and pl anned pri or to entry  into the 
study . Appropri ate documentati on is requi red in these cases
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on healt h status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative reason).
6.1.[ADDRESS_803459]’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with protocol -
specified procedures. All SAEs must be co llected that occur during the screening period and within 
[ADDRESS_803460] igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study 
procedure ), the relat ionship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not rel ated to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_803461] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). When using paper forms, the reports are 
to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmissio n to:
SAE Email Address: See Contact [CONTACT_432260].
SAE Facsimile Number:  See Contact [CONTACT_198264].
For studi es capturing SAEs/pregnancies through electroni c data capture (EDC), electronic 
submissio n is the required method for reporting. The paper forms shoul d be used and submitted 
Revised Protocol No.: 04
Date: 24-Jul-[ADDRESS_803462] (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): See Contact [CONTACT_251620].
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up 
SAE reports should include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report. 
All SAEs should be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilizat ion.
6.2 Nonserious Adverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE informat ion should begin at enrollment.
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or di scont inuat ion of study  drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All ident ified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Com pletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies that 
are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .

Any laboratory test resul t abnormalit y that required the subject to have study drug discont inued 
or interrupted
Any laboratory  test resul t abnorm ality that requi red the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy .

6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Secti on 6.1.1for reporti ng details).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as:

consulted throughout the development of the protocol  and will participate in data analysis and 
interpretati on.
In addition, an internal data monitoring committee (IDMC) consisting of senior expert 
representatives of the Sponsor who are independent from the study  team  will be established. This 
committee will include at a minimum two physicians and a statistician. This committee woul d 
have the remit o f regularly assessing study progress at defined inter vals (at least 2 times a year and 
ad-hoc as necessary ), reviewing safet y data including all SAEs, grade 3 and 4 AEs and 
discontinuat ions and examining critical efficacy endpo ints (e.g. MMR, CCyR and disease 
progression) of the study .
8. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
This is an open -label, single -arm study  with no comparat ive objective. 
A 75% MMR rate at 12 months after dasat inib discontinuati on is considered clinically  relevant. 
Under such an assumpt ion, a sample size of 74 patients will ensure a 20% width for a 95% 
confidence interval.  To accommodate an expected 5% drop -out rate, a total of 79 subjects will be 
enrolled into this trial.
8.2 Populations for Analyses
Enrolled subjects: All subjects who signed an informed consent.
Evaluable subjects:  All enrolled subjects who do not have any  major deviati ons or vi olations 
of the protocol.  
All enrolled subjects will be used in the tabulat ion of subject disposi tion and will be used in 
the analysis of baselin e characteri stics and efficacy . Also, the efficacy  endpo ints will be 
analyzed for the enrolled and evaluable subject populat ions. Safety, extent of exposure, and 
healt h outcom e will be tabulated and analyzed for the enrolled subjects. 
8.3 Endpoints
8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary efficacy e ndpo int is the proportion of subjects who maintain MMR at [ADDRESS_803469] definit ion of progress ion (Secti on 5.4.2 ).24In the event that any subject 
discontinues the study  or di es pri or to 12 mont hs then these events will be considered failures and 
these patients will be included in the deno minator of the proporti on, following the intent to treat 
principle.

8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
The secondary  efficacy endpoints include 
event -free survival (EFS) (defined as survival  with no loss of MMR) at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 
60months after dasatinib discont inuat ion 
relapse-free survival (RFS) at 6, 12, 18, 24 mo nths and every 6 months thereafter after dasatinib 
discontinuat ion 
assessment of BCR -ABL kinet ics forsubjects who experience loss of CMR but not MMR 
assessment of BCR -ABL kinet ics in subjects in CMR or less wit h measurable levels
the rate of transformation to AP/BC
PFS
overall survival (OS)
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
8.3.4 Safety Endpoints
Safety endpo ints include the frequency and CTCAE grade of adverse events during 
discontinuat ion of study treatment and during treatment (re -start of dasat inib), the number of dose 
interrupti ons, dose reducti ons and treatm ent discontin uations for drug -related toxicit y.
8.3.5 Outcome Research Endpoints
Qualit y of life assessments: EORTC QLQ -C30 and MDASI -CML during discontinuat ion of study 
treatm ent and during treatm ent (re-start of dasatinib) will be evaluated. Health care utilizat ion 
during the discont inuat ion of study treatm ent and during treatm ent (re-start of dasatinib) study 
periods will also be explored and reported separately  from the clinical study  report.
8.4 Analyses
No formal statistical testing will be performed.  Due to the study  design, some of the efficacy 
endpo ints usually considered as efficacy will be considered as both efficacy and safet y endpo ints:  
progression of disease (per ELN guidelines) which includes transform ation to AP/BC and death 
due to any  reason, and risk associated with re-gaining MMR fo llowing re -start of dasat inib.

of the proporti on, fo llowing the intent to treat principle risks.
The secondary  analysis including time to event endpoints: EFS, RFS, PFS, OS will be analyzed 
using Kaplan -Meier Methods at yearly intervals. Rates of transformations will be analyzed as

Guidelines of Acceptable Methods of Contraception 
NOTE: The wording below is provi ded as an example andmay be revised based on local input 
and requests, as long as protocol  requi rements are maintained . 
Use of dasat inib during pregnancy can be harmful to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103] (baby), potentially 
resul ting in birth defects or the death of the fetus. At a minimum, you must agree to use two 
methods of contraception. One method must be highly  effect ive (selected fro m Section A below) 
and the second method must be either highly effective or less effect ive (selected fro m Secti on B 
below):
A. HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Highly Effective contracepti on methods are as follows:
1.Progestogen only  hormonal contracept ion associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation.
2.Horm onal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_606434] + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine 
devices (IUDs) such as Mirena 
3.Nonhorm onal intrauterine devices (IUDs), such as ParaGard® 
4.Bilateral tubal occlusio n(also known as having tubes tied)
5.Vasectomised partner with documented azoospermia 90 days (test done to show that 
there is no sperm)  after procedure 
a.Vasectomised partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that 
partner is the sole sexual  partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the 
vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
b.If using this method of contraception , male subject s with partners who are 
WOCBP m ust also use condoms .
6.Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
7.Com plete abstinence
a.Com plete abstinence is defined as the co mplete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse.
b.Com plete abstinence is an acceptable form of contrac eption for all study  drugs 
and must be used throughout the duration of the study  treatm ent pl us [ADDRESS_803485] pregnancy  tests 
monthly
B. LESS EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
1.Diaphragm  with spermicide
2.Cervical cap wit h spermicide
3.Vaginal sponge wit h spermicide

APPENDIX 8 METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
At a minimum, women of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) and WOCBP who are partners of 
male subjects must agree to the use of two methods of contraception , with one method being 
highly effective and the other method being either highly effect iveor less effect ive as listed 
below:
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Highly effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of <  1% when used consistent ly 
and correctly . Male subjects must inform their female partners who are WOCBP of the 
contraceptive requi rements of the protocol are expected to adhere to using contracepti on
(including condo ms as the requi red second method) with their partner. Contraception methods 
are as fo llows:
1.Progestogen only  hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibition of  ovul ation.
2.Horm onal methods of contraception including oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_606434] + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine 
devices (IUDs) such as Mirena 
3.Nonhorm onal IUDs, such as ParaGard 
4.Bilateral tubal occlusio n
5.Vasectomised partner with documented azoospermia 90 days after procedure
Vasectomised partner is a highly effect ive birth control  method provi ded that partner 
is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomised 
partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
If using this method of contracepti on, male subjects with partners who are WOCBP 
must al so use condom s.
6.Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
7.Com plete abstinence
Com plete abstinence is defined as the compl ete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse. (refer to Glossary  of Term s)
Com plete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs and 
must be used throughout the duration of the study treatm ent (plus [ADDRESS_803486] us 30 days).
It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete 
abstinence is elected.
Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as 
specified in Secti on 6.4
Acceptable alternate methods of highly  effective contraception must be discussed in 
the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
The reliabilit y of sexual abst inence needs to be evaluated in relat ion to the durati on of 
the clini cal trial and the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject.

Methods  
Drug . Capsules containing 500mg Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_740398] 500mg 
microcrystalline cellulose prepared by [CONTACT_740407] ( www.makerx.com ), a licensed 
compounding pharmacy.  
Procedure . Participants will be  randomly assigned to either placebo or 500 mg of Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_740399] a double -blind procedure.  Participants will fill out background demographic and personality 
questionnaires for about 20 -30 minutes after consuming drug.  The tasks will begin after  60 
minutes  has passed from drug or placebo intake, in order allow sufficient time for Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_740400] b rain (Cryer, 1998;  Nagelschmitz, 2014 ). 
Emotional Image Rating Task : Each participant is presented with 120 images , drawn 
from the previously published stimuli used in Leal et al. (2014) , Schaller (2011) and the 
International Affective Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2980]  (Lang , 1995 ), in a pseudo -random order according to the 
procedures in Durso et al. (2015). Images were pre-categorized on evaluative dimensions 
corresponding to  extreme ly unpleasant  (35 images) , moderate ly unpleasant  (15 images) , neutral  
(20 images) , mode rately pleasant  (15 images) , and extreme ly pleasant  (35 images) . The 
participants will be  asked to evaluate  60 of  the images  on their val ence by [CONTACT_740408]: “To what extent is this pi[INVESTIGATOR_740401]?” using a 9-point scale with 4 being 
extremely positive, -4 being extremely negative, and 0 being neither positive nor negative. They 
will then be  shown 60 different  images , this time be ing asked: “ To what extent  does this pi[INVESTIGATOR_740402]?”  in order to rate their level of emotional arousal. A similar 
9-point scale w as used, with 0 being “I feel little emotion” and 8 being “I feel an extreme amount 
of emotion.” These two blocks are in a consecutive, non -counterbalanced order.

Balloon Analogue Risk Task:  Once participants complete  the emotional image rating  
task, they will complete  the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART ) to measure risk taking 
behavior (Lejuez, et al., 2002).  In this task, participants h ave the opportunity to inflate [ADDRESS_1012162] pump had a 1/128 probability of 
bursting, the second pump 1/127, and so on until on the 128thpump there wasa 1/1 probability of 
bursting.  
Memory Recognition  Task : Participants are then asked to perform  a memory recognition  
task based on the paradigm in Leal et al. (2014). Participants were shown 180 images and ha ve 
to classify each as an image that they had seen in the emotional rating task or a new image. 
Images were divided equally among four different groups: 45 old images that appeared in the 
emotional rating task, 45 new high similarity lures that looked very closely like images shown in 
the emotional rating task (ex. an image of a crossing guard , after being  shown an image of the 
same crossing guard from a s lightly different angle in the first task), 45 new low similarity lures 
that looked somewhat like images shown in the emotional rating task (ex. an image of a dirty 
3 
Study Design and Analysis Plan: Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_740397] , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , April 28, [ADDRESS_1012163] task), and 45 new foils th at did not 
bare any resemblance to images from the emotional rating task (ex. an image of an airplane , after 
not being shown an image of aircraft in the first task). Each group was evenly composed of [ADDRESS_1012164] easant, neutral, moderately pleasant, 
and extremely pleasant image category. For analysis, d -prime (d’) scores were then calculated 
for each participant in each normative rating category. d’ is a measure of a participant’s signal 
detection ability and is u naffected by [CONTACT_606270]. It was calculated by [CONTACT_67000] z -score 
of each participant’s hit rate by [CONTACT_941] z -score of their false alarm rate for each normative rating 
category.     
Saliva Sample : Participants will then be  asked to provide two saliva samples  of 1.5 mL  in 
order to measure prostaglandin levels in the saliva. Saliva samples are taken at the beginning of 
the experiment 5 minutes after the ingestion of drug or placebo, and at the end of the experiment 
after part icipants had completed all computerized tasks, approximately 90 minutes after ingestion 
of drug or placebo.

Data Analysis Plan  
For analysis of the evaluations and arousal ratings of the emotional images, identical 
procedures to those done in Durso, Luttrell, & Way, (2015) will be performed. Specifically, 
responses will be subjected to a 2 (treatment: Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], placebo) × 5 (normative rating: extremely 
unpleasant, moderately unpleasant, neutral, moderately pleasant, extremely pleasant) mixed -
model ANOV A. Participants who respond faster than 500msec will be dropped from analyses as 
they are deemed to not be taking the task seriously.  
For the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, the primary dependent measure will be adjusted 
average number of pumps (the number of pumps on trials where the balloon didn’t burst)  
following the initial work in this area (Lejuez, et al., 2002).  
For the memory recognition task, the d’ score will be subjected to the same analytical 
approach as that for the evaluations and arousal ratings.

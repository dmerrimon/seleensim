Abstract
Objectives:
Primary Objective
  Assess the safety of infusing ex vivo expanded NK cells in patients receiving busulfan-fludarabine with an allogeneic HLA matched  hematopoietic 
transplantation for myeloid malignancies.  Two sources of NK cells could be studied,  depending on what donor source is available: cells from the HLA 
matched related donor or cells from an unrelated cord blood  unit.
  For each source of NK cells we will determine:
  the maximum tolerated cell dose, 
  the phenotype and function of the ex vivo expanded NK cells and their survival in vivo and 
  the rate of engraftment, graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD), immune reconstitution,  relapse  rates and survival  for patients receiving  this regimen.
Rationale: (Be as concise as possible)
The study will test hypothesis is that the addition of ex vivo expanded NK cells will improve eradication  of myeloid  malignancies when added to a regimen of 
busulfan-fludarabine and allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation.  NK cells from different sources  may potentially be used,  each with different potential 
effects and toxicities.   The initial study will determine the safety and toxicities of NK-cells from the HLA matched donor  or an unrelated  cord blood 
unit.  Transplant outcomes  will be compared with historical controls receiving the same regimen  without NK cells.
 
Natural killer cells are a unique class of lymphocytes, with cytotoxic,  and immunoregulatory function  with potent antileukemia  effects.  NK cells are regulated  
by [CONTACT_733228]-ligand  interactions  and mediate cytotoxicity against certain HLA class I mismatched targets. By [CONTACT_733229], killing of tumor cells 
by [CONTACT_733230] a missing signal (or missing self) on the target  cells.   NK cytotoxicity in vitro is greatest from an HLA mismatched donor, but 
also occurs  with against  HLA matched targets.   
 
We performed a phase I study using  unexpanded NK cells, selected from peripheral blood of normal donors.   This approach is limited by [CONTACT_733231], which can be obtained from a normal donor. The addition of NK cells did not increase toxicity associated with hematopoietic 
transplantation.  We have  developed a system for ex vivo expansion of NK cells,  allowing large numbers to be manufactured  from a small  starting  population  
obtained by [CONTACT_48571].  This allows administration of up to [ADDRESS_1001869] with a phase  I/II study of these 
ex vivo expanded NK cells, and determine which source of cells will be most promising to improve progression free survival  in patients with high risk myeloid 
leukemias.

Preparative Regimen
Prior to initiating chemotherapy in this study,  all toxicities from prior systemic chemotherapy  must be resolved at least to grade 1. Flt3 or TKI inhibitors as well 
as intrathecal therapy, nonmyelosuppressive agents,  low dose cytarabine,  hydroxyurea are permitted if indicated  to control active leukemia, but must be 
stopped at least  [ADDRESS_1001873] dose can be administered as an outpatient or as an inpatient. The Busulfan “test dose”  of 32 mg/m2 will be based on actual body weight.  The 
infusion time will depend on the AUC – 60 min for AUC  4000 and 45 min for AUC 6000.   
D-13 to D-10 Fludarabine and Busulfan administration
Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 will be dosed per actual body weight/actual body surface area. No arbitrary  dose adjustment(s) based  are allowed. Fludarabine  is 
administered IV once  daily for 4 consecutive days, followed  by [CONTACT_733232].  
Busulfan adjusted dose is determined to achieve a systemic exposure represented  by [CONTACT_469102] 6000 microMol-min ± 5% for the entire 4-day 
treatment period.  Patients over age 60 and/or with performance status=2 will receive AUC of 4000 microMol-min ± 5% for each dose.  If it is not feasible to 
perform the pharmacokinetic studies, a Busulfan dose  of 130 mg/m2 should  be administered (100 mg/m2 for age over 60 or PS=2). 
The PK-guided daily high-dose Busulfan dose(s)  will be started immediately upon completion of the daily Flu doses.
D-8 Alloreactive NK infusion
Patients are premedicated with diphenhydramine  25 mg IVPB.  Corticosteroids will not be administered as premedication.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_733224]’s  bedside during the NK cell infusion to help treat any allergic reaction that might occur.
The alloreactive  NK cell infusion will be given at one of 4 dose  levels based on the number of NK cells (CD3-,CD 56+ cells)/kg  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_733225]. Dose  
levels are: 106, 107, 3 x 107, 108.  
For recipi[INVESTIGATOR_733226]  > 100 kg, the NK cell dose will be determined as if their body  weight is 100 kg.
Patients are premedicated with diphenhydramine  25 mg IVPB. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_733227]’s  bedside  during  the NK cell 
infusion to help treat any allergic  reaction  that might occur. For infusion, a normal  saline intravenous drip will be established.  The alloreactive  NK cells will be 
infused through this line without a filter under direct supervision  of the investigator or physician designee. 
Contingencies:   If the planned alloreactive NK cell product cannot be infused for any reason, such as the product not meeting release criteria, patients will 
skip the scheduled interleukin 2 administration  and continue the treatment plan as indicated for day -3, i.e.,  Thymoglobulin 1.5 mg/kg  for 3 days and PBSC  
transplantation.  (i.e., days  -8 to -4 will be deleted from the schedule). These patients  are considered  technical  failures of the procedure.
If the cell product contains greater than 106 NK cells/kg, but less than the specified cell dose, the cells will be infused, and evaluated  on an intent to treat 
basis.  
Unused NK cells not required for the described assays will be discarded.
If a positive  sterility culture is noted after infusion, the physician and the patient will be notified,  antibiotic  sensitivity of the organism will be determined. The 
patients will be evaluated with a blood culture and other studies as clinically  indicated and receive antibiotic  treatment as indicated.  Patients will be monitored 
for evidence  of infection.  The FDA and the IRB will be notified and the laboratory will investigate the source of contamination.
D-8 to D-4. Systemic Interleukin-2 treatment
Patients receive systemic interleukin-2 at a dose of 0.5 million units  subcutaneously for 5 doses.   The doses are given approximately daily starting  on day -8 
(approximately 2 hours after NK cell infusion and after resolution of any infusion  related  toxicities)  to day -4 to enhance the survival and cytotoxicity of the 
infused NK cells.    Because of scheduling related to the NK cell infusion, it may be necessary to give 2 doses of IL-2 within 24 hours;  however doses of IL-[ADDRESS_1001874] transplant cyclosphosphamide  and tacrolimus.
Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome positive acute leukemia  may receive tyrosine kinase  inhibitors as clinically indicated.

Statistical Considerations:
This study will be conducted on the Department of Biostatistics  Clinical  Trial Conduct (CTC) website.
This is a phase I/II dose-finding study to determine an optimal NK cell dose in each of three distinct patient subgroups, A = KIR mismatched haplo  donors, B = 
KIR mismatched cord blood donors, C = matched SIB donors. The same  dose-finding design will be used within  each subgroup.   Initial safety data from the 
Phase I study  will be collected in an initial cohort of several adult subjects  prior to enrolling any pediatric subjects.
Within each  donor type subgroup, dose-finding will be done as follows.  The Bayesian model averaging  continual  reassessment method, BMA-CRM, (Yin and 
Yuan, 2009) will be applied. The four NK cell doses  to be studied are: 106, 107, [ADDRESS_1001875] NK cell dose  level. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any of the following  events  occurring through day 42:  Graft  failure, severe (grade 3,4) 
infusional toxicity, grade  3 organ toxicity that is in excess of the expected frequency  for institutional norms, severe grade 4 organ toxicity, or death.  The 
targeted toxicity probability for applying the BMA-CRM  is 0.50.   For each group, the maximum  sample size will be 24, for up to 12 cohorts  of 2 patients each, 
consequently the maximum sample size in the entire study  thus will be 3*24=72 patients.  Two safety rules will be applied. 1) no untried dose may be skipped 
when escalating and 2) if the lowest dose  is unacceptably toxic (unsafe),  then accrual in that subgroup will be terminated  early  and no dose selected. 
Formally, denoting  the probability of toxicity at the lowest dose level by p1, the lowest  dose will be considered  unsafe if Pr{p1 > .50 |  data}  > .80.  If all three 
subgroups are due to safety terminated, the trial will be stopped.  Note: Effective 12/15/15, the haploidentical NK cell group was terminated  to allow the study 
to focus  on the two remaining groups.
BMA-CRM Model. To compute posterior  probabilities of toxicity for each dose  in subgroup, we adopt  the models in Yin and Yuan (2009) with the 
recommended prior distributions therein.  The two sets of probability rates  for the four doses,  which  were averaged, used in the simulation were (0.30, 0.40,  
0.50, 0.60)  and (0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40).  Simulation results establishing  the design’s properties for each subgroup under each of five potential  dose-toxicity  
scenarios are summarized in Table 1.  Each scenario was simulated 2000 times.   For each scenario,  the table includes the true probability of toxicity, pT, the 
proportion of trials that each dose was selected, and the average  number of patients treated at each dose.    
Patient Donor Type  Assignment Algorithm 
The following algorithm  will be used to assign  patient to the three donor groups {A,B,C} as they are accrued. 
1. At the start of the study, all three subgroups  are open.
2. If there are no acceptable doses within  a subgroup (see below), the subgroup will be permanently closed.
3. Once [ADDRESS_1001876] been evaluated  for DLT at day 42, that subgroup will be 
considered temporarily  closed.
5. Otherwise, the subgroup will be defined as open.  
Patients will be assigned to the subgroup as they are enrolled using the following algorithm:
1. If all three  subgroups are open, patients with a HLA matched sibling  will receive NK cells from that donor.   
2. Patients with an unrelated donor  may receive  NK cells from a cord blood unit, selected to provide the greatest KIR:KIR  ligand mismatch.  
3. If exactly one subgroup is open, new patients will be assigned to  that subgroup.
4. If no subgroups are open, the enrollment of new patients  must wait for at least one subgroup to open.
Secondary Outcomes.  Secondary  outcomes will include  overall survival time,  disease-free survival time,  and GVHD.  Grade  3 toxicities will be collected 
and we will determine if any occur in increased  frequency compared to historical  experience with this regime  without NK cells.
Data Analysis. The data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_733233], by [CONTACT_733234]-tabulated with dose, and fitting appropriate logistic or ordinal outcome regression models to assess possible patterns of change with 
dose.

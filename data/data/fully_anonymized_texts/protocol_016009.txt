CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY 
Amendment: 1 
Date: 30 July 2019 
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGES A summary of major changes covered by [CONTACT_216413] 1 to the 165-304 protocol is provided 
below.   
1. The study duration has been extended from approximately 61 weeks to 121 weeks. 
Rationale:  The study is ongoing and extending the duration should ensure that all subjects 
on the study continue to have access to pe gvaliase without involuntary drug holidays. 
2. Additional immunogenicity assays have been added. 
Rationale:  Because patients in 165-304 will receive pegvaliase doses higher than the 
currently approved maximum dose of 40 mg/day, more drug may be available to potentially 
combine with antibodies to form circula ting immune complexes (CICs), which could 
increase the risk of immune-mediated even ts. Therefore, additional immunogenicity 
evaluations have been added; the additional evaluations will be performed on samples already identified for collection in the protoc ol. No additional blood dr aws will be required. 
3. Changes were made to dosing exception la nguage for [ADDRESS_259998] who had transitioned 
from PAL-003 to 165-304 on a higher dose. 
Rationale:  In a parent study for PAL-003 (the phase 2 study PAL-002), dosing with 
pegvaliase was weight-based, and the maximum permitted dose early in the study was up to 5.0 mg/kg/week. One subject who continued on 120 mg/day dosing in PAL-003 based on the 
maximum reported body weight of ~220 kg and the demonstrated efficacy of that dose, has 
transitioned from PAL-003 into 165-304. The protoc ol is amended to remove reference to 
previous weight-based dosing while still including a dosing exception (not to exceed 120 mg/day dose) for this subject. In addition, the amendment sets the maximum dose increase that an investigator can request at “not to exceed 60 mg/day”, with the exception of the aforementioned patient. 
4. Study background information has been upda ted to reflect comme rcial approval of 
pegvaliase as an available treatment option for patients with PKU in the US and EU. 
5. Additional minor changes have  been made for purposes of consistency and clarity. 
Specific changes included in this amendment,  including the Synopsis, since the original 
protocol (dated 11 April 2018) are outlined in Section  24. DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

TITLE OF STUDY : An Open-label Extension Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of 
Subcutaneous Injections of Pegvaliase (> 40 mg/day Dose) in Adults with Phenylketonuria 
PROTOCOL NUMBER : 165-304 
STUDY SITES:  Up to 29 sites in the [LOCATION_002] 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : Phase 3 
STUDY RATIONALE : 
Study 165-304 is an open-label extension for subjects who participated in Studies PAL-003 and 
165-302 at doses > 40 mg/day. The objective is to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy in subjects 
treated at doses exceeding the approved pegvaliase labeled dose (the currently approved label 
specifies up to and including 40 mg/day dose only). 
Literature reports suggest the majority of adults with PKU cannot adhere to severe phenylalanine 
(Phe) intake restrictions. Even among adults reporting to adhere to severe Phe intake restrictions, the 
majority fail to maintain recommended blood Phe levels. Baseline blood Phe levels and diet from 
the literature and previous pegvaliase clinical studies confirm this finding among adult participants. Adults with PKU with poor metabolic control represent a patient population in great need of 
additional therapeutic options.  
OBJECTIVES : 
The primary objective of the study is: 
x To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of pegvaliase (> 40 mg/day dose) in adult 
patients with PKU 
The secondary objective of the study is: 
x To characterize dietary protein intake from medical food and from intact food during 
long-term treatment with pegvaliase (> 40 mg/day dose) in adult patients with PKU 
The exploratory objective of the study is: 
x To characterize the long-term immunogenicity profile of pegvaliase (> 40 mg/day dose) in 
adult patients with PKU  
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN : 
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_260000] at a dose of > 40 mg/day to 60 mg/day, inclusive. Dose regimens other than daily dosing at DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

receives a pegvaliase dose not to exceed 120 mg/day) may be allowed provided the investigator 
consults with the medical monitor and obtains approval from the medical monitor prior to starting 
the alternative regimen. Subjects will continue their prior pegvaliase dose regimen on the 165-[ADDRESS_260003] enrolled from the PAL- 003 study who receives a pegvaliase dose not to

option to transition to commercial drug. Dose re ductions may be performed if warranted due to 
adverse events (AEs) or hypophenylalaninemia. Dose increases to up to 60 mg/day may be performed per investigator discretion in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. Dosing 
will continue for approximately [ADDRESS_260005] the same day. Pegvaliase dosing should continue without interruption from the previous 
study; beginning on Day 1, subjects will receive the same dose and regimen of pegvaliase they were 
receiving in 165-[ADDRESS_260006] (or a subject-designated caregiver) must have met predefined self-administration criteria 
in PAL-003 or 165-302 to qualify for pegvaliase self-administration, including demonstrated 
working knowledge of the signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction, including 
anaphylaxis, and what to do if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. Eligible subjects (or 
caregivers) have been trained to self-administer pegvaliase. 
A competent adult will observe the subject during pegvaliase administration and for a minimum of 
1 hour following pegvaliase administration upon reintroduction of pegvaliase after resolution of a 
Grade 3 or higher hypersensitivity adverse event (HAE), any dose interruption of  4 days, and for a 
dose increase to 60 mg/day; administration of pegvaliase may only be performed if this person is 
present. Observations should be performed for all doses administered for 1 week after reintroduction of pegvaliase or a dose increase to 60 mg/day. Information and training on how to recognize a 
possible reaction, the severity of the reaction, and instructions on what to do if a reaction occurs will be provided to any person designated to observe the subject during pegvaliase administration.

medication (NSAID) is administered as a premedica tion, it should be given with food. Subjects may 
also be pre-medicated at any time in the study at the discretion of the investigator. Subjects are 
provided with a workbook to document the date and time of pegvaliase injections, the injection site, and suspected AEs. 
A subject’s ability to maintain a consistent diet is  essential for the success of the study by [CONTACT_216415]. A dietitian under investigat or supervision will manage subject diet for the 
entire duration of the study. Subjects are provided 3-day diaries in which all dietary protein intake 
(including medical food and intact food) must be recorded for 3 consecutive days immediately prior 
to each scheduled clinic visit for review with a dietitian. All subjects will be provided the option of 
tyrosine supplementation (500 mg, 3 times per day with  meals) at the discretion of the investigator. 
Subjects are instructed not to change their dietary protein intake during the study. 
Because the risks of taking pegvaliase during pregnancy and breastfeeding are unknown, subjects 
cannot take pegvaliase if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Subjects 
must be willing to use [ADDRESS_260009] use 2 acceptable methods of contraception. Subjects who are planning to become pregnant 
(or impregnate a female partner) may modify their diet in consultation with the investigator and/or study dietitian. Subjects who are confirmed to be  pregnant by a serum pregnancy test and are 
temporarily off pegvaliase are not required to perform the scheduled urine pregnancy tests. Subjects 
who are pregnant or are trying to conceive and have temporarily discontinued pegvaliase should not 
perform the scheduled pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments. Male subjects who have impregnated a 
female partner may re-start pegvaliase after conception following the investigator’s consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_7195]. Male subjects must use a barrier method for 
contraception prior to restarting pegvaliase. Female subjects who remain in the study after 
temporary discontinuation of pegvaliase due to pregnancy may restart pegvaliase dosing after a 
confirmed negative urine pregnancy test result, the birth (or termination of the pregnancy) has been 
reported, and breastfeeding has been completed (if applicable), or after the subject is no longer 
actively trying to conceive. Re-starting pegvaliase dosing requires prior consultation with the 
investigator and approval by [CONTACT_216416]. Female subjects must return to the 
protocol-required contraception use, which must include 1 barrier method, immediately after the 
birth (or termination of the pregnancy). DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

Except for subjects transitioning to commercial drug, if pegvaliase is discontinued before study 
completion, every effort will be made to maintain the subject in the study and continue study visits 
and assessments, provided the subject’s health, safety, and welfare are not detrimentally affected. 
In addition to BioMarin, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) monitors the safety of study 
subjects. The DMC is an independent committee that  acts in an advisory capacity to BioMarin. 
Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events 
Subjects are evaluated for safety throughout the study and are trained to recognize potential HAEs 
(including anaphylaxis) and how to respond. Subjects  are instructed to contact [CONTACT_216417]. After a telephone assessment, the investigator may require further evaluation at the clinic. If a hypersensitivity reaction (eg, injection-site reaction, rash, joint pain, itching) occurs, 
the subject may be advised to premedicate with H1 antagonist, H2 antagonist, and antipyretic 
(eg, acetaminophen) approximately 2 to 3 hours prior to subsequent pegvaliase doses. If NSAIDs 
are administered as a premedication, they should be given with food. 
HAEs, including anaphylaxis, are expected with pegvaliase administration. In response to a 
suspected HAE, pegvaliase dosing may be modified or halted depending on the severity of the event 
and suspected pegvaliase causality. Severity for HAEs will be per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) grades.

Once an AE (other than anaphylaxis) improves to grade 1 or resolves, the pegvaliase dose may be 
increased, maintained, or reduced, at the discretion of the investigator. If reduced, the recommended pegvaliase dose reductions include: from 60 mg/day to 40 mg/day, from 50 mg/day to 20 mg/day, or 
from 40 mg/day to 20 mg/day, with reductions from intermediate doses at the discretion of the 
investigator. If dosing has been interrupted due to an AE (other than anaphylaxis) and the investigator determines it is safe for the subject to resume dosing, the first dose after improvement

Response to Anaphylaxis 
If the investigator suspects that the event is ana phylaxis, the subject will be assessed in the clinic 
and the sponsor’s medical monitor should be immediately notified. Laboratory assessments for 
suspected anaphylaxis events should be performed prior to the next administration of pegvaliase 
(if applicable) and include anti-pegvaliase IgE (for optimal results, sampling must be performed 
> 8 hours after event onset) and tryptase (for optimal results, perform within 24 hours of event 
onset). If the investigator determines it is safe for the subject to resume dosing with pegvaliase 
following resolution of anaphylaxis, the dose level will be reduced as follows:

a Dose may be lowered further per investigator discretion. Dose frequency should be the same as the dose regimen at the 
time of anaphylaxis onset; however, dose frequency may be revised per investigator discretion and in consultation with the sponsor’s medical monitor. 
The first dose administered after resolution of anaphylaxis is to be administered at the clinic with 
equipment for emergency resuscitation (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) within easy access. Additionally, the

7 INTRODUCTION 
Phenylketonuria (PKU, OMIM 261600) is a rare au tosomal recessive genetic disorder that is 
characterized by [CONTACT_216423], phenylalanine (Phe), 
and is caused by [CONTACT_216424] (PAH). The 
estimated prevalence of PKU is 1 in  15,000 births in the [LOCATION_002] (NIHCDP, 2001) . 
PAH catalyzes the conversion of the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine, 
and this enzymatic activity is facilitated by [CONTACT_216425] (BH4). PAH deficiency results in abnormally elevated  concentrations of Phe. 
The pathophysiology of PKU is well understood. A substantial body of evidence confirms 
that elevated Phe is directly toxic to cells in  the brain, where it causes inhibition of protein 
synthesis in humans and animals (Wall, 1990) , affects the normal mor phology of myelinating 
proteins ( Dyer, 1996) , and leads to arrested or dela yed development of dendrites and 
synapses in the cerebral cortex (Huttenlocher, 2000) . Neuropathology in PKU has been 
shown to derive from oxidative stress, impaired neurotransmitter metabolism, impaired protein synthesis and lipid metabolism, and brain energy metabolism alterations 
(Schuck, 2015).  The neurotoxicity of elevated Phe is a direct effect of Phe itself 
(Kaufman, 1989) ; no abnormal Phe metabolites are observed in the PKU individual and 
normal Phe metabolites are toxic only at concentrations that are much higher than those reported in individuals with PKU. 
Without highly restricted Phe intake, individuals with PKU quickly reach and sustain toxic 
concentrations of blood Phe. Individuals with classic PKU may have a complete absence or 
profound deficiency of PAH and typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] s how very high elevations of blood Phe 
 1200 μmol/L). Uncontrolled blood Phe in adults is  associated with executive dysfunction 
and significant behavioral and psychiatric pr oblems, including depression and anxiety, and 
results in a negative impact on patient quality of life ( Moyle, 2007; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_216390], 1997; Smith, 2000; 
Waisbren, 1999;  Gassio, 2003) . High blood Phe levels negatively affect mood and ability to 
sustain attention in adults with PKU (ten Hoedt, 2011) . Studies have reported widespread 
correlations between improved cognitive performance in adults with PKU and control of blood Phe during their life span ( Palermo, 2017; Romani, 2017) . The prevalence of 
psychiatric and neurologic symptoms in adults  with PKU is higher than the US National 
Institutes of Health estimates for disease pr evalence in adults in the general population 
(NIMH, 2013) . 
The American College of Medical Genetics a nd Genomics (ACMG) practice guidelines for 
PKU recommend life-long management and maintenance of metabolic control as essential to optimal functioning of indivi duals with PKU, with a goal of maintaining blood Phe DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

older than 12 years (van Spronsen, 2017) . 
Historically the only treatment option ava ilable for patients with PKU was medical 
nutritional therapy (MNT) with severe restric tion of Phe intake, alone or as adjunct to 
Kuvan® (sapropterin 6R-tetrahydrobiopterin or 6R -BH4). Phe restriction with MNT involves 
consumption of semisynthetic medical foods that provide a source of Phe-free protein, 
modified low-protein foods, small amount of na tural protein (to provide required amounts of 
Phe), and other supplements (eg, vitamins, miner als) to correct nutriti onal deficiencies that 
can result from Phe restriction. MNT with seve re Phe restriction can help some patients 
control their blood Phe levels, although data show that even when PKU patients report 
adherence with MNT, many patients continue  to have very high  blood Phe levels of 
approximately 926 μmol/L ( Koch, 2002) , demonstrating that MNT is not an effective 
treatment option for many adults with PKU. For the majority of adults with PKU, chronic MNT with Phe restriction is not sustaina ble nor feasible as a treatment option (Walter, 2002; 
Burton, 2010).   
BioMarin has developed pegva liase, a genetically modified phenylalanine ammonia lyase 
(PAL) enzyme product of the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis  that is PEGylated to 
decrease immunogenicity and increase half -life, as a novel treatment for PKU.  
A brief review of pegvaliase (also referred to as rAvPAL-PEG or BMN 165) is provided 
below. A comprehensive review of pegvaliase is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure 
supplied by [CONTACT_189447]. Investigators are to review this document prior to initiating this study. 
7.1 Nonclinical Studies 
The nonclinical program was specifically designed  to support the chronic use of pegvaliase 
for PKU patients 16 years of age and older. Th e studies completed were comprehensive and 
included single and repeat-dos e pharmacodynamic (PD), safety  pharmacology, toxicokinetic 
and toxicity evaluations in ENU2 mice, and normal rats and monkeys. Developmental and 
reproductive toxicity studies were conducted in rats and rabbits. The pharmacological 
activity of pegvaliase was demonstrated in a rodent model of PKU, the ENU2 mouse. ENU2 
mice exhibit hyperphenylalaninemia similar to PKU patients and were utilized to help determine initial dose levels of pe gvaliase for clinical trials. All nonclinical studies used the 
subcutaneous (SC) route of ad ministration, and the results from these studies were used to 
inform the starting clinical dose of pegvaliase. DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

7.1.1 Pharmacology 
Pharmacology was assessed in the BTBR Pahenu2 (ENU2) mouse model of PKU. The ENU2 
mouse model exhibits characteristics similar to those of PKU patients, including 
hyperphenylalaninemia (baseline plasma  Phe concentrations of 1000 to 2000 PM) and 
hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371]. The repeat-dose studies in the BTBR Pahenu2 mouse demonstrated the 
pegvaliase-related pharmacological activity resulting in decreased plasma Phe levels. There were no pegvaliase-related effect s on respi[INVESTIGATOR_216391] a 
single SC administration to rats or cardiovascular parameters after a single SC administration to monkeys. 
7.1.2 Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pe gvaliase in rats, rabbits, and monkeys were similar to 
humans with respect to a 1-compartment model with 1
st order absorption and elimination. 
Time to maximum concentration (T max) and elimination half-life (t 1/2) were 1 to 3 days, and 
there was evidence of accumulation in a ll species. AUC and maximum observed plasma 
concentration (C max) were approximately dose proporti onal, with a high inter-animal 
variability in pegvaliase plasma levels at a given dose. Pegvaliase exposure decreased with multiple dosing, likely attributable to anti-dr ug antibody responses; exposures returned to 
levels comparable to Week 1 after Week 4 in the rat. Inter-animal variability in anti-drug antibody response and accumulation were high after repeat pegvaliase administration. 
7.1.3 Toxicology 
The nonclinical safety program for pegvaliase in cluded single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats and monkeys in order to char acterize the potential toxicity and exaggerated 
pharmacology of pegvaliase. Developmental a nd reproductive toxicity studies were also 
conducted in rats and rabbits. The studies included toxicological endpoints as well as 
toxicokinetic and immunogenicity parameters. Plasma Phe levels were also assessed as a primary PD endpoint. The main pegvaliase safety-related fi ndings identified from nonclinical 
studies were: (1) dose-dependent polyethylene glycol (PEG)-related findings, including 
vacuolation of renal tubu le cells and histiocytic cells, in the repeat-dose rat toxicity studies, 
(2) dose-dependent, pegvaliase-rel ated arterial inflammation in small arteries and arterioles

obtained following the first SC dose in the 26- week rat and 39-week monkey studies and the

patients are, respectively, 298 ng/mL (C max) and 50,658 ng-hr/mL (AUC 0-inf). A challenge 
with the safety factor determination was the high variability in exposure following repeat dosing in both animals and humans, believed to  be due to the generation of anti-drug 
antibodies that bind to and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_216392]. This initial reduction

PK data following the first dose (up to [ADDRESS_260043]-dose), where anti-drug antibody effect 
was negligible, and plasma drug levels were high. 
Given the nonclinical PK data and expected  Phase 3 exposure in humans based on PAL-001, 
safety factors calculated for peak exposure (C

anticipated human exposure based on rat and mo nkey data, respectively. On a systemic

7.3 Study Rationale 
Study 165-304 is an open-label extension for s ubjects who participated in Studies PAL-003 
and 165-302 at doses > 40 mg/day. The objective is to evaluate long-term safety and efficacy 
in subjects treated at doses exceeding the currently approved pegvaliase label (the label specifies up to and including 40 mg/day dose only). 
Literature reports suggest the ma jority of adults with PKU cannot  adhere to severe Phe intake 
restrictions (Cunningham, 2012).  Even among adults reporting to adhere to severe Phe intake 
restrictions, the majority fail to ma intain recommended blood Phe levels 
(Modan-Moses, 2007).  Baseline blood Phe levels and diet from previous pegvaliase clinical 
studies confirm this finding am ong adult participants. Adults with PKU with poor metabolic 
control represent a patient population in great  need of additional therapeutic options.

were 2 treatment options availa ble for patients with PKU: medical nutritional therapy (MNT) 
with Phe restriction, and sapr opterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan) as adjunct to MNT and Phe 
restriction. Most PKU patients re quire lifelong stringent Phe restriction and MNT to control 
blood Phe levels and to help pr event complications associated with high Phe levels in the 
brain. 
Uncontrolled blood Phe in adulthood is associat ed with impairment of neuropsychiatric, 
neurocognitive, and executive function, a heteroge neous variety of behavi oral and psychiatric 
problems including depression and anxiety, a nd negatively affects patient quality of life 
(Moyle, 2007; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_216390], 1997; Smit h, 2000; Waisbren, 1999; Gassio, 2003) . High blood Phe 
levels also negatively affect mood and the abilit y to sustain attention in adults with PKU 
(ten Hoedt, 2011).  Several interventional studies of rest ricted Phe intake to control blood Phe 
in adult PKU patients have shown improvements on neuropsyc hiatric and executive function 
domains when subjects are at  lower blood Phe levels ( Bilder, 2016) . These findings suggest DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5
 (165-304 Amendment 1)  Page [ADDRESS_260047] reported widespread correlations between cognitive performance in adults with PKU and control of Phe during their lifespan, suggesting that it is 
important to maintain low blood Phe through lif e in order to provide  optimal neurocognitive 
function ( Palermo, 2017; Romani, 2017) . 
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) practice guidelines 
recommend lifelong management of PKU, w ith a goal of maintaining blood Phe 
concentrations PRO/ Vockley, 2014) . Similar European guidelines for the

7.4.[ADDRESS_260048] patients, and 
addition of Kuvan to treatment is only effec tive in a sub-population of patients with less 
severe PKU (Blau, 2015) . 
Medical Nutritional Therapy (MNT) Although strict adherence to Ph e restriction and MNT can be ef fective in lowering blood Phe 
levels and preventing the severe  neurological consequences of  high blood Phe levels, most 
adult PKU patients are unable to maintain target blood Phe levels  with restriction in protein 
intake alone, as lifelong restri ction of natural protein and a dherence to MNT imposes such a 
personal and social burden that it becomes prac tically impossible to sustain for the vast 
majority of subjects. For the majority of adults  with PKU, chronic MNT with Phe restrictions 
is not sustainable nor feasible as a trea tment option as most foods contain protein 
(Walter, 2002; Burton, 2010) . In a study monitoring adherence to a lo Z3KHGLHWRIWKH
adult PKU population were not maintaining nutritiona l low-Phe restrictions  (Walter, 2002).  
The stringent MNT with onerous Phe-restricti on proscribes consumption of natural protein 
such as meat, fish, chicken, eggs, nuts, beans,  milk, and other dairy pr oducts as well as many 
higher protein grains and starches, thus si gnificantly limiting food choices. In addition, PKU 
patients require conco mitant administration of  unpalatable synthetic Phe-free amino acid 
supplements to ensure adequate  nutritional intake of protei n. The stringent MNT has been 
found to cause nutritional deficiencies (eg, in vitamin B12 and other B vitamins, vitamin D, 
folate, calcium, and iron with associated health  consequences), as well as social isolation 
related to the important role of  food in our social interacti ons, the time burden of planning, 
assessing, calculating, and recording food intake, and the very limited number of natural DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

foods that can be eaten (MacDonald, 2016) . PKU patients also suffer the impact of 
significant risk factors for non-PKU morbidity re lated to MNT, such as obesity, bone disease 
and dietary deficiencies, which result from a lifetime of attempted and increasingly unachievable control of Phe intake. 
In addition, chronically elevated blood Phe le vels can, by [CONTACT_216426], potentially create a negative cycle of worsening disease control. Tasks such as m onitoring dietary Phe intake, menu planning, 
avoiding prohibited foods, re membering to order MNT and lo w protein foods, and attending 
clinical appointments and routine blood testing vi sits may all be compromised by [CONTACT_216427]. 
Sapropterin Dihydrochloride (Kuvan) Sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan) is a synthe tic oral formulation of BH4, which works by

9.1.1 Response to Hypersensitivity Adverse Events 
Subjects are evaluated for safety throughout all parts of the study and are trained to recognize 
potential HAEs (including a serious anaphylaxis)  and how to respond. Subjects are instructed 
to contact [CONTACT_216432]. After a telephone assessment, the 
investigator may require further evaluation at the clinic. If a hypersensitivity reaction (eg, injection-site reaction, rash, joint pain, itching) occurs, the subject may be advised to 
premedicate with H1 antagonist, H2 anta gonist, and antipyretic (eg, acetaminophen) 
approximately 2 to 3 hours prior to subsequent pegvaliase doses. If NSAIDs are administered 
as a premedication, they should be given with food. 
Hypersensitivity AEs, including anaphylaxis, are expected with pegvaliase administration. 
Pegvaliase dosing in response to a suspected HAE may be modified or temporarily halted 
depending on the severity of the event and susp ected pegvaliase causality. Severity for HAEs 
will be per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) grades (refer to Section  10.1) .

destroyed or missing study drug or study materials. 
Unused study drug may be destroyed on site, per the site’s standard operating procedures, but 
only after BioMarin has granted approval for dr ug destruction. The monitor must account for 
all study drug in a formal reconciliation proce ss prior to study drug destruction. All study 
drug destroyed on site must be documented. Do cumentation must be provided to BioMarin 
and retained in the investigator study files.  If a site is unable to destroy study drug 
appropriately, the site can return unused st udy drug to BioMarin’s designated Drug 
Destruction Facility upon request. The return of study drug or study drug materials must be 
accounted for on a Study Drug Return Form provided by [CONTACT_189447]. 
Subjects are provided instructions for returning unused study drug prefilled syringes and for 
proper disposal of used study drug prefilled syringes or study drug materials. 
All study drug should be store d, inventoried, reconciled, and dest royed or returned according 
to applicable state and federal regulations and study procedures.

x Complications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedur es, medication washout, or no-treatment 
run-in). 
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. 
For this study, a medical device is defined as  the prefilled syringe and all of the component 
parts. Adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_216441], including 
malfunction, injury, or medication er ror, will be captured as AEs.

Note: Life-threatening refers to an event that places the patient at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
x Requires or prolongs in-p atient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
x Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
x Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect in th e child or fetus of a subject exposed to IP 
prior to conception or during pregnancy 
x Is an important medical event or reaction – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the patient or require inte rvention to prevent one of the above 
consequences (eg, anaphylaxis) 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria fo r SAEs should be regarded as non-serious AEs. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_260096] (AESI) 
For this protocol, anaphylaxis per NIAID/FA AN criteria for the clinical diagnosis of 
anaphylaxis is designated an AESI (serious or nonserious and irrespective of severity) to 
facilitate rapid repor ting and sponsor review. All occurrences of anaphylaxis per 
NIAID/FAAN criteria will be reported to the s ponsor within 24 hours of the site becoming

assess AEs for severity, relationship to stud y drug, and seriousness (refer to Section  10.1.2 
for SAE definitions). These assessments shoul d be made by a study clinician with the 
training and authority to make a diagnosis (eg, MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse 
practitioner, or DDS). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Seriousness 
The investigator will assess if an AE shoul d be classified as “serious” based on the 
seriousness criteria enumerated in Section  10.1.2.  Seriousness serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity 
Severity (as in mild, mode rate, or severe headache) is not e quivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on patient/event  ou tcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. The severity of each will be assessed using the defined categories in  Table [IP_ADDRESS].1.  
The investigator will determine the severity of each AE, SAE, and AESI using the 
NCI-CTCAE v5.0. Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v5.0 as stated below.

vomiting should not be recorded in the same  entry, but as 2 separate entries). 
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferre d terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_216443], using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
Using accepted medical terminology, enter the diagnosis (if known). If not known, enter 
sign(s) and/or symptom(s). If a diagnosis subseq uently becomes available, then this diagnosis 
should be entered on the AE form, replacing  the original entries where appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events 
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other ev ents (eg, cascade events) should be identified 
by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if se vere diarrhea is known to have resulted in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. However, medically important events that may be linked an d/or separated in time should be recorded as 
independent events on the eCRF. For example, if  severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, 
both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends con tinuously, without resolution, between subject 
evaluation time points. Such an event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its 
severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF). 
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but 
then subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of  the AE should be individually recorded as a 
separate event on the AE eCRF. DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

[IP_ADDRESS]  Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Laboratory test results will be recorded on the laboratory results pages of the eCRF, or 
appear on electronically produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the central laboratory, if applicable. 
Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the cr iteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF. 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be doc umented as an AE if it is not otherwise 
refuted by a repeat test to confirm the a bnormality and any 1 or more of the following 
conditions is met: 
x Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
x Leading to a change in study medicati on (eg, dose modification, interruption or 
permanent discontinuation) 
x Requiring a change in concomitant therapy (eg, addition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment). 
x The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
x The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management (eg, change of dose, 
discontinuation of study drug, more fr equent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc.) 
This applies to any protocol and non-protocol specif ied safety and efficacy laboratory result 
from tests performed after the first dose of stud y medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clinical significance criteria. 
This does not apply to any abnormal laborat ory result that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_760], or those which are a result of an AE that has already 
been reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pre-existing Conditions 
A pre-existing condition is one that is present at  the start of the study. Such conditions should 
be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF. 
A pre-existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the c ondition worsens during the study period. It is DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy 
Pregnancy in either a subject or the partner of  a subject who has taken study drug should be 
reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aw are of the pregnancy. The pregnancy should 
be reported by [CONTACT_216444] (BPV) and completing the pregnancy eCRF in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. The investigator must make every effort to follow the subject through 
resolution of the pregnancy (delivery or ter mination) and to report the resolution on the DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, shou ld always be classified as an SAE (as the 
sponsor considers these to be medically significant), recorded on the eCRF, and 
expeditiously reported to the sponsor as an SAE. 
10.4 Reporting Requirements 
The sponsor is responsible for identifying, pr eparing, and reporting a ll suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees, and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in the clinical trials regulations. 
10.4.1  Expedited Reporting Requirements 
All SAEs and AESI that occur during the c ourse of the AE Reporting Period (refer to 
Section  10.2.1) , whether or not considered related to st udy drug, must be reported by [CONTACT_216445]. The SAE report form must be submitted to BPV within [ADDRESS_260103] 
information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of an SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is importa nt that investigators submit any information 
requested by [CONTACT_189463]. 
Adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_189674] (ie, prefilled syringe), 
including malfunction, injury, or medication erro r, will be captured in in the EDC system. 
All serious events related to the device will be reported to BPV within [ADDRESS_260104] administration of study drug or study discontinuation/terminati on, whichever is longer.

record to facilitate source data verification. 
The investigator should follow all unresolved SAEs to resolution, unless the subject is lost to 
follow up, or it has been deter mined that the study treatment  or participation was not the 
cause of the SAE.  Resoluti on of the SAE (with dates) s hould be documented on the AE 
eCRF and the SAE report form, as  well as the subject's medical record to facilitate source 
data verification. 
For some SAEs, the sponsor may follow up by  [CONTACT_756], fax, elect ronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details  (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant 
report, or autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report. 
10.[ADDRESS_260107] to report, to the 
investigator and/or to BPV directly, any subs equent SAEs that the subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment. 
The investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or terminated st udy participation, if the investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have  been related to prior stud y treatment. The sponsor should 
also be notified if the inves tigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subseque ntly conceived offspring of a subject that participated in 
this study.

16 COMPENSATION, INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY 
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. BioMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/IEC/REB 
approval, BioMarin may reimburse  the reasonable cost of travel for study-related visits in 
accordance with BioMarin’s study-specific trav el and reimbursement policy. BioMarin will 
not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, or trea tments for medical problems of any sort related 
solely to the study subject’s disease. Costs as sociated with such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, and 
treatments should be billed and co llected in the way that such costs are usually billed and 
collected outside the study. 
The investigator should contact [CONTACT_189471] a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_216451]. Any 
subject who experiences a study-related injury sh ould be instructed by [CONTACT_216452] a pre-specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment facility, if necessary . The subject should be given the name [CONTACT_4007] a 
person to contact [CONTACT_216453], and assistance with, treatment for 
study-related injuries. The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the cost of the 
medical treatment is not covered by [CONTACT_216454], then either BioMarin or the institution may pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by  [CONTACT_191684]. In some 
jurisdictions, BioMarin is obligated by [CONTACT_216455]-related injuries without prior 
recourse to third party payer billing and/or regardless of fault. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law. DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

be trained on the application and will enter th e clinical data from source documentation. 
Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable. 
In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be 
corrected by [CONTACT_216456]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, the system will require the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction and the identity of the operator. 
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the e CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, 
which necessitates access to all original record ings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data shoul d be attributable (signed and dated). The investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If direct source document verification of study data by [CONTACT_216457], then the investigator must make available facilities and/or personnel to allow GCP-compliant source verificati on to occur. Examples of such methods include certified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_216406], or other GCP-compliant means agreed between the investigator and the sponsor. 
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_216458] “Source Data Verified” (SDV). If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personnel will then answer the query by [CONTACT_189477]. 
The CRA will then review the response and dete rmine either to close the query or re–query 
the site if the response does not fully address the question. This process is repeated until all 
open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook can be locked, da ta fields must be source data verified and 
all queries closed. Refer to the Study Monitori ng Plan for details on which fields must be 
source data verified. The Data Manager, or designee, will then set the status of the forms, DocuSign Envelope ID: D7A66402-315A-4939-8858-10F8915CA3E5

Medical Need and Current Treatment Options Sapropterin dihydrochloride (Kuvan) is a synthetic oral formulation of BH4, which works by [CONTACT_216461] (Blau, 2015). Kuvan is approved for children and adults in the United 
States for the treatment of BH4-responsive PKU in conjunction with Phe-restricted intake, and in the European Union for 
BH4-responsive PKU and BH4 deficiency.

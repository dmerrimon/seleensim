ABSTRACT  
Primary intracranial germ cell tumors ( GCTs ) represent 3 -5% of all central nervous system 
(CNS ) tumors and occur most commonly in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_750680] a male 
preponderance. Germinomas account for approximately two -thirds of intracranial GCT s and the 
remaining third are non-germinomatous germ cell tumors ( NGGCT s). 
1-4 NGGCTs include 
endodermal sinus tumor or yolk sac tumor (YST), choriocarcinoma (CC), embryonal carcinoma 
(EC) and more commonly mixed malignant germ cell tumors. GCTs may secrete measurable proteins into the blood and/ or cerebro -spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] ( CSF). Human chorionic gonadotropin- beta
 
(hCGβ) and alpha -fetoprotein (AFP) are internationally used for diagnostic purposes . 1,5-7 
Moderate elevat ion of hCGβ only in serum and/ or CSF with characteristic neuroimaging features 
is considered diagnostic for bifocal germinoma and a biopsy is generally not mandated.  
Abnormal AFP levels and/or hCGβ  levels  in the serum or CSF  >50 mIU/mL are generally 
consi dered to be consistent with NGGCT s and a biopsy is not required for diagnosis. However, 
biopsied germinomas have been reported to secrete hCGβ levels of up to 200 mIU/mL with no adverse impact upon survival . 
8,9 Surgery/tis sue biopsy is required for diagnosis in the absence of 
tumor marker elevation.  
 
The late effects of craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25332] ( CSI) have long been recognized, particularly in 
children.  Long -term sequelae include auditory and visual impairment, endocrine and 
neurocognitive dysfunction and secondary malignancies . 23-25, 10-[ADDRESS_1027777] and germinoma. Localized disease as defined by [CONTACT_750742], pi[INVESTIGATOR_750681], both (bifocal), or elsewhere within the ventricles.  
 The objective of this study is to investigate whether pre- radiation therapy followed by [CONTACT_750743] (RT) will yield a high progression free survival (PFS) while reducing the

risk of long term neurocognitive sequelae and maintaining quality of life (QoL). Cognitiv e, 
social, emotional and behavioral functioning will be evaluated and longitudinally modeled for all 
patients (on both strata) using the ALTE07C1 protocol.  
 
This study consists of 2 treatment strata:  Stratum 1 for patients with localized NGGCTs and 
Stratu m 2 for patients with localized germinomas.  Treatment for NGGCTs (Stratum 1) will 
determine, as measured by [CONTACT_941] 3 -year progression -free survival (PFS) rate, whether dose and 
volume of irradiation can be safely reduced to 30.6 Gy whole ventricular field irr adiation (WVI)  
and 23.[ADDRESS_1027778] in the subgroup of children and young adults (ages 3- 21 yrs) with 
localized NGGCT who have  a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed complete response 
(CR) or partial response (PR) in response to induction c hemotherapy and negative serum and 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) tumor markers or in patients who have less than a PR after induction 
therapy with negative tumor markers who undergo second- look surgery and are found to have 
only mature teratoma, residual scar or fibrosis  and meet the criteria for CR or PR.   
 
Treatment for germinoma (Stratum 2)  will determine, as measured by [CONTACT_941] 3 -year PFS rate, 
whether simplified chemotherapy prior to dose -reduced radiation therapy is effective for treating 
children and young adults (ages 3 -21 yrs) with localized germinoma who present with serum and 
CSF hCGβ ≤ 50  mIU/ml . PFS and survival distributions of localized germinoma patients who 
present with serum and/or CSF hCGβ > 50 mIU/ml and ≤ 100 mIU/ml will be estimated .

1.0 GOALS A ND OBJECTIVES (SCIENTIFIC AIMS)  
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 
1.1.1  
To determine, as measured by [CONTACT_941] 3 -year progression -free survival (PFS) rate  and 
patterns of failure , whether dose and volume of irradiation can be safely reduced 
to 30.6 Gy whole ventricular fi eld irradiation (WVI) plus 23.[ADDRESS_1027784] instead of 36 Gy craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25360] (CSI) plus primary site boost in 
the subgroup of children and young adults (ages 3 to ≤ 21 years) with localized 
non-germinomatous germ cell tumor (NGGCT) who h ave a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and tumor marker criteria (CSF and serum) for confirmed 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to induction chemotherapy and 
negative serum and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) tumor markers OR in patients who have less than a PR after induction chemotherapy with negative tumor markers 
who undergo a second -look surgery and are found to have only mature teratoma, 
residual scar or fibrosis and fit the definition of CR/PR after second -look surgery.  
 
1.1.2  
To determine,  as measured by [CONTACT_941] 3- year PFS rate  and patterns of failure, 
whether simplified chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_2715]-reduced radiation therapy is 
effective for treating children and young adults (ages 3 to ≤ 21 years) with 
localized primary central nervous system  (CNS) germinoma who present with 
serum and/or CSF  human chorionic gonadotropin -beta (hCG β) ≤ 50  mIU/ml.  
 
1.1.3  
To prospectively evaluate and longitudinally model the cognitive, soci al, and 
behavioral functioning of children and young adults who are treate d with reduced 
radiation dose and volume  of irradiation in Stratum 1 (NGGCT) and with dose -
reduced radiation therapy  in Stratum 2 (Germinoma) using the ALTE07C1 
protocol. This objective will be assessed independently for  the two strata.  
 
1.2 Secondary Obje ctives  
 
1.2.1

2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Stratum 1: Localized Non -Germinomatous Germ Cell Tumors (N GGCT ) 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_1027785] recent and  completed Children’s Oncology Group ( COG ) ACNS0122 trial 
for NGGCT patients used a combinatio n of carboplatin/etoposide alternating 
with ifosfamide/etoposide for a total of 6 induction cycles.  Due to the safety and 
efficacy of this chemotherapy regimen and in an attempt to maintain a relevant comparison group, the current pr otoco l’s NGGCT stratum  will use the same 
chemotherapeutic agents as ACNS0122.   
 
2.1.2  Role of Chemoradiotherapy  
Radiation therapy (RT) plays an important role in the treatment of NGGCT; 
however, regimens that use RT alone have only achieved 5- year OS rates of 
20%- 40%, and most  patients relapse within [ADDRESS_1027786] of care. Since CSI and whole brain irradiation (WBI) are 
associated with significant late effects, minimizing exposure to RT by [CONTACT_750744] . 10-12  COG 
Study ACNS0122 utilized 36 Gy CSI with IFR to 54 Gy following 6 cycles  of 
induction chemotherapy, and this resulted in a 2- year PFS and OS of 84.4 +/ - 4% 
and 93 +/ - 3%, respectively . 28-31 In the Société Internationale d’Oncologie 
Pédiatrique (SIOP) CNS GCT -96 trial (n=172), those patients with localized 
disease (n=135) received 4 courses of chemotherapy (cisplatin, ifosfamide and etoposide) followed by [CONTACT_750745] 54 Gy. At a median follow -up of 39 months, the 
reported PFS for the patie nts with localized disease  was 69 + 5%. There were [ADDRESS_1027787] study group treated “int ermediate prognosis” 
patients with 5 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide followed by [CONTACT_750746] 30.6 Gy and IFR to 50 Gy and showed a 10- year PFS and OS rates of 81.5% and 89.3%, 
respectively . 
8,9 Patients with predominantly malignant germ cell tumor elements 
formed the Japanese “poor prognosis group” and  were treated with 3 cycles of 
ifosfamide, cisplatin, etoposide and CSI. They received an additional 5 cycles of 
the same chemotherapy after CSI. The 10 -year PFS and OS rates we re 58.8% and 
62.7%, respectively . 8,9  
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027788] patients based upon 
different risk groups such as tumor histology, serum and/or CSF tumor markers 
(AFP and hCGβ) and responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy gives insight into 
what subgroups are most appropriate for reduced radiation . Response to 
induction chemotherapy has most consistently proven prognostic in previous clinical trials and se ems most appropriate for stratification of patients. Of the [ADDRESS_1027789] ’[ADDRESS_1027790] half (47%) relapsed and had a much worse PFS (37 + 10%) 
compared to those patients in CR post -chemoradiotherapy (86 + 4%). 33 In the 
Japanese cooperative group study, for  “intermediate -risk” group patients, only [ADDRESS_1027791] patients received 
four cycles of carboplatin, etoposide and bleomycin. Patients with less than CR received two additional cycles intensified by [CONTACT_207135]. All 5 patients 
with less than CR die d of disease progression compared to 15 out of 21 (71.4%) 
patients with CR who were alive without disease at two years from diagnosis . 
[ADDRESS_1027792] 
patients were treated with two to five courses of cisplati n, etoposide, 
cyclophosphamide and bleomycin. Of the 17 assessable patients for response, 11 
achieved CR after two courses and five achieved PR. T he median PFS and OS in 
CR group were 62 and 75 months, respectively, compared to 23 and 41 months in the PR group . 
18 Although the complete response rates to chemotherapy in these 
studies were very promising (65 to 76%), survival data in the PR group were less 
so, as a result of a chemotherapy only strategy.  
 
The data released documenting the outcomes of patients enrolled on COG 
ACNS0122 are very promising for pa tients who achieved a CR (complete 
radiographic and tumor marker response) and PR (>65% reduction in measurable disease radiographically and normalization of tumor markers) after induction chemotherapy.  Of the [ADDRESS_1027793] localized tumors. Twenty five of 79 patients (31.65%) achieved a CR and 
17 of 79 (21.5%) achieved a PR at the end of induction. Of the [ADDRESS_1027794] had 
only a m ature teratoma, residual scar or fibrosis  on pathology . The median 
follow -up time for the 64 patients without an event is 3.5 years (range: 73 days to 
6 years).  Three -year EFS were 92%, 94.1% and 85.7% for these three groups, 
respectively, without a stati stical difference in outcomes among the three groups. 
Hence, based on these excellent outcomes in these three groups in ACNS0122,

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
we hypothesize that those patients with a CR or PR to induction chemotherapy 
(see Section 10 for response definition) and pati ents whose second -look surgery 
confirms mature teratoma or scar/fibrosis would be the appropriate group to safely reduce dose and volume of irradiation.

been 21 second -look surgeries on 19 patients.  The pathology on these surgeries 
included 13 teratomas (4 growing teratoma syndrome), [ADDRESS_1027796] . 31

chemotherapy follow ed by [CONTACT_750747] a means of reducing radiation doses 
and/or volume while maintaining high cure rates . 46,47 The finding of relapses within the 
ventricles (but outside the local radiation field) in multiple studies has induced the SIOP, 
French Society of Pediatric Oncology (SFOP), and Japanese Brain Tumor clinical trial 
groups to change from IFR t o WVI following chemotherapy for non -metastatic CNS 
germinoma . 7,48,49  
 Local control rates within the irradiated whole ventricular volume remain over 90%.  In addition, most relapsing patients are successfully salvaged with chemotherapy and/or RT .

that chemoth erapy in  germinoma can be safely simplified using a combination of 
carboplatin and etoposide with the advantage of easier out -patient administration when 
appropriate and reduced risk of hyperhydration- associated metabolic complications while 
still maintain ing high cure rates with a  potentially  lower risk of late effects.  
 
2.2.1  Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG & hCGβ) and Need for Tissue D iagnosis  
There are conflicting data regarding the maximum level of hCGβ in germinoma 
and its prognostic significance. S awamura et al reported that 14 of 74 germinoma 
patients had elevated hCG serum levels between 5 -200 mIU/ml. The 10 -year OS 
for patients with germinoma with normal serum hCG  was 90%, which was 
significantly higher than the 60% for patients with hCGβ -secreti ng germinomas . 
61 However , in a retrospective review of germinoma patients with (n=39) and 
without (n=131) hCGβ elevation, no statistical difference in response  to 
chemotherapy, clinical outcome or rate of recurrence was found . [ADDRESS_1027801] study group currently treats all localized 
germinoma patients (regardless of the level of hCGβ secretion) with the same 
regimen consisting of 3 cycles of carboplatin and etoposide followed by [CONTACT_750748] 
a dose of 24 Gy.7 
 
Based on these data and intensive review within the CNS study committee, the present study ’s Stratum 2  (Germinoma)  will include patients with elevations of 
s e r um  o r  C S F  hC G β  l e v e l s  up t o  1 0 0 m I U / m l  pr o v i de d A F P  l e v e l s  a r e  i n t he  
normal range .  
 
2.2.2  Subclinical Ventricular M etastases and Bifocal Germinoma  
Chemotherapy serves two roles defined by [CONTACT_750749]: chemotherapy 
may eradicate neuraxis and extra -CNS metastatic disease outside of the volume 
of irradiation and it may redu ce the tumor burden or increase the sensitivity of 
tumor cells to irradiation within the irradiated volume. The burde n of metastatic 
disease that may be eradicated using chemotherapy and volume of residual tumor or magnitude of the response to chemotherapy that allows lower doses of 
irradiation to be utilized are unknown. That ventricular irradiation is critical to the s uccess of combined modality regimens suggests that subclinical ventricular 
metastatic disease is present at the time of diagnosis in a significant proportion of patients and that current chemotherapy regimens are inadequate to eradicate this subclinical disease. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_750686], metastatic disease will be defined as neuroimaging 
evidence of intracranial or spi[INVESTIGATOR_750687] a lumbar puncture. Therefore, 
intraoperative or endoscopic observed studding of ventricles alone (without 
evidence of seeding on MRI or CSF) will NOT  be used to classify patients as 
having metastatic disease. Similarly, patients with bifocal lesi ons (pi[INVESTIGATOR_750688]) fare as well as those with unifocal lesions when treated with chemotherapy and ventricular irradiation . 
49,64,65 These patients will be eligible

for study participation and, in accordance with the SFOP and SIOP approach, a 
biopsy will NOT  be required if the clinica l presentation (evidence of DI in 
particular) and imaging characteristics are typi[INVESTIGATOR_750689]β ≤ 50mIU/ml. Germinoma located within a ventricle with 
unifocal parenchymal extension will also be treated as localized germinoma.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1027802] functional capacity well into adulthood. 
72-74 A retrospective study evaluating long -term QOL in 52 germinoma survivors 
into adulthood identified significant problems: only 6 of 44 patients were marri ed, 21 patients had no occupation and 7 of 11 formerly employed patients 
had left their jobs .
66  
 
The literature on neurocognitive and quality of life outcomes specifically among 
survivors of CNS Germ Cell tumors is limited, and the findings to date are based 
on reports with small sample size and/or retrospective methodology. The 
majority of these reports indicate at least some degree of cognitive impairment . 
75-77 More recently, O’Nei l et al [ADDRESS_1027803]. The resulting longitudinal models will describe changes in neurocognitive 
function. These models will also provide the means of exploring associations of 
covariates such as tumor location, age and the dose/volume of irradiation with 
outcomes.

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and 
up to 1 week for surgery) for valid cl inical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where 
explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1027820] begin therapy within 31  days of definitive diagnostic surgery or clinical 
diagnosis  and 5 calendar  days from enrollment on study. Each subsequent cycle of 
Induction c hemotherapy will begin when ANC > 1,000/ µL and platelets > 100,0 00/µL and 
when off filgrastim (G -CSF) for at least 48 hours  (if applicable) . 
 
Cycle A:  (21 Days)   
Carboplatin (600 mg/m2/dose ) Day 1  
Etoposide (150 mg/m2/dose ) Days 1 -3  
 
Cycle B:  (21 Days)   
 Ifosfamide (1800 mg/m2/dose ) Days 1 -5

Growing Teratoma Syndrome  
Second -look surgery is strongly recommende d in patients with normalization of markers 
who fail to achieve a radi ographic CR or PR to induction chemotherapy and in patients 
with increasing size of the mass on MRI scan and negative markers at any time during 
Induction chemotherapy. If a mature teratoma and/or fibrosis are removed, the patient 
remains on protocol and s hould continue therapy as planned. R esponse should be 
assessed according to the radiographic and tumor marker response criteria listed  in 
Section 10 .

second -look surgery (and have histology consistent with fibrosis, scar or mature teratoma) 
will then proceed to radiation therapy as above.  
 Patients with positive markers  or who have < PR after  induction  chemotherapy /second -look 
surgery will be removed from protocol therapy.   
 
Patients  with residual viable malignant elements (except mature teratoma) on second -look 
surgery will be removed from protocol therapy.   
 Patients who are unable to undergo a second -look surgery due to safety or other reasons, 
will be taken off protocol therapy if they do not meet criteria for PR/CR (imaging and 
tumor markers).

4.3 Stratum 1 (NGGCT) Administration Guidelines for Induction 
4.3.1  Cycle A  (Cycles 1, 3, 5)  
 
CARBO platin : IV over 15 -60 minutes  
Day: 1 
Dose: 600 mg/m2/dose  
 
Avoid use of aluminum containing needles or administration sets.  
 Medication errors have oc curred due to confusion between CISplatin 
(Platinol
®) and CARBOplatin (PARAplatin®). 
  
Etoposide : IV over 60 -120 minutes  
Days: 1 -3 
Dose: 150 mg/m2/dose 
 
Infuse diluted solution (concentration  ≤ 0.4 mg/mL) over at least 60 -120 minutes; 
slow rate of adminis tration if hypotension occurs. Rate should not exceed 
300 mg/m2/hour (10  mg/kg/hour) (hypotension risk). The use of an in -line filter 
during the infusion is suggested.  
 
Special precautions:  Etoposide can be mixed in 0.9% NaCl or D 5W. Avoid use of 
large vol umes of D 5W due to potential development of hyponatremia.  
 
Stability:  Leaching of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) from PVC bags occurred with 
etoposide 0.4  mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl solution. To avoid leaching, prepare the 
etoposide solution as close as possible, p referably within 4  hours, to the time of 
administration or alternatively as per institutional policy. Glass or polyethylene -
lined (non- PVC) containers and polyethylene -lined tubing may be used.

4.3.3 Cycle B (Cycles 2, 4, 6)  
 
Ifosfamide : IV over 60 minutes  
Days: 1-5 
Dose: 1800 mg/m2/dose 
 
Suggest ed hydration:  Administer 3,000  mL/m²/day (125  mL/m²/hour) using fluid containing 
D5W / 0 . 4 5 %  N a C l  o r  0 . 9 %  N a C l .  A c h i e v e  u r i n e  s p e c i f i c  g r a v i t y  ≤  1.010 prior to start of 
ifosfamide. Monitor for adequate urine output as per institution guidelines. May use diuretics (eg, 
furosemide) to increase urine output. Consider adding potassium and magnesium to prevent 
electrolyte deficiencies.  
 
Etoposide:  IV over 60 -120 minutes* 
Days: 1 -5 
Dose: 100 mg/m2/dose 
 
Note : Infuse as diluted solution (concentration ≤ 0.4 mg/mL); *slow rate of administration if 
hypotension occurs. Rate should not exceed 300 mg/m2/hour (10 mg/kg/hour) (hypotension risk). 
The use of an in -line filter during the infusion is suggested.  
 
Special precautions : Etoposide can be mixed in 0.9% NaCl or D 5W. Avoid use of large volumes of 
D5W due to potential development of hyponatremia.  
 
Mesna: IV (short or continuous infusion)  
Days: 1-5 
Total Dose: 1800 mg/m2/day  
 
IV short or continuous infusion:  For prophylaxis of hemorrhagic cystitis, the total daily mesna 
dose is equal to 100% of the daily ifosfamide dose. Mesna can be administered in 5  divided doses 
by [CONTACT_750752] 15 to 30  minutes. The initial bolus dose of mesna may be 
administered 15  minutes before or at the same time as the ifosfamide dose; subsequent doses are 
given 3, 6, 9, and 12  hours after the start of ifosfam ide.   
 
For example: if the ifosfamide dose is 1 000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 1 000 mg; 
200 mg of mesna will be given 15  minutes before or with the ifosfamide dose (Hour  0) and 
4 boluses of 200  mg each will be given at Hours  3, 6, 9 and 12.  
 This total daily dose of mesna can also be administered as IV continuous infusion. The 
continuous infusion should be started 15-30 minutes before or at the same time as ifosfamide and 
finished no sooner than 12  hours after the end of the ifosfamide infusion.    
 
For example: if the ifosfamide dose is 1 000 mg, then the total daily mesna dose is 1000  mg; the 
[ADDRESS_1027832] 14  hours and 30 minutes. 
 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 29 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
 
Use of oral mesna:  
The oral dose of mesna is twice the IV dose. Patients able to tolerate oral mesna may receive the 
last FOUR bolus doses (originally at Hours  3, 6, 9, and 12) orally at 40% of the ifosfamide dose. 
The oral doses will be administered at Hours  1, 4, 7, and 10.   
 
For example: if the ifosfamide dose is [ADDRESS_1027833] 200  mg dose of mesna will be 
given IV 15  minutes before or with the ifosfamide dose (Hour  0) and FOUR oral doses of 
400 mg each will be given at Hours  1, 4, 7, and 10.  
 
Administer tablets or diluted parenteral solut ion.  To decrease sulfur odor, dilute mesna parental 
solution before oral administration. The solution can be diluted 1:1 to 1:10 in water, carbonated 
cola drinks, fruit juices (grape, apple, tomato and orange) or plain or chocolate milk.   The most 
palatab le is chilled grape juice.   Tablets are 400  mg each and can be divided into 200 mg/0.[ADDRESS_1027834] 200mg. Administer doses on  a schedule as determined by 
[CONTACT_750753]. If a dose is missed, administer d ose immediately. Give the 
next scheduled dose according to the original dosing schedule. Do not deviate from the original 
schedule. Notify provider if a dose is delayed or missed.  If a dose is vomited within 2 hours of 
administration, repeat the dose orall y or switch to intravenous mesna.  
 
Filgrastim : Subcutaneous (preferred) or IV  
Days: Daily, starting on Day 6 and continue for 10 days until ANC > 1500/ µL after the expected 
nadir.  
Dose: 5  mcg/kg/dose.  
 Note:  The use of filgrastim is strongly recommen ded, h owever, patients receiving PEG -filgrastim 
will not be excluded.

Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027837] compromised renal function should undergo a GFR  (see table 
in Section 3.2.6 .2).  If the corrected GFR is <100 mL /min/1.73m2, the carboplatin 
dose should be calculated per the modified Calvert Formula using a target AUC 
of 5.  Please note that the equation below calculates the ACTUAL mg of 
carboplatin to be given and NOT the dose per surface area.  Also n ote that 
the maximum dose calculated using the modified Calvert Formula must not exceed the orig inally planned dose of 600  mg/m
2.  Each final total daily dose 
of carboplatin should be checked to ensure that it does not exceed this amount.     
 Modified Calvert Formula : 
 
Carboplatin Total Dose in mg/day = {(Corrected GFR x surface area)  + (15 x surface area)} x AUC  
                                                                                   1.73 
 
Alternately, the equation may also be expressed as follows:  
 
Carboplatin Total Dose in mg/day = {(Uncorrected GFR)  + (15 x surface area)}  x AUC  
 
Example Ca rboplatin dosage calculation:  
Example 1:  
 Surface area = 0.5m
2   Corrected GFR = 70m L/min/1.73m2 
 
Total dose in mg/day = { 70 x 0.5  + 15(0.5)  }  x 5 
      1.73 
Dose = (20.23 + 7.5) x 5 = 139 mg/day  
 Double check dose to ensure that it does not exceed 600 m g/m
2:  
139 mg ÷ 0.5 m2 = 278 mg/m2  
This does not exceed the max dose of 600 mg/m2, so 139 mg is acceptable.  
 
Example 2:  
Surface area = 1.2 m2   UN-corrected GFR = 50 mL/min 
 
Total dose in mg/day =  {50 + 15(1.2)}  x 5 
 Dose = (50  + 18) x 5 = 340 mg/day 
 
Doub le check dose to ensure that it does not exceed 600 mg/m
2:  
340 mg ÷ 1.2 m2 = 283 mg/m2   
This does not exceed the max dose of 600 mg/m2, so 283 mg is acceptable.  
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027838] and by [CONTACT_750754] .  
Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) are the clinical methodology of choice for initial 
testing.  If these are normal, patients do not need further evaluation, and should 
be coded as having no hearing loss.  If they are abnormal, then brainstem evoked auditory responses (BAER) or tone audiometry should be used to more 
specifically describe the hearing loss.  A decrease in auditory acuity at 
frequencies above 4000 Hz is expected and does not constitute a contraindication to further therapy.  For Grades 0, 1 and 2 ototoxicity (CTCAE) no dose 
modification is recommended.  For Grade 3 toxicity, a 50% reduction should be 
made in the carboplatin dosage. For Grade 4 ototoxicity, carbopla tin can be 
continued at 50% dose reduction or discontinued at the discretion of treating 
physician and family
. 
 
 
5.1.3  Allergic Reactions  
Carboplatin allergic reactions may be managed with pre -medications such as 
diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg IV (maximum dose 50 mg), ranitidine 1 mg/kg IV 
(maximum dose 50 mg) and hydrocortisone  
4 mg/kg IV (maximum dose 100 mg).   
 
5.1.4  Hematologic Toxicity  
If counts are slow to re cover after Cycle A, use filgrastim (G -CSF) during 
subsequent Cycle A.  
 
5.2 Etoposide  
 
5.2.1  Nephrot oxicity   
In patients with impaired renal function, the following initial dose modification should be considered based on measured creatinine clearance:  
 
 
Measured CrCL   
> 50 mL/min/1.73m2  
15-50 mL/min/1.73m2 
 
Etoposide Dose   
100% of Dose   
75% of Dose  
 
Subsequent dosing should be based on patient tolerance and clinical effect.  Data 
are not available in patients with creatinine clearances of < 15 mL/min and further dose reduction should be considered in these patients.  
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_1027839]  bilirubin is between 2 and 3 mg/dL, give 50% of the calculated dose 
of etoposide.   If the direct bilirubin is > 3 mg/dL, hold the etoposide.   Full dose 
may resume when the direct bilirubin has fallen to < 1.2 mg/dL.  
 
5.2.3  Allergic Reactions  
Etoposide al lergic reactions may be managed with pre- medications such as 
diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg IV (maximum dose 50 mg), ranitidine 1 mg/kg IV

Microscopic Hematuria  
For transient microscopic hematuria  (no more than 2 abnormal urinalyses on 2 
separate days during a  cycle of therapy), there is no modification of the 
ifosfamide or mesna  dose. 
  
For persistent microscopic hematuria  (> 2 abnormal urinalyses during a cycle of

hematuria) during or following a cycle of therap y, hold ifosfamide until 
hematuria clears . When hematuria clears, restart at 50% of the previous 
ifosfamide dose. Use hydration of 3500- 4000 mL/m2/day and mesna at 100% of  
ifosfamide dose as a continuous infusion over 24 hrs/day. The ifosfamide dose 
may be escalated back to 100% if tolerated.  
  
For persistent gross hematuria after completion of a cycle of therapy , hold 
subsequent ifosfamide until the urine clears to less than gross hematuria. 
Reinstitute ifosfamide at 50% of the initial dose, with hydration of 3500 -4000 
mL/m2/day and the mesna at 100% of the ifosfamide dose administered as a 
continuous infusion over 24 hours . If this regimen is tolerated, the ifosfamide 
dose may be escalated back  to the original dose (100%).  
  
For persistent gross hematuria occurring during a cycle of  ifosfamide , interrupt 
the ifosfamide . Withhold further ifosfamide until the next cycle of therapy or 
until urine clears.  Reinstitute ifosfamide at 50% of the initi al dose, with 
hydration of 3500 -4000 mL/m2/day and the mesna at 100% of the ifosfamide 
dose administered as a continuous infusion over 24 hours . If this regimen is 
tolerated, the ifosfamide dose may be escalated back to the original dose (100%).

Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027846] up to 54 Gy. 
The “intent -to-treat” principle will be followed and any eligible patient who receives dose 
and volume reduced radiation therapy  and is evaluable based on response to induction 
therapy will be included in the primary analysis.  The number of patients enrolled in stratum 
[ADDRESS_1027847] whether the PFS distribution of localized 
primary CNS germinoma patients who present with serum and or CSF hCG β ≤ 50mIU/ml is 
sufficient to support continued investigation of the proposed treatment regimen. The “intent -
to-treat” principle will be followed and any eligible patient who receives dose -reduced 
radiation therapy will be included in the primary analysis.  The number of patients enrolled in 
stratum 2 who fail to receive this reduced radiation therapy will also be reported.  
 In addit ion, for each stratum descriptive statistics will be provided reporting the 
proportion of patients who are classified as local, ventricular, distant or a combination of local, ventricular, and/or and distant failures based primarily on imaging evaluation o f the 
neuraxis. See Section 15.[ADDRESS_1027848] step in assessing primary objective 1.1.3, modeling neurocognitive function, as assessed on ALTE07C1 , will be to monitor the rate of participation of eligible patients 
treated with dose and volume reduced radiation therapy in stratum 1 and dose -reduced 
radiation therapy in stratum 2. The same monitoring rule described below will be independently implemented for Stratum 1 and for Stratum 2.  
 
Assessing neurocognitive function for patients treated on ACNS1123 will be considered 
feasible unless statistical evidence develops that fewer than 80% of patients who are 
eligible and evaluable for assessing primary objectives 1.1.[ADDRESS_1027849] both 9- month and 30-
month neurocognitive assessments on ALTE07C1. This rate of success will ensure that 
longitudinal modeling of neurocognitive function will provide viable historical controls 
for subsequent CO G trials of these diseases. The rate of also achieving 60 -month (5- year) 
neurocognitive assessments is not considered for monitoring feasibility, as the total study 
duration is only expected to be approximately seven years.  
 
The statistical criteria for m onitoring neurocognitive evaluations are based on a one -sided 
test (α = 0.0 25) that the  true, unknown,  success rate is at least 80% (≥ 80%) with 80% 
statistical power to detect that the success rate is 6 5%, which would be unacceptable. 
Assuming a binomial distribution, EAST5 was used to calculate the two stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_317150]. If within a stratum, 9 (≤9) or fewer of the first 23 patients evaluable for 
feasibility (39.1 %) have both 9 and 30 month  evaluations  (i.e. patients who are eligible 
and evaluable for assessing the primary objective and are more than 30 + 4 months from 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 41 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
diagnosis) , we will recommend to the COG DSMB that consideration be given to closing 
the stratum. The second boundary for recommending closing the stratum will be if 28 or 
fewer (≤ 28) of the  initial 45 patients  evaluable for feasibility  (62.2%) enrolled in that 
stratum have both 9 and 30 month evaluations  (i.e. patients who are eligible and 
evaluable for assessing the primary objective and are more than 30 + 4 months from 
diagnosis) . Otherwise  accrual to the stratum will continue until the full cohort of patients 
required to address the primary objective assessing the [ADDRESS_1027850] patients.  
2. The second secondary objective is to provide Kaplan -Meier estimates of the PFS 
and survival distributions of the cohorts of patients who present with a) non 
metastatic CNS Germinoma patients with hCG β ≤ 50 mIU/ml and  b) non 
metastatic CNS Germinoma patients with hCG β > 50  mIU/ml and ≤ 100mIU/ml. 
These estimates will only be available to the COG DSMC until the trial is closed to 
accrual.  
 9.[ADDRESS_1027851]  
In ACNS0122, COG institutions enrolled 79 eligible patients with localized disease over a period of 53 months. Of these 79 patients, 49 (95% lower 
confidence bound = 53%) would have been eligible based o n response to 
induction therapy to address the primary study objective of this trial for an 
expected accrual rate of approximately 11.[ADDRESS_1027852] 
that approximately 7 years will be required to accrue the required 77 eligible 
patien ts evaluable for the primary objective.  
 
9.2.2 Stratum 2 G erminoma  
Based on the publication by [CONTACT_540362], the 95% confidence interval estimate of the incidence of CNS germinoma in children 4 to <18 years of age is (0.48, 0.91) . 
67 We 
assume that this estimate holds for 5 to 19 year olds. Canada and US population 
estimates for 5 to 19 year olds are 6.02 and 61.7 million, respectively. Thus, 
annually we estimate th at there are 32.5 to 61.6 diagnoses of CNS germinomas in 
patients 5 to 19 years of age. Again based on Keene et al, approximately 77% of 
patients with CNS germinomas will be diagnosed with localized disease and 
approximately 75% will present with serum and  CSF hCG β ≤ 50mIU/ml. 67 
Assuming that 80% of eligible patients would consent to enrolling on this study, we 
estimate that the annual accrual for patients eligible for the primary study objective 
will be between 15 and 28 patients.  Since 64.7% of eligible patients are expected to 
be evaluable for the primary objective, annual accrual of eligible, evaluable patients will be between 10 and 18 patients.  
 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 42 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
Due to the excellent accrual rate of germinoma patients within the initial 2.5 years 
of study opening  (accrual of 80 patients within 27 months) , we expect that 
approximately 5 years will be required as originally estimated to accrue the required 79 eligible patients evaluable fo r the primary objective.  Note that assessing whether 
the accrual rate is adequate should not begin until one year after the protocol has been released to COG institutions for submission to their Institutional Review 
Boards (IRB). Receiving IRB approval tak es significant time and thus accrual 
during the first year will no doubt be much less than projected; thus, assessment will 
begin with the completion of year two.  
 
9.2.3 Total Accrual  
Considering 77 eligible, evaluable  patients will be required for Stratum  1 and 79 
eligible , evaluable  patients for Stratum 2, with a 10% ineligible rate, the 
maximum number of patie nts expected to be accrued is 275 patients.   
 As of Amendment #1A , for Stratum 1, the original estimate of the study duration 
was mistakenly based  on the fact that all eligible patients enrolled on Stratum 1 
would be evaluable for addressing the primary objective. However, the Stratum 1 primary objective will be addressed only by [CONTACT_750756]. In 
reality, based on the results from the preceding ACNS0122 study, we had expected that approximately 62% of Stratum 1 eligible patients would experience 
a CR or PR and would receive reduced radiation therapy. Conside ring that 77 
eligible patients who achieve a CR or PR and receive reduced radiation therapy 
are required to address the primary objective of Stratum 1, we will need to incre ase accrual to approximately 125  patients.  
 
For Stratum 2, in order to estimate th e study duration, there was no information 
on which we could estimate the proportion of eligible patients that would 
experience a complete response or continued complete response and contribute to 
addressing the primary objective. Seventy -nine (79 ) eligible, evaluable patients 
are required to address the primary objective. Currently, based on the ACNS1123 
data through 31 December 2013, we estimate that approximately 64.7% of 
Stratum 2 elig ible patients will experience a CR or CCR, receive reduced 
radiation therapy and contribute to addressing the primary objective. Thus , we 
need to accrue a total of 123  eligible patients to Stratum 2.  
 
Assuming that the expectation for 62% of Stratum 1 eligible patients and 64.7% of Stratum 2 eligible patients will contribu te to addressing the primary objectives 
is realized, we will need to accrue 248 (125+123 ) patients and assuming a 10% 
ineligibility rate, the maximum number of patien ts expected to be accrued is [ADDRESS_1027853]  
This s tudy will be designed based on the observed outcome for patients treated on 
ACNS0122. Of 102 eligible patients treated on ACNS0122, 79 (77.5%) were determined to have localized disease. Thirty -two of the 79 (40.5%) patients 
achieved a CR (N=25) in response  to induction therapy or were found on second-
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027854] a mature teratoma, residual scar or fibrosis (N= 7). Based on 
the ACNS0122 data frozen as of June 30, 2011, the 3- year PFS rate for these 32 
patients is 90.6% (SE=5.2%) and follow -up was current for all patients. No patient 
is censored within two years of initiating therapy and [ADDRESS_1027855] year. Seventeen of the 79 (21.5%) patients achieved a PR in response to induction therapy and the 3- year PFS rate fo r these patients is 94.1% 
(SE=5.7%) with no patient censored within two years of initiating therapy and [ADDRESS_1027856] year. The 3- year EFS point estimate 
(95% confidence interval estimate) for the 32 CR and 17 PR patients are 90.6% 
(73.7%, 96.9%) and 94.1% (65.0%, 99.2%), respectively. Thus the 3- year PFS rate 
for these two cohorts of patients treated on ACNS0122 are both excellent and 
similar supporting our decision to combine the groups in our study of reduced 
irradia tion. The observed 3 -year PFS rate for the combined cohort of 49 patients 
(32+17) is 91.8% (SE=3.9%).  
 
The historical data from the COG trial ACNS0122 shows that for the [ADDRESS_1027857] been followed for more than three years. With 
so few f ailures in the historical data, the usual time -to-event distributions, 
exponential, Weibull etc., are difficult to characterize and to assess for adequacy of 
fit; so the Study Committee has no estimate of a hazard rate and clearly no estimate 
of median progression -free survival. The binomial distribution appeared to be the 
best distribution on which to design this trial reflecting the fact that with rare 
exception all failures are expected to occur early. The binomial distribution 
parameterized by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_1027858] 82% (null hypothesis: ≤ 0.82) and 
powered to detect that the 3 -year PFS rate is really 93% (0.93). East 5.3
© was used 
to calculate the require sample size of [ADDRESS_1027859] 69 patients (≥ 69) are progression free after three years and 
conclude that reduced therapy is acceptable. Due to the discrete distribution, the 
actual type I error rate is 0.0492 (probability of falsely concluding that the treatment 
is effective when the true 3- year PFS rate is 0.82) and statistical power is 0.911 
(probability of correctly concluding that the treatment is effective when the true 3 -
year PFS rate is 0.93).  
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027860] sufficie nt merit 
for continued investigation, our design requires a statistically significant result – p-
value<0.0492. The null hypothesis must be rejected otherwise this approach will have to be reconsidered.  
 
Due to the expected accrual rate, expected low failure rate and three year PFS 
endpoint, even one interim analysis for futility that would stop accrual early is not feasible. Note that interim analyses would be restricted to patients who are 
documented failures within three years of initiation of treatment a nd those patients 
followed for three years failure free. Thus, no formal futility interim analysis is 
planned. However, if [ADDRESS_1027861] failed (progressed or lost to 
follow up) before three years of follow up and fewer than [ADDRESS_1027862] (DSMB) has had the opportunity to review all data.  
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_1027863] discussed above.  Huh, Maity and 
Bamberg report 10 -year PFS of 96.6% (n=32); 5- year PFS of 100% (n=39); and 5-
year PFS of 88% (n=49), respectively.33-35 The four relapses in the Bamberg  cohort 
were all within three years of initiating therapy. Calaminus reported an EFS rate of 97 ± 2% for [ADDRESS_1027864] three years.  
 Based on the results of the SIOP -96, SFOP trial and Japanese studies, our approach 
will be conside red acceptable if there is statistical evidence that the true, unknown 
3-year PFS rate is greater than 0. 87 (> 87%). Thus, a one -sided test will be used 
with a type I error rate of 0.10 (α = 0.10) and 90% statistical power (β = 0.10), if the 
true 3 -year PFS rate is 95%. Since this approach offers the potential for superior 
quality of life for surviving patients who are spared exposure to highly effective 
cranial spi[INVESTIGATOR_750699] h as long term consequences for survivors, we have set 
the statistical power at 90%.  
 The sample size calculation will be based on the binomial distribution testing that 
the true, unknown 3- year PFS rate is at most 87%  ( n u l l  hy p o t h e s i s :  ≤  0 . 87) and 
powered t o detect that the 3 -year PFS rate is really 95% (0.95). This method 
requires that no patient be lost to follow up within the first three years. All patients 
who fail to be evaluated for progression at the [ADDRESS_1027865] 5. 4
© was 
used to calculate the require sample size of [ADDRESS_1027866] 73 patients (≥ 73) are progression free after three years. 
This approach was selected to minimize the number of patients with this rare 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027867] failed (progressed or been lost to follow up) before three years of follow up and fewer than [ADDRESS_1027868] begun treatment, accrual will be suspended until the 
COG DSMB has had the opportunity to review all data.  
 
9.3.3  Longitudinal Modeling of Neurocognitive Function (Cognitive, Social and 
Behavioral)  
These analyses will be conducted independently for Stratum 1  (NGGCT) and 
Stratum 2 (Germinoma) patients. To be included in the analyses, patients must have the [ADDRESS_1027869] neuropsychological and behavioral battery focuses on three cognitive domains: intelligence, attention, and memory, as well as broad domains of social, emotional, and behavioral functioning.  Data for all 
assessments will be available as standardized t -scores. The change over time for 
each compone nt of the neuropsychological testing will be estimated using 
Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE); 
82 with the standardized t -scores as the 
dependent variable and the assessment times as a covariate. For neuropsychological components for which some patients are missing data at one of the three assessments, Weighted GEE 
83-84 will be used to address the 
missingness under the assumption that the data are missing at random (MAR).  
 GEE mode ls will be used to explore associations of changes over time with 
factors such as gender, age at initiation of radiation therapy, tumor location, 
surgical intervention, etc.

and its perpendicular for each target lesion. 3D (volume) tumor dimensions are determined by [CONTACT_750757] (perpendicular to the plane of the axial measurement) for each target lesion . Regarding MRI 
imaging, the radiologist at each institution may select whatever sequence best highlights the 
tumor (T1 enhanced or T2 weighted or FLAIR images) and the same sequence should be used for serial measurements. Response determination will be based on a comparison of a 
2D (area:W x T – see below) 3D (volume; (W x T x L – see below)  between the baseline 
assessment and the study date designated in the follow -up Report Form.   Reports for the 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027870] tumor 
dimension, and its perpendicular  +/- length . Either T1 or T2 weighted images are used - 
which ever gives the best estimate of tumor size. The following section describes the 
methodology.  (See Figure 10.1 below for illustration)  
 
1. For MRI imaging  the longest diameter can be measured from the axial plane o r the  
plane , provided the same plane is used in follow ups. This longest measurement of 
the tumor is referred to as the width (W).   
2. The perpendicular measurements should be determined - transverse (T) 
measurement, perpendicular to the width in the selected  plane.  
3. The length is then measured as the perpendicular to the plane defined by 
[CONTACT_750758] 1 and 2.  
4. The cystic or necrotic components of a tumor are typi[INVESTIGATOR_750700]. Therefore only the solid component of cystic/necroti c tumors should 
be measured. If cysts/necrosis compose s the majority of the lesion, the lesion may not 
be “measurable”.   
Options:   
- if the cyst/necrosis is eccentric, the W and T (and L) of the solid portion 
should be measured, the cyst/necrosis excluded f rom measurement  
- if the cyst/necrosis is central but represents a small portion of the tumor (< 25%), disregard and measure the whole lesion  
- if the cyst/necrosis is central but represents a large portion of the tumor, identify a solid aspect of the mass tha t can be reproducibly measured

10.[ADDRESS_1027872] CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is 
considered a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor 
progression/response.  
2. In case of a bifocal lesio n both lesions should be selec ted as “target” lesions.  
3. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickness of the slices showing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect (e.g. 8 mm 
lesion for a 4 mm slice).  
 
10.4 Response Criteria for Target Lesions  
1. Response criteria are assessed in 3 (volume) (or 2 (area) if 3 not possible ) 
dimensions – the product of W x T  x (L) .  
2. To assess response/progression, the ratio is calculated  (x 100 = %) : 
  W x T  x (L)  (current scan)   
  W x T x (L)  (reference scan) 
 
3. Development of new disease or progression in any established lesions is 
considered progressive disease (PD), regardless of response in other lesions – e.g. 
even when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the progressive dise ase 
takes precedence.  
 
4. For purposes of this study, response criteria for target lesions are:

Complete Response (CR): Complete disappearance of visible disease on 
imaging allowing for minimal residual disease/enhancement ≤ 0.5  cm maximal 
dimension in supra sellar or ≤ 1 cm in pi[INVESTIGATOR_750701].  
 
Continued complete response (CCR): Continuing absence of radiographically 
identifiab le disease allowing for minimal residual disease/enhancement ≤ 0.5 cm

but ≥ 65% decrease in the sum of the products of the three perpendicular 
diameters (volume) of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial 
baseline measurements.  
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the three perpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR (taking as 
reference the initial baseline measurements), nor sufficient increase in a single 
target lesion to qualify for PD, (taking as reference the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started)  and r esidual disease after chemotherapy 
of  > 1.5 cm maximal dia meter.  
 Progressive Disease (PD): 40% or more increase in the product of perpendicular 
diameters (volume) of ANY target lesion, taking as reference the smallest 
product observed since the start of treatment, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
*In the circumstance that 3 -D measurement cannot be determined, maximal 
diameter in a 2- D measurement (area) would be used to evaluate response: 
TxW (product of the longest diameter and its longest perpendicular diameter )

become negative (AFP, hCGβ) at completion of chemotherapy .  Patients with PD 
and increasing levels of hCGβ  or AFP after completion of 2, 4 or 6 courses of 
chemotherapy will come off protocol.  
 
10.5 Retrospective Response Review  
MRI imaging for all patients  on study will undergo retrospective central review following 
the completion of treatment. Results of the retrospective review will not be returned to 
the site. See Section 14.4  for imaging central review re quirements.  
 
  
11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents .  
 
11.2 Determination of Reporting Requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) the characteristics 
of the adverse event including the grade  (severity) ; 2) the relationship to the study 
therapy  (attribution); and 3) the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event . 
  
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial source. In some cases an agent obtained commercial ly may be used for 
indications not included in the package label.  In addition, NCI may on some occasions distribute commercial supplies for a trial.  Even in these cases, the agent is still 
considered to be a commercial agent and the procedures described below should be 
followed.  
 
Determine the prior experience Expected  events are those that have been previously 
identified as resulting from administration of the agent.  An adverse event is considered 
unexpected,  for reporting purposes only, when either the  type of event or the severity of 
the event is not listed in:  
• the current known toxicities for each commercial agent as provided in the Drug Information for Commercial Agents Used by [CONTACT_2005]’s 
Oncology Group posted on the COG website; or  
• the drug package insert.  
 
 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (eg, 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary malignancy.  
 All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment need to be reported via CTEP -
AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
 
11.3 Reporting of Adverse Events for Commercial  Agents –via  CTEP -AERS   
Expedited AE reporting must use CTEP -AERS (Adverse Event Expedited 
Reporting System), accessed via https://eapps- ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers  
 
Commercial report ing requirements  are provided in Table B.  The commercial agent(s) 
used in this study are listed in the front of this protocol immediately following the Study 
Committee roster.   
 
• COG requires the CTEP -AERS  report to be submitted within 7 calendar  
days  of learning of the event.    
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided 
during trial registration on all reports.  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the NCI Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will 
be utilized for AE reporting and are located on the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a cop y of the CTCAE.  
 
Table B  
Reporting requirements for adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_640718].  
 
CTEP -AERS  Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events That Occur During Therapy 
With a Commercial Agent or Within [ADDRESS_1027874] dose of treatment with a commercial agent which 
can be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not 
due to cancer recurrence mus t be reported via CTEP -AERS . 
  
11.4 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
Note:  The guidelines below are for routine reporting of study specific adverse events on 
the COG case report forms and do not affect the requirements for CTEP -AERS  reporting.  
 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 52 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
The NCI def ines both routine and expedited AE reporting.   Routine reporting is 
accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study 
database.   For this study, routine reporting will include all toxicities reported via CTEP -
AERS  and all G rade 3 and higher Adverse Events.  
 
12.0 STUDY REPORTING  AND MONITORING   
The Case Report Forms and the submission schedule are  posted on the COG web site with each 
protocol under “ Data Collection/Specimens ”. A submission  schedule is included.  
 
12.1 CDUS  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS) . Cumulative 
CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due 
January 31, April 30, July [ADDRESS_1027875] the interests of patients and the scientific integrity for all clinical trial research by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology Group, the COG Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) revi ews reports of interim analyses of study toxicity and outcomes prepared by 
[CONTACT_4305], in conjunction with the study chair’s report. The DSMC may 
recommend the study be modified  or terminated based on these analyses.   
 Toxicity monitoring is also the responsibility of the study committee  and any unexpected 
frequency  of serious events on the trial are to be brought to the attention of the DSMC . 
The s tudy statistician is responsible for the monitoring of the interim results and is 
expected to requ est DSMC review of any protocol issues s/he feels require special 
review. Any COG member may bring specific study concerns to the attention of the 
DSMC.  
 The DSMC approves major study modifications proposed by [CONTACT_293866] ( eg, termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_293832], increasing target sample size, etc.). The DSMC determines whether and to whom outcome results may be released prior to the release of study results at the time specified i n the protocol document.  
 
 
 
13.0 SURGICAL GUIDELINES  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up 
to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per  COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly 
prohibited within the protocol).  
  
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027876] will present 
with mass lesions in either the pi[INVESTIGATOR_750704]/or suprasellar regions.  Other less common 
locations include the thalamus/basal ganglia and fourth ventricle. Patients with primary 
tumors in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_750705]. The neurosurgeon 
must consider the following goals in the  initial management of patients suspected of 
harboring a primary germ cell tumor.  
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_1027877] a cranial MRI with and without gadolinium at diagnosis/prior 
to enrollment. If surgical resection is performed, patien ts must have pre -operative 
and post -operative cranial MRI with and without gadolinium. The post -operative 
brain MRI should be obtained within [ADDRESS_1027878] a spi[INVESTIGATOR_750691]/prior to enrollment.  
 
Note: If the spi[INVESTIGATOR_750706], it is recommended to be obtained with and without gadolinium.  
 
13.1.2  Medications  
• Corticosteroids:  Patients with large tumors and those with non -
communicating hydrocephalus may benefit from high doses of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone (0.25 -1.0 mg/kg/day) in divided doses 
every 6 -8 hours. Appropriate endocr ine tests should be drawn in consultation 
with the pediatric endocrine consultant prior to initiating corticosteroid therapy.  
• Anticonvulsants:  The use of prophylactic anticonvulsants in patients with 
CNS germ cell tumors in typi[INVESTIGATOR_750707]. Seizures are rare following endoscopic third ventriculostomy or intraventicular tumor biopsy. Prophylactic 
anticonvulsants may be administered prior to craniotomies and corticectomies depending on institutional policy.  
 
13.1.3  Hydrocephalus  
• Most patients with pi[INVESTIGATOR_750708] a non -
communicating hydrocephalus due to obstruction of flow at the level of midbrain through the aqueduct of Sylvius.  
• A communicating hydrocephalus may arise as a c onsequence of diffuse 
leptomeningeal metastases. The management of hydrocephalus will relate to the severity of symptoms of raised intracranial pressure and the clinical response to corticosteroids.  
• The preferable management for patients with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_750709] a third ventriculostomy at the time of endoscopic biopsy.   
• The routine placement of a VP shunt is not recommended.  
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 54 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
  
13.1.4  Tumor Sampling and Resection  
See Section 3.2.2 regarding eligible diagnosis.  
• It is highly  desirable to first confirm the diagnosis on frozen section in the 
operating room and then to obtain sufficient tissue for flash freezing (biology 
studies) and formalin fixation (complete immunohistological characterization).  
• Radical resection for reducti on of tumor burden is discouraged given the 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_750710].  
 
13.1.5  Intra-operative CSF sampling  
• For patients undergoing an endoscopic procedure, it is highly desirable that intraven tricular CSF sample to be obtained prior to biopsy and sent for cytology, 
hCG and AFP. The ventricular CSF should be obtained before fluid is instilled 
for irrigation.  
• Lumbar CSF should be obtained (within 10- 14 days after surgery if applicable) 
for cytop athology prior to enrollment unless medically contraindicated.  
 
13.2 Operative Management  
 
13.2.1  Endoscopy  
• It is recommended that the endoscope be used for intraventicular tumor biopsy and for performance of a third ventriculostomy, if needed.  
 
• Normal si zed ventricles do not preclude the use of the endoscope for 
tumor biopsy if stereotactic guidance is available. The endoscope should 
be coupled to the frameless navigation system.    The visual 
documentation of seeding, undetectable at the l evel of sensitivity of 
neuroimaging, will be documented, but will not alter radiation treatment.  
 
13.2.2  Other Operative Approaches  
It is recognized that some tumors may not be easily biopsied by [CONTACT_750759], depending on the 
anatomy of the tumor and institutional expertise.  These include the following:  
 
• Stereotactic needle biopsy  
Image -guided frame -based techniques are preferred at some sites for 
appropriately selected tumors.  Careful planning of t he trajectory is 
essential to minimize the risk of injury to deep venous and arterial structures.  
 
• Transphenoidal procedures  
The transphenoidal approach may be the preferred method to biopsy a 
isolated suprasellar tumor, especially if a radical resection  is not 
required.  The morbidity of this approach is less than a craniotomy.  
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 55 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
 
• Open craniotomy  
If the above techniques are not deemed feasible or fail to yield diagnostic 
tissue, an open craniotomy would be appropriate as a means for 
establishing the di agnosis of a germ cell tumor.  The operative approach 
would be determined by [CONTACT_750760].  
 
13.2.3  Ancillary Procedures  
 
• External ventricular drain (EVD)  
In some circumstances an EVD may be necessary for monitoring intracranial 
pressu re or temporary control of hydrocephalus.   
 
• Septostomy  
If the tumor is producing hydrocephalus by [CONTACT_750761] a lateral ventricle at the 
level of the foramen of Monro, a third ventriculostomy may not be possible. In such cases, a septostomy may allow a communication to be established between 
the two lateral ventricles and permit a tumor biopsy at the same procedure.  
 
13.2.[ADDRESS_1027879] ventricle or communicating 
hydrocephalus.  
 
13.3 Management of Complications  
• Peri-surgical complic ations include hemorrhage, infection, seizures, and neurological 
injury.  
• Significant complications will delay the implementation of adjuvant therapy and may 
preclude protocol eligibility.   
• The patient must be ready to begin protocol therapy within 31 day s of surgery. 
Readiness assumes significant recovery from peri -operative complications and 
absence of any wound dehiscence, CSF leakage, uncontrolled hydrocephalus or uncontrolled life -threatening endocrine deficiency.  
 
13.4 Second- Look Surgery  
• The presence of residual or progressive disease after the completion of induction chemotherapy in patients following 4 or 6 (NGGCT) cycles of chemotherapy 
warrants consideration of a “second -look” surgical procedure.  
• All differential diagnostic concerns must be considered to include: a non-
germinomatous germ cell component, mature teratoma, a non -protocol tumor and 
scar/fibrosis.  
• Appropriate management will depend on narrowing this differential. An open craniotomy may be the preferred procedure since a radical resecti on of residual tumor 
may be therapeutic.

15.0 RADIATION THERAPY GUIDELINES  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are 
based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor 
unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up 
to 1 week for surgery) f or valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility, procedure and/or 
anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly 
prohibited within the protocol).  
 Radiation Therapy (RT) can only be de livered at approved RT facilities (COG administrative 
policy 3.9).  
 
15.[ADDRESS_1027885] volumes are fixed fo r 
Stratum 1 and vary according to response for Stratum 2. The whole ventricular 
volume should be contoured according to an atlas approved by [CONTACT_750762].  
 
15.0.2  Required Benchmark and Questionnaires  
Radiation therapy will be administe red using protons or photons. Required 
photon methods include 3D -conformal radiation therapy (3D -CRT) and intensity 
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Centers participating in this protocol using 3D-CRT are required to complete the 3D benchmark; those usi ng IMRT must 
complete the IMRT questionnaire and benchmark or phantom and those using 
protons must complete the proton benchmark and questionnaire. All centers 
participating in this protocol must complete the  IROC RI (QARC)  CT/MR image 
fusion benchmark. Be nchmark materials and questionnaires may be obtained 
from the IROC RI (QARC)  (www.qarc.org) and must be submitted before 
patients on this protocol can be evaluated. For information regarding the IMRT 
phantoms, please contact [CONTACT_174631] (http://rpc.mdanderson. org/rpc).  
 
15.0.3  Guidelines and Requirements for the Use of IMRT  
Investigators using IMRT will be required to comply with the guidelines developed for the use of IMRT in National Cancer Institute sponsored

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
cooperative group trials. These guidelines are av ailable through www.qarc.org . 
These guidelines require that the protocol explicitly state their requirements and 
methods for localization and immobilization; the use of volumetric imaging; 
target and organ motion management; nomenclature, definitions and r ationale for 
targets and organs at risk; target volume coverage and normal tissue dose constraints; effects of heterogeneity in tissues; and quality assurance.  
 
15.0.[ADDRESS_1027886] comply with the 
Advanced Technology Consortium proton therapy guide lines available through 
www.qarc.org .  These guidelines specify the following for the participating 
institution: both passive and scanned beams may be used, but the Radiologic Physics Center must review and credential the specific beam line delivery 
parameters.  Dose reporting will be in  Gy (RBE). Radiation doses shall be 
prescribed protocol specified definitions for gross (GTV) and clinical (CTV) target volumes. For set -up uncertainties and target motion, additional margin, 
smearing, range of modulation will be a dded on a per beam basis. The proton

15.4.[ADDRESS_1027898] (volumetric) based planning is required to optimize dose to the PTV while 
protecting normal tiss ues. Organs at risk within the irradiated volume should be 
contoured including those required. A DVH is necessary to determine target 
coverage and evaluate dose to normal tissues. CT section thickness should be  
≤3mm . 
 
15.4.2  In-room verification of spatial positioning   
[IP_ADDRESS]   
Portal imaging is the most common system used to verify patient position, in particular when the target volume is believed to possess a fixed spatial relationship with visualized bony a natomy. If volumetric imaging is not 
available, o rthogonal paired (AP and lateral) portal images (MV or kV) are 
required to verify that the isocenter is in correct alignment relative to the patient position.  Beamline imaging of the treatment port should be  performed when 
feasible . For proton treatment, orthogonal paired kV imaging for daily patient 
positioning and beamline kV imaging for treatment port verification are required . 
 [IP_ADDRESS]   
Volumetric imaging is allowed in this study. This includes in -room kV or MV 
cone beam or conventional CT imaging. Please be able to submit representative 
axial images showing the isocenter and the correct alignment in relationship to 
the patients’ position. For CT tomography where isocenters are not used, a 
printout of th e isodoses overlaid on the fused CT images can be printed to 
demonstrate in room verification.  
 
 
15.5 Target Volumes  
 
15.5.1  General comments  
International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Reports 50, 62 and 78 ( www.icru.org ) define pr escription methods and nomenclature that 
will be utilized for this study. Although the MRI obtained immediately prior to 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/[ADDRESS_1027899] created 
and appropriately named six (n=6) target volumes: Whole Ventricular Volume 
(WVV), Whole Ventricular Volume CTV (WVVCTV), Whole Ventricular 
Volume PTV (WVVPTV), boost GTV (GTV), boost CTV (CTV) and boost PTV (PTV).  
 (1) Obtain a treatment pla nning CT using a ≤3mm image section thickness. 
Contrast is not required.  
(2) Fuse the appropriate MR sequences  
(3) Contour the GTV to satisfy the protocol requirement to delineate this volume.  
(4) Expand GTV geometrically by 5mm to create a CTV for the boost phase of 
treatment.  
(5) Expa nd the CTV geometrically by 3 or 5mm to create the PTV. Please note 
that a 3mm PTV margin expansion requires daily image guidance and intervention prior to treatment. A 5mm PTV margin expansion has no special 
requirements.  
(6) Contour the WVV  to satisfy the p rotocol requirement to delineate this 
volume.        
(7) The WVV is not a volume representing gross tumor and therefore does not require a geometric expansion to form the WVVCTV.  However, it is critical that the boost CTV be included in the WVVCTV to ensure t he boost CTV 
receives the protocol specified dose.  Add the boost CTV to the WVV. Please name [CONTACT_750774].  
(8) Expand the WVV CTV geometrically by 3 or 5 mm to create the WVVPTV. 
Please note that that a 3mm PTV margin expansion requires daily image guidance and i ntervention prior to treatment.  A 5mm PTV margin expansion 
has no special requirements.  
(9) Please note that the boost volumes must be defined upfront to ensure this 
volume receives the protocol specified dose.

•        A contouring atlas is availab le on the COG and IROC RI (QARC)  websites 
(www.QARC.org ). 
 
• The whole ventricle volume (WVV)  should encompass the lateral, third, and 
fourth Care should be taken to ensure the suprasellar and pi[INVESTIGATOR_750717].  Inclusion of the prepontine cistern is 
optional  but should be considered for patients that have undergone a third 
ventriculostomy and for patients with large suprasellar tumors. The whole 
ventricles should be contoured according to the whole ventricle atlas available on the COG website and QARC website. The fusion of T2 MR 
sequence obtained just prior to radiation therapy to assist in delineating CSF/ventr icles is encouraged.  
 
• Whole ventricular clinical target volume ( WVV CTV) :  
The whole ventricular volume represents an area of subclinical microscopic 
disease in the ventricular system and therefore a geometric margin is not required to form the WVVCTV.  However, it is critical that the WVV be 
combined with the boost CTV to ensure full dose to the involved field 
boost.  Combine the WVV and boost CTV to form the WVVCTV.  The 
WVCTV should not extend outside of the bony calvarium.  
 
• Whole ventricular p lanning tar get volume  (WVVPTV) :  
A geometric expansion  of 3 or 5 mm should be added to the WVVCTV to 
create the WVVPTV.  The PTV has two components, the internal margin 
(IM) and the set -up margin (SM). The IM is meant to compensate for all 
movements and variations in size and shape of the tissues contained within 
the WVV CTV. The SM is meant to account for set -up, mechanical and 
dosimetric uncertainties related to daily patient positioning, treatment 
equipment and software.  Given that the WVV CTV is generally confined to  
the intracranial space , the WVV PTV may extend into or beyond bone but is 
unlikely to extend beyond the surface of the patient.  
 
15.5.[ADDRESS_1027900] volumes (GTV, CTV and PTV)  
 
• Gross tumor volume (GTV) should include any residual tumor pr esent at the 
time of treatment planning and all tissues initially involved or in contact [CONTACT_750764] (surgery or chemotherapy). The GTV is 
defined as the tumor bed at the time of diagnosis accounting for shifts in normal tissues displaced by [CONTACT_750765]. This does not apply to areas of parenchymal 
infiltration.  Any region of the brain infiltrated by [CONTACT_750766].  
 
All diagnostic imaging should be reviewed prior to treatment planning and 
the sequences that best define the full extent of disease should be  registered 
for treatment planning . 
 
• Boost c linical target volume (CTV) includes the GTV with an added margin 
that is meant to treat subclinical micros copic disease and is anatomically 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 64 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
confined (i.e., the CTV is limited to the confines of the bony calvarium, falx 
and tentorium where applicable or extends up to but not beyond 
neuroanatomic structures through which tumor extension or invasion is 
certain no t to have occurred); the CTV margin will be 5mm for all patients. 
When the GTV approaches the boundary of an anatomic compartment, the CTV will extend up to and include the boundary. The CTV margin chosen 
for this study requires diagnostic MR imaging data with image section 
thickness ≤ 5mm   
 
• Boost planning target volume  (PTV) includes  a margin which is added to the 
CTV in 3 -dimensions to create the PTV. It is geometric and not anatomically 
defined. The PTV has two components, the internal margin (IM) and the set -
up margin (SM). The IM is meant to compensate for all movements and 
variations in size and shape of the tissues contained within the CTV. The SM 
is meant to account for set -up, mechanical and dosimetric uncertainties 
related to daily patient position ing, treatment equipment and software.  For 
this study,  the PTV margin should be 3 mm. Given that the CTV is generally 
confined to the intracranial space, the PTV may extend into or beyond bone but is unlikely to extend beyond the surface of the patient.  
 
15.5.4 Proton definitions for GTV, CTV and PTV  
• GTV is the same for protons and photons.  
• CTV is the same for protons and photons.  
• PTV will be uniquely defined for proton therapy ( Section 15.6.4 ). 
• When passive sca ttering or uniform scanning methods are used, the boost 
planning target volume  (PTV) for proton therapy will include  a margin which 
is added to the CTV in 3 -dimensions . The margin should be consistent with 
the motion control and setup accuracy for the part icular type of treatment at 
the treating proton center. The PTV will be used for dose reporting and 
not specifically for treatment planning. The goal of treatment planning will 
be CTV coverage at 100% directly with specific measures taken for each 
specific  uncertainty, Specific adjustments will be made to (1) aperture 
margin definitions, (2) smearing of compensator, (3) range of the individual 
beams (depth of penetration), and (4) modulation width of the SOBP. The 
following parameters must be explicitly rep orted for each beam: range, 
modulation, smearing radius of the compensator, set -up margin (SM) and 
PTV margin. The specifics of dose reporting for the proton PTV and recommendations regarding the PTV margin are discussed in Section 15.6.4
.

*The dose per fraction is [ADDRESS_1027906] 95% of the protocol -specified dose should encompass 100% 
of the whole ventricular PTV and the boost PTV and no more than 10% of either 
PTV  should receive greater than 110% of the protocol dose as evaluated by 
[CONTACT_25400]. The 100% isodose should be equal to the protocol specified dose. Wedges, 
compensators and other methods of generating more uniform dose  distributions 
are encouraged . 
 
 
For protons, treatment planning does not specifically use a PTV . All uncertainties 
are taken into account explicitly to create a robust plan that provides full dose coverage of the CTV.  For passive scattering and uniform s canning, the aperture 
margin must include the appropriate beam penumbra for the selected beam 
energy, and setup and internal margins (SM and IM).  These margins depend on 
the patient setup techniques used at the treating proton center .  The aperture 
margin  may be expanded further if a cold spot occurs near the edge of CTV due 
to insufficient lateral scatter.  The smearing radius for the range compensator must be equal to the setup and  internal margins (SM and IM). The beam range 
should be equal to the maximum water equivalent depth of the CTV plus a range 
margin.  The main part of the range margin comes from uncertainty in CT 
accuracy and the conversion of the Hounsfield units to proton stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_750719].  Most proton centers are expected to use 3.5% of the maximum water -
equivalent depth of the CTV and then add another millimeter to account for 
uncertainties in beam range calibration and compensator fabrication.  Additional 
range margin should be applied if internal motion could increase the water 
equival ent depth of the CTV.  The modulation width should be increased 
consistently  to ensure proximal coverage of the target volume.  The beam range 
may be adjusted at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist based on 
 
 
Version Date: 6/1/15   Page 67 
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ACNS1123  
normal tissue dose concerns.  As noted in section 15.5.4 , a PTV should be created 
by a uniform expansion from CTV for reporting purpose s. The expansion margin 
should be consistent with SM and IM  and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3 mm for a static target 
volum e when daily imaging is  performed. With the planning guidelines provided 
herein, no more than 10% of PTV should receive greater than 110% of the 
protocol dose as evaluated by [CONTACT_25400].  In most cases, at least 95% of the protocol -
specified dose should encompass  100% of the PTV.  A potential exception is 
when the range margin is smaller than the PTV expansion (e.g., 3mm).  As a 
result, the beam may not penetrate deep enough to sufficiently cover the distal 
portion of the PTV.  This may occur for shallow target volumes where the 
maximum depth of the CTV is small and the range margin is small. This scenario 
is not expected for this protocol; however, such incomplete coverage of the PTV 
will not constitute a planning deviation because the plan should be sufficiently 
robust to cover the CTV with the protocol specified dose accounting for all 
uncertainties.  
 
15.6.5 Interruptions, Delays and Dose Modifications  
There will be no planned rests or breaks from treatment, and once radiation therapy has been initiated, treatmen t will not be interrupted except for any life threatening 
infection or severe hematological toxicity defined as ANC < 300/ µL or platelets less 
than 40,000/ µL during the course of treatment. Blood product support should be 
instituted according to institutio nal/protocol guidelines.  The reason for any 
interruptions greater than 3 treatment days should be recorded in the patient treatment chart and submitted with the QA documentation. There should be no modifications in dose fractionation due to age or field s ize. If one treatment is 
missed during a weekday, it may be made up on the weekend if the institutions allows. On weeks on which a holiday falls, radiation therapy may be given 4 days that week.  
  
15.7 Treatment Technique  
 
15.7.1  Beam Configuration  
Every a ttempt should be made to minimize dose to organs at risk without 
compromising coverage of the target volume. Three -dimensional conformal 
therapy (coplanar or non- coplanar) or IMRT are required to minimize dose to 
normal tissues. Treatment techniques utiliz ing at least [ADDRESS_1027907] location of the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_750720]. This is accounted for in 1 5.6.4 . The s econd is the 
biologic uncertainty of the distal range of  the proton beam in which the RBE may 
be greater than 1.1; therefore, single proton beam plans which stop in a critical 
organ will not be allowed.  Individual proton beams which are component s of a 
multi -field proton beam and which stop within such an orga n will be allowed but 
are not encouraged. It is preferable to stop the proton beam beyond the critical organ.

15.7.4  Simulation including patient positioning and immobilization  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient positioning   
Reproducible setups are critical and the use of immobilization devices is required .  The patient should be treated in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_750723] . Consideration should be given to implications for inter and intrafraction 
motion when using non- standard position approach es. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immobilization devices  
Standard immobilization devices for the head are to be used.  The methods used 
for localization and immobilization of both patient and tumor are critical. The 
imaging studies should provide a clear assessment of the t arget volume with the 
patient in the treatment position.  
 
15.7.5  Special considerations  
Anesthesia or sedation may be required in certain patients, such as very young 
patients, to prevent movement during simulation and daily treatments.  
 
15.7.6 Motion M anagement and Margins to Account for Target Volume Changes During 
Treatment  
Considering motion of normal tissues and target volumes is important. The 
internal target volume (ITV) is defined as the CTV surrounded by [CONTACT_750767]. The planning organ at risk volume (PRV) includes the corresponding organ at risk (OAR) volume surrounded by a margin to compensate for motion or 
physiologic change in the OAR. If adequate clinical data  do not exist to define 
the IM component of the PTV or the PRV margin, the following suggestions are 
provided: 
 
• A margin matching the PTV margin may be added to any OAR to form the PRV.  
• Any change in clinical condition or anatomy related to hydrocephalus, VP 
shunt placement, subdural fluid, pseudomeningocele or steroid use should be monitored carefully and with repeat imaging when indicated.

volumes. To avoid exceeding the suggested dose constraints, the dose coverage may be adjusted provided the guide lines of Section 15.6.4 
are observed.  
 Following the recommendations of ICRU 62, a margin of 3 -5 mm shall be added around 
each of these structures to compensate for geometric uncertainties. The volume , which 
includes this margin , is called the Planning Organ at Risk Volume (PRV). The dose to 
each of these PRV’s shall not exceed [ADDRESS_1027909] e drawings of these critical 
structures will be available on the IROC RI (QARC)  website ( www.QARC.org ).

 Major Deviation:  Radiation therapy course prolonged more than [ADDRESS_1027921]  may be described as local, 
ventricular, distant or a combination of local , ventricular, and/or  and distant and are based 
primarily on imaging evaluation of the neuraxis. Local failure is defined as progression of known residual tumor or the appearance of tumor at known prior sites of disease that 
were at some point without evidence of disease. Ventricular failure is defined as the 
appearance of tumor at sites within the ventricular system other than known prior sites of 
disease . Distant failure is defined as the appearance of tumor at sites outside the 
ventricles or the primary tumor volume.  Distant failure most often occurs in the 
subarachnoid space and may occur at any point within the neuraxis. Although rare, extra -
CNS metastasis represents distant failure. Combined local , ventricular, and/or  distant 
failure is defined when evaluation of the  entire neuraxis reveals failure at two or three of 
the defined categories . The monitoring of EFS will assess the rate of failure.  
Determining the patterns of failure will require an assessment of tumor recurrence with 
respect to targeting and dosimetry.

There is no universally accepted analytical method to assess pattern of failure. For this study, 
the pattern of failure will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively by [CONTACT_750770].  
 
 
16.0 NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION STUDY  
Note: Patients must be enrolled on ALTE07C1 at the time of study enrollment on ACNS1123.  
 
A separate informed consent for ALTE07C1 must be signed.  Please refer to the ALTE07C1 protocol for 
eligibility requirements.  
 Because of the high risk of neurodevelopmental problems in young children treated for  CNS germ cell 
tumors , assessment of functional and neuropsychological status will be completed to obtain information 
about tumor and treatment rel ated morbidity.  The premise of this study is that newer radiation planning 
and delivery techniques are capable of reducing neuropsychological sequelae for all children, including the very young.  While it has historically been difficult to obtain neuropsy chometric data in a cooperative 
group study, this is now feasible with ALTE07C1.  T hese data are critical to the success of this treatment 
approach and its acceptance by [CONTACT_1962], parents , and the neuro -oncology community.

Non-Germinomatous Germ Cell Tumor (NGGCT)  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age)  
 
Phase [ADDRESS_1027923] been talking with you about your  non-germinomatous germ cell tumor (NGGCT) . A 
NGGCT is a type of cancer that grows in your brain . Your tumor is loc alized meaning it has not 
spread to other areas of your brain, spi[INVESTIGATOR_750728].  After doing tests, we have found that 
you have this type of cancer.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study to see if localized NGGCT tumors treated with  
chemo therapy and radiation treatment s with a smaller dose of radiation will work as well as 
radiation treatments used in previous studies . A research study is when doctors work together to 
try out new ways to help people who are sick.  We will talk to you about enrolling on another 
COG study, ALTE07C1. The goal of ALTE07C1 is to l earn about the thinking, learning, and 
remembering) of children being treated for cancer . 
 
3. Standard treatment for NGGCT tumors includes chemotherapy to shrink the tumor as much as 
possib le followed by [CONTACT_750772] s. Radiation treatments used to treat NGGCT is usually 
given to the whole brain and is often given to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_750729].  
 
4. Children who are part of this study will be treated with chemotherapy called I nduction 
chem otherapy followed by [CONTACT_400561] s. The treatment on this study takes about [ADDRESS_1027924] a second surgery before you receive radiation treatment s. 
 
5. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study.  These good things are called “benefits.”  We hope that a benefit to you of being  part of this study is that the 
new treatments work better to get rid of the tumor than the standard treatment and causes less 
damage to your brain .  But, we do  not know for sure if there is any benefit of being part of this 
study.  
 
6. Sometimes bad things ca n happen to people when they are in a research study.  These bad things 
are called “risks.”  One risk to you from this study is that the study treatment may not work as 
well as other treatments to make your tumor get smaller or go away for as long as possi ble. Other 
things may happen to you that we don’t yet know about.  
 
7. Your family can choose to be part of this study or not.  Your family can also decide to stop being in this study at any time once you start.  There may be other treatments for your illness that your 
doctor can tell you about.  Make sure to ask your doctors any questions that you have.

STUDY PHASE  Phase II  
OBJECTIVES  Primary Objective:  
To compare 2 -year disease -free survival (DFS) in participants with 
confirmed triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) treated with a 
genomically directed therapy or standard of care  following preoperative 
chemotherapy  
 
Secondary Objectives:   
• To compare overall DFS and 1 -year DFS  
• To determine 5 -year overall survival (OS)  
• To collect archived tumor specimens and genomic DNA to 
explore potential correlates of recurrence and toxicity.  
• To describe the toxicities associated with genomically directed 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590042]:  
• To describe the evolution of genomically directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590043]  
• To evaluate the drug specific effect on both effi cacy outcomes 
(DFS and OS) and toxicity.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  Sequencing:  
DNA from archived tumor samples collected at the time of surgery 
(residual disease post neoadjuvant chemotherapy) will be extracted and 
sequenced. The resulting sequencing data will be interrogated for known 
genomic drivers of sensitivity or resistance to existing FDA approved 
agents.  
 
Cancer Genomics Tumor Board (CGTB):  
Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based 
on sequencing data alone, the CGTB will be respo nsible for the final 
treatment recommendation. The CGTB will consider the genomic data 
along with the participant’s prior treatment history, ongoing toxicities, 
and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by 
[CONTACT_590057] a significant clinical or safety contraindication 
exists for that therapy. All participants and treating investigators will be 
blinded to sequencing results and CGTB deliberations until the time of 
relapse.

 STUDY DESIGN  Participants with a CGTB tr eatment recommendation:  
Participants with a CGTB recommendation will be randomized to 
Experimental Arm A (genomically directed monotherapy) or Control 
Arm B (standard therapy).  
 
Experimental Arm A (genomically directed monotherapy)  
Participants randomized to Experimental Arm A will receive an FDA 
approved drug at standard dose for four cycles (12 -16 weeks total 
duration, depending on cycle length).  Clinical and laboratory monitoring 
and dose -reductions will follow the FDA package insert guidelines. 
Detaile d information about the drugs expected to be recommended most 
commonly can be found in Appendix A.  
 
Control Arm B (standard therapy)  
Recently, a randomized phase III trial of over [ADDRESS_777277] option in this setting. As this 
represents only a single trial (with prior data not demonstrating benefit 
for the addition of capecitabine in the neoadjuvant nor adjuvant settings 
in unselected  participants), observation can be considered an option as 
directed by [CONTACT_1963]. While not recommended, other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590044].  
 
Participants with no CGTB recommendation:  
Participants may have no CGTB recommendation either because 1) 
sequencing did not identify a matched drug or 2) the matched drug was 
contraindicated. These participants will be assigned  to Control Arm B 
and treated as described above for Control Arm B. As the outcome of 
participants without an ‘actionable’ genomically directed therapy may 
differ, the primary analysis will include only participants randomized  to 
Control Arm B.  
NUMBER  OF 
PARTICIPANTS  Total number REQUIRED to be randomized  and evaluable for efficacy  = 
136 
 
Estimated number with technical failure in sequencing = [ADDRESS_777278] no CGTB  
recommendation  = 30  
 
Estimated total number of participants to be enrolled = 192 
 
Maximum number of participants to be enrolled = 200

 ELIGIBILITY  1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of 
personal health information.  
NOTE:   HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed 
consent or may be obtained separately.  
NOTE:  Central pathology review may be conducted any time after 
definitive surgery. Consenting participants may be pre -registered to 
the study and proceed with central pathology review before full 
eligibility has been confirmed. However, ALL of the eligibility 
criteria must be met and formal study registration completed prior to 
submission of the sample for sequencing.  
2. Age ≥ [ADDRESS_777279] be willing to use an 
effective method of contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method 
of birth control; abstinence) from the time consent is signed until [ADDRESS_777280] should be 
repeated.  
NOTE:   Women are considered not of childbearing potential if they 
are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy, bil ateral 
tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), or they are 
postmenopausal for at least [ADDRESS_777281] histologically or cytologically confirmed triple negative 
(ER-/PR-/HER2 -) invasive breast cancer, c linical stage I -III at 
diagnosis (AJCC 6th edition) based on initial evaluation by [CONTACT_590058]/or breast imaging prior to study registration.  
NOTE:   ER, PR, and HER2 status will be confirmed by [CONTACT_590059].  ER and PR will be 
considered negative if ≤ 1 0% of cells stain weakly positive. HER2 
will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by 
[CONTACT_9064] (IHC) or 2+ by [CONTACT_590060] a 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) ratio of < 2.0 or < [ADDRESS_777282] completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy.  
NOTE:  Acceptable preoperative regimens include an anthracycline 
or a taxane, or both. Participants who received preoperative therapy 
as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Parti cipants may not have 
received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery prior to 
randomization. Bisphosphonate use is allowed.

Version Date: 27APR [ADDRESS_777283] 14 days prior, but no more 
than 84 days prior, to study registration.  
NOTE: Negative margins for both invasive and ductal carcinoma in 
situ (DCIS) are desirable, however participants with positive margins 
may enr oll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is 
possible and participant has received radiotherapy. Participants with 
margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible. 
Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (including 
lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable.  
10. Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of 
definitive surgery following preoperative chemotherapy.  Significant 
residual disease is defined as at least one of the following:  
• Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) classification II or III 6 
• Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least [ADDRESS_777284].  
• Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1 cm 
with any lymph  node involvement (does not include metastases 
in lymph node which are only detected by 
[CONTACT_9064]).  
• Any lymph node involvement that results in 20% cellularity or 
greater regardless of primary tumor site involvement (includes 
no residual disease in the breast).  
11. Must have an FFPE tumor block with tumor cellularity of 20% or 
greater.  
NOTE:  Prior to registration, the tumor cellularity will be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_51723]. Percent values will be double -checked at 
Paradigm (a Next Generation S equencing Company).  
12. BREAST RADIOTHERAPY  
• Whole breast radiotherapy is required for participants who 
underwent breast -conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or 
partial mastectomy. Participants must have completed 
radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no  more than 84 days 
prior) to study registration.  
• Participants with a primary tumor > 5 cm or involvement of ≥[ADDRESS_777285] -operatively at the discretion of the 
treating physician.   For part icipants with primary tumors ≤ 5 
cm or with < [ADDRESS_777286] local therapy.  
• For radiati on required prior to surgery, the participant must 
register within 84 days of surgery.  Also, participants in this

mastectomy radiation therapy.  
• For those participants who do not require radiation, re gistration 
must be within 84 days of surgery.    
13. No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies 
are required in the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings 
that would suggest distant disease.  
14. No treatment with any investigational agent within [ADDRESS_777288] be obtained within 14 days prior to 
study registration.  
• Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL  
• Platelets ≥  100 K/mm3  
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3  
• Calculated creatinine clearance of ≥ 50 cc/min using the 
Cockcroft -Gault formula  
• Bilirubin  ≤ 1.5   ULN (except in participants with 
documented Gilbert’s disease, who must have a total bilirubin 
≤ 3.0 mg/dL)  
• Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤  2.5  ULN  
• Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT)  ≤ 2.5  ULN  
17. Left ventricular ejection fraction within norma l limits obtained within 
30 days prior to study registration.  
NOTE:  Participants with an unstable angina or myocardial infarction 
within [ADDRESS_777289] consent to collection of whole blood samples for genomic 
analysis.  
21. No clinically significant arrhythmia or baseline ECG  abnormalities in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021].  
22. No active second malignancy (except non -melanomatous skin cancer 
or incidental prostate cancer found on cystectomy): Active second 
malignancy is defined as a current need for cancer therapy or a high  
possibility (> 30%) of recurrence during the study. Previous 
contralateral breast cancer is allowable unless it meets “active” 
criteria as stated above.

test with 0.05 level of significance (calculation done using nQuery 
Advisor 7.0) and assuming exponential survival.  
 
Here, we have assumed a three -year accrual time period, and each 
participant  will subsequently be followed for two years. This three -year 
accrual period will ensure the ability to recruit [ADDRESS_777292] will be done using the stratified randomization factors: 1) 
neoadjuvant anthracycline versus not and 2) lymph node involvement at 
time of definitive surgery versus not. In addition, sensitivity analyses 
using Cox regression may be carried out to identify prognostic factors 
and provide adjusted estimates of the t reatment group differences in DFS.  
 
Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
As support for the primary objective, overall DFS and [ADDRESS_777293] described above for 2 -year D FS. Toxicity  variables will be 
tabulated separately for the two groups. Five-year OS will be compared 
between treatment groups using the same methodology as DFS. In 
addition , characteristics of tumor specimens and genomic DNA will be 
correlated with recurrence and toxicity. Continuous measures will be 
correlated with binary variables (e.g. recurrence and toxicity) using 
maximal chi -square tests and continuous variables using P earson or 
Spearman correlations. Binary variables such as tumor and genomic 
characteristics will be correlated with recurrence and toxicity using chi -
square or Fisher’s Exact test. All of the correlative analyses are

disease biology. We will also compare the entire control Arm B 
(randomized and non -randomized) to Experimental Arm A. This analysis 
assumes that those participant s randomized into Control Arm B and those 
participant s without actionable mutat ions have similar disease biology, 
and thus there is no participant  selection bias. The secondary analyses 
will look at DFS, OS, and other toxicity outcome. We will also run the 
drug specific analysis using frailty model.  
 
Analysis of Exploratory Objective s 
During the period required for accrual, it is expected that the ability to 
recommend genomically directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590045]. Changes may 
occur as data from ongoing  correlative studies reach the level of evidence 
required to enter the selection algori thm and/or as new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590046]. To explore the impact 
of this evolution, sequencing data from all participants  will be reanalyzed  
and represented along with the initial clinical information to the CGTB 
within 1 month of completion of the enrol lment. CGTB 
recommendations for optimal therapy will be compared with the initial 
recommendations and the proportion with a change in recommendation 
will be reported.  
 
Another exploratory analysis will evaluate each s pecific drug’s effect on 
efficacy parameters  (i.e. DFS) and toxicity. Because the number of 
participants receiving a specific drug is expected to be relatively small, 
we will analyze  this using a frailty model for DFS. In this model, we 
allow different dru g effects to share the same variance estimate in order 
to gain power. This analysis will be implemented in R package, coxph 
function. The dru gs’ effect on toxicity will be analyzed  with the 
generalized linear mixed effect model, implemented in SAS PROC 
GLIMMIX or GENMOD.  
 
The other exploratory analysis will depend on the results of sequencing. 
Similar to the drug specific analysis, we will use either the frailty model 
or the generalized linear mixed model to analyze clinical outcomes.

 1 BACKGROUND & RATIONALE  
1.1 Primary (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy for breast cancer  
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a well -established role in the management of both early -stage and 
locally advanced breast cancer. Providing treatment prior to definitive surgery not only improves 
the abilit y to achieve breast conservation, but also allows determination of in vivo  sensitivity to 
therapy and offers an ideal platform for clinical research. Although many will experience 
shrinkage in tumor volume with neoadjuvant therapy, at the time of surgery o nly about 33% of 
patients will experience a pathologic complete response (pCR) with complete lack of invasive 
tumor tissue in the surgical specimen. Long -term follow -up of neoadjuvant studies consistently 
demonstrates significantly improved survival in ind ividuals with pCR, with comparatively inferior 
outcomes in those with residual disease at surgery1-[ADDRESS_777297] of residual disease is more 
striking in patients with triple negative (ER -/PR-/HER2 -) disease compared to patients with other 
molecular phenotyp es5. Unfortunately, patients with triple negative disease who have substantial  
(Miller -Payne classification6 1 or 2 or residual cancer burden classification II or III7) residual 
disease at the time of surgery have a dismal prognosis with only 35 -40% remain ing free of 
recurrence at [ADDRESS_777298] neoadjuvant 
therapy to 8 cycles of capecitabine at 2500 mg/m2/day (2 out of 3 weeks) vs. no additional 
therapy . Approximately 64% of the population had hormone receptor positive disease and 36% 
had triple negative disease. The trial data was presented at the [ADDRESS_777299] 
Conference (Toi et al.) after [ADDRESS_777300] patient rando mized. The DSM 
committee terminated the trial early after the trial results had met a planned interim analysis of 
benefit for the addition of capecitabine. The capecitabine arm demonstrated an improvement in 
DFS from 74% in the control arm to  82% in the ca pecitabine arm (HR=0.70; p=0.005) .  The 
addition of capecitabine also improved  OS from 89.2% to 94% (HR=0.60; p<0.01) . The hazard 
ratios were highly significant in the triple negative subgroup  (HR=0.58; 95% CI=0.39 -0.87) .  
Thus, capecitabine can be conside red a standard option in this setting  for triple negative breast 
cancer . As this represents only a single trial (with prior data not demonstrating benefit for the 
addition of capecitabine in the neoadjuvant nor adjuvant settings), observation can also be 
considered an option after discussion of risk to benefit ratio with the patient.   
 
1.[ADDRESS_777301] s. Examples  of successful drugs matched to 
aberrancy include  various categories of aberrancy : over-expression  (e.g. trastu zumab for HER2 
overexpression9), translocation (e.g. imatinib for BCR -ABL  translocation10) and point mutation 
(e.g. vemurafenib for BRAF activating mutation; V600E11). In general, the therapeutic index for 
these targeted approaches has been exceptionally high. This proposal will attempt to capi[INVESTIGATOR_590048] -approved agents with molecular 
aberrancies determined by [CONTACT_590061].

Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR [ADDRESS_777302] non -specific chemotherapy i n the 
neoadjuvant setting with substantial residual disease. This patient population, by [CONTACT_590062], is 
resistant to traditional  non-specific cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Also, by [CONTACT_590063], they are clearly in need of additional (and h opefully superior) targeted therapy. Since 
these participants  have already received standard therapy, the concern for  a “high -risk” patient not 
receiving potentially life -saving therapy will not be  an issue. Further, since all drugs used in this 
proposal a re FDA -approved and will be used as single agents, there should be no toxicity concerns 
beyond those side effects that  are well recognized . From a genomic standpoint, the use of these 
agents in a relatively early point in the tumor’s life (i.e. adjuvant se tting) will minimize som e 
intrinsic concerns such as genom ic drift.[ADDRESS_777303] . 
 
1.3 Use of next generation ( massively parallel) sequencing to identify therapeutic targets  
Paradigm is a non-profit joint venture between  the University of Michigan and the International 
Genomics Consortium  (IGC) . Paradigm ’s cancer diagnostic test, PCDx  (which will be the 
platform implemented in this protocol) is a  sophisticated and comprehensive CLIA next -
generation sequencing cancer diagnostic test available for cancer analysis on formalin fixed 
paraffin sections. PCDx uses a custom analysis on the PGM Ion Torrent platform to provide 
patients and physicians with a blueprint of the underlying mechanisms of a patient’s disease 
through next -generation sequencing for mutations, copy number variants ( CNV ), mRNA and 
chromosomal changes including allelic burden , potential treatment approaches, assessment of 
level of evidence, and comprehensive invento ry of relevant clinical trials.  This clinical decision

1.4 Expected actionable mutations/pathways with recommended agents  
We have performed an in silico  study to predict the most commonly identified and the relative 
diversity  of compounds likely to be identified u sing this approach . To do this, we used [ADDRESS_777306] cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) , a publically available 
resource of cancer genomics data . For each of these 72 cases we collated the data regarding 
somatic mutations, copy number variation, and differential gene expression (compared to a panel 
of [ADDRESS_777307] tissues) and submitted this data through the Paradigm PCDx informatics 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]. F or each case, a comprehensive report was generated associating genomic aberrancies 
with potential therapeutics. The report may list any of the following: 1) FDA -approved,

The drugs listed in Table 1 will be dosed according to the FDA -approved package inserts ( See 
Appendix A ). While the drugs listed here will likely comprise a large number of our expected 
drug recommendations , the nature of this trial makes it impossible to anticipate the optimal 
genomic target for all participants . Thus, if the genomic data identifies a less  common actionable 
mutation/pathway not included in Appendix A , the Sponsor investigator must obtain approval of a 
protocol exception from  the local IRB per local institutional policy . If the same genomic change s 
(and drug ) are recommended for a second pat ient, we will conclude that this represents a  recurrent 
aberrancy rather than a sporadic event . With this knowledge , the protocol will be amended to add 
the mutation/pathway and resulting drug.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_777310]  (CGTB)  
Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based on sequencing data 
alone, the CGTB will be responsible for the final treatment recommendation.  
The CGTB includes a diverse group of members with specific areas of expertise including:  
 
• Sponsor Investigator  (Schneider)  
• Genomics/informatics expert (Radovich)  
• Breast medical oncologist with clinical trial expertise (Miller)  
• Director of the I ndiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center (IUSCC)  Phase I 
Program (O’Neil)  
• Ethics and supportive care (Helft)  
 
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR [ADDRESS_777311] three members of the CGTB will meet to review the 
sequencing report and relevant clinical data for each participant .  If only tw o permanent members 
of the CGTB are available to meet, an ad hoc  member ( other medical oncologist with clinical  trial 
expertise) may fill in as the third required member. Assuming there are available cases, t he review  
will take place during  a standing week ly meeting . Optimal therapy recommendations will be made 
by [CONTACT_21128]. Although the participants  will be de -identified during the CGTB deliberations, their 
underlying comorbidities and medical history may reveal the identity to the treating physician. To 
avoid the potential that knowledge of the sequencing data might influence the treating 
investigator’s approach (especially if randomized to Control Arm B), any CGTB member who is 
also the treating physician will be recused and excluded from those discussion s. 
 
Hoosier Cancer Research Network  will provide the CGTB with the Paradigm PCDx sequencing 
results report , recommended agent , and summary of the participant’s relevant  clinical data.  The 
CGTB will consider the genomic data along with the participant’s prior treatment history, ongoing 
toxicities, and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by [CONTACT_590064] a significant clinical or safety contraindication exists for that therapy. For 
example, if TOP2A is identified for a participant who previously received anthracycline -based 
neoadjuvant therapy, the CGTB would not recommend additional doxorubicin  due to excess 
potential for toxicity and lack of enthusiasm for re -treatment with the same drug. Similarly, if a 
particip ant has persistent neuropathies, a drug known to cause substantial neuropathy would not be 
recommended . 
 
If more than one actionable mutation/pathways drug is identified  (this occurred  in 30% of cases in 
our preliminary data set), the  CGTB  will make the final recommendation  for a single drug based 
on the following  criteria : 1) Strength of the data that demonstrates an  association  between the 
genomic aberration and the selected drug ; 2) Participant’s prior exposure to therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  and 3) Co-
morbidities or persistent toxicities.  
 
All participants  and treating investigator s will be blinded to sequencing results and CGTB 
deliberations until the time of relapse.  Reports will automatically be made available to the treating  
investigator at that time . 
 
1.6 Protocol therapy  
All participants  for whom the CGTB recommended an optimal therapy will be randomized to 
Experimental Arm A or Control Arm B. If there is a technical failure in sequencing, no actionable 
mutations/pathways are identified, or the CGTB cann ot make a treatment recommend ation , 
participants  will be assigned to Control Arm B.  Based on our preliminary data;  we suspect this 
will happen for 18% of our population. Participants who are assigned to Control Arm B will not 
be included in the primary analyses.  
 
Participants in Experimental Arm A will begin protocol therapy within 10 working days of 
randomization.

 Experimental Arm A (genomically directed monotherapy)  
For participants  randomized to Experimental Arm A, HCRN  will send the CGTB treatment 
recommendation to the treating investigator  in a secure  email message . Drug specific details for 
the top [ADDRESS_777312] commonly expected drugs can be found in Appendix A . After discussion of th e 
drug specific information and expected toxicities, participants  will be asked to provide additional 
consent to proceed with protocol therapy.  
 
Consenting participants  will receive the CGTB recommended therapy in accordance with the FDA 
label  for 4 cycles ( 12-16 weeks  depending on cycle length). For oral drugs administered 
continuously, [ADDRESS_777313] clinical practic e. 
 
Control Arm B (standard therapy)  
Those randomized to Control Arm B (and those with no drug call who are assigned to Control 
Arm B) will follow the direction of their treating physician. Recently, a phase III trial, CREATE -
X16, randomized over [ADDRESS_777314] neoadjuvant therapy to 8 cycles of capecitabine at 
2500 mg/m2/day (2 out of 3 weeks) vs. no additional therapy. Approximately 64% of the 
population  had hormone receptor positive disease and 36% had triple negative disease. The trial 
data was presented at the [ADDRESS_777315] Conference (Toi et al.) after [ADDRESS_777316] patient randomized. The DSM committee terminated t he trial early after the 
trial results had met a planned interim analysis of benefit for the addition of capecitabine. The 
capecitabine arm demonstrated an improvement in DFS from 74% in the control arm to 82% in 
the capecitabine arm (HR=0.70; p=0.005).  T he addition of capecitabine also improved OS from 
89.2% to 94% (HR=0.60; p<0.01). The hazard ratios were highly significant in the triple negative 
subgroup (HR=0.58; 95% CI=0.39 -0.87).  Thus, capecitabine can be considered a standard option 
in this setting  for triple negative breast cancer. As this represents only a single trial (with prior data 
not demonstrating benefit for the addition of capecitabine in the neoadjuvant nor adjuvant 
settings), observation can also be considered an option after discussion of risk to benefit ratio with 
the patient. While not recommended, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590050].

 5.3 Missed doses  
In general , participants  should be encouraged to comply with the FDA -recommended treatment 
schedule. However, if IV treatment is missed for reasons other than toxicity ( e.g. participant  
vacation, family emergency, etc.), participants  able to resume treatment within 2 weeks should 
receive the full planned number of cycles. If a delay of more than 2 weeks is required, the missed 
IV treatment should be omitted (i.e. not made up) and participants  should proceed with the next 
cycle as orig inally scheduled. For those participants  receiving oral agents, missed doses should not 
be made up and should continue for the duration planned at the outset of therapy.

 7.8 Study Participation Discontinuation (CONTROL ARM B ONLY)  
A participant will be discontinued from study participation under the following circumstances:  
• If the participant requests discontinuation.  
 
NOTE: Participants can stop participating at any time. However, if they decide to stop 
partici pating in the study, they will continue to be followed for progression and survival 
unless the participant has also withdrawn consent for further follow -up. 
 
7.9 Surveillance  (ARM S A & B) 
• Complete p hysical examination  including: weight, BP  
• ECOG performance status  
• Participants  will be monitored by [CONTACT_590070] (chest wall, axillary, or supraclavicular nodes) or distant  recurrent disease  at least 
once every [ADDRESS_777341] observation only, 
follow -up will begin after randomization . At progression, pa rticipants  will be followed 
for survival only.  
• Suggested guidelines for surveillance of breast cancer survivors are available through the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( www.nccn.org ). 
• Routine blood work or radiology in the  absence of symptoms suggestive of recurrent 
disease is not recommended.  
• Remaining breast tissue (contralateral breast and ipsilateral breast in participants  treated 
with breast conserving surgery) should be imaged annually according to standard screening 
guidelines.  
• Correlative Studies  for Arm B only  
o Mandatory  – collect 10 mL whole blood for CTC  at 3 or 6 month visit  
 
8 CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION  
DFS is d efined as the duration of time from randomization to time of a D FS event, defined as local 
failure (invasive), regional failure, distant failure, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non -
invasive), or death from any cause. The diagnosis of local or dis tant recurrence should  ideally be 
pathologically confirmed , however if biopsy if not possible, radiology confirmation by [CONTACT_4654], MRI, 
or PET scan is acceptable.  
 
9 BIOLOGICAL SAMPLES  
HCRN  will provide sample collection  kits and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_590053] . All sample labels will only 
include the HCRN  participant study ID#, date/time of collection and sample type. No personal 
identifiers will be included.  Refer to the CLM  associated with this protocol for collection, 
processing, labeling , and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].  
 
9.1 Central Pathology Review  
Analysis by [CONTACT_408916] (ASCO) and College of American 
Pathology (CAP) expert panel suggests that approxi mately 20% of ER, PR, and HER2 tests 
performed in community laboratories are inaccurate with a fairly equal distribution of false 
positive an d false negative results. T he ASCO/CAP guidelines seek to improve test quality and 
BRE12 -158 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR 2018         Page 29 of 56 
 reliability . As such, ER, PR , and HER2 status will be confirmed by [CONTACT_590071].  
• ER and PR will be considered negative if ≤ 1% of cells stain weakly positive.  
• HER2  will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by [CONTACT_9064] (IHC) or 2+ 
by [CONTACT_590060] a fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) ratio of  < 2.0 or < 6 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_590052] . 
 
Additionally central pathology review will confirm the cellularity of the residual disease sample (>  
20% required for eligibility).  If the sample fails to meet the percent value required , a new sample 
(if available) will be requested  from the participating site.  
 
Formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue from the residual disease removed at the time of 
definitive surgery (mandato ry) is required to be submitted for central pathology review . The 
estimated timeframe to complete the central pathology review and provide a results report is 5-7 
working days. Once the central pathology review is complete  and participant  eligibility is 
confirmed , formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue will need to be sent to Paradigm.  
Paradigm will  double -check the cellularity percent values and complete the genomic sequencing. 
Refer to the CLM  for collection, labeling and shippin g instructions . 
 
NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after definitive surgery. Consenting 
participants  may be pre -registered to the study and proceed with central pathology review before 
full eligibility has been confirmed. However , ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and 
formal study registration completed prior to submissio n of the sample for sequencing.  
 
9.2 Samples for genomic sequencing  
Prior to registration , the tumor cellularity will be confirmed by [CONTACT_51723] . Percent 
values will be double -checked at Paradigm (a Next Generation Sequencing Company). A 
minimum of 20% tumor cellularity is needed to initiate the next generation sequencing analysis. 
Paradigm will use a proprietary tumor enrichment technology called L aser Capture Enrichment 
(LCE) that allows the macroscopic and microscopic isolation of populations of cells such as 
cancer cells to be separated from the non -malignant populations. The LCE technology has been 
validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas project (T CGA) and is the only capture enrichment 
technology allowed into TCGA. Paradigm can provide the mutational next generation sequencing 
analysis when the cellularity is equal to or above 20% tumor nuclei. LCE will be used to enrich 
above the 20% tumor cellula rity cut point. Above 50% tumor nuclei, the full Paradigm analysis of 
mutation, copy number abnormality, chromosomal aberrations , and mRNA can be performed in 
totality on formalin fixed paraffin sections.  When the tumor cellularity is between 20% and 50% 
tumor nuclei than some subset of the Paradigm analysis can be performed and thus all samples 
above 20% will be sent.

11 ADVERSE EVENT  MANAGEMENT  
Adverse events will be collected and reported as described below for the Experimental Group 
(Arm  A) only.  Arm B subjects are undergoing treatment that is considered standard of care, 
recording and reporting of adverse events will no t be done . 
 
11.1 Definitions of Adverse Events  
 
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or clinical trial subject administered an 
investigational product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment.  An adverse event (AE) can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product.  
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical signs  or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic testing.  
 
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence resulting in one or more of the 
following:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (defined as an event in  which the participant  was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appro priate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the participant  or may require intervention (e.g., 
medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition 
above).  Examples of such events include, but are not limited  to, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
11.1.3  Unexpected Adverse Event  
An adverse event not mentio ned in the package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the package insert.  
 
11.2 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting  
Adverse events will be recorded from the time of consent and for at least [ADDRESS_777342] a well -defined 
safety profile, only serious adverse events, and adverse events resulting in dose modification 
and/or treatment discontinuation will be reported. All AEs considered related to trial med ication

11.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting  
 
11.3.1  Study Center (Site) Requirements for Reporting SAEs  
Treating i nvestigators and other site personnel must report any SAEs occurring during the course 
of the study within [ADDRESS_777344].  
 
The definition of “related ” being that there is  a reasonable possibility the drug caused the adverse 
experience.  
 
Table 1 5: Relationship of adverse event to the investigational agent  
Unrelated  The Adverse Event is clearly not related to the agent(s)  
Unlikely  The Adverse Event is doubtfully related  to the agent(s)  
Possible  The Adverse Event  may be related  to the agent(s)  
Probable  The Adverse Event is  likely related to the agent(s)  
Definite  The Adverse Event is clearly related  to the agent(s)  
 
The completed SAE Report ing Form (see Study Procedure  Manual) must be emailed to 
safety @hoosiercancer.org  at HCRN  within 24 hours  of discovery  of the event.  The treating 
investigator is responsible for informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE as 
per local requirements.  
 
The original copy of the SAE Report ing Form  along with  the email cover sheet and/or fax 
confirmation sheet must be kept within the study binder at the study site.  
 
Follow -up information should be emailed to safety @hoosiercancer.org  at HCRN , using a new 
SAE Report ing Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported SAE and giving the 
date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event 
should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up 
information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated , 
and whether the participant continued or with drew from study participation.  
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_777345] be reported primarily for the purposes of SAE reporting; however, deaths due 
unequivocally to progression are not SAEs.  
 
Your local IRB should be notified and their reporting procedure followed.  The completed SAE 
Reporting Form should be emailed to safety @hoosiercancer.org  at HCRN  within 24 hours  of 
discovery  of the event.

 11.3.3  HCRN  Requirements for Reporting SAEs  
HCRN  will voluntarily report to the FDA , regardless of the study site of occurrence, any SAE that 
is reasonably related  (i.e. possible, probable, definite) to the protocol therapy and different in type 
and/or severity from what would be expected from the approved drug labeling  (unexpected) . 
Unexpected fatal or life -threatening experiences associated with the protocol therapy will be 
voluntarily reported to the FDA as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days after 
initial receipt of the information by [CONTACT_328805] . All other serious  unexpected experiences associated 
with the use of the protocol therapy will be voluntarily reported to the FDA no later than 15 
calendar days after initial receipt of the information by [CONTACT_328805] .

Clinical Study Protocol  
Version Date: 27APR [ADDRESS_777348] will be done using the stratified 
randomization factors: 1) neoadjuvant anthracycline versus not and 2) lymph node involvement at 
time of defini tive surgery versus not. In addition, sensitivity analyses using Cox regression may be 
carried out to identify prognostic factors and provide adjusted estimates of the treatment group 
differences in DFS.  
 
Participants who are assigned  to Control Arm B will  not be included in the primary analyses.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_777349] described above for 2 -year 
DFS. Toxicity  variables will be tabulated separately for the two group s. Five-year OS will be 
compared between treatment groups using the same methodology as DFS. In addition , clinical and 
demographic characteristics of tumor specimens and genomic DNA will be correlated with 
recurrence and toxicity. Continuous measures will be correlated with binary variables (e.g. 
recurrence and toxicity) using maximal chi -square tests and continuous variables using Pe arson or 
Spearman correlations. Binary variables such as tumor and genomic characteristics will be 
correlated with recurrence and toxicity using chi -square or Fisher’s exact test . All of the 
correlative analyses are exploratory and are designed to compleme nt efforts in other trials using 
this approach.  
 
In the secondary analysis, the participant s without an actionable mutation in Control A rm B will 
be compared to the rest of participant s in Control A rm B. Here our hypothesis is that these 
participant s may h ave different disease  biology . We will also compare the entire  control A rm B 
(randomized and non -randomized) to Experimental A rm A. This analysis assumes that those 
participant s randomized into Control A rm B and those participant s without actionable mutati ons 
have similar disease  biology , and thus there is no participant  selection bias. The secondary 
analys es will look at DFS, OS, and other toxicity outcome. We will also run the drug specific 
analysis using frailty model.

 12.5 Analysis of Exploratory Objective s 
During the period required for accrual, it is expected that the ability to recommend genomically 
directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590045]. Changes may occur as data from ongoing correlative studies reach 
the level of evidence required to enter the selection algorith m and/or as new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_590046]. To explore the impact of this evolution, 
sequencing data from all participants  will be reanalyzed  and represented along with the initial 
clinical information to the CGTB with in 1 month of completion of the study enrol lment. CGTB 
recommendations for optimal therapy will be compared with the initial recommendations and the 
proportion with a change in recommendation will be reported.  
 
Another exploratory analysis will evaluate ea ch specific drug’s effect on the participant  efficacy 
outcome (i.e. DFS) and toxicity. Because the number of participants receiving a specific drug 
treatment is expected to be relatively small, we will analyze  using a frailty model for DFS. In this 
model, we allow different drug effects to share the same variance estimate, in order to gain power. 
This analysis will be implemented in R package, coxph function. The drug effects on the toxicity 
will be analyzed  with the generalized linear mixed effect model, i mplemented in SAS PROC 
GLMMIX or GENMOD.  
 
The other exploratory analysis will depend on the results of sequencing. Similar to the drug 
specific analysis, we will use either the frailty model or the generalized linear mixed model to 
analyze clinical outcome s. 
 
[ADDRESS_777350] (DSMB) that will review and monitor 
study progress, toxicity, safety and other data from this trial. The DSMB is separate from the 
IUSCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) referred to below. The board is chaired 
by [CONTACT_590073]. Questions about participant safety or 
protocol performance will be addressed wi th the Sponsor investigator, statistician , and study team 
members. Should any major concerns arise; the DSMB will offer recommendations regarding 
whether or not to suspend the trial.  
 
The DSMB will meet twice a year to review accrual, toxicity, response , and reporting information. 
The DSMB will meet annually after the last participant is off treatment and has completed the end 
of treatment evaluation. Information to be provided to the DSMB may include: participant accrual, 
treatment regimen information, adv erse events , and serious adverse events reported by [CONTACT_17203], 
summary of any deaths on study, audit , and/or monitoring results.  
 
The DSMB will provide a recommendation to the team after all information is reviewed. This 
information should also be provided to the IRB at the time of continuing review for the trial.  
 
13.1.2  Data Safety Monitoring Committee  
HCRN will provide the DSMC with data summary reports as requested.  The DSMC will also 
review DSMB reports regarding this study.

PURPOSE OF STUDY
Why is this research being done?
Since the identification of the HIV virus, much has been learned about the disease caused by [CONTACT_420485], for people who are able to take their antiretroviral medications on a regular basis, the 
life expectancy is now what it would be for that person based upon his current age. 
In this study we are referring to young men who have sex with men as YMSM. In Baltimore and 
other US cities, HIV positive YMSM have not stayed in outpatient care or taken care of their 
HIV/AIDS the best way. HIV/AIDS clinics have tried a number of ways to keep YMSM coming 
to treatment, but we are going to try a new method.
This research is evaluating the response of both YMSM and HIV clinic staff when the staff 
members of the clinic are taught new skills.

that your identity could become re-connected with your health information.  If this happened - 
information could be revealed that could lead to denial of employment or insurance for you or a 
relative, or law enforcement agencies might be able to demand information about you in 
connection with an investigation. Our staff is trained to take steps to protect your confidentiality.

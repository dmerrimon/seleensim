The current application is for testing an interv ention to help more low -income smok ers get closer to quitting. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a
decrease in the r ates smoking cigarettes in the gener al population, smoking r ates in low -income populations are still
compar atively high. The standard pr actice for smoking cessation progr ams is state tobacco Quitlines, but these services
are gener ally only offered to those who are ready to quit smoking in the next 30 da ys, effectiv ely ex cluding 70-80% of
low-income smok ers. This study will pro vide an alternativ e to people who aren't ready to quit y et, called Smok e-Free 
 Homes. Smok e-Free Homes in volves helpi[INVESTIGATOR_551634], which will reduce second-hand
smok e exposure for non-smok ers, including children, who liv e in the home. In addition, the smok ers themselv es are
more lik ely to reduce the number of cigarettes they smok e and get closer to quitting. 
 
The interv ention is a Hybrid T ype [ADDRESS_724952] pr actice interv ention (the
state Quitline; Arm 1) with the expanded service alternativ e (the Quitline in addition to Smok e-Free Homes; Arm 2)
among 1,980 low -income smok ers across nine states. P articipants will be r andomly assigned to each Study Arm. The
study outcomes are 7-da y and 30-da y point prev alence of smoking abstinence, number of cigarettes per da y, number of
24-hour quit attempts, and acceptance of the interv entions. P articipants will be recruited from nine state United W ay 2-

1.5 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project:
Cigarette smoking in the U .S. follows a socio-economic gr adient. Adult smoking prev alence is 26-28% among the
poor, least educated, and those on Medicaid or uninsured, compared to 14% in adults abo ve the po verty level and
7% in those with a college degree. Compared to other smok ers, low -income smok ers begin smoking at a y ounger
age, ha ve greater nicotine dependence, lower self -efficacy for quitting, lower readiness to quit, are less lik ely to use
evidence-based quitting methods, and succeed less often when trying to quit. Smoking-related cancers are more
common and more often diagnosed at a later stage in low -income and low -education populations.6,7,[ADDRESS_724954] U .S.
populations and places, smoking is relativ ely uncommon and/or not permitted. But in social networks of low -income
smok ers, it is prev alent, normativ e and acceptable, especially at home and work. In our recently completed U01
studies of Smok e Free Homes in low -income populations in fiv e states, 66% of participants reported that half or
more of their friends and relativ es smok e. In our ongoing R01 study of low -income smok ers, 42% liv e with at least
one other smok er, and of those who are emplo yed, 75% work with other smok ers. Smoking norms lik e these are
associated with higher r ates of indoor smoking and lower r ates of cessation among low -income smok ers, in part
because they feel less pressure to quit. 
 
Although 83% of U .S. households now ha ve smok e free home rules, only 46% of households with smok ers ha ve
bans, and just 37% of households with low -income smok ers ha ve them. W e hypothesiz e that expanding population-
level cessation services to include Smok e Free Homes will engage more low -income smok ers in pro ven interv entions
and yield greater cessation than current standard pr actice. Our proposed approach is based on six broad claims
supported b y strong evidence from multiple disciplines: 
 1. Most low -income smok ers are not ready to quit. R eadiness to quit is the strongest predictor of making a quit
attempt. Compared to smok ers not thinking about quitting, those planning to quit in the next 30 da ys are six times
more lik ely to try quitting and four times more lik ely to succeed.66 But low -income and low -education smok ers are
significantly less lik ely to be planning to quit. Studies in div erse populations and settings consistently find that only
20-30% of low -income smok ers are ready to quit in the next [ADDRESS_724955] pr actice, these smok ers
are ineligible to receiv e cessation services and offered nothing to help them prepare to quit. NCI’ s Tobacco Control
Research Priorities for 2016-2025 call for interv entions that “reach and engage” ambiv alent 
 smok ers and facilitate “tr ansition from unmotiv ated smok er to abstinence” (Priorit y 6-2). 
 
2. Creating a Smok e Free Home is easier than quitting smoking. Studies in communit y health centers, safet y net
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], subsidiz ed housing, the V A system and homeless shelters consistently find that low -income smok ers ha ve
low confidence in their abilit y to quit and r ate quitting as “v ery hard. ” In sharp contr ast, creating a smok e free home
is viewed as less difficult and confidence for banning in-home smoking is high. In our team’ s SFH studies,
participants were confident (7.8 on a 1-10 scale) they could mak e their home smok e-free. Other research has
reported nearly identical confidence scores across 10 in-home smoking situations. In separ ate studies, only 21% of
participants said it would be “difficult ” or “v ery difficult ” to adopt a home smoking ban or “too hard” to comply with a
full smoking ban. In more motiv ated populations, parents who smok e rate adopting a smok e-free home as not
difficult (4.9 out of 10, where 10=most difficult) and most sa y making their 
 home smok e-free is “manageable” and a “first step” tow ards quitting. Among low -income individuals who adopt
home smoking bans, only [ADDRESS_724956] accept a Smok e Free Homes interv ention. This is
supported b y 50 y ears of F oot-in-the-Door (FITD) research. FITD is a sequential request str ategy to achiev e
behavioral compliance without pressure. P eople first receiv e a small request they are lik ely to accept, then a larger
request that is the actual target beha vior sought. Completing the larger request is more lik ely among those who first
complete the smaller request than among those who receiv e only the larger request. 
 
FITD can help people quit smoking. In a r andomiz ed study , 63% of smok ers who agreed to a small request (no
smoking for two hours) later agreed to a larger request (no smoking for 24 hours). Only 27% agreed to stop for a
day when that w as the only request. The effect persisted for actual smoking: 28% of FITD smok ers quit for a da y
compared to 12% who receiv ed only the request to quit for 24 hours. Findings from a communit y-based smok e free
homes initiativ e in low -income neighborhoods support FITD: of 523 smok ers who made a smok e free home pledge
(the initial small request), 12% went on to set a quit date and 6% quit within four weeks. 
Three conditions maximiz e FITD effects: (1) ha ving individuals perform – not just agree to – an initial request that
requires some effort to complete; (2) emphasizing that performing the initial request shows that a person is capable
of completing the larger request; and (3) making the larger request a natur al extension of the initial request. Our
design and interv entions reflect this; creating a smok e free home is the small request and quitting smoking is the
large one. NCI’ s Tobacco Control R esearch Priorities for 2016-2025 seek “sequential treatment str ategies” to increase
use of evidence-based interv entions b y unmotiv ated smok ers (Priorit y 6-3).

https://myirb.wusm.wustl.edu/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=1 11698948 4/105. Smok e Free Homes increase success in quitting. Evidence from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies shows an
association between ha ving a smok e free home and making a quit attempt, longer dur ation of quit attempts, and
abstinence from smoking. Ha ving a smok e free home is also associated with reduced relapse among ex -smok ers and
reduced cigarette consumption among continuing smok ers. This is in part because smok ers most lik ely to ha ve home
smoking bans are lighter smok ers or in adv anced stages of readiness to quit, but also due to genuine “treatment
effects” lik e reducing exposure to smoking and other smok ers, making it less con venient to smok e at home, and
disrupting smoking patterns and cues. 
To understand how establishing a smok e free home affects cessation in low -income smok ers, we analyz ed data from
our team’ s Smok e Free Homes interv ention trials (pooled n=941 with no home smoking ban at baseline). Controlling
for study group and correlates of cessation and Smok e Free Homes, creating a Smok e Free Home increased quit
rates at 3-month follow -up nearly 4-fold (15.6% vs 4.5%; OR=3.9, 95% CI=2.1,7.3) and ev en more at 6-month
follow -up (26.1% vs 5.1%; OR=6.6, 95% CI=4.1,10.3). Most promising for the proposed study , among smok ers
who had nev er tried quitting at baseline, those who created a Smok e Free Home were significantly more lik ely to
report a quit attempt at follow -up than those who did not create one. 
6. Expanding treatment offerings in population-lev el tobacco services will attr act more low -income smok ers.
Business scholars ha ve shown that because customer needs and preferences v ary, offering a v ariety of products or
services attr acts more customers and increases sales. These principles apply to reducing smoking in low -income
Americans; b y offering Smok e Free Homes, quitlines will engage more smok ers than with cessation alone. NCI’ s
Tobacco Control R esearch Priorities for 2016-2025 call for testing “population wide approaches” that increase
“uptak e and reach of existing evidence-based treatments” (Priorit y 1-1). 
Led b y [CONTACT_473668] (PI: U01 CA154282), our team dev eloped Some Things are Better Outside (hereafter , Smok e Free
Homes or SFH). Based on Social Cognitiv e Theory and the T ranstheoretical Model,SFH consists of goalsetting, role
modeling, persuasion, en vironmental cues and reinforcement deliv ered o ver six weeks via a telephone coaching call
and three mailings. Its impact w as ev aluated in three separ ate RCT s and its potential for scale-up ev aluated in a
national dissemination study (T able 1), all in low -income 2-1-[ADDRESS_724957] s, over half of participants
reported annual household income <$10,000; most were African American (83% in A tlanta; 61% in NC; 65% in TX)
or Hispanic (12% in TX). The dissemination study did not assess income, but 54% of participants were African
American, 24% had <HS education, 39% had a HS diploma or GED only , and 78% rented their home. 
An initial efficacy trial w as conducted in A tlanta, with SFH deliv ered b y a univ ersity research team to adults in
households that allowed smoking and had at least one smok er and one non-smok er. Compared to a no-interv ention
control group , those who receiv ed SFH were more lik ely to report a home smoking ban at 3-month (30% vs. 15%,
p<=0.001) and 6-month follow -up (40% v . 25%, p<0.01).1 Self -reports were v alidated with air nicotine monitors.
Next, we conducted a r andomiz ed effectiv eness trial in North Carolina with SFH deliv ered b y a 2-1-1 helpline. Again,
those receiving SFH were more lik ely than controls to report a home smoking ban at 3-month (38% vs.
19%,p<.001) and 6-month (43% vs. 33%, p<.05) follow -up. A third RCT , in [LOCATION_007], sought to replicate the NC
findings in a different region and population. As before, those receiving Smok e Free Homes were more lik ely than
controls to report home smoking bans at 3-month (47% vs. 25%, p<.001) and 6-month (63% vs. 38%, p<.001)
follow -up. Findings remained significant in intent -to-treat and sensitivit y analyses in which those lost -to-follow -up or
reporting enforcement challenges were designated as failures. Process ev aluations showed that SFH w as well-
receiv ed and work ed for both smok ers and non-smok ers. 
Given the consistent interv ention effects across three separ ate RCT s in o ver 1,500 households, we launched a
dissemination trial in fiv e 2-1-1s in four states (AL, FL, OH, OK) selected through a competitiv e RFA process to
deliver SFH for one y ear and tr ack outcomes. They enrolled 2,345 households, deliv ered SFH, and reached 1,543
households (66%) at 2-month follow -up; 61% reported a home smoking ban and 11% reported quitting. 
Three secondary findings from these studies are highly relev ant to the proposed study . First, although changes in
smoking are not addressed b y SFH nor were aims of the studies, all three RCT s found greater reductions in
cigarettes smok ed per da y at follow -up in the SFH group (-2.9 per da y) vs. controls. Confidence in quitting w as
higher at 3-month follow -up in the SFH vs. control group , and there were more quit attempts. In all study groups,
those creating a home smoking ban had higher quit r ates (see abo ve). These findings bolster our claim that a smok e
free home can help smok ers progress tow ards quitting. Second, in all RCT s, the control group established home
smoking bans at a high r ate. W e believ e this w as due to an extensiv e battery of questions they answered about
home smoking bans at three time points (87 items in A tlanta; 96 in NC; 139 in TX). This “interv ention via
assessment ” led to family discussions and thoughts about home smoking bans. In the current study , we a void such
reactance b y asking <5 SFH questions see “Measures”). 
Helpi[INVESTIGATOR_551635]: specializ ed quitlines and meeting basic needs. This ongoing RCT (CA -201429;
Kreuter , PI) is [ADDRESS_724958]. 2018, 734 ha ve
been consented from a single 2-1-1 in Missouri, and 3- and 6-month follow -up rates (73% and 60%) ha ve met
targets. Giv en the proposed study’ s more inclusiv e eligibilit y (adding smok ers not ready to quit) and plans to recruit
from nine (vs. one) 2-1-1s, we are highly confident about recruiting 1,[ADDRESS_724959] quitline
condition to date (identical to QL in the proposed study), 58% ha ve taken a quitline call, 27% ha ve taken 2 or more
calls, 72% signed up for text messages on quitting and 52% read the quit guide. Third, the need for Smok e Free
Homes is substantial. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_551636] [ADDRESS_724960]. 2018 show
that 75% allow smoking in their home, 43% liv e with one or more other smok ers, and 78% of work ers ha ve
cowork ers who smok e. An interv ention lik e SFH is much needed. Although the proposed study will benefit from
methods, measures and effect siz es from the current R01, the studies are quite different. In the current R01 we’v e
excluded 1,880 low -income daily smok ers since June 2017 because they were not planning to quit in the next 30
days (n=1,516) or weren’ t interested in a quit smoking progr am (n=364). The proposed study would enroll such

within a quitline also distinguish the proposed study .

The recruitment and study procedures will occur for about 3 y ears and 3 months. P articipants will be ask ed to participate
in the study for a total of six months that ma y include completing the quitline coaching sessions which can tak e 1-4
months, Smok e-Free Homes which in volves 3 mailings and 1 coaching call o ver the course of 6 weeks, and follow -up at
3 and 6 months; howev er, they can withdr aw from the study at an y time. 
 
Study Arm 1 will be the control group who will be offered their state tobacco quitline services following the baseline
assessment. They will be giv en the option to enter this progr am. If they choose to do so , a Quit Coach from Optum will
reach out to them and pro vide between 1 and 4 coaching calls to help them quit smoking. The specifics of each state
quitline ma y vary slightly but the calls are scheduled to be flexible with the participant's a vailabilit y. Quit Coaches use
motiv ational interviewing and cognitiv e-beha vioral techniques to help the participant set a quit date and be ready to 
 quit. Progr ams also ma y have a printed Quit guide booklet, offer nicotine replacement ther apy (NR T) like nicotine gum
or patches, and pro vide texting and/or emailing services. P articipants are also giv en a number that they can call
whenev er they need to . 
 
Study Arm 2 will be the treatment group and they will also be offered their state tobacco quitline. What differs in this
condition is that if participants are not interested in the quitline, they will be offered Smok e-free homes (SFH), which
includes 3 mailings at 1 week, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after enrollment and a coaching call at 2 weeks after enrollment.
The SFH coach will discuss the steps of making their home smok e-free, goal-setting, and potential challenges and
solutions.

participants will report use of an y pharmacologic cessation aids (i.e. , NRT, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], Chantix). Successful quitters (7
days) will report their confidence in sta ying quit and all others will report readiness to quit. R eactions to the quitline and
smok e-free homes interv entions and staff will be assessed with measures from our previous studies assessing
usefulness (e.g. , was it helpful?), satisfaction (would y ou recommend it to others?) user experience (were they easy to

who didn't quit who were in the treatment group will be offered whichev er progr am they weren't offered at baseline. 
The second follow -up assessment will occur at 6 months after baseline and will again be ask ed about smoking
abstinence and their success in creating a smok e-free home. Those who report that they don't smok e will be offered to
take an at -home urine cotinine test to v erify their lowered nicotine lev els. If participants are willing to participate, they
will be mailed a urine test to measure their cotinine lev els, which is a metabolite of nicotine. The urine test, which can
be purchased at an y local pharmacy o ver-the-counter , will be mailed to participants with instructions for sending the
results. The study team will not receiv e any biological samples or testing materials in the mail. Instead, participants will
be instructed to send a pi[INVESTIGATOR_551637]/or phone account. The photo will include
only the results: a photo of the dipstick next to the results card. No personal identifiable information will be included in
the photo . The results will be link ed to the participants study ID via their phone number from which the photo w as sent.
Consent will be obtained prior to sending the testing kit in the mail via phone script. R esults will be recorded in

the participant (if an y)
benefits to societ y (if an y)
All participants will be giv en the opportunit y to receiv e free Quitline services and some will also be giv en the
opportunit y to create a smok e-free home. Both of these options will pro vide a significant health benefit to the
participants and those who liv e in the home. This study will show whether Quitlines can effectiv ely pro vide an
alternativ e to quitting smoking for those who aren't ready to quit y et, reducing exposure to secondhand smok e.
1.[ADDRESS_724971] population-lev el cessation services will increase the proportion of low -
income smok ers who quit b y 6-month follow -up. In this analysis, the independent and dependent v ariables are
dichotomous; the str ata variable is participants’ state of residence, also a pro xy for benefits offered b y their state
quitline. The primary outcome, self -report abstinence at 6-month follow -up, will be v alidated b y urine cotinine test:
Level 3-[ADDRESS_724972] result will be assessed using the K appa statistic, with v alues > 0.[ADDRESS_724973] for this
using t -tests for continuous v ariables and chi-square tests for categorical v ariables. If significant differences are
found, we will include those v ariables as co variates in all analyses. F or Aim 1A (abstinence from smoking) the
Cochr an–Mantel–Haensz el test will be used to test the conditional association between study group and abstinence
at 3- and 6-month follow -up, controlling for states. A Breslow -Day test will be used to examine whether there is a
common odds r atio (OR) across states. Finding greater odds of abstinence across states for the group receiving both
Quitline and Smok e Free Homes would support the h ypothesiz ed interv ention effects. If the Breslow -Day test is
significant, we will estimate state-specific ORs. T o control for other potential co variates, we will regress abstinence at
3- and 6-month follow -up on study group and other co variates using logistic regression. In the regression model, 8
dumm y variables for states will be created to account for differences in state Quitlines. Adjusted odds r atios (OR)
and 95% confidence interv als (CI) will be reported to quantif y the associations. Study group effects for Aim 1B
(made a quit attempt or did not) will be examined in a series of analyses similar to those described for Aim 1A.
Finding a greater odds of quit attempts in the Quitline and Smok e Free Homes group across states would support
hypothesiz ed effects. F or Aim 1C, cigarettes smok ed per da y is a count dependent v ariable (DV) measured at
baseline, 3- and 6-month follow -up and assumed to follow the P oisson distribution. If the assumption of P oisson
distribution is met, we will regress the DV on study group , states and other potential co variates and allow the β for
study group as a r andom effect using r andom-effect P oisson regression. Otherwise, we will fit r andom effect negativ e
binomial regression to the data. Finding a larger decrease in cigarettes smok ed per da y in the combined group (vs.
Quitline alone) would support the h ypothesiz ed effect. Analyses for Aim 1D will replicate those for Aims 1A -C, but be
conducted in only the subset of participants from both groups who declined quitline services when offered at
baseline. R egression analyses for Aim 1D will also test baseline v ariables described previously (see “Baseline
survey”), because quitline acceptance r ates ma y differ b y group . These comparisons pro vide the best estimate of the
added benefit of offering Smok e Free Homes to smok ers who are not y et ready to quit. 
 
Aim 2. The primary implementation research question in this Hybrid T ype 2 trial is whether demand for and
engagement in quitline services – oper ationaliz ed as acceptance and use – differs b y study group . In Aim 2A, the DV
is dichotomous (accepts Quitline/does not). Using the same analytical str ategies and statistical methods described
for Aim 1A, we will examine cumulativ e probabilities of accepting quitline services during the study period b y group ,
adjusting for baseline co variates. Finding a greater lik elihood of accepting quitline services in the combined group
(vs. Quitline only) will support our h ypothesis. F or Aim 2B , the DV is whether participants use 0, 1 or 2+ quitline
counseling sessions, and will be treated as an ordinal v ariable. Counseling sessions include all inbound and outbound
phone inter actions between a quit coach and participant. Among those who accept quitline services, we will regress
number of quitline sessions used b y the end of the study on study group and other baseline measures using ordinal
logistic regression. The proportional odds assumption will be tested using the score chisquare test. If it is met,
adjusted ORs and 95% CIs will be reported from the ordinal logistic regression model. Otherwise, multinomial
logistic regression will be used to compare different probabilities (e.g. , 0 vs 1 and 0 vs 2+ sessions), adjusting for
potential baseline co variates. Finding greater odds of using more sessions in the Quiltine and Smok e Free Homes
group will support our h ypothesis. Aim 2C examines our h ypothesis that integr ating a Smok e Free Homes
interv ention into an existing tobacco treatment system will mo ve smok ers who are not y et ready to quit
incrementally closer to quitting. R eadiness to quit, pessimism about quitting and ambiv alence about smoking are
continuous DVs for this aim. Among participants still smoking at the end of the study , the lev el of readiness,
pessimism and ambiv alence at 6-month follow -up will be regressed on study group , states, baseline DV and baseline

smoking, and less pessimism about quitting in the Quitline and Smok e Free Homes group (vs. Quitline only) would
support our h ypothesis. 
Aim 3. Economic ev aluation is essential in assessing implementation feasibilit y and sustainabilit y. We will assess
cost-effectiv eness (using CEA) of adding the Smok e Free Homes interv ention to quitline services compared to
Quitline alone from the QL pro vider perspectiv e, and conduct a cost -benefit analysis (CBA) of SFH compared to QL
alone from both the individual and societial perspectiv es. Short - (during progr am) and long-term horiz ons (multiple
years) will be considered, using accepted methods of economic ev aluation.208-[ADDRESS_724974] accounting records of Optum. If SFH does not incur additional fix ed costs abo ve QL, fix ed
costs are ignor able in the CEA and CBA as they cancel out between interv entions. V ariable costs depend on scope
and number of activities. Coaching calls are core to the QL, but the number can v ary by [CONTACT_54443]. SFH in volves one call
and three mailings (postage, printing costs). Costs per call in QL and SFH will be measured b y length in minutes,
average w age (including fringe benefits) of a coach, and the additional time spent on unsuccessful attempts to reach
a participant. In terms of cost -effectiv eness, Aim [ADDRESS_724975] per successful quit.
1.21 Provide the r ationale or power analysis to support the number of participants proposed to complete this study .
Based on previous reser ach, in both groups, 25% of participants will accept QL when offered (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 1, ongoing
cessation R01); 42%, 31% and 27% will tak e 0, 1 and 2+ QL calls, respectiv ely (ongoing cessation R01); and 12%,
13% and 31% will report quitting, respectiv ely (ongoing cessation R01). In the QL+SFH group , 65% of those who
decline QL will accept SFH (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 2, SFH trials); of those accepting, 37% will create a SFH and 63% will not, with
corresponding quit r ates of 26% and 5% (SFH trials). W e assume all who decline QL and SFH will quit at a v ery low
rate (2%). Using these data to estimate cessation after a first offer of QL and SFH yields intent -to-treat quit r ates of
5.9% (SFH) and 11% (QL+SFH). Ev en if no other cessation occurs, the study is powered to detect this difference. If
we assume the same interv ention use and quit r ates apply for a second offer of QL and SFH (at 3-month follow -up),
intent -to-treat quit r ates would be 9.6% (SFH) and 17.5% (QL+SFH), also within the study’ s power . We are
confident that the final quit r ates for each group will fall between these v alues. 
 
We used G*P ower to calculate the sample siz e required to detect study group quit r ate differences of 6 vs 11%
(minimum expected), 8 vs 14%, and 10 vs 17% (maximum expected) at three lev els of power . As shown, with
1,116 participants (558 per group) completing 6-month follow -up, we can detect a 6 vs 11% difference with 85%
power . Power will be greater for larger differences. A ttrition is expected to be 40% at 6-month follow -up, thus a
baseline sample of 1,980 assures enough participants at follow -up (n=1,188) ev en if attrition is slightly higher than
projected.

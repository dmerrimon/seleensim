2/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 3 
RATIONALE 
Protocol GO29505 has been amended to include the following changes: 
• Wording regarding dosing delay due to treatment-related toxicity (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
has been added to clarify that when dosing delay to paclitaxel occurs, preferred 
dosing for ipatasertib/placebo is to align and resume with paclitaxel dosing 
• To clarify that dose reductions and dose modification(s) for ipatasertib/placebo and 
paclitaxel are independent (Table 1) 
• To provide further guidance and clarification to the management of diarrhea 
Dosing modification for ipatasertib and placebo (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
Diarrhea management (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• To add Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea and Grade 2 diarrhea that persists for longer than 5 days 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_3062] (per diarrhea management in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
as adverse event of special interest in Section 5.2.3 to improve monitoring of 
diarrhea events by [CONTACT_1034] 
• Wording regarding recording of persistent or recurrent adverse events 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]) has been modified/added to clarify data entry requirements for adverse event reporting 
• To add a sensitivity analysis that accounts for patients whose pCR assessment 
cannot be ascertained (Section 6.4.1). 
• To include additional information on the management guideline for diarrhea 
(Appendix 6) 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.

3/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906726] the changes to the protocol, where 
applicable. 
SECTION 3.1.2:  Joint Monitoring Committee  
A Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) will be in place during the study and will provide oversight of safety and efficacy.  The primary responsibility of the JMC is to review the available safety data and to make a reco mmendation to continue, modify the study 
design as required for improved safety, or terminate the study.  While a JMC review is 
being conducted, patient accrual into the study will continue.  The JMC will be 
composed of a designated sponsor medical oncologist (who is not the study medical 
monitor), the drug safety officer, and the study biostatistician.  In addition, the  JMC will 
also include at least two external medical oncologists who are not employees of 
[COMPANY_002]/Genentech and are not affiliated with the study team, to provide clinical and methodological expertise in early breast cancer.  The members of the JMC will not interact with the sites or investigators in terms of study conduct.   
The JMC will convene to review partially unblinded summaries of th
e safety data after 
approximately [ADDRESS_906727] completed study treatment as well as 
surgery, the JMC will convene again to review data from an i nterim safety and efficacy 
analysis.  Additional details (e.g.,  JMC members, communication, affiliations) will be 
provided in the JMC Agreement.  While this review is being conducted, patient accrual 
into the study will continue.  The medical monitor may a lso request additional safety 
and/or efficacy analysis and may call for additional meetings of the JMC to review 
ongoing data to assess risk/benefit.  
The reviews the JMC will conduct are descri bed in Section 6.8.1 and Section 6.8.2.  
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Paclitaxel 
The dose of paclitaxel in this study is 80 mg/m2 administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, 
15, and 22 of each 4-week cycle, for a total of 3 cycles of treatment (12 total doses) .… 
SECTION 5.1.2:  Safety Monitoring  
Safety will be evaluated in this current study through the monitoring of all serious 
adverse events, non-serious adverse event s, and laboratory abnormalities, defined and 
graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0.  In addition, prespecified analyses of the safety 
and relevant efficacy data will be conducted by [CONTACT_671109] [ADDRESS_906728] completed study treatment including surgery (safety only), and again after 

Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
4/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906729] completed study treatment including surgery (safety and 
efficacy In addition, the JMC will conduct analyses of safety (see Section 6.8.1 and 
Section 6.8.2 ). 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  General Guidelines 
General guidelines for dosage/schedule modification are summarized as follows: 
• If paclitaxel treatment component is delayed, the study cycle day count for each 
cycle continues and does not shift.  
• If ipatasertib or placebo treatment is delayed, paclitaxel treatment should continue 
as scheduled; however, if paclitaxel treatment is delayed and ipatasertib/placebo is 
scheduled to be administered at the same timepoint, it is preferred that 
ipatasertib/placebo is also delayed to align with paclitaxel dosing . 
• If the dose day of paclitaxel treatment is delayed, the ipatasertib or placebo may be 
delayed at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Dosage Modifi cation for Ipatasertib and Placebo 
If the patient does not tolerate the QD dosing of the ipatasertib or placebo, a BID 
regimen of the ipatasertib or placebo (with the total daily dose divided in half, without a dose reduction, and administered approximately every 12 hours) may be attempted (e.g., a 400 mg QD dose may be divided into 200 mg administered BID).  The BID 
regimen may be used to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea,
 and 
vomiting, and/or diarrhea .  Employment of a BID regimen should not be considered as a 
dose reduction.  No more than two dose reducti ons of ipatasertib or placebo per patient 
(lowest dose level to be administered will be 200 mg/day) will be allowed, and dose 
re-escalation of ipatasertib or placebo may be permitted in the study after discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Diarrhea 
Diarrhea should be managed with loperamide or per institutional guidelines. local 
guidelines and standard of care, includin g but not limited to therapy with Lomotil 
(diphenoxylate and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), codeine, or octreotide.   Dose reductions for diarrhea 
should occur only if the symptoms persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_671090] (combination) 
anti-diarrheal medications.  If persistent diarrhea  (more than 48 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_671091])  is attributable to the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or 
paclitaxel, dosage modification guidelines for ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel are 
outlined below: 
• Grade 2 diarrhea :  The investigator should initiate optimal medical management 
with loperamide as early as possible.  If di arrhea is persistent (lasting longer than 
48 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_45862]), second-line therapy may employ a BID 
regimen include (but not limited to) Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), codeine 
or octreotide per local guidelines and standard  of care.  Ipatasertib/placebo dosing 
should be interrupted until improvement of diarrhea to Grade ≤ 1, at which time 
ipatasertib administration (equivalent to /placebo may be resumed at  the total 
daily same  dose divided by [CONTACT_2016]), see Sectio n 0.  Alterna tively, the investigator may 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
5/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 alsofor initial occurrence with consideration of maintenance loperamide dosing (i.e., 
2 mg, 2 to 4 times daily).  Investigators may  reduce ipatasertib or placebo by [CONTACT_23615] (see Table 1)  for recurrent Grade 2 diarrhea.  If diarrhea persists 
following up to two  dose reduction s of ipatasertib or placebo, consider dose hold or 
reduction of paclitaxel by [CONTACT_31806] .  Dose intensity of paclitaxel should be maintained as 
much as is safely possible. Paclitaxel  dose level reduction or discontinuation can be 
considered if diarrhea persists even after ipatasertib/placebo discontinuation  (see 
Table 1). 
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea :  Medical management of diarrhea per Grade 2 diarrhea above 
should be initiated as early as possible.  Ipatasertib or placebo should be held until 
the diarrhea resolves to Grade ≤ 21, at which time maintenance loperamide dosing 
(i.e., 2 mg, 2 to 4 times daily) is recommended.  The dose of ipatasertib or placebo 
will be reduced by [CONTACT_158175] (see Table 1).  If 
diarrhea persists following dose reduction of ipatasertib or placebo, consider an 
additional dose hold or reduction of paclitaxel by [CONTACT_671110]/placebo should be considered (see Table 1).  Dose intensity of paclitaxel should be maintained as much as is safely possible.  Paclitaxel dose reduction or 
discontinuation can be considered if diarrhea persists even after ipatasertib/placebo 
discontinuation (see Table 1) .  
 
Dose re-escalation of the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel may be permitted in 
subsequent cycles for patients who exhibit Grade ≤
 [ADDRESS_906730] one cycle 
after discussion with the Medical Monitor .  
For additional information on the management guideline for diarrhea, see Appendix 6.  
SECTION 5.2.3:  Non-Serious Adver se Events of Special Interest 
(Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor)  
…Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: 
• Grade ≥ 3 colitis  or diarrhea 
• Grade 2 diarrhea that persists for longer than 5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_115116] (per diarrhea management in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
SECTION [IP_ADDRESS]:  Persistent  or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial , unless the severity (intensity or grade) of the event 
will be record ed at the time the event is first reported. increases.   If a persistent adverse 
event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity it should also be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial (less severe) adverse event 
report should be updated to indicate that the event resolved on the date just prior to the 
day the event became more severe.  If the a persistent adverse  event becomes serious, it 
should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
6/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 be updated by [CONTACT_25748] " initial ( non -serious" to " ) adverse event report 
should be updated to indicate that the event resolved on the date just prior to the day 
the event became serious," providing the date that the event became serious, and 
completing all data fields related to serio us adverse events .  
SECTION 6.4.1:  Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint  
In addition, a sensitivity analysis may be conducted to account for patients whose pCR assessment cannot be ascertained.  
Section 6.8.2:  Optional Interim Analysis  
In addition, the Medical Monitor may request additional safety analysis and may call for additional meetings of the JMC to review ongoing data to assess risk/benefit.

Objectives
 
Efficacy Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective for this study is to estimate the efficacy of ipatasertib combined 
with paclitaxel compared with placebo combined  with paclitaxel in patients with early stage 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), as measured by [CONTACT_671112] l aboratory evaluation of 
pathological complete response (pCR) rate within the breast and axilla (ypT0/Tis ypN0) in all patients and in patients with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-low tumors. 
The secondary efficacy objectives for this study are as follows: 
• To estimate the clinical activity of ipatas ertib combined with pa clitaxel compared with 
placebo combined with paclitaxel, as measured by [CONTACT_671113] (ypT0/Tis) in all patients and in patients with PTEN-low tumors 
• To evaluate objective response rate (ORR ) assessed by [CONTACT_671114] (MRI) via modified Response Evaluati on Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) of 
ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel compared wi th placebo combined with paclitaxel in all 
patients and in patients with PTEN-low tumors 
• To estimate the clinical activity, as measured by [CONTACT_508880] (ypT0/Tis and ypT0/Tis ypN0) and 
ORR of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel compared with placebo combined with 
paclitaxel in patients who are Akt diagnostic positive (Dx+) (defined by [CONTACT_671115], 
INPP4B status, and PI3K alterations) 
• To assess pCR rates according to subtypes of  breast cancer defined by [CONTACT_671116] 
(e.g., the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer defined by [CONTACT_671117]50 classifier)

Study Design  
Description of Study 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-contro lled, multicenter, pre-operative Phase II study 
designed to estimate the efficacy of ipataserti b combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy versus 
placebo combined with paclitaxel chemotherapy in women with Stage Ia −IIIa (primary 
tumors ≥ 1.5 cm) triple-negative breast adenocarcinoma.   Patients with cT4 or cN3 tumors are 
not eligible.  Patients and investigators will be blinded to study treatment.  Estrogen receptor 
(ER)- and Progesterone receptor  (PgR)-negative is defined as < 1% of tumor cell expression of 
ER and PgR.  Patients who have an unknown ER, PgR, or human epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] 2 
(HER2) status and for whom determination of status is not possible are also not eligible for this 
study.  Estimated benefit will be compared in a ll patients (independent of results from the 
diagnostic assessments of the tumor) and in patients with PTEN-low tumors. 
Approximately 150 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30 centers.  Patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_671121]:  PTEN status (H score 0, vs. 
1 to ≤ 150, vs. > 150), node involvement (pathologically positive versus no known involvement), 
and T size (T1 −2 vs. T3). 
For the purpose of enrollment, ER, PgR, and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning 
of study treatment.  Additionally, all enrolled patients must consent to provide sufficient and 
evaluable archival tissue for PTEN status determination.  In the absence of archival tissue, fresh tissue biopsy samples, excluding cytology and fine-needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) specimens, 
will be acceptable; however, eval uation of the patient’s tumor sample for PTEN status by a 
central laboratory should occur prior to the init iation of study treatment.  All patients will undergo 
pretreatment tumor tissue acquisition (snap-fr ozen, optimal cutting temperature [OCT], and 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] cores).  One pretreatment FFPE core biopsy and two 
freshly frozen core biopsies must be obtained for all patients prior to initiating study treatment.  
Pre-surgical FNA or core biopsy of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_671093], but full excision lymph node biopsy (e.g., sentinel lymph node excisi onal biopsy [SLNB]) is not allowed. 
All patients will receive paclitaxel 80 mg/m
2 every 7 days for a total of 12 doses (i.e., Days 1, 8, 
15, and 22 of each cycle) .  Patients in the experimental arm will receive ipatasertib at a dose of 
400 mg administered orally once daily (QD) on Days 1 to 21 every 28 days and those in the 
control arm will receive placebo on the same day s.  Each cycle will be 28 days in duration and 
study treatment will continue for a total of thr ee cycles until disease pr ogression, intolerable

17/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 toxicity, elective withdrawal from the study, or  study completion or termination.  Following three 
cycles of treatment, pati ents will undergo  surgery. 
Prior to administration of t he second paclitaxel dose, a second res earch biopsy will be 
conducted for biomarker evaluation; at least one FFPE and at least two frozen OCT cores 
biopsy samples will be obtained.   
Primary breast tumor and axillary lymph nodes will be assessed every [ADDRESS_906750] exam (palpation and clinical  measurement; caliper preferred).  Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_671094].  Tumo r measurement by [CONTACT_671122] (at approximately 
Weeks 10 −12, following completion of neoadjuvant chem otherapy).  Early assessment by [CONTACT_671123].  Es timation of ORR will be by [CONTACT_100694]. 
Patients with clinical or radiologic evidence of significant residual or progressive disease, as 
defined by [CONTACT_100694], can either proceed directly to surgery or be discontinued from the study, based on the investigator’s discretion.  Pa tients who discontinue study treatment prior to 
surgery will be required to have an additional research biopsy where at least one FFPE and at least two frozen OCT core biopsy samples will be obtained.   
Safety will be evaluated during the study through the monitoring of all serious and nonserious 
adverse events, graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE, v4.0).   
The pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib/pl acebo will be assessed in all patients. 
During Weeks 10 −12 (approximately; i.e., near the time of completion of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy), the patient will consult with the surgeon to plan the type of  breast surgery to be 
performed (breast conservative vs. mastecto my) and to schedule the date for surgery. 
Following surgical resection of primary tumor, pat ients are expected to continue post-operative 
treatment with a standard adjuvant  chemotherapy regimen such as 
5-FU/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC), 5-FU/epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]/cyclophosphamide (FEC), or 
doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC), if appropriate and as chosen by [CONTACT_24018].  
Post-operative treatment information (chemotherapy, radiother apy, etc.) will be collected at the 
post-surgery visit. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, pCR within the breast and axilla (ypT0/Tis ypN0) in all patients 
and in patients with PTEN-low tumors will be as sessed by [CONTACT_671124]. The trial is anticipated to have a recr uitment period of approximately 24 months.

Investigational Medicinal Products  
Test Product 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) and Placebo  
Ipatasertib will be supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Study treatment to either ipatasertib or plac ebo will be assigned by [CONTACT_671129] (IWRS).  Ipatasertib or placebo will be administered orally QD, beginning on Cycle 1, 
Day 1 through Day 21 of each 28-day cycle for a total of 3 cycles of treatment.  Patients in the 
experimental arm will receive ipatasertib at a dose of 400 mg QD, and those in the control arm will receive placebo on the same days.  Ipataser tib or placebo will be administered prior to the 
IV infusion of paclitaxel.  Each dose of ipatas ertib or placebo should be taken with a minimum of 
3 ounces (90 mL) of fluid.  Ipatasertib or placebo may be taken with or without food.  If a dose is 
missed (not taken within 8 hours after the sched uled dosing time), the patient should resume 
dosing with the next scheduled dose.  Missed or vomited doses will not be made up. 
The dose of ipatasertib or placebo will be taken at home, as directed on all days when there are 
no scheduled clinic visits.  Ipatasertib or pl acebo should be taken at approximately the same 
time each day.  On study visit days or visit day s that require a blood draw for PK sampling, 
patients should not take their dose of ipataser tib or placebo at home before reporting to the 
clinic.  Patients will be instructed to take their oral  dose of ipatasertib or  placebo at the clinic 
after completion of the pretreatment assessments.  A sufficient amount of ipatasertib or placebo shoul d be provided to the patient to last for up to 
one treatment cycle (i.e., approximately 28 days) .  In some cases, extra tablets may be 
dispensed if there is a possibility that the patient’s next visit may be delayed (e.g., due to 
holiday, inclement weather, or distance of patient ’s home from study center).  Patients will also 
be given instructions for self-administration on dosi ng days that do not coincide with clinic visits. 
Patients will be asked to record the time and date they take each dose in a medication diary.  Patients will be instructed to bring their bottles of ipatasertib or placebo (including all unused 
tablets) and their medication diaries to each study visit for assessment of compliance and 
medication disposal. 
The investigator (or designated representative) is  responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_671095] , including the amount dispensed to each patient 
and the amount returned by [CONTACT_6904].  Study dr ug accountability (verification of the total 
number of tablets administered) for each pati ent should be performed as indicated in the 
protocol. 
Any dose modification, overdose, or incorrect adm inistration of ipatasertib or placebo should be 
noted on the Study Drug Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  Adverse events 
associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF. 
Paclitaxel
 
The dose of paclitaxel in this study is 80 mg/m2 administered by [CONTACT_197275] 1, 8, 15, 
and 22 of each 4-week cycle, for a total of 3 cycles of treatment  (12 total doses) .  Calculation of 
body surface area for the purposes of dosing of paclitaxel should be made according to the 
prescribing information.  If the patient’s weight changes by > 10% during the study, the body 
surface area and drug doses should be recalculated, per institutional guidelines.   
On the planned day of treatment, chemotherapy may be administered if:  
• ANC ≥ 1500/μL (or per institutional guideline) 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
22/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 • Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (or per institutional guideline) 
• Grade ≤ 2 clinically significant chemotherapy -related gastrointestinal toxicity 
Because of the known potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the 
Cremophor® vehicle, precautions must be taken to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis.  Patients 
must be premedicated prior to paclitaxel per institutional practice with dexamethasone, 
diphenhydramine, and one of the following two H 2-receptor blockers:  ranitidine or famotidine.  
Other H 2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, wh ich are known to inhibit cytochrome P450, 
are excluded.  An H 1-receptor antagonist, such as diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_906757] 60 minutes for each dose per institutional 
guidelines and administered after the oral dose of ipatasertib or placebo. Patients should be monitored during paclitaxel admin istration per institutional policies.  Patients 
may receive anti-emetic and other prophylactic treatments (e.g., IV infusions of calcium and 
magnesium to try and decrease any potential peri pheral neuropathy) according to institutional 
and/or local standards and per manufacturer’s instructions. Any dose modification, overdose, or incorrect administration of paclitaxel should be noted on 
the Paclitaxel Administration eCRF.  Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect 
administration of paclitaxel should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Comparator 
Ipatasertib placebo is the comparator in this st udy.  See Test Product section above for details. 
Statistical Methods
 
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based on randomized patients, with patients 
allocated to the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
Safety analyses will include treated patients (i.e., patients who received at least one dose of 
ipatasertib, placebo, or paclitax el), with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with 
the regimen that they actually received. 
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons when addressing primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints.  Multiple comparison adj ustments will be used for selected exploratory 
endpoints to account for genome-wide correlative comparisons.   
The primary analysis will be performed after LPLV and subsequent data cleaning, expected to 
occur approximately [ADDRESS_906758] and axilla (ypT0/Tis 
ypN0).  The primary efficacy analyses will be performed on randomized patients, with the patients allocated to the treatment arm accordi ng to the randomization.  The pCR endpoint will 
be analyzed for all randomized patients and for patients with PTEN-low tumors.  Patients whose 
pCR assessment is missing are counted as not achieving a pCR. 
An estimate of the pCR rate and its 90% CI (B lyth-Still-Casella method) will be calculated for 
each treatment arm for all randomized patients and for patients with PTEN-low tumors.  The 
difference in pCR rates will also be provided wi th 90% CIs, using the normal approximation to 
the binomial distribution.  Stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests will be used to compare treatment arms. 
In addition, a sensitivity analysis may be cond ucted to account for patients whose pCR assessment 
cannot be ascertained. 
Determination of Sample Size 
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and pr eliminary evidence of activity of ipatasertib 
and paclitaxel.  This trial is hypothesis-generating and is able to detect only a large benefit from 
combination therapy with ipatasertib and pac litaxel versus placebo and paclitaxel.   
A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in the study (75 per arm).  Assuming a 60% prevalence of 
PTEN-low status in TNBC, it is expected that [ADDRESS_906759] minimum clinically meaningful differences 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
23/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 between treatment arms at a statistically significant α (type 1) error level of 5%.  Instead, the 
90% confidence interval s (CIs) for the difference in pCR rate will be calculated with the 
expectation that for clinically meaningful outcome s, the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI will 
be greater than 0. 
For example, a true improvement of greater than 20% in pCR rate (from 20% to 40%) would be 
considered a clinically meaningful outcome when  comparing ipatasertib and paclitaxel versus 
placebo and paclitaxel.  Given at least 90 pati ents (45 per arm) with PTEN-low tumors and a 
targeted improvement of 20% in pCR rate, t he corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 
90% CI is 2.3%.  Also, for 150 patients (75 per arm) in ITT population with a targeted 
improvement of 15% in pCR rate, the corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI is 1.5%. 
Interim Analyses 
Planned Interim Analyses  
The Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) will convene for a review of partially unblinded 
summaries of the safety data after approximat ely [ADDRESS_906760] an optional interim analysis and the 
timing of the analysis will be documented in the Spon sor’s trial master file prior to the conduct of 
the interim analysis.  The interim analysis will be performed and reviewed by [CONTACT_671130]. 
In addition, the Medical Monitor may request additi onal safety analysis and may call for additional 
meetings of the JMC to review ongoing data to assess risk/benefit.

Globally, breast cancer is the most common invasive malignancy with a prevalence of more than 1.3 million patients and a mortality rate of approximately 450,000 deaths per year ( Jemal et al. 2011 ). 
The treatment algorithm for patients with breast cancer is based on several considerations, for example, clinical factors and histopathology characteristics, including the presence or absence of human epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] 2 (HER2) a mplification, and 
hormone receptor status.  Most breast cancers in the Western world (approximately 94−95% of patients in the U.S. and Europe) are diagnosed when the cancer is still 
confined to the breast, with or without locoregional lymph node spread ( Sant et al. 2003 ; 
Howlader et al. 2011 ).  At this stage (early breast cancer [EBC]), the disease is usually 
operable and can be treated surgically with curative intent. 
Even with current optimum treatment, approximately 20 −45% of patients with clinically 
localized disease at diagnosis relapse ( EBCTCG 2011 , 2012 ).  Upon relapse, patients 
with metastatic disease have a median survival of approximately 24 months and a 5-
year life expectancy of 18 −23% in the U.S. and Europe ( Sant et al. 2003; 
Howlader et al. 2011 ).  Thus, there is a substantial need to improve treatment outcomes 
for patients with early breast cancer to delay/prevent future relapse. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_906767] been shown to correlate with differences at the gene expression level ( van’t Veer et al. 2002 ).  Molecular profiling of 
breast cancers using cDNA array technology showed that breast cancer can be further sub-classified into Luminal A and B subgroups (with high expression of estrogen 
receptor/progesterone receptor [ER/PgR]), basal -like, HER2 -enriched, and normal -like.  
The basal-like subtype was so named because the expression pattern of this subtype mimics that of basal epi[INVESTIGATOR_671098]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].  The molecular driv ers underlying the pathogenesis of the basal-like 
subtype are not well-understood. 
Approximately 80% of basal-like breast cancers lack immuno-staining for hormone 
receptors and HER2 and are thus often referred to as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) ; approximately 15% of breast cancers are classified as TNBC.  TNBCs are more 
likely to exhibit an aggressive phenotype, including high genomic instability, rapid 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
28/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906768] cancer subtypes; patients  generally experience 
rapid clinical progression and poor survival.  Additional clinically active agents are needed for early TNBC. 
1.1.2 PI3K/Akt Signaling in  Triple-Negative Cancer  
Akt is the central node of the PI3K-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling axis and represents a major downstream  effector of receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs).  Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway results in essential cellular functions including cell survival, growth, and proliferation, which are properties that underlie human cancers.  The PI3K/Akt pathway can be activated through loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) ( Li et al. 1997 ), through activating 
mutations and/or amplifications in PIK3CA ( Bachman et al. 2004 ), or through loss of the 
phosphatase inositol po lyphosphate 4-phosphata
se, type II (INPP4B) ( Fedele et al.2010 ); 
all these events are frequently observed in TNBC. 
As demonstrated by [CONTACT_671131] ( Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012 ), among the 
breast cancer subtypes, basal-like-/t
riple-negative breast canc er was associated with 
the 
highest activity of PI3K/Akt pathway signaling as demonstrated by [CONTACT_671132]/mutation analysis, reverse-phase phosphoproteomic analysis (RPPA) and by [CONTACT_671133].  Genetically, mutations in the PIK3CA gene are found in approximately 9% of basal-like breast cancers; in addition, PTEN and INPP4B gene losses occur in approximately one-third of samples as evaluated by [CONTACT_671134].  Furthermore, deficient expression of tumor suppressors PTEN and INPP4B was found in >
 one-third of the basal-like breast cancers.  These alterations were 
associated with a higher degree of Akt pathway activation (as determined by [CONTACT_671135]6 levels RPPA) in the basal subtype relative to other breast cancer subtypes.  Inactivation of PTEN using tissue-specific gene knockout experiments drives the development of basal-like breast cancer in animal models (Dourdin et al. 2008 ; 
Saal et al. 2008 ).   
 
 
).  Given that 
the Akt pathway in TNBC is frequen
tly activated (by [CONTACT_329192]-dependent and -independent 
mechanisms), inhibition of Akt represents a compelling and rational potential treatment strategy. 
1.1.3 Akt Activation and Chemoresistance  
Activation of Akt signaling (whether intrinsic or induced following chemotherapy) leads to chemoresistance across several cancer models, including breast cancer.  One reported 

 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
29/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 mechanism of Akt-mediated chemoresistance, in response to genotoxic stress, is that 
DNA-dependent protein kinase and Akt can cross-regulate DNA repair via 
non-homologous end-joining ( Toulany et al. 2008 ).  Additionally, Akt activation can lead 
to abrogatio n of the G 1-S checkpoint (via MDM2 phosphorylation) and the G 2-M 
checkpoint (in part via Chk1 activation) (Xu et al. 2012 ).  Taxanes and other 
chemotherapeutic agent s can indu
ce up−regulation of Akt in cancer cell lines via multiple 
proposed mechanisms, resulting in chemo-resistance ( Winograd-Katz and Levitzki 2006).  
Thus, up−regulation of Ak t signaling 
represents a potentially important survival pathway 
in response to genotoxic stress, and activa tion of Akt signaling following chemotherapy 
(including taxanes) may promote cell survival ( Isakoff et al. 2005 ). 
Several studies have shown that inhibition of the  PI3K/Akt pathway in diverse cancer
s 
leads to radiosensitization and/or chemosensitization ( Brognard et al. 2001 , 
Wallin et al. 2010 ).  In contrast, overexpression/ac tivation of Akt across several tumor 
models leads to chemoresistance ( Clark et al. 2002 ; Liu et al. 2007 ), including to 
paclitaxel ( Isakoff et al. 2 005).  Given that up −regulation of Akt signaling  may lead to 
chemoresistance, targeting TNBC with an Akt inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy may increase treatment efficacy. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_906769] adjuvant treatment (Mauriac et al. 1991 ; Scholl et al. 1994 ; Semiglazov et al. 1994 ; 
Powles et al. 1995; Fisher et al. 1997 ; Wolff et al. 2000 ).  Neoadjuvant therapy results in 
similar rates of disease-fr ee survival (DFS ) or overall survival (OS) comp
ared with 
adjuvant therapy.  A meta-analysis of nine randomized studies comparing adjuvant with 
neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer showed no difference in rates of death, disease progression or disease recurrence based upon the timing of the systemic therapy ( Mauri et al. 2005 ).  Rather, the major role of neoadjuv ant treatme
 nt historically 
has been to reduce the size of unresectable tumors, allowing surgery to be performed; for example for operable tumors, neoadjuvant treatment allows for greater conservation of the breast and a decreased need for mastectomy ( Hortobagyi et al. 1988; 
Fisher et al. 1997 ; Mieog et al. 2007).  Because n eoadjuvant therapy has comparable 
efficacy and
 safety to adjuvant therapy, the concept of neoadjuvant therapy is now 
well-established option for patients with EBC. 
Across multiple neoadjuvant trials, patients who achieve a pathological complete 
response (pCR; and especially pCR defined as no residual disease present in both the breast and axilla) have an improved prognosis compared with those who have residual invasive disease present in the surgical specimen after completion of preoperative therapy (non-pCR).  For example, in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP studies B-18 and B-27, HRs for DFS for patients who achieved a pCR relative to those who did not were 0.47 and 0.49, respectively in the two trials; the HRs 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
30/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 for OS were 0.32 and 0.36, respectively (Rastogi et al. 2008).  In addition, the 
Collaborative Trials in Neoadjuvant Breas
t Cancer (CTNeoBC) meta-analysis was 
conducted in 2012, evaluating over 12,000 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as part of clinical trials (Cortazar et al. 2012 ).  The results confirm an 
associat ion 
between pCR and both event-free survival (EFS: hazard ratio [HR] 0.48, 
95% CI 0.43–0.54) and OS (HR 0.36, 0.31–0.42).  The association between pathological complete response and long-term outcomes was especially strong in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (EFS:  HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.18–0.33; OS: HR 0.16, 0.11–0.25).  In addition to benefit in TNBC patients noted above in the Cortazar et al. ( 2012 ) meta-
analysis, Liedtke et al. ( 2008 ) found that pCR rates were higher with neoadjuvant 
treatment in patients with  TNBC compared with those with n
on-TNBC (22% versus 11%; 
p = 0.034).  The prognosis for patients who experience a pCR is excellent, with less than 
10% developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a distant recurrence at [ADDRESS_906770] a much poorer prognosis.  Interestingly, evaluation of residual tissue from TNBC patients who do not achieve a pCR demonstrated mutations affecting the PI3K–Akt pathway were enriched in post–neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumors compared with pretreatment tumors, suggesting Akt pathway contributes to chemoresistance ( Blako et al. 2014). 
1.2 BACKGROUND ON IPATASERTIB 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) is a novel, selective, ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of all three isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase Akt and is potent in nonclinical models, including tumors with loss of PTEN (PTEN-low, PTEN-null, or PTEN-mutated) or mutations of PIK3CA both in vitro and in vivo.  Ipatasertib inhibits the kinase activity of Akt and suppresses the phosphorylation of its direct substrates, including PRAS40, and additional downstream targets, such as S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), resulting in G
[ADDRESS_906771] and/or apoptosis in human cancer cells ( Lin et al. 2012 ). 
See the Ipatasertib Investigator's Brochure for additional det ails on non
clinical and 
clinical studies. 
1.2.1 Summary of Ipataser tib Nonclinical Studies  
Daily and intermittent dosing of ipatasertib has demonstrated tumor growth inhibition in nonclinical models of multiple tumors.  In vitro studies showed that high levels of pAkt, often through inactivation of PTEN, predicted response to ipatasertib.

32/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 [IP_ADDRESS] Study PAM4743g ⎯Phase I Study of Single-Agent Ipatasertib 
Ipatasertib is currently tested in a Phase I open-label dose-escalation study (PAM4743g), 
in patients with refractory solid tumors, using a 3 + 3 design to assess the safety, 
tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of ipataserti b administered orally once daily (QD) for 
[ADDRESS_906772] six cohorts (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 mg daily); 800 mg daily resulted in dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; fatigue and gastrointestinal intolerance).  A patient in the expansion arm continues to receive treatment at an ipatasertib dose of [ADDRESS_906773] six cohorts receiving 25 to 600 mg of ipatasertib experienced a DLT.  The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ipatasertib was determined to be 600 mg orally QD on a 21-day-on and 7-day-off (21/7) schedule. 
Study PAM4743g:  Preliminary Safety Data  
As of 31 March 2014, enrollment in Study PAM4743g was completed, with 52 patients enrolled and 51 patients treated with ipatasertib (GDC-0068), including [ADDRESS_906774] frequently reported adverse events in ≥
 10% of patients that were assessed by [CONTACT_671136] (70.6%), diarrhea (68.6%), vomiting (51%), asthenia (37.3%), hyperglycemia (33.3%), decreased appetite (23.5%), dyspepsia (19.6%), dysgeusia (11.8%), rash (11.8%), and upper abdominal pain (11.8%).  In the 800-mg cohort, 2 patients experienced a DLT of Grade 3 asthenia.  No DLTs were reported in the 600-mg cohort; thus, 600 mg was determined to be the MTD on this schedule.  Grade ≥
 3 adverse events in ≥  5% of patients that were assessed 
as related to ipatasertib were diarrhea (n  = 4, 7.8%), and asthenia (n  = 3, 5.9%).  There 
were no ipatasertib −related Grade 4 or Grade 5 adverse events. 
Study PAM4743g:  Preliminary Pharmacokinetic Data  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data are available from 30 patients treated with ipatasertib during the dose-escalation stage from dose cohorts 1 to 7 (25 to 800 mg) on a 21/7 schedule, with PK data available from the single dose on Day 1 and following multiple doses (on Day 8 of continuous dosing).  The preliminary PK profile of ipatasertib shows that ipatasertib is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_671099] (t
max) ranging from 
0.5 to 3 hours across all doses.  The mean terminal half-life ranged from 21.7 to 31.4 hours at doses above 100 mg.  Mean maximum concentration (C
max) and 
total exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) were dose-proportional in the range from 25 to 800 mg.  Preliminary data also show that the pharmacokinetics of ipatasertib are comparable between the fed and fasted states.  The transient increase in glucose and insulin are also comparable between the fed and fasted states of dosing following ipatasertib administration (for additional information, see the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure).  
Study PAM4743g:  Preliminary Pharmacodynamic Data  
The pharmacodynamics of ipatasertib were assessed in Study PAM4743g on the basis 
of changes in the Akt pathway, including phosphorylated [COMPANY_004]3 β (p[COMPANY_004]3β) in 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
33/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and phosphorylated PRAS40 (pPRAS40) in predose and 
postdose tumor biopsies.  [COMPANY_004]3 β and PRAS40 are substrates of Akt ( Yan et al. 2013 ).  
In PRP expe riments, the p[COMPANY_004]3 β level decreased by [CONTACT_589715] 60% at doses ≥ 200 mg 
and by [CONTACT_726] 80% at the [ADDRESS_906775] proteins, including more than 60% decrease in pPRAS40 (compared with baseline) in all three patients treated at 400 mg (see the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for additional information). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study PAM4983g ⎯Phase Ib Study of Ipatasertib and 
Chemotherapy 
Study PAM4983g is a Phase Ib, dose-escalation study, in patients with advanced solid tumors, to determine the MTD and recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of ipatasertib administered QD orally in combination with docetaxel on a 14-day-on and 7-day-off (14/7) 
dosing schedule (Arm A), with mFOLFOX6 (Arm B; see the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure for details), and with paclitaxel (90 mg/m
2 administered weekly [3 week on and 
1 week off]) with ipatasertib on a 21/7 dosing schedule (Arm C).   
Study PAM4983g:  Preliminary Safety Data for Ipatasertib  + Taxanes in 
Arm A (Ipatasertib  + Docetaxel) and Arm C (Ipatasertib  + Paclitaxel) 
As of 31 March 2014, enrollment in Study PAM4983g was completed for Arm A, with 27 patients enrolled in Arm A (ipatasertib combined with docetaxel), and enrollment was completed for Arm C, with 27 patients enrolled (ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel).   
Ipatasertib in combination with docetaxel was well tolerated in the 27 patients in all 
dosing cohorts (100, 200, 400, and 600 mg); no patients receiving 100 to 600 mg of ipatasertib experienced a DLT.  The adverse events reported in ≥
 10% of patients that 
were assessed by [CONTACT_671137] (GDC-0068) in combination with docetaxel were nausea (74.1%), diarrhea (70.4%), vomiting (66.7%), decreased appetite (25.9%), asthenia (22.2%), fatigue (18.5%), dyspepsia (14.8%), hyperglycemia (14.8%), rash (14.8%), hypomagnesemia (11.1%), and mucosal Inflammation (11.1%).  These adverse events were predominantly Grade 1 or 2.  There were no ipatasertib-related Grade 4 or Grade 5 adverse events with the ipatasertib
 + docetaxel 
combination.   
As of 31 March 2014, preliminary safety data from Study PAM4983g were available for 
27 treated patients in Arm C (ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 
administered weekly [3 week on and 1 week off]), including 21 patients treated at a 400 mg of ipatasertib and 6 patients treated at 600 mg of ipatasertib.  No patients receiving ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel experienced a DLT.  The adverse events reported in ≥
 10% of patients that were assessed by [CONTACT_671138] (77.8%), nausea (55.6%), vomiting (37%), fatigue (33.3%), decreased appetite (14.8%), rash maculo-papular 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
34/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 (14.8%), abdominal pain (11.1%), dehydration (11.1%), hyperglycemia (11.1%), and 
rash (11.1%).  These adverse events were predominantly Grade 1 or 2.  Grade 3 adverse events related to ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel occurred mostly at 600 mg (in 5 of 6 patients or 83%), versus 400 mg of ipatasertib (in 3 of 21 patients or 14%), including diarrhea (n
 = 6), hyperglycemia (n  = 3), dehydration (n  = 2), anemia (n  = 1), 
neutropenia (n  = 1), and rash (n  = 1).  There were no Grade 4 or Grade 5 adverse events 
related to ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel as assessed by [CONTACT_473].  Three patients in the 600 mg ipatasertib + paclitaxel cohort were dose reduced for ipatasertib-related recurrent adverse events, including Grade 3 dehydration (n
 = 1), 
Grade 3 diarrhea (n  = 1), and Grade 2 diarrhea (n  = 1), while 1 patient in the 400 mg 
ipatasertib  + paclitaxel cohort was dose reduced for ipatasertib-related Grade [ADDRESS_906776] cancer patients enrolled in 
Arm C (400 mg ipatasertib +paclitaxel) of Study PAM4983g.  All 10 patients completed Cycle 1 with no DLT, and the majority of the adverse events were Grade 1 and 2.  The preliminary safety profile for this expansion cohort is consistent with that described above.  
Based on the overall safety data from Arm C, the RP2D of ipatasertib is 400 mg daily on 
a 21/7 dosing schedule in combination with  paclitaxel administered every 7 days. 
Study PAM4983g:  Preliminary Pharmacokinetic Data 
As of 31 March 2014, preliminary PK data from Study PAM4983g were available for 
patients treated with ipatasertib combined with docetaxel (Arm A) or paclitaxel (Arm C).  Ipatasertib exposures in both the docetaxel-treated and paclitaxel-treated arms were comparable to the Phase I single-agent data from Study PAM4743g.   
 
 
and the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure). 
Study PAM4983g:  Prelimin ary Clinical Activity 
As of 31 March 2014, 12 patients in Study PAM4983g had a radiographic response by [CONTACT_16622], Version 1.1 (RECIST, v1.1) criteria on computed tomography (CT) scans:  3 patients (11.1%) in Arm A (ipatasertib in combination with docetaxel), 3 patients (8.8%) in Arm B (ipatasertib in combination with mFOLFOX6), and 6 patients (22.2%) in Arm C (ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel).  All 3 patients in Arm A had pr eviously received taxane (docetaxel or 
paclitaxel) chemotherapy, all 3 patients in Arm B had previously received FOLFOX or 
platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy, and 4 of 6 patients in Arm C had previously received taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) chemotherapy.  Molecular analysis

35/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906777] 7 of the 12 patients (58%) with 
radiographic responses had tumors with alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, including low expression of PTEN (immunohistochemical H-score ≤

1.[ADDRESS_906778] cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide.  Of these, approximately 200,000 are of the triple-negative (ER–/PR–/HER2–) phenotype.  Improving the results of chemotherapy when the disease is still localized to the breast and regional lymph nodes offers the chance of potentially curing the disease, as well as delaying disease recurrence and death in those who are not cured.  In neoadjuvant setting, pCR correlates with a favorable outcome in TNBC; thus pCR is a useful tool to enable rapid and effective evaluation of much needed new targets and treatments for TNBC.  Evaluation of residual tissue from TNBC patients who do not achieve a pCR demonstrated mutations affecting the PI3K–Akt pathway were enriched in post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy tumors compared with pretreatment tumors, suggesting activation of the Akt pathway contributes to chemoresistance ( Blako et al. 2014 ). 
As demonstrated by [CONTACT_671131] (Cancer Genome Atlas Network 2012 ), TNBC 
often exhibits activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, relative to other breast ca ncer subtypes.  
For example

Clinical safety profile of ipatasertib as a single-agent in the Phase Ia study (PAM4743g) 
and in combination with paclitaxel in the Phase Ib study (PAM4983g) supports development in breast cancer.  As a single-agent, ipatasertib has a predictable PK profile with a half-life of approximately 24 hours, and ipatasertib significantly downregulates the PI3K/Akt pathway at doses ≥
 200 mg.  In the Phase Ib 
study (PAM4983g), ipatasertib 400 mg daily was well-tolerated when combined with paclitaxel, exhibiting primarily Grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea) and did not exacerbate the known adverse events attributable to paclitaxel. 
The study population eligible for this trial is at high risk for relapse ( ≥
 20% over 5 years); 
the addition of effective and tolerable ther apy to conventional neoadjuvant regimen may 
increase pCR rates and thereby [CONTACT_671139]-term outcomes for these patients.  In 
addition, there may be additional benefits such as improved chances of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients who desire this, and reduced rates of 

 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
36/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 re-operation for residual disease following primary surgery.  The addition of ipatasertib to 
taxane-based neoadjuvant regimen is expected to be generally well tolerated.  Significant increases in leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, or cardiac toxicity are not anticipated but will be monitored during the trial.  Given the data to date, the benefit-risk assessment for administration of ipatasertib as part of a neoadjuvant treatment regimen 
within this clinical trial is considered positive. 
Given that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is frequent in TNBC and may lead to 
chemoresistance, and ipatasertib can be safely combined with paclitaxel, this Phase II trial is designed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling will enhance the efficacy of paclitaxel chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with TNBC.  The primary endpoint of this study will estimate the magnitude of benefit via pathologic complete response (pCR) in the breast and axilla of ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel for patients with TNBC, as well as to prospectively evaluate whether patients whose tumors harbor a low/absent PTEN expression (by [CONTACT_4658]) derive greater benefit from this regimen relative to the overall intent-to-treat population.  Other hypothesis generating exploratory analyses will be conducted as appropriate to evaluate molecular signatures that could predict patient response.

Approximately 150 patients will be enrolled at approximately 30 centers.  Patients will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_270175]:  PTEN status (H score 
0, vs. 1 to ≤ 150, vs. >  150), node involvement (pathologically positive versus no known 
involvement), and T size (T1 −2 vs. T3). 
For the purpose of enrollment, ER, PgR, and HER2 will be locally determined prior to beginning of study treatment.  Additionally, all enrolled patients must consent to provide sufficient and evaluable archival tissue for PTEN status determination.  In the absence of archival tissue, fresh tissue biopsy samples, excluding cytology and fine-needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) specimens, will be acceptable; however, evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for PTEN status by a central laboratory should occur prior to the initiation of study treatment.  All patients will undergo pretreatment tumor tissue acquisition (snap-frozen, optimal cutting temperature [OCT], and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] cores).

During Weeks 10 −12 (approximately; i.e., near the time of completion of neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy), the patient will consult with the surgeon to plan the type of breast 
surgery to be performed (breast conservative vs. mastectomy) and to schedule the date for surgery (see Section  3.1.1). 
Following surgical rese ct
ion of primary tumor, patients are expected to continue post-
operative treatment with a standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen such as 5-FU/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC), 5-FU/epi[INVESTIGATOR_14962]/cyclophosphamide (FEC), or doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (AC), if appr opriate and as chosen by [CONTACT_34427].  Post-operative treatment inform ation (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.) will 
be collected at the post-surgery visit. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, pCR within the breast and axilla (ypT0/Tis ypN0) in all 
patients and in patients with PTEN-low tumors will be assessed by [CONTACT_671147]. 
The trial is anticipated to have a recruitm ent period of approximately 24 months.   
A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1 . 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
41/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 3.1.1 Surgery  
The patient should be evaluated at baseline and during approximately Weeks 10 −12 of 
treatment to plan the surgical procedure (BCS or mastectomy); both the physician 
recommendation and final patient decision should be documented in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Surgery will take place no more than [ADDRESS_906785]-surgery visit will be performed within approximately 4 weeks after surgery for 
assessment of adverse events and general safety.  In addition, follow-up adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be recorded, once known, in the eCRF. 
3.1.2 Joint Monitoring Committee  
A Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) will be in place during the study and will provide oversight of safety and efficacy.  The primary responsibility of the JMC is to review the available safety data and to make a reco mmendation to continue, modify the study 
design as required for improved safety, or terminate the study.  While a JMC review is 
being conducted, patient accrual into the study will continue.  The JMC will be 
composed of a designated sponsor medical oncologist (who is not the study medical 
monitor), the drug safety officer, and the study biostatistician.  In addition, the  JMC will 
also include at least two external medical oncologists who are not employees of 
[COMPANY_002]/Genentech and are not affiliated with the study team, to provide clinical and methodological expertise in early breast cancer.  The members of the JMC will not interact with the sites or investigators in terms of study conduct.   
The reviews the JMC will conduct are described in Section 6.8.[ADDRESS_906786] visit (LPLV) occurs 
or the date at which the last data point required for statistical analysis or safety follow up is received from the last patient, whichever occurs later.  LPLV is expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_906787] patient is enrolled. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
42/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906788] been shown 
to be equivalent to those of adjuvant therapy ( Mauri et al. 2005 ), and the former offers 
clear advantages to patients, particu larly for patients with lar
ger tumors; patients with 
smaller breast tumors (1 −2 cm) also have been shown to benefit.  Tumor shrinkage prior 
to surgery may allow breast conservation surgery ( Coudert et al. 2006), and since the  
response to 
therapy can be monitored, the patient might be also spared further 
treatment with inactive medications.  Upon completion of neoadjuvant treatment and 
surgery, patients are expected to continue to receive further adjuvant therapy (e.g., radiation and additional chemotherapy), if appropriate, following discussion with the treating physician. 
The neoadjuvant setting provides a unique opportunity to identify predictive biomarkers 
of response to novel therapeutic agents.  Pretreatment biopsies are easily accessible, usually from the diagnostic specimens.  On-treatment biopsies may also be pre-specified in order to monitor pharmacodynamic markers of treatment response at a biological level.  Finally, the surgical specimen, if pCR is not reached, can be utilized as well to understand mechanisms of resistance.  The biological information obtained from all these biological specimens can be correlated with clinical data, such as pCR, a surrogate endpoint that demonstrates strong association with disease-free and overall patient survival in some subtypes of breast cancer ( Cortazar et al. 2012 ; 
von Minckwitz and Fontanella 2013 ). 
Of note, at the completion of study treatment in this study, patients are e x
pected to 
continue post-operative treatment with a standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy 
regimen such as FAC, FEC, or AC.  The s pecific regimen will be chosen by [CONTACT_671148], and should be recorded in the eCRF. 
3.3.2 Rationale for Starting Dose and Schedule of Ipatasertib  
For ipatasertib, the starting dose of 400 mg QD and the starting schedule of 21 days on and 7 days off (21/7) were selected on the basis of safety data from Arm C of Study PAM4983g, the Phase Ib trial of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  In Arm C of St udy PAM49
 83g, ipatasertib was generally well 
tolerated when administered at a dose of 400 mg QD on a 21/7 dosing schedule, in combination with paclitaxel 90 mg/m
2 administered weekly (3 week on and 1 week off).  
A relative bioavailability study (Study GP29066) has been conducted in healthy volunteers and showed that 400-mg tablet dose of ipatasertib to be used in this study will provide exposures similar to the Phase II 400-mg dose of ipatasertib in the capsule formulation used in Study PAM4983g. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
43/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906789] treatment exists  specifically for neoadjuvant TNBC; rather, 
widely divergent chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_44850] (and radiation therapy) remain the 
cornerstone of treatment.  The role of paclitaxel in the treatment of breast cancer has been well established in both the adjuvant and metastatic settings.  Multiple trials demonstrated an increase in DFS in breast cancer patients who received paclitaxel-based therapy in the adjuvant setting ( Hayes et al. 2007 ; Mackey et al 2013 ).  
In addition, taxanes are among the most active chemotherapy agents for the treatment of MBC in te rms of response rates or 
survival, based on a meta-analysis of three 
randomized trials comparing a taxane with an anthracycline ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_94899]-Gebhart et al. 2008 ).  
The pCR re sponse rate 
of single agent paclitaxel is approximately 15 −25% for TNBC 
patients treated in the neoadjuvant setting ( Llombart et al. 2012 ); this pCR rate with 
paclitaxel is comparable to pCR in large single institution stud
ies across diverse 
regimens (Ju et al. 2012 ).  Two Phase III studies  showed th at addition of bevacizumab 
results in a modest increase in pCR, particularly in patients with TNBC; however the addition of bevacizumab did not alter rate of BCS and was associated with increased Grades [ADDRESS_906790] neoadjuvant regimen has recently been tested in GeparSixto and Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) [ZIP_CODE] trials ( Sikov et al. 2013 ; 
von Minckwitz et al. 2014 ).  These trials also sho w
 ed that although the addition of 
platinum resulted in improvement in pCR, there were substantial hematologic and other 
toxicities, leading to dose reductions and early treatment discontinuations.  It is unknown at this time whether the modest improvement in pCR observed in these trials (10 −15%) 
will result in improved DFS or OS.  Paclitaxel results in reasonable pCR rate with manageable adverse event profile, allowing completion of the neoadjuvant treatment course and is thus a widely used and appropriate therapy for patients treated in this setting. 
Dose and regimen for paclitaxel in neoadjuvant and metastatic setting has been tested 
in several clinical trials.  In the neoadjuvant setting, weekly paclitaxel was also shown to 
improve the likelihood of pathologic complete remission in the breast and axillary lymph nodes (28.2% vs. 15.7%; p
 = 0.02), as well as the opportunity for BCS (p  = 0.02), when 
compared with paclitaxel administered ev ery 3 weeks in the neo-adjuvant setting 
(Green et al. 2005 ).  In the metastatic setting, re sults of the  CALGB 9840 showed that 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered weekly had superior efficacy to and was better 
tolerated than paclitaxel 175 mg /m2 administered every 3 weeks in patients with MBC 
(Seidman et al. 2004 ).  This Phase I I study (GO29505) will use a similar regimen of 
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered weekly that was tested in the above referenced trials, 
as well as that used in the SOLTI NeoPARP trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
Upon completion of study treatment in this study, patients are expected to continue 
post-operative treatment with a standard anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
44/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 such as FAC, FEC, or AC.  The specific regimen will be chosen by [CONTACT_671149], and should be recorded on the eCRF. 
3.3.4 Rationale for Objective Response Assessed by [CONTACT_671150]-Deri ved Metrics for Exploratory 
Purposes  
ORR is based on criteria related to changes in tumor size (e.g., RECIST) and is 
generally defined as the sum of partial and complete responses.  ORR is a robust indicator of antitumor activity in new anticancer agents and is considered to be an established surrogate marker for clinical benefit.  It has been used as a primary endpoint in multiple neoadjuvant trials ( Smith et al. 2005 ; Ellis and Ma 2007 ; Baselga et al. 2009 ).  
Guidelines for RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_906791] and mammography 
(Eisenhauer et al. 2009 ).  In addition, MRI has been shown to be more accurate than 
clinical palp ation, ultrasound, and mammograph
y for measuring residual tumor size after 
neoadjuvant therapy in several prospective trials (Balu-Maestro et al. 2002; 
Yeh et al. 2005; Akazawa et al. 2006 ), including the I-SPY trial ( Hylton et al. 2012).  
Results from the I-SPY trial also sh
owed that tumor volume measurements based on the 
percent of tumor with enhancing signal after MR contrast agent administration may be a more sensitive measure of response during neoadjuvant treatment than longest dimension measures.  Enhancing tumor volu me, along with other MRI-derived metrics 
acquired within the same MRI exam such as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; a measure of tumor cellular composition derived from diffusion-weighted imaging), 
(Partridge et al. 2013 ), may serve as additional prognostic and/or predictive biomarke rs 
of neoadjuvant therapy.  
3.3.[ADDRESS_906792] activation in tumors, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_671151], INPP4B loss, PIK3CA mutations, etc., may be an important predictive diagnostic for efficacy of ipatasertib.  PTEN loss is an important cause of constitutively active Akt, and represents a potentially important predictive biomarker.  Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling frequently occurs in TNBCs; approximately 60% of TNBC samples exhibit low expression of PTEN.  In this Phase II study, PTEN status will be performed prospectively from archival tissue (or fresh biopsy if archival is not available), and t he results will be used to stratify patients in 
this study.   
 
 
 Activation of the Akt results in 
increased levels of phosphorylated down-stream effector proteins, including pPRAS40, 

 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
45/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 pS6, p[COMPANY_004]3b; these proteins can be evaluated by [CONTACT_69162]/or reverse phase protein 
array from archival and/or fresh biopsy samples.  Collectively, these data could elucidate if the detection of alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, including low PTEN expression, loss of INPP4B activity, activating mutation in PIK3CA, and/or AKT3 overexpression, can be used to identify patients who may especially benefit from the combination of ipatasertib with paclitaxel. 
Taken together, these considerations support the collection of tissue from patients to 
evaluate the activity of ipatasertib combined with paclitaxel in patients with early TNBC 
in order to assess the clinical impact of these biomarkers. 
3.3.6 Rationale for Collection of  Fresh Tumor Biopsies Following 
Progression for Exploratory Purposes  
Exploratory assessments of biologic markers will be performed.  If tumor biopsies can be obtained with minimal risk and discomfort to patients who progressed during therapy, tissue may be collected at the end of the study (e.g., following disease progression prior to start of next therapy) from patients who consent to this procedure.  Tissue samples will be assessed for alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway, as this may help predict which patients may benefit from ipatasertib and may also help identify potential causes of acquired resistance to ipatasertib.  Tumor biopsies may be used to explore PI3K/Akt pathway marker levels, gene copy number changes, and mutations to evaluate potential mechanisms of resistance to the combination of ipatasertib and paclitaxel. 
3.3.7 Rationale for Collection of Blood Samples for Noninvasive 
Disease Monitoring  
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be detected in the blood of cancer patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_671101] (Schwarzenbach et al. 2011 ).  For example, the mutational status of tumor cells may be 
obtained thr ough the iso
lation of ctDNA ( Maheswaran et al. 2008 ), and ctDNA has been 
used to monitor treatment effectiveness in melanoma, as well as in bre
ast cancer 
(Shinozaki et al. 2007 ).  An assay has been developed to ide ntify major mutations in  the 
PIK3CA gene through analysis of ctDNA in plasma.  In this study, blood samples will be collected at screening and during the study to evaluate oncogenic mutations at baseline and to assess for possible emergence of new mutations after treatment with ipatasertib and paclitaxel.  Mutations will be evaluated in relevant genes in the PI3K/Akt pathway, including but not limited to PIK3CA.  It is estimated that up to 10% of TNBCs may harbor PIK3CA mutations ( Zang et al. 2012 ).  Identifying potential discordances in the PIK3CA 
status from baseline to 
post-surgery/end-of-study through exploratory analysis of 
archival tumor samples and ctDNA may help clarify the prognostic and predictive significance of PIK3CA mutations in patients with TNBC treated with ipatasertib and paclitaxel.

46/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 3.3.8 Rationale for the Pharmacokinetic Evaluation Schedule  
A sparse sampling strategy will be applied in this study (see Appendix 2  for schedule).  
The sampling schedule is designed t

• Comparison of the rates of BCS and conversion to BCS in patients with T2 or T3 
tumors 
 
3.4.2 Safety Outcome Measures  
The safety and tolerability of ipatasertib w hen combined with paclitaxel will be assessed 
using the following outcome measures: 
• Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events, graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE, v4.0 
• Clinically significant changes in vital si gns, physical findings, and clinical laboratory 
results during and following ipatasertib administration 
 
3.4.3 Pharmacokinetic Outcome Measures  
For ipatasertib, the following PK parameters will be analyzed using a PopPK approach 
as data allow: 
• Exposure following first dose (AUC 0-24) and steady-state (AUC ss) 
• Minimum observed plasma concentration (C min; trough concentration) 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc.

3.4.4 Exploratory Outcome Measures  
The exploratory outcome measures for this study are as follows: 
• Alterations in DNA and RNA, including but not limited to mutational status, 
RNA expression levels, DNA copy number, protein expression and modifications 
• Evaluation of changes in enhancing tumor volume from baseline to surgery as 
measured by [CONTACT_235292] 
• Evaluation of changes in tumor cellular composition as assessed by

4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT AND BLINDING 
After written informed consent has been obtained, the study site will obtain the patient’s 
screening number from the Interactive Web Re sponse System (IWRS).  Once eligibility 
has been established, the patient will be enrolled, and the study site will obtain the patient’s identification number from the IWRS. 
The patient will be randomized, and the site will obtain the blinded study drug kit number 
from the IWRS.

This comparison (Arm 1 vs. Arm 2) will be performed in all patients (independent of results from the diagnostic assessments of the tumor) and in specific subsets of patients with PTEN-low tumors (see Section 6.4) to 
estimate the clinical effect of PTEN status and t o provide information for the design

4.2.3 Minimization of Bias  
Patients will be allocated to each of the treatment arms (Arm 1 or Arm 2) through the use of a stratified permuted block randomization to ensure within-stratum balance of patient characteristics between treatment arms.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_270175]: PTEN status (H score 0, vs. 1 to ≤
 150, vs. >  150), Node involvement 
(pathologically positive versus no known involvement), and T size (T1-2 vs. T3).  These three stratification factors were chosen because of their known or suspected prognostic value and/or potential to affect efficacy of paclitaxel with/without ipatasertib.  Prospective stratification by [CONTACT_671154] a result of sources other than ipatasertib. 
Placebo tablets will be identical in shape and in color to the ipatasertib tablets and will be 
undistinguishable (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details).  Tablet bottles and dr ug kits for 
placebo will 
also be identical to those for ipatasertib, except for the unique kit numbers 
on the kit boxes.  
To minimize bias from potential unblinding, an IWRS provider will conduct randomization 
and hold treatment assignment codes.   
Because of the size of the study, use of IWRS, randomization, blinding, and expected 
lack of substantial emergency unblinding, collected data will be protected from any biases that would arise from subjectivity in the reporting of the outcome measures.  To further protect the integrity of the study, the results of interim safety and efficacy analyses will not be made known to the investigators, and the PTEN loss status or other AKT pathway alterations within the tumor samples will not be disclosed to the investigators. 
The addition of ipatasertib to paclitaxel is not expected to affect planned laboratory tests 
or adverse reactions to a degree that would significantly unblind patients or investigators.

[IP_ADDRESS] Ipatasertib (GDC-0068) and Placebo 
Study treatment to either ipatasertib or placebo will be assigned by [CONTACT_10966].  Ipatasertib or 
placebo will be administered orally QD, beginning on Cycle 1, Day 1 through Day 21 of each 28-day cycle for a total of 3 cycles of treatment.  Patients in the experimental arm 
will receive ipatasertib at a dose of 400 mg QD, and those in the control arm will receive placebo on the same days.  Ipatasertib or placebo will be administered prior to the IV infusion of paclitaxel.  Each dose of ipatasertib or placebo should be taken with a minimum of 3 ounces (90 mL) of fluid.  Ipatasertib or placebo may be taken with or without food.  If a dose is missed (not taken within 8 hours after the scheduled dosing time), the patient should resume dosing with the next scheduled dose.  Missed or vomited doses will not be made up. 
The dose of ipatasertib or placebo will be taken at home, as directed on all days when 
there are no scheduled clinic visits.  Ipatasertib or placebo should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  On st udy visit days or visit days that require a 
blood draw for PK sampling, patients should not take their dose of ipatasertib or placebo at home before reporting to the clinic.  Patients will be instructed to take their oral dose of ipatasertib or placebo at the clinic after completion of the pretreatment assessments outlined in Appendix [ADDRESS_906804] for 
up to one treatment cycle (i.e., approximately 28  days).  In some cases, extra tablets 
may be dispensed if there is a possibility that the patient’s next visit may be delayed (e.g., due to holiday, inclement weather, or distan ce of patient’s home from study center).  
Patients will also be given instructions for self-administration on dosing days that do not coincide with clinic visits. 
Patients will be asked to record the time and date they take each dose in a medication 
diary.  Patients will be instructed to bring their bottles of ipatasertib or placebo (including all unused tablets) and their medication diaries to each study visit for assessment of compliance and medication disposal. 
The investigator (or designated representative) is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_671102], including the amount dispensed to each patient and the amount returned by [CONTACT_6904].  Study drug accountability (verification of the total number of tablets administered) for each patient should be performed as indicated in Appendix [ADDRESS_906805] ad

15, and 22 of each 4-week cycle, for a total of 3 cycles of treatment (12 total doses) .  
Calculation of body surface area for the purposes of dosing of paclitaxel should be made according to the prescribing information.  If the patient’s weight changes by >
 10% during 
the study, the body surface area and drug doses should be recalculated, per institutional guidelines.   
On the planned day of treatment, chemotherapy may be administered if:  
• ANC ≥
 1500/μL (or per institutional guideline) 
• Platelet count ≥ 100,000/μL (or per institutional guideline) 
• Grade ≤ 2 clinically significant chemotherapy -related gastrointestinal toxicity 
 
Because of the known potential for allergic reactions to paclitaxel and/or the 
Cremophor® vehicle, precautions must be taken to decrease the risk of anaphylaxis.  
Patients must be premedicated prior to paclit axel per institutional practice with 
dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and one of the following two H 2-receptor blockers:  
ranitidine or famotidine.  Other H 2-receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, which are 
known to inhibit cytochrome P450, are excluded.  An H 1-receptor antagonist, such as 
diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_906807] 60 minutes for each dose per 
institutional guidelines and administered after the oral dose of ipatasertib or placebo. 
Patients should be monitored during paclitaxel administration per institutional policies.  
Patients may receive anti-emetic and other pr ophylactic treatments (e.g., IV infusions 
of calcium and magnesium to try and decrease any potential peripheral neuropathy) according to institutional and/or local standards and per manufacturer’s instructions. 
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are 
provided in Section 5.1.5.  
Any dose modification, overdose, or incorrect ad
ministration of paclitaxel should be

4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
Please see Appendix 1  for the schedule of assessments performed during the study. 
All patients 
will be closely monitored for safety throughout the study and during the 
adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1).  Study assessments will be 
performed at screening, during treat
ment, and at the treatment completion visits.  
Screening assessments will be performed with in [ADDRESS_906813]-surgery assessment should be performed 
within 4 weeks of the patient’s surgery.   
4.5.1 Descriptions of Study Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log 
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study-specific screening tests or  evaluations.  ICFs for enrolled patients 
and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History and Demographic Data 
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer treatments, cancer procedures, and history of weight loss), disease characteristics (histologic subty pe, stage of disease, and immunostaining or 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
58/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 in-situ hybridization results), and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, 
over-the-counter drugs, herbal/homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) 
used by [CONTACT_25701] 28 days prior to the ICF signature. 
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination should include the evaluation of head, eye, ear, nose, 
and throat; cardiovascular; dermatological; musculoskeletal; respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]; gastrointestinal; 
and neurological systems, clinical br east examination and regional lymph node 
examination, as well as measurement of weight and height (height at screening only).  
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Vital Signs eCRF. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), targeted physical examination (including 
clinical breast examination and regional lymph node examinati on) should be performed 
to assess and record changes from baseline abnormalities and any treatment-emergent signs or symptoms.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  See Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for the clinical brea st 
examination
 requirements. 
As part of tumor assessment, physical exami nations should also include evaluation of 
the presence and degree of enlarged lymph nodes, as well as a breast examination. 
ECOG performance status and weight will be recorded at baseline and throughout the 
study, as scheduled.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include measurements of heart ra te; systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
while the patient is in a seated position after resting for at least 5 minutes; respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]; and oral, axillary, or tympanic temperature. 
On paclitaxel dosing days, vital signs will be recorded prior to dosing and at the end of 
the infusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Distant Sites Tumor Assessment 
Baseline distant sites tumor staging procedures should be performed at the discretion of the treating investigator.  As a reference, per National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, metastatic evaluation can be informed from clinical stage as follows:  
• For Stage II and Stage IIIA:  bone scan is to be performed in presence of bone pain 
and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase; abdominal/pelvic CT in case of elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal symptoms or 
abnormal physical examination; c hest CT if pulmonary symptoms.

59/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906814] X-rays/diagnostic CT, liver imaging, 
and/or other radiographic modalities may be co nsidered when clinically indicated to 
exclude metastatic disease. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor and Response Evaluations 
All measurable disease must be documented at screening and re-assessed at subsequent tumor evaluation (see Appendix 3 ).  Response will be assessed by [CONTACT_671157] b
reast MRI.  Whenever 
possible, assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_294861]. 
Mammogram 
Bilateral mammograms must be obtained at baseline within [ADDRESS_906815] be done by 
[CONTACT_5292] (palpation) at baseline and as specified in Appendix [ADDRESS_906816] 
tumor measurement by [CONTACT_4733] (pref
erred) or ruler will be performed and recorded in the 
eCRF. 
Axillary lymph node status (and other regional lymph nodes if clinically indicated) will 
also be assessed as clinically positive or negative at each timepoint.  The main purpose of performing this examination is to rule out progressive disease that would lead to study treatment discontinuation. 
Breast MRI 
Contrast-enhanced breast MRI scans is mandatory for all patients at baseline (within 28 days prior to start of study treatment, Cycle 1 Day 1) and at the presurgical visit.  
Timing and location of any clip or marker placement during study biopsies should be 
recorded for reference when MRI scans are read.  If the screening breast MRI scan is not evaluable for RECIST measurement due to technical limitations of the scan itself, the scan may be repeated.  Other MRI acquisition sequences, such as diffusion-weighted imaging, may be acquired during this study during the MRI scan visits for each patient. 
If at any time there is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_671103], then the 
algorithm provided in Figure [ADDRESS_906817] site practice may be followed for the use of mild sedatives or anti-anxiolyti cs for claustrophobic patients prior to MRI. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
60/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 An independent radiologic review facility will be used for the purpose of collecting and 
assessing the quality of patient imaging scans throughout the trial.  The review facility will retain copi[INVESTIGATOR_671104]-related endpoints. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory, Biomarker,  and Other Biological Samples 
Adequate hematologic and organ function within [ADDRESS_906818] be determined.   Predose laboratory samples should be drawn within approximately 3 days prior to study drug adm inistration on Day 1 of each cycle, and 
results available before dosing.  Postdose laboratory samples should be drawn according to the schedule in Appendix 1 . 
Local Laboratory Samples 
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site's local laboratory for analysis: 
• Hematology:  Complete blood count, including red blood cell (RBC) count, ANC, 
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell (WBC) count with differential 
(neutrophils, bands, eosinophils, basophils , lymphocytes, monocytes, and other 
cells), and platelet count 
• Coagulation:  INR, PT, and aPTT/PTT 
• Fasting (≥
 8-hour fast) serum chemistry:  sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, 
glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, 
magnesium, total bilirubin, total protein, albumin, LDH, ALT, AST, and alkaline 
phosphatase. 
• Fasting (≥  8-hour fast) lipid profile and amylase:  Total cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, amylase, and lipase 
• Fasting insulin  
• Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c) 
• Urinalysis (specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and blood) 
• Pregnancy test:  All women who are not postmenopausal ( ≥ 12 months of 
non-therapy-induced amenorrhea) or surgically sterile will have a serum pregnancy 
test at screening.  Urine or serum pregnancy tests will be performed at specified 
subsequent visits, and as clinically indicated.  If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it 
must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. 
 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
61/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 Central Laboratory Samples 
Instruction manuals outlining sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment 
instructions and supply kits will be provided for all central laboratory assessments.  Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to one or several central laboratories for analysis: 
• Mandatory tumor tissue:  All biopsies collected for study purposes, whether it is 
required or optional, should be from safely accessible tissue and be minimally 
invasive 
• Specimens will be used for assessment of several biomarkers.  It is likely that not all 
assays will be performed on samples provided by [CONTACT_6904] (possibly because of 
insufficient tumor material or inadequate sample quality).  Therefore, assays will be 
performed with the following priority to ensure a high likelihood of generating data to support the objectives of the study, including but not limited to hematoxylin and 
eosin (H&E) stains, PTEN status by [CONTACT_4658], INPP4B status by [CONTACT_4658], RNA isolation for 
gene expression analysis, PIK3CA alteration analysis, AKT3 analysis, Ki67 staining, DNA isolation for additional mutation detection and copy number analyses, and 
RPPAs.  In addition, other exploratory assessments, including but not limited to, 
AKT/PTEN signaling pathways may be evaluated, including protein expression and molecular profiling studies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
gene-expression. 
Archival tumor tissue for PTEN status:  Tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable tumor content.  Evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for 
PTEN status by a central laboratory must occur prior to initiation of study treatment.  A minimum of 10 unstained slides from a prior diagnostic FFPE core 
biopsy would be required for enrollment eligibility purposes.  Cytologic or FNA 
samples are not acceptable.  
If archival tissue is either insufficient or unavailable, FFPE core sample from a 
pretreatment biopsy of the tumor may be used; however, evaluation of the patient’s tumor sample for PTEN status by a central laboratory should occur 
prior to the initiation of study treatment.   
Screening and on-treatment tumor tissue biopsy:  FFPE and non-FFPE 
samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor biopsies.  At least 
one FFPE core needle biopsy and at least two freshly frozen OCT core needle biopsies are required at baseline and Cycle 1, Day 8.  
Tissue from surgery (see Section 3.1.1):  A FFPE tumor block and/or 
representative tissue sample slides fr
om the scheduled surgical resection are 
required for additional pathway marker evaluation.   
If a tumor block and/or slides cannot be obtained for various reasons (e.g., 
the tumor tissue is not sufficient at surgical resection), the site should 
discuss with the Sponsor. 
Mandatory tissue biopsy if patient will have additional systemic therapy prior to 
surgery:  FFPE and non-FFPE samples will be prepared from newly collected (fresh) tumor biopsies.  At least one FFPE core needle biopsy and at least two 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
62/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906819] core needle biopsies are required prior to initiation of 
additional systemic therapy. 
• Optional tumor tissue from biopsies at progression:  Optional FFPE tumor biopsy 
collection is strongly recommended and may be obtained if the patient progresses 
during neoadjuvant treatment.  Patients must have provided specific consent to 
allow collection and retention of optional samples. 
• Plasma samples for exploratory research on candidate biomarkers including, but not 
limited, to ctDNA 
• At Cycle 1, Day 1, a whole blood sample will be taken for DNA analysis and will be 
collected as part of the central laboratory samples. 
• Plasma samples for PK assessment:  Plasma samples will be collected to measure 
ipatasertib concentrations (see Appendix 1  and Appendix 2) .   
• Any remaining samples 
collected for PK and biomarker assays may be used for 
exploratory biomarker profiling, metabolite profiling and identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development purposes as appropriate. 
Residual samples will be destroyed no later than [ADDRESS_906820] to the confidentiality standards 
described in Section  8.5. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiograms 
Triplicate 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained at specified timepoints, as outlined in the schedule of assessments (see Appendix 1 ).  Three interpretable ECG recordings 
(e.g., without artifacts) m ust be obtained at each 
timepoint ( ± 5 minutes).  The average of 
the three readings will be used to determine ECG intervals (e.g., PR, QRS, QT).  Single ECG recordings may be obtained at unscheduled timepoints as indicated.  
Lead placement should be as consistent as possible.  ECG recordings must be 
performed after the patient has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 10 minutes.  All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at that same time (e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws) and should not be obtained within 3 hours after any meal.  Circumstances that may induce changes in heart rate, including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre-ECG resting period and during ECG recording. 
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG 
tracings.  Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_26650]'s permanent study file at the site.

treatment may be instituted per the discretion of the investigator.  If a PK sample is not scheduled for that timepoint, an unscheduled PK sample should be obtained and collected subsequent to the ECG reading.  A decision on study drug discontinuation should be made, as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  The investigator should also evaluate 
the patient f or potential 
concurrent risk factors (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, 
co-medications known to prolong the QT interval, severe bradycardia). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pathology A ssessment at Surgery 
Determination of pathological complete response (pCR) will be as measured by [CONTACT_671158].  Pathologic response within the breast and axilla will be assessed per local guidelines. 
4.5.2 Timing of Study Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening and Pr etreatment Assessments 
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed by [CONTACT_671159].  The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 
Screening and pretreatment tests and eval uations will be performed within 28 days 
preceding Cycle 1, Day 1, unless otherwise specified.  Results of tests and/or 
examinations performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within [ADDRESS_906823] dose of study treatment may be used rather than repeating required tests.  Additional informed consent (with a separate ICF) is required for collection of optional samples. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessments during Treatment 
All visits must occur within 3 days ( ± 3 days) of schedule visits after Cycle 1, Day 1, 
unless otherwise noted.  All assessments will be performed on the day of the specified visit unless a time window is specified.  Assessments scheduled on the day of study 
drug administration of each cycle should be per formed prior to study drug administration, 
unless otherwise noted.   
The surgery visit should take place no more than [ADDRESS_906824] dose of 
paclitaxel. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Post-Surgery/Early Termination Assessments 
A treatment completion visit should be scheduled within approximately 4 weeks after surgery.  The treatment completion visit procedures and assessments should be performed after patients permanently discontinue all study treatments (i.e., ipatasertib or 
placebo, and paclitaxel).

5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.[ADDRESS_906827] identified limited overlap with the well-defined safety profile of paclitaxel.  The combination of ipatasertib and paclitaxel has been well tolerated in the Phase Ib study (PAM4983g), including ipatasertib administered at the RP2D of 400 mg in combination with paclitaxel.  However, given that both ipatasertib and paclitaxel may result in gastrointestinal toxicity, there may be an increased risk of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea with this combination.  The potential for a clinically meaningful change in the exposure of ipatasertib and/or paclitaxel because of drug −drug interaction (DDI) is 
anticipated to be low, based on the PK data from the Phase Ib study (PAM4983g). 
The safety plan for this study is designed to ensure patient safety and will include 
specific eligibility criteria and monitoring assessments as detailed below. 
5.1.1 Eligibility Criteria  
Eligibility criteria for this study (see Section  4.1) were selected to enhance the safet y of 
patients in this trial.  A number of exclusion criteria are specifically based on the known 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
66/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906828] analyses of 
safety (see Section 6.8.1 and Section 6.8.2 ). 
5.1.[ADDRESS_906829] been assessed as related to ipatasertib and occurred in ≥
 10% of the patients:  nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, 
asthenia, hyperglycemia, decreased appetite, dyspepsia, dysgeusia, and rash.  Grade 3 adverse events that were assessed as related to ipatasertib were diarrhea, asthenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hypophosphatemia, nausea, and toxic skin eruption (see Section  1.2.2 and Ipatasertib Investigator’s Br ochure for 
 more details). 
The combination of ipatasertib with paclitaxel has also been tested in Arm C of the ongoing Phase Ib study (PAM4983g).  The types and frequencies of adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_671161]4983g are comparable to the single-agent Study PAM4743g.  The following adverse events in Arm C (ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel) have been assessed as related to ipatasertib in combination with paclitaxel and occurred in ≥
 10% of the patients:  diarrhea, 
nausea, fatigue, vomiting, rash, abdominal pain, anemia, dehydration, dermatitis acneiform, dizziness, dyspnea, and hyperglyc emia.  Grade [ADDRESS_906830] of adverse events observed in Study PAM4983g is provided in Section 1.2.2. 
Refer to the Ipatasertib Investigator’s Brochure f or further inf
ormation regarding the 
nonclinical and clinical safety evaluation of ipatasertib as a single-agent and in combination with chemotherapy. 
5.1.4 Potential Safety Issues Associated with Paclitaxel  
In prior clinical trials of paclitaxel, the following safety signals associated with paclitaxel were identified:  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, peripheral neuropathy, hypersensitivity reactions, and hematologic toxicity.   
To be eligible for the current study, patients must have adequate hematologic function, 
as manifested by [CONTACT_671162].  Furthermore, blood cells 
will be assessed prior to each treatment cycle (every 4 weeks) or sooner if clinically 
indicated.  
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
67/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 Peripheral neuropathy has not been observed to date with single-agent ipatasertib in the 
Phase Ia study (PAM4743g).  Patients with Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_906831] Characteristics 
5.1.5 Dosage Modifications  
Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are provided below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] General Guidelines 
Dose modifications for paclitaxel chemotherapy will be performed according to standard practice or institutional guidelines; details in this section can be used as guidance.  Reasons for dose modifications or delays, the supportive measures taken, and the outcome will be documented in the patient's chart and recorded in the eCRF.  
General guidelines for dosage/schedule modification are summarized as follows: 
• All effort should be made to provide 12 total doses of paclitaxel, if risk/benefit 
assessment allows. 
• If ipatasertib or placebo treatment is delayed, paclitaxel treatment should continue 
as scheduled; however, if paclitaxel treatment is delayed and ipatasertib/placebo is 
scheduled to be administered at the same timepoint, it is preferred that ipatasertib/placebo is also delayed to align with paclitaxel dosing . 
• If toxicity causes paclitaxel treatment to be delayed, clinic visits (and study 
procedures) associated with each cycle of therapy, as defined by [CONTACT_671163], will also be del ayed.  However, laboratory assessments 
and clinical visits shall be scheduled as needed for adverse events follow-up.  Once 
the toxicity has resolved to the required level, study treatment and study procedures 
will be resumed, according to the study cycle day count. 
• For any concomitant conditions at baseline, the dose modifications will apply 
according to the shift in toxicity grade, if the investigator deems it appropriate.  
For example, if a patient has Grade 1 asthenia at baseline that increases to Grade 2 during treatment, this will be considered a shift of one grade and will be treated as 
Grade 1 toxicity for dose-modification purposes. 
• For toxicities assessed by [CONTACT_671164], treatment may be continued at the same dose without reduction or 
interruption.  Dose reductions or interruptions may not be required for anemia (non-hemolytic) if satisfactorily managed by [CONTACT_27752]. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
68/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 • If any observed toxicity is attributable to only one drug as assessed by [CONTACT_1275], the dose of the other drug(s) may not require modification. 
• Dose modifications for isolated abnormal hematologic laboratory values will be 
based on hematologic parameters at the start of a treatment cycle.   
• Patients who require chemotherapy dose reductions and tolerate the reduced dose 
for across three or more doses (i.e., at least 21 days) may be allowed to increase 
back to a 100% dose at the treating physician’s discretion.   
• Chemotherapy may be delayed to manage toxicity.  Delays up to 4 weeks 
(approximately 28 days) are permitted.  Any delay longer than 4 weeks for a 
treatment-related adverse event will require  permanent discontinuation of paclitaxel.  
All effort should be made to provide 12 total doses of paclitaxel, if risk/benefit allows.  
 
Criteria for treatment modifications and guidelines for the management of toxicities 
attributable to ipatasertib, placebo, and/or paclitaxel are summarized below, along with recommended dose reductions for ipatasertib, placebo, and/or paclitaxel (see Table 1).  
The suggested reduction  instructio 
ns provided in Table 1 are intended to serve as a 
guideline to allow ongoin g treatment for patients.

Second dose reductionb 200 mg 50 mg/m2 
Third dose reductionb Discontinue  Discontinue 
a If the patient continues to experience s pecified drug-related adverse events after 
second reduction, the treatment should be discontinued.  
b Note that dose modification(s) for ipatasertib/placebo and paclitaxel are 
independent (e.g., adverse event may lead to dose reduction for ipatasertib/placebo with no dose modification for paclitaxel).
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosage Modification for Ipatasertib and Placebo 
Patients may hold the ipatasertib or placebo for up to 4 consecutive weeks 
(approximately 28 consecutive days) in order to recover from toxicity or an adverse 
event related to the study drug.  If the ipatasertib or placebo is discontinued at any time during the study, patients may have the option of continuing on study with chemotherapy alone. 
If the patient does not tolerate the QD dosing of the ipatasertib or placebo, a BID 
regimen of the ipatasertib or placebo (with the total daily dose divided in half, without a dose reduction, and administered approximately every 12 hours) may be attempted (e.g., a 400 mg QD dose may be divided into 200 mg administered BID).  The BID 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
69/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 regimen may be used to alleviate gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea  and 
vomiting.  Employment of a BID regimen should not be considered as a dose reduction.  
No more than two dose reductions of ipatasertib or placebo per patient (lowest dose level to be administered will be 200 mg/day) will be allowed, and dose re-escalation of ipatasertib or placebo may be permitted in the study after discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fasting Hyperglycemia 
Fasting is defined as abstaining from food and drink (with the exception of water) for at least 4 hours.  Dosage modification guidelines for fasting hyperglycemia attributable to ipatasertib or placebo are outlined below: 
• Grade 1 fasting hyperglycemia (Range:  >
 ULN−160 mg/dL [>  ULN−8.9 mmol/L]) :  
The patient may continue treatment with the ipatasertib or placebo, and 
chemotherapy.  The patient may receive education on a diabetic diet and consider 
beginning home glucose monitoring at the discretion of the investigator.  If glucose home monitoring is instituted, the ipatasertib or placebo treatment decision should 
be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of 
ipatasertib or placebo.  The patient may be started on an oral anti-diabetic medication (e.g., metformin) at the discretion of the investigator. 
• Grade 2 fasting hyperglycemia (Range:
   > 160− 250 mg/dL [>  8.9−13.9 mmol/L]) :  The 
patient should be started on an oral anti-diabetic medication (e.g., metformin) and 
should receive education on a diabetic diet.  The ipatasertib or placebo treatment 
decision should be based on the morning fasting glucose value obtained prior to the dose of ipatasertib or placebo.  The patient may also continue treatment with the 
ipatasertib or placebo, and/or chemotherapy. 
• Grade ≥
 3 fasting hyperglycemia (Range:    > 250− 500 mg/dL [>  13.9−27.8 mmol/L]) :  
The ipatasertib or placebo should be held until fasting hyperglycemia has resolved 
to Grade ≤ 2, but may continue chemotherapy.   The patient should start a diabetic 
diet and should start an oral anti-diabetic medication (e.g., metformin).  The patient 
may begin home glucose monitoring (with fasting glucose checked prior to the 
ipatasertib daily dose).  If fasting glucose levels recover to Grade ≤  2 within 3 days, 
the ipatasertib or placebo may be resumed at the same dose; alternatively, the dose 
of ipatasertib or placebo may be reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (see Table 1) at the 
discretion of
 the investigator.  If Grade  ≥ 3 fasting hyperglycemia recurs within the 
same cycle, or if recovery of fasting glucose levels to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_906832] be reduced by [CONTACT_671165].   
 
If patients develop Grade ≥ 3 fasting hyperglycemia associated with severe neurological 
symptoms (e.g., lethargy, focal signs, and obtundation), hyperventilation, abdominal pain 
or hypotension, discontinuation of study treatment with ipatasertib or placebo should be considered and discussed with the Medical Monitor.  Patients should be educated on the symptoms of hyperglycemia so that they  can be promptly and appropriately managed. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
70/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 In order to diminish the risk of hypoglycemia, insulin should not be administered for 
asymptomatic hyperglycemia of any grade. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neutropenia a nd/or Thrombocytopenia 
Addition of hematopoietic growth factors is allowed.  Dosage modification guidelines for neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia attributable to paclitaxel are outlined below: 
• Grade 2 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia
:  Paclitaxel may be administered at the 
previous dose when ANC has recovered to ≥ 1500/μ L (or per institutional guideline) 
and when the platelet count has recovered to ≥ 100,000/μ L (or per institutional 
guideline).  If the hematologic parameters do not recover to levels required for 
dosing per guidelines within 14 days, the paclitaxel dose should be reduced.  
• Grade  ≥ 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia :  Paclitaxel should be held.  Dose for 
subsequent paclitaxel treatments should be reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (see 
Table 1).  Following a tr eatment delay of 4 wee ks, if recovery to ANC of ≥ 1500/μL 
(or per institutional guideline) or if recovery to platelet count of ≥ 100,000/μL (or per 
institutional guideline) does not occur before the next scheduled paclitaxel dose, the patient will permanently discontinue paclitaxel treatment. 
• Febrile neutropenia (ANC <
 1000/μL and fever ≥  38.5°C [101 °F]):  Paclitaxel should 
be held until adequate recovery and for up to 4 weeks.  If the neutropenia recovers 
to ANC ≥  1500/μL within 4 weeks, paclitaxel should be reduced by [CONTACT_12691].  
Following a treatment delay of up to 4 weeks, if recovery to ANC of ≥ 1500/μL does 
not occur, the patient will permanent ly discontinue paclitaxel treatment. 
 
If a dose delay is required as a result of neutropenia at any grade, patients should 
receive prophylactic granulocyte col ony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or 
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) per institutional standards. 
Patients should be counseled as to the risk of fever and infection and to the importance 
of contact[CONTACT_671166], so that they can be promptly and appropriately managed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nausea and/or Vomiting 
Dose reductions for nausea and/or vomiting should occur only if the symptoms persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a minimum of two treatments with adequate (combination) anti-emetic treatment(s), including ondansetron (or equivalent anti-emetic).  If the nausea and/or vomiting are attributable to the ipatasertib or placebo, the investigator may employ a BID dosing of the ipatasertib or placebo administration (equivalent to the total daily dose divided by [CONTACT_2016]; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  For persistent nausea and/or vomiting attributable 
to the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or pac litaxel, d osage modification guid
elines for 
ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel are outlined below: 
• Grade 1 nausea and/or vomiting :  Maximum supportive care should be administered 
as needed at the discretion of the investigator.  
• Grade 2 nausea and/or vomiting :  Ondansetron (or equivalent anti-emetic) should 
be administered as needed.   
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
71/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 • Grade ≥ 3 nausea and/or vomiting :  Ondansetron (or equivalent anti-emetic) should 
be administered as needed.  If the nausea and/or vomiting are attributable to 
ipatasertib or placebo, the investigator may employ a BID dosing of 
ipatasertib/placebo administration (equivalent to the total daily dose divided by [CONTACT_2016]; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]); alternatively, the dose of ipatasertib or placebo may be 
reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (see Table 1 ).  If nau 
sea and/or vomiting is attributable to 
chemotherapy, paclitaxel may be given at a reduced dose du ring subseq
uent cycles. 
 
Dose re-escalation of the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel may be permitted in 
subsequent cycles for patients who exhibit Grade ≤ 1 nausea/vomiting through at least 
one cycle. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diarrhea 
Diarrhea should be managed with loperamide or per local guidelines and standard of care, including but not limited to therapy wi th Lomotil (diphenoxy late and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), 
codeine, or octreotide.   Dose reductions for diarrhea should occur only if the symptoms 
persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_671090] (com bination) anti-diarrheal medications.  
If persistent diarrhea  (more than 48 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_671105])  is attributable to the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel, dosage modification 
guidelines for ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel are outlined below: 
• Grade 2 diarrhea
:  The investigator should initiate optimal medical management 
with loperamide as early as possible.  If di arrhea is persistent (lasting longer than 
48 hours despi[INVESTIGATOR_45862]), second-line therapy may include (but not 
limited to) Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atro pi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), codeine or octreotide per local 
guidelines and standard  of care.  Ipatasertib/placebo dosing should be interrupted 
until improvement of diarrhea to Grade ≤ 1, at which time ipatasertib /placebo may 
be resumed at  the same  dose for initial occurrence with consideration of 
maintenance loperamide dosing (i.e., 2 mg, 2 to 4 times daily).  Investigators may  
reduce ipatasertib or placebo by [CONTACT_30560] (see Table 1)  for recurrent Grade 2 
diarrh
ea.  If diarrhea persists following  up to two dose reduction s of ipatasertib or 
placebo, consider dose hold of paclitaxel .  Dose intensity of paclitaxel should be 
maintained as much as is safely possible. Paclitaxel  dose reduction or 
discontinuation can be considered if diarrhea persists even after ipatasertib/placebo 
discontinuation  (see Table 1). 
• Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea :  Medical management of diarrhea per Grade 2 diarrhea above 
should be initiated as early as possible.  Ipatasertib or placebo should be held until 
the diarrhea resolves to Grade ≤ 1, at which time maintenance loperamide dosing 
(i.e., 2 mg, 2 to 4 times daily) is recommended.  The dose of ipatasertib or placebo 
will be reduced by [CONTACT_158175] (see Table 1).  If 
diarrhea persists following dose red uction of ipa
tasertib or placebo, an additional 
dose hold or reduction with ipatasertib/placebo should be considered (see Table 1).  
Dose intensity of paclitaxel should be maintained as much as is safely possible.  
Paclitaxel d
ose reduction or discontinuation can be considered if diarrhea persists 
even after ipatasertib/placebo discontinuation (see Table 1) .  
 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
72/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 Dose re-escalation of the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel may be permitted in 
subsequent cycles for patients who exhibit Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_906833] one cycle  after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor .  
Gastroenterologists should be counseled as to the risk of colitis and infection upon 
prolonged diarrhea condition, and patients should be educated on the symptoms of dehydration, so that patients can be promptly and appropriately managed. 
For additional information on the management guideline for diarrhea, see Appendix 6. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mucositis 
Dosage modification guidelines for mucositis attributable to the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel are outlined below: 
• Grade 1 or Grade 2 mucositis
:  Maximum supportive care should be administered 
as needed at the discretion of the investigator.  If Grade ≥ 2 mucositis recurs in 
subsequent 4-week cycles, despi[INVESTIGATOR_99190], the dose of ipatasertib 
or placebo should be reduced by [CONTACT_30560], and/or the dose of paclitaxel may 
be reduced for subsequent 4-week cycles (see Table 1).   
• Grade ≥ 3 mucositis :  If the mucositis resolves to Grade ≤ 2 during the current cycle, 
the dose of ipatasertib or placebo should be reduced by [CONTACT_30560], and/or the dose of paclitaxel may be reduced by [CONTACT_320881] 
(see Table 1 ).  If the mucositis does not resolve to Grade ≤
 2 during the current 
cycle, paclitaxel should be held for a maximum of 4 weeks (approximately 28 days).  
If the mucositis resolves to Grade ≤ 2 within a maximum of 4 weeks, dosing of 
paclitaxel may resume at dose reduc ed by [CONTACT_671167] 
(see Table 1 ).  If recovery of mucositis to Grade ≤ 2 does not occur within a 
maximum of 4 weeks, the patient will permanently discontinue paclitaxel and may 
continue the ipatasertib or placebo after discussion with the Medical Monitor. 
 
Dose re-escalation of the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel may be permitted in 
subsequent cycles for patients who exhibit Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_906834] one cycle. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin Toxicity 
Dosage modification guidelines for skin toxicity attributable to the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel are outlined below:  
• Grade 1 or Grade 2 skin toxicity, asymptomatic:
  Investigator may prescribe topi[INVESTIGATOR_671106]. 
• Grade 2 skin toxicity, symptomatic:   Investigator should consider topi[INVESTIGATOR_671107].  The ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel 
treatment may be held until resolution to Grade ≤ 1 or resolution such that the skin 
toxicity is no longer clinically significant. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
73/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 • Grade ≥ 3 skin toxicity attributable to ipatasertib or placebo :  The ipatasertib or 
placebo should be held for a maximum of 4 weeks (approximately 28 days).  During 
this time, the patient may continue treatment with paclitaxel at the discretion of the 
investigator.  If the skin toxicity resolves to Grade ≤ 2 or resolution such that the skin 
toxicity is no longer clinically significant in less than 4 weeks, dosing of the 
ipatasertib or placebo may resume, but the dose of ipatasertib or placebo should be 
reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (see Table 1).  If recovery of the skin toxicity to Grade ≤ 2 
or resolution such that the skin toxicity is no longer clinically significant does not 
occur within a maximum of 4 weeks, the patient will permanently discontinue the 
ipatasertib or placebo but may continue paclitaxel. 
• Grade ≥ 3 skin toxicity attributable to paclitaxel :  Paclitaxel treatment should be held 
for a maximum of 4 weeks (approximately 28 days).  If the skin toxicity resolves to Grade ≤
 2 within a maximum of 4 weeks, paclitaxel treatment may resume with 
paclitaxel dose reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (see Table 1).  If recovery of t he skin 
toxicity to Grade 
≤ 2 does not occur within a maximum of 4 weeks, the patient will 
permanently discontinue paclitaxel but may continue the ipatasertib or placebo. 
 
Dose re-escalation of the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel may be permitted in 
subsequent cycles for patients who exhibit Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_906835] one cycle.  
The ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel should be permanently discontinued for rash due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], or other suspected severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction that is related to ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Neuropathy 
If Grade ≥ 3 peripheral neuropathy attributable to paclitaxel develops in patients, 
paclitaxel should be held until the neuropathy recovers to Grade ≤ 2 or resolution such 
that the peripheral neuropathy is no longer clin ically significant.  During this time, the 
patient may continue the ipatasertib or placebo at the discretion of the investigator.  If the peripheral neuropathy recovers to Grade
 ≤ 2 within 4 weeks or resolution such that 
the peripheral neuropathy is no longer clinically significant, dosing of paclitaxel may resume reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (see Table 1).  If recovery of the peripheral neuropathy to Grade ≤
 2 or resolution such that the peripheral neuropathy is no longer 
clinically significant does not occur within a maximum of 4 weeks, the patient will permanently discontinue paclitaxel but may continue the ipatasertib or placebo. Dose of paclitaxel may be reduced at discretion of the investigator for clinically significant neuropathy not reaching grade 3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypersensitivity 
If a hypersensitivity reaction due to infusion of paclitaxel develops in patients, treatment for the hypersensitivity reaction, including the possibility of rechallenge with paclitaxel, should be administered as per institutional guidelines or at the discretion of the investigator.  The patient may continue the other study treatment components not associated with the toxicity (i.e., ipatasertib or placebo). 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
74/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 [IP_ADDRESS] Other Non-Hematologic Toxicities 
If other Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicities not described above develop in patients, 
treatment with the ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel may be held, depending on 
the attribution of the toxicity, at the discretion of the investigator.  During this time, treatment may continue with the other non-attributable treatment agent (i.e., either the ipatasertib or placebo, or paclitaxel).  The Grade ≥
 [ADDRESS_906836] weekly.  If the toxicity resolves to Grade ≤ 1 within 2 weeks, treatment 
may resume with the attributable agent.  If the toxicity resolves to Grade ≤ 1 in 
2−4 weeks, the dose of the attributable drug should be reduced by [CONTACT_671168] 1.  Depending on the nature and the severity of the 
adverse eve n
t, if recovery to Grade ≤ 1 takes >  4 weeks, treatment may resume with the 
attributable agent with dose reduction, or the attributable agent may be permanently discontinued, at the discretion of the investigator and after discussion with the Medical Monitor.   
For Grade ≥
 3 toxicities associated primarily with laboratory abnormalities only 
(e.g., elevation of ALT, AST, lipase, or amylase, or decreases in phosphorus without 
clinical or other evidence of pancreatitis or other hepatic dysfunction), study treatment may continue without interruption and/or dose-reduction at the discretion of the investigator per institutional practice. 
5.1.6 Management of Specific Adverse Events  
Guidelines for the management of specific adverse events are provided below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hyperglycemia 
Concomitant administration of the ipatasertib with food increased plasma glucose and insulin levels in the single-agent Phase Ia study (PAM4743g).  Grade 1 or Grade 2 fasting hyperglycemia events were observed among fasting patients and were relieved with a combination of oral anti-diabetic therapy (e.g., metformin) and diet modifications.  Patients who at baseline show early signs of insulin resistance, based on an elevated homeostasis model of estimated insulin resistance, may be treated with an oral anti-diabetic drug (e.g., metformin) and will still be allowed to participate in the trial.  To prevent the risk of hypoglycemia, managemen t of any asymptomatic hyperglycemia 
with insulin should be avoided. 
Use of glucocorticoid pretreatment for paclitaxel may influence glucose metabolism 
in patients in this study.  Institutions may use glucocorticoid premedications per institutional policies and as described in the package insert. 
Patients who currently require the use of insulin or have a fasting glucose >
 150 mg/dL 
or HbA 1C > 8% at baseline will be excluded from this study.  Fasting glucose levels and 
HbA 1C will be obtained at selected study visits from all patients as described in 
Appendix 1 .  For the purposes of dose modification decisio ns, glucose m easurements 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
75/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 should be in a fasting state, defined as a glucose level obtained ≥ [ADDRESS_906837] 
medical practice for hyperglycemia and sequelae, such as dehydration and acidosis.  Suggested dose modifications of the ipatasertib or placebo for hyperglycemia are outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Other metabolic effe cts o
bserved with the class of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors include 
hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia; therefore, patients with Grade  ≥ 2 
uncontrolled or untreated hypercholesterolemi a or hypertriglyceridemia will be excluded 
from the study.  Fasting plasma lipid profiles will be obtained at selected study visits from all patients as described in Appendix 1 .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematologic Toxicity 
Lymphocyte depletion has been observed in nonc linical toxicity studies in animals 
treated with ipatasertib; therefore, patients will be required to have adequate hematologic function, with resolution of any acute hematologic toxicities from prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], before initiation of ipatasertib or placebo.  Patients with conditions that affect lymphocyte counts, such as HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy, will be excluded from the study.  Patients will have standard hematologic parameters monitored 
throughout the study as described in Appendix 1 .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal Toxicity 
Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in the Phase Ia study (PAM4743g) with single-agent ipatasertib.  These symptoms are generally transient and relieved by [CONTACT_671169] (e.g., ondansetron for nausea and loperamide for diarrhea).  Class effects from other PI3K/Akt pathw ay inhibitors have included stomatitis and 
diarrhea and are generally reversible.   
Any potential gastrointestinal effects will be monitored by [CONTACT_671170].  Patients with known active inflammatory diseases, including those with small or large intestinal inflammation (e.g., Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis), will be excluded from the study.   
Gastrointestinal toxicities should be managed according to institutional guidelines, with 
appropriate supportive care as clinically indicated.  Suggested dose modifications of ipatasertib or placebo, and/or paclitaxel for gastrointestinal toxicities are outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for nausea/vomiting, Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for diarrhea, and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
for m
ucositis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dermatologic Toxicity 
Treatment-related rash occurred in approximately 12% of patients who received ipatasertib in the Phase Ia study (PAM4743g).  This rash commonly manifested itself as 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc.

5.[ADDRESS_906839], regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product 
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition  (
e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X-ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies) 
 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
77/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) 
• Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death) 
This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe 
form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. 
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Results in p ersistent or 
significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event 
results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study drug 
• Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the 
patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) 
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not
 synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE 
criteria; see Section 5.3.3); the event itself may be of relatively minor med i cal 
significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). 
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF. 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_25741] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions). 
5.2.[ADDRESS_906840] (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special inte rest are required to be reported by [CONTACT_547479] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructio ns).  Adverse events of special intere
 st 
for this study include the following: 
• Cases of potential drug-induced liver inju ry that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by [CONTACT_25742]’s 
law (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Suspected t r
ansmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_5257], as defined below 
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
78/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906841].  This term applies only  
when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 
• Grade 4 fasting hyperglycemia or symptomatic Grade 3 fasting hyperglycemia 
• Grade ≥ 4 hepatotoxicity 
• Grade ≥ 3 colitis  or diarrhea  
• Grade 2 diarrhea that persists for longer than 5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_115116] (per diarrhea management in Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• Grade ≥ 3 rash 
• Grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis 
• Any grade acute coronary syndrome or myocardial infarction 
 
5.3 METHODS AND TIMING FO R CAPTURING AND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1, 
for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Even
t eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.4,  5.5, and 5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on
 the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section  5.3.3
), and causality (see Section  5.3.4).   
5.3.[ADDRESS_906842].  All 
adverse events, whether reported by [CONTACT_25743], will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for instructions  f
 or reporting serious adverse events). 
After initiation of study drug, all adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported until [ADDRESS_906843].  After this period, the investigator is not required to actively monitor patients for adverse events; however, the Sponsor 
should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any post-study serious adverse events with a suspected causal relationship (see Section  5.6). 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
79/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient eval uation timepoints.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include the following: 
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?" 
"Have you had any new or changed health pr oblems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale fo r the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table 2 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specif
ically listed in the NCI CTCAE. 
Table 2 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically 
Listed in NCI CTCAE 
Grade Severity 
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; c linical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25674]; disabling; or 
limiting self-care activities of daily living b,c

NCI CTCAE  = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v4.0), which can be found at:   
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopm ent/electronic_applications/ctc.htm 
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_19640], using the telephone, managing money, etc. 
b Examples of self-care activities of daily living include bathing, dr essing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medica tions, as performed by [CONTACT_25744]. 
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medi cal event," it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting in stru ctions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section  5.2.[ADDRESS_906844] be reported as serious adverse events (see Section  5.4.2 for 
reporting instruction
s), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section  5.2.2 . 
 
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
80/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 "no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 3): 
• Temporal relationship of
 event onset to the initiation of study drug 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable) 
• Known association of the event with t he study drug or with similar treatments 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study • Presence of risk factors in the patient or  use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event 
• Presence of non-treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event 
 
Table 3 Causal Attribution Guidance 
Is the adverse event suspected to  be caused by [CONTACT_25745], evidence, 
science-based rationales, and clinical judgment? 
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 
administration of the study drug, and the adver se event cannot be readily explained by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concom itant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the 
adverse event abates or resolves upon di scontinuation of the study drug or dose 
reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the cr iteria specified below .  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug 
(e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adv erse event has no plausible temporal 
relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_906845] dose of study drug). 
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol-mandated therapy. 
5.3.[ADDRESS_906846] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event 
eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms 
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
81/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 and/or symptoms cannot be medically characte rized as a single diagnosis or syndrome 
at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently establishe d, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nulli fied and replaced by [CONTACT_40877], with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events 
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A m edically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints.  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF , unless the severity increases.   If a persistent adverse event 
becomes more severe, it should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event 
eCRF.  The initial (less severe) adverse event report should be updated to indicate that 
the event resolved on the date just prior to the day the event became more severe.  If a 
persistent adverse  event becomes serious, it should be recorded as a separate event on 
the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting 
instructions ) 
.  The initial ( non-serious ) adverse event report should be updated to 
indicate that the event resolved on the date just prior to the day the event became 
serious.  
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
82/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse 
events. 
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in  deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 
 × ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia." 
Observations of the same clinically signific ant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Vital Sign Values 
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659] 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation) 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
83/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 • Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically signifi cant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Liver Function Tests 
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury.  
Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
> 2 × ULN 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning o f 
the event), either as a se
rious adverse event  or a non-serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section  5.4.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths 
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1), regardless of relat i
 onship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2).  This 
includes de ath attribute
d to progression of TNBC. 
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should be used only for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within [ADDRESS_906847] seen alive 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
84/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. 
If the death is attributed to progression of TNBC, "TNBC progression" should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Preexisting Medical Conditions 
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only
 if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., "more frequent headaches"). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Breast Cancer 
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not
 be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on RECIST.  In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25675] (i.e., in-patient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25676] a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section  5.2.2), except as outlined 
below.   
The followin g hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27825]: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678] 
• Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33402] (e.g., for study drug administration 
or insertion of access device for study drug administration) 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
85/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met: 
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27827]

• Perform an efficacy measurement for the study 
• Receive scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study 
 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25681], 
but should be reported as adverse events instead: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25682] 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events As sociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2). 
5.[ADDRESS_906848] report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than [ADDRESS_906849] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: 
• Serious adverse events 
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest 
• Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information).  New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis 
• Significant new diagnostic test results 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
87/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancies in Female Patients 
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the 
investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within [ADDRESS_906850] dose of study drug.  A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by [CONTACT_26819] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) and submitted via the EDC system.  A pregnancy report will automatically be generated and sent to Safety Risk Management.  Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
In the event that the EDC system is unava ilable, the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting 
Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to [COMPANY_002] or its 
designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_123567].  Once the E DC system is available, all information will 
need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects and Abortions 
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2).  Any abortion should be reported in the same fashion (because the 
Sponsor co

expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and 
applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. 
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events us ing the following reference documents: 
• Ipatasertib Investigator's Brochure 
• Local prescribing information for paclitaxel 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
89/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN  
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be based on randomized patients, with 
patients allocated to the treatment arm to which they were randomized. 
Safety analyses will include treated patients (i.e., patients who received at least one 
dose of ipatasertib, placebo, or paclitaxel), with patients allocated to the treatment arm associated with the regimen that they actually received. 
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons when addressing primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  Multiple comparison adjustments will be used for selected exploratory endpoints to account for genome-wide correlative comparisons.   
The primary analysis will be performed after LPLV and subsequent data cleaning, 
expected to occur approximately [ADDRESS_906855] only a 
large benefit from combination therapy with ipatasertib and paclitaxel versus placebo and paclitaxel.   
A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in the study (75 per arm).  Assuming a 60% 
prevalence of PTEN-low status in TNBC, it is expected that [ADDRESS_906856] minimum clinically meaningful differences between treatment arms at a statistically significant α 
(type 1) error level of 5%.  Instead, the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the difference in pCR rate will be calculated with the expectation that for clinically meaningful outcomes, the lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI will be greater than 0. 
For example, a true improvement of greater than 20% in pCR rate (from 20% to 40%) 
would be considered a clinically meaningful  outcome when comparing ipatasertib and 
paclitaxel versus placebo and paclitaxel.  Given at least 90 patients (45 per arm) with PTEN-low tumors and a targeted improvement of 20% in pCR rate, the corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI is 2.3%.  Also, for 150 patients (75 per arm) in ITT population with a targeted improvement of 15% in pCR rate, the corresponding lower limit of the two-sided 90% CI is 1.5%. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
90/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906857] OF STUDY 
Enrollment, study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be 
summarized overall and by [CONTACT_2939].  The reasons for study treatment discontinuation will be tabulated, and major protocol violations will be summarized. 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF TREATMEN T GROUP COMPARABILITY 
Demographic and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, region, weight, baseline ECOG performance status, tumor PTEN status, and tumor PIK3CA status will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939]. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, 
and ranges.  Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_671171]. 
6.[ADDRESS_906858] and axilla (ypT0/Tis ypN0).  The primary efficacy  analyses will be performed on randomized 
patients, with the patients allocated to the treatment arm according to the randomization.  The pCR endpoint will be analyzed for all randomized patients and for patients with PTEN-low tumors.  Patients whose pCR assessment is missing are counted as not 
achieving a pCR . 
An estimate of the pCR rate and its 90% CI (Blyth-Still-Casella method) will be 
calculated for each treatment arm for all randomized patients and for patients with PTEN-low tumors.  The difference in pCR rates will also be provided with 90% CIs, using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.  Stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests will be used to compare treatment arms. 
In addition, a sensitivity analysis may be conducted to account for patients whose pCR 
assessment cannot be ascertained. 
6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows. 
• The rate of pCR in breast in all patients and in patients with PTEN-low tumors 
assessed by [CONTACT_671172] 
• Tumor ORR assessed by [CONTACT_671173] m odified RECIST criteria, in all patients 
and in patients with PTEN-low tumors  
• The rate of pCR and ORR in patients whose tumors are Akt Dx+ (defined by [CONTACT_610746], INPP4B status, and PI3K alterations) 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
91/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 • The rate of pCR according to subtypes of breast cancer defined by [CONTACT_671142]; e.g., PAM50 classifier 
• The rate of BCS and conversion to BCS in patients with T2 or T3 tumors 
 
These endpoint measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_671174] 90% CIs for 
each treatment arm, and will be compared between the two treatment arms for each population using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.  In addition, the locally-assessed pCR rate in breast and axilla will also be compared between the two treatment arms based on Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. 
6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES 
The safety analyses will include all treated patients (i.e., randomized patients who received at least one dose of ipatasertib, placebo, or paclitaxel), with patients grouped according to the treatment actually received.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events, changes in laboratory 
test results, changes in vital signs, and ipatasertib or placebo, and paclitaxel exposures.  Treated patients will be included in the safety analyses. 
Verbatim descriptions of adverse events will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  
Treatment-emergent events (defined as events occurring on or after the first dose of ipatasertib, placebo, or paclitaxel) will be summarized by [CONTACT_235350], appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE, v4.[ADDRESS_906859] modeling will be used for the estimation of PopPK parameters for GDC-0068.  Covariates such as patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, body size), may be tested for significance on PK parameters of interest. 
The PK data may be combined with the safety, efficacy, and biomarker data for 
exposure-response modeling as an exploratory objective.  PK and PK/pharmacodynamic analyses may be reported in separate stand-alone reports.  Additional analyses may be explored as warranted by [CONTACT_26739]. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
92/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 6.7 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES 
The exploratory endpoints, including the effects of PI3K/Akt pathway alterations in the 
archival tumor samples will be evaluated with appropriate methods. 
6.[ADDRESS_906860] an optional 
interim analysis and the timing of the analysis will be documented in the Sponsor’s trial master file prior to the conduct of the interim analysis.  The interim analysis will be performed and reviewed by [CONTACT_671175]. 
In addition, the Medical Monitor may request additional safety analysis and may call 
for additional meetings of the JMC to review ongoing data to assess risk/benefit. 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT  
7.[ADDRESS_906861] data

The Sponsor will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data.  Electronic data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. 
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored by [CONTACT_260506]’s standard procedures. 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
93/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906862] disc is required. 
7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENTATION 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient-reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico-technical departments involved in a clinical trial. 
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section  7.5. 
To facilitate source data 
verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor (or designee) direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow inspection by [CONTACT_25756]. 
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly  into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
94/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906863] of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, ePRO data (if applicable), Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_25653] [ADDRESS_906864] conservation surgery; in addition, pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is prognostic of favorable long-term outcome.  An important consideration for neoadjuvant regimen is good tolerability, allowing completion of the regimen and safe surgical resection.   
Taxane-based therapy can improve pCR in the neoadjuvant setting.  In addition, 
single-agent taxane therapy is safer relative to multidrug combinations, exhibiting lower frequency of Grade 3 and 4 events, and lower treatment discontinuation rate (see Section  3.3.3).  Notably, only a limited number of patient s achieve p
 CR; thus there 
is a need for safe and effective regimen in ear ly TNBC (as well as within biomarker 
subsets of TNBC).

BASELINE DOCUMENTATION OF TARGET AND NON-TARGET LESIONS 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate 
the overall tumor burden at baseline and to use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations shoul d be performed as close as possible to the 
treatment start and never more than [ADDRESS_906892] is currently the preferred modality for assessing metastatic disease, but should not be used in this focused setting of neoadjuvant

111/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906893] lesions, and will also be used to assess response in this protocol, adhering to response criteria as presented in this appendix.  
Target Lesions  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Up to 
[ADDRESS_906894] may be identified as target lesions.  A sum of the diameters of all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The baseline sum of diameters will be used as a reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered malignant lesions (neither target nor non-target) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. Pathologic axillary lymph nodes are not to be designated at target lesions, and 
lymph node measurements are not to be included in the sum of diameters (see below for 
more detail).  
Bilateral breast imaging studies should be conducted at each study assessment. The same method of measurement and the same technique should be used to characterize each target lesion at baseline and during the study, and all measurements should be recorded in metric notation.  Care must be taken in measurement of target lesions with different modalities, since the same lesion may appear to have a different size with each modality. If for some reason the same imaging modality cannot be used at a scheduled assessment time point, then the case should be discussed with the radiologist to determine if substitution of any other approach is possible and, if not, the patient should be considered not evaluable at that timepoint, for that particular type of imaging assessment. 
Non-Target Lesions  
Non-target lesions may include any other measurable breast lesions not identified as target lesions, as well as truly non-measurable lesions, such as diffuse skin thickening or other lesions not measurable by [CONTACT_128694]. 
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures 
that may be visible by [CONTACT_235361].  Axillary lymph nodes are 
known to vary widely in size, and signs of abnormality in axillary lymph nodes on 
imaging include other morphological findings often in addition to changes in nodal size.  For these reasons, pathologic axillary lymph nodes on imaging should be identified as

Breast Cancer (cont.) 
Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
112/Protocol GO29505, Version 3 non-target lesions at baseline.  Change in short-axis dimension may be considered in 
the assessment of pathology, but measurements are not required, and these lesions 
should be followed qualitatively, as descr ibed below at each response assessment 
timepoint.   
Signs of lymph node pathology on imaging include the following:  
• Increase in short axis dimension 
• Thickened cortex, either diffusely or asymmetrically enlarged 
• Thinning, or replaced fatty hilum 
• Irregular margins or spi[INVESTIGATOR_235244] • Rim enhancement • Decreased echogenicity of cortex • Perinodal edema 
 
EVALUATION OF RESPONSE 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor 
response for target breast lesions: 
• Complete response (CR):  disappearance of all target lesions 
• Partial response (PR):  at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters 
• Progressive disease (PD):  at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (nadir), including baseline In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate 
an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. 
• Stable disease (SD):  neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study

113/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906895] their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions that are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on imaging that the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as being too small to measure.  When this occurs, it is important that a value be recorded on the CRF as follows: 
• If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], 
the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm. 
• If the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to 
accurately measure, BML (below m easurable limit) should be indicated.  
 
To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is abl e to provide an actual measure, that should 
be recorded, and, in that case, BML should not be ticked.  
Lesions That Split or Coalesce on Treatment.   When non-nodal lesions fragment, the 
longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the 
target lesion sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter for the coalesced lesion should be recorded. 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
This section provides the definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for any non-target lesions identified at baseline.  Although some non-target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and, instead, should be assessed only qualitatively at the timepoints specified in the protocol. 
• CR: disappearance of all non-target lesions 
– All lymph nodes must be non-pathologic in appearance 
• Non-CR/Non-PD:  persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) • PD: unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.  For pathologic axillary 
lymph nodes, this may be based on a combination of morphological factors, 
including a potential increase in short-axis dimension

Ipatasertib (GDC-0068)—Genentech, Inc. 
114/Protocol GO29505, Version [ADDRESS_906896] increase in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare. 
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal, that is, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  For example, necrosis of a breast lesion may be reported on an MRI scan report as a “new” cystic lesion, which it is not. A lesion identified during the study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. 
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example bec ause of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. 
Timepoint Response (Overall Response)  
Table 1 provides a summary of the overall response status calculation at each protocol-specified timepoint for which a response assessment occurs.

Missing Assessments and Not-Evaluable Designation  
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not 
evaluable at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is also consi dered not evaluable at that timepoint, unless a 
convincing argument can be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned timepoint response. Similarly, if one or more non-target lesions are not assessed, the response for non-target lesions should be “not evaluable” except where there is clear progression in non-target lesions that are assessed.  
Special Notes on Response Assessment  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease as shown in Table 1.

[LOCATION_001] Heart Association Classification 
of Functional Cardiac Capacity 
Class Description 
I No limitation:  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, 
dyspnea, or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332]. 
II Slight limitation of physical activity:  Such patients are comfortable at rest.  
Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspnea, or 
angina. 
III Marked limitation of physical activity:  Although patients are comfortable at 
rest, less than ordinary physical  activity will lead to symptoms. 
IV Inability to carry on physical activity  without discomfort:  Symptoms of 
congestive heart failure are present even at rest.  With any physical activity, increased discomfort is experienced.

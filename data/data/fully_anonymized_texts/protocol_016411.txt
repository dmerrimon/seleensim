a. Background  
Individuals who abuse cocaine for recreational purpose can have  excessively elevated core 
temperatures  (PMID: 9628710, 7484066 , 8010552, 18823733, and 2728444) . Using a passive heat 
stress approach, we previously showed that intranasal cocaine administration suppressed skin blood 
flow and sweating (PMID: 12044126).  However, it remains unknown whether suppression of skin 
blood flow and sweating responses to cocaine are sufficient to cause excessive elevations in core 
temperature during exercise.    
 
We propose that cocaine- induced reductions in sweating and skin blood flow will result in excessive 
elevations in core temperature during exercise in warm environmental conditions. Thus, the objective of this work is to test the hypothesis that  intranasal cocaine impairs  core temperature responses during 
mild to moderate intensity exercise while in warm environmental conditions . 
 
b. Current practice  
A cocaine solution, administered  in each nostril to achieve analgesia and vasoconstriction, is commonly 
used in rhino- surgical procedures  (PMID: 32730351, 16848922, and 26452438) . According to the 
product insert, “The total dose for any one procedure or surgery should not exceed 3 mg/kg cocaine 
hydrochloride”, which is the basis for our decision to not administer more than 3 mg/kg cocaine for any 
one procedure.

V2Mar2018 A lidocaine solution is also commonly used for related procedures (PMID: 26452438, 24980226,  and 
30017430) at doses similar to proposed with the present protocol .   
 
3.  Study Design.  
Describe the study design (e.g., single/double blind, parallel, crossover, etc.)  Consider inserting a scheme 
to visually present the study design.  
 
We will conduct a double -blind, placebo -controlled, crossover study. Following informed consent and 
screening, eligible participants will be randomized to complete the cocaine or the placebo (lidocaine)  trial first, 
with the other “agent” administered during the subsequent visit . After the administration of either of these 
drugs, the participate will perform mild to moderate intensity exercise in warm environmental conditions (no 
higher than 41 °C).

V2Mar2018 Inclusion:  
• 18-50 years of age  
• Healthy  
• Non-obese (body mass index less than 31 kg/m2) 
• Speak English 
• Systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg  
• Diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg  
 
Exclusion:  
• Subjects not in the defined age range  
• Subjects who have cardiac, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], neurological and/or metabolic illnesses  
• Any known history of renal or hepatic insufficiency/disease  
• Pregnancy or breast feeding 
• Current smokers, as well as individuals who regularly smoked within the past 3 years  
• Subjects who cannot speak or read English 
• History of drug above within the past 5 years  
• Positive urine drug screen 
• Currently taking pain modifying medication(s)  
 
Although this study requires relatively uncomplicated procedures, inclusion of non- English speaking subjects 
would compromise subject safety. Consequently, it is imperative that the research and medical staff can 
communicate instantly and effectively with subjects, without the need of a translator. Therefore, the 
investigators feel that inclusion of non- English speakers would markedly and unnecessarily increase the risk 
to those participants.  
 Healthy adults will be recruited via online and paper  flyers, emails to the [LOCATION_007] Health System (reaches over 
18,000 people) , local universities (inclusive of UTSW), and our institutional participant database. Participants 
must be free from underlying serious medical  conditions (detailed via medical history, physical exam), non -
smokers, have a body mass index less than 3 1 kg/m
2, and will be excluded if they have any  current  
cardiometabolic  diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). Individuals who are pregnant, planning to become 
pregnant, or breastfeeding will be excluded. We will also exclude those with a history of drug abuse.  
 
As described above, all participants will complete an informed consent and screening for eligibility.  
Participants will be randomized to complete either the cocaine or placebo trial first. During these experimental 
visits, participants will perform mild to moderate -intensity exercise in warm environmental conditions (no 
higher than 41 °C). 
 
The setting for all visits will be the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine. Trials will be conducted in controlled laboratory settings.  A physician with a license to prescribe schedule II drugs  (Noah Jouett DO, 
Satyam Sarma MD, or Tiffany Brazile MD), or a research nurse (with oversight from that physician
) will 
administer cocaine (no higher than 3 mg/kg body mass) or placebo (lidocaine, no higher than 3 mg/kg body 
mass) during each experimental visit. We will assess core and skin temperatures, local and whole- body sweat 
rate, brachial blood pressure, heart rate via electrocardiogram, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (from metabolic cart), 
compensatory reserve via photoplethysmography, and plasma catecholamine concentrations from blood 
samples collected prior to and after exercise (~3 tablespoons per experimental visit). In addition, ratings of 
perceived exertion and thermal perception will be obtained.  
 
Data analysis will be performed as done previously in [CONTACT_175248]’s laboratory  in companion studies 
addressing the same questions but during passive heating rather than exercise ( PMID: 12044126) . 
Specifically, we will compare thermoregulatory and cardiovascular data ( e.g., baseline and end -exercise)

V2Mar2018 between placebo and cocaine trials . All data will be analyzed while blind to condition and with proper co -
variate analys es. 
 
Personal health  information  (PHI)  that is collected will be kept in a key -lock filing cabinet in a key -lock room 
only accessible to study team members within a numeric -padlocked laboratory . As described in the eIRB 
portal, a coded number  system will be used in p lace of the participants name [CONTACT_175246] -identify their research 
information collected. A participant ID key, only accessible to study team members, will link the participants 
‘information with the coded number.  Additionally, we follow all applicable University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern 
IRB and Institute of Exercise and Environmental Medicine (i.e., where the research will take place)  guidelines 
for protecting research participant privacy.  
 
Up to 3 0 participants  are anticipated to enroll in this study , with a goal of obtaining complete datasets on 20 
individuals . No study has evaluated the effects of cocaine on core temperature responses during exercise in 
warm (or thermoneutral) environmental conditions . The power and sample size estimates are based on 
findings from [CONTACT_40344]’s laboratory investigating core temperature responses to 60 min of exercise in burn 
survivors. Our rationale for using burn survivors is the expectation that the suppression in sweating in burn 
survivors with 20 -40% body surface area burn may be similar to the suppression in sweating caused by 
[CONTACT_130892]. The power analysis was calculated using G*Power  [Ttests – Means: Difference between two 
dependent means (matched pairs)] using a projected ~25% heightened increase in core body temperature 
following 60 minutes of exercise with cocaine  relative to when participants received placebo  (i.e., placebo:  
0.82±0.36 °C, cocaine: 1.02±0.40 °C ). These predictions resulted in an effect size of 0.60 . With a study 
power=0.81 at an alpha=0.05,  yielded an estimated subject size of 19 individuals . That value was inflated to 
20 subjects (10 male and 10 female) to permit an exploratory  comparison in the primary responses between 
sexes. Given the potential for subject dropouts, we propose to recruit up to [ADDRESS_1250262] 
never been assessed, the indicated values  are estimates and thus interim power analyses will be performed, 
with the number of required subjects adjusted based upon the variance of the obtained data.

5.  Safety Precautions.  (Describe safeguards to address the serious risks listed above.)  
a.  Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks for each of the more 
than minimal risk research procedures  listed above.  
Cocaine  and lidocaine  administration:  No greater than 3 mg/kg body mass of cocaine  or lidocaine  will 
be administered  once during one each  experimental visit. A t the administered doses of cocaine or lidocaine 
(doses consistent with procedures performed by [CONTACT_892657], nose, and throat physician in a doctor’s office setting) the risks to the participants are minimal. That said, the administered dose of cocaine has the  
potential to slightly elevate arterial  blood pressure and heart rate. However, in our prior trial  (PMID: 
12044126) cocaine increased resting blood pressure less than 10 mmHg and increased resting heart rate 
Form A  
STU-2023-0094 
 
STU2023- 0094, Crandall, FormA -Protocol, Mod_5, 02 -07-24 (2)    9 
V2Mar2018 less than 10 bpm , both  relative to the placebo (lidocaine) trial. Thus, we do not expect blood pressures or 
heart rates to be excessively elevated. Importantly, in the healthy cohort that will be assessed, such 
increases in arterial blood pressure and heart rate are inconsequen tial. Importantly, w e will monitor the 
patient's vital signs continuously for both the cocaine and lidocaine experimental limbs . A physician licensed 
to precribe schedule II drugs  (Noah Jouett DO, Satyam Sarma MD, or Tiffany Brazile MD)  will be present 
whenever cocaine is administered to observe and intervene should the patient exhibit the slightest evidence 
distress . Standard “crash cart” equipment (inclusive of a defibrillator ) will always be readily available . As 
mentioned above, we per formed  similar trials, usin g cocaine and lidocaine (PMID: 12044126)  in young 
healthy adults without any complications.  
 
Upon the conclusion of the protocol, subjects will not be permitted to leave the laboratory until all of the 
following discharge variables are met:  
• The subject presents with an Aldrete score (post -anesthesia discharge scoring system) matching 
baseline,  
• The subject demonstrates an awareness of time, person, and place and is able to answer 
questions appropriately  
• The subject is able to stand up and walk for 5 minutes without assistance (supervised) 
• The subject is able to drink water and eat crackers without reports of nausea 
• The subject able to void   
Sub-maximal exercise in thermoneutral conditions:  There are no additional risks involved with 
performing a sub -maximal exercise test beyond that associated with light to moderate -intensity physical 
exertion. Every precaution will be taken to minimize the risk by [CONTACT_892658] (blood 
press ure, heart rate and rhythm) throughout the exercise. This test will be stopped if signs or symptoms of 
cardiac ischemia develop, if excessive hypertension or hypotension develop, or if arrhythmias occur dur ing 
exercise.  A research nurse will be present during the sub -maximal exercise test to interpret any danger 
signs and symptoms.  
 
Exercise in warm environmental conditions:  Internal body temperature will be monitored throughout 
each experiment. The protocol will stop, and the environmental temperature will be reduced, in the unlikely 
occurrence that internal  body temperature exceeds 39.5°C or upon any indication of adverse cardiovascular 
or neurological symptoms (e.g., lightheadedness, hypotension, hypertension, nausea, etc). Our 20+ years 
of experiences reveals that healthy individuals are able to tolerate the exercise bout well. Upon completion 
of each trial, we will ensure that each subject is normothermic and adequately hydrated prior to being 
permitted to leave the laboratory . A research nurse will monitor the participant’s vital signs throughout 
exercise and will stop the exercise, and cool the environment, should any adverse signs or symptoms occur . 
 Internal temperature (temperature sensor pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]): See comments above regarding the internal body 
temperature cut -off (39.5 °C) for all trials. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_665211] [ADDRESS_1250265]’s medical history prior to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_892654]. Should a subject have any contraindications in taking the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], the pi[INVESTIGATOR_892655]. 
Rather, rectal temperature will be obtained.  
 Internal temperature (rectal sensor): If rectal temperature is used, the subject will self -insert a small 
single -use rectal temperature sensor to a pre -marked depth of [ADDRESS_1250266] or previously had inflammatory bowel or colon disease and/or rectal or anal surgery. They also may not use the probe if they currently have hemorrhoids (internal or external), rectal bleeding, 
diarrhea or fecal impaction in the rectum. Each subject’s medical history will be verified prior to self -
insertion of the rectal probe by [CONTACT_54340].  
 
Internal temperature (suppository pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]): If a suppository temperature sensing pi[INVESTIGATOR_892656], with a gloved 
hand the subject will self -insert a lubricated temperature sensor pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (like a suppository) into their rectum.

STU2023- 0094, Crandall, FormA -Protocol, Mod_5, 02 -07-24 (2)    [ADDRESS_1250267] currently has hemorrhoids (internal or external), rectal bleeding, diarrhea or fecal impaction in the 
rectum. Each subject’s medical history will be verified by [CONTACT_892659] -insertion of this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  
 
Blood draws: Blood draws will be obtained via a “butterfly” needle. No more than 6 tablespoons of blood 
will be withdrawn across all visits.  There is a small risk of infection and a still smaller risk of a blood clot. 
The likelihood of these complications is  remote (less than 1 in 10,000) when the procedure is carried out 
by [CONTACT_175243], as during this study. There is also a small risk of the 
needle perforating the vein or not being inserted into a blood vessel. The participant may have discomfort, 
bleeding, and/or bruising and on rare occasions, a person may feel dizzy or faint.  
 
Health history assessment : Participants will fill out a survey  related to their physical well-being.  It is 
possible individuals may feel uncomfortable while completing this  survey. We will ensure all participants 
are aware of this procedure during the informed consent visit. If a participant is uncomfortable completing 
all of the survey, they will be reminded that 1) their participation is entirely voluntary, 2) that only study 
investigators will have access to the surveys and their results, and 3) only de- identified results will be shared 
in scientific meetings and/or in future scientific manuscripts. 
 
 
b.  Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in 
the event of adverse events, or unanticipated problems involving subjects.  
When the participant is undergoing any testing, they will be supervised by [CONTACT_175244]/or 
physician.  In addition, physicians and nurses at the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine will 
assist as needed.  A physician licensed to prescribe schedule I I drugs  (Noah Jouett DO, Satyam Sarma 
MD, or Tiffany Brazile MD)  will be present when cocaine is administered.  There is a fully stocked “crash 
cart” with a defibrillator and medications within [ADDRESS_1250268] that participants are not discharged until vital signs are similar 
to that of baseline values .

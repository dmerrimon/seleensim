3.2 Primary Endpoint /Analysis 
 The study will be analyzed per the standards of the 1994 Tentative Final Monograph 
(TFM) for Effectiveness Testing of a Patient Preoperative Skin Preparation (FR 59:116, 17 June 94, pp. [ZIP_CODE]- [ZIP_CODE]) , as updated by [CONTACT_265989] .  The primary efficacy criteria will be assessed based on 
log
10 CFU/cm2 reduction s at the 10- minute sampling time. The TFM indicates log 10 
CFU/cm2 reductions as the primary efficacy measure while the Proposed 
Amendment of the Tentative Final Monograph (FR 80:84, 01 May 2015)  indicates 
responder rates as the primary efficacy requirement . This study will use responder 
rate at [ADDRESS_323434] -prep as the primary measure of efficacy but will also 
calculate and show log 10 CFU/cm2 reductions from baseline.

  The primary measure of antimicrobial efficacy is the reduction of skin flora on the 
abdominal and groin sites at 10  minutes following application of the study treatments 
relative to the Treatment Day baseline counts.  
The reduction will be calculated by a perc ent successes approach (i.e. percent of 
subjects meeting required reductions = responder rate ).  A site is considered a 
responder for the treatment  at the indicated time point  if the criteria in the following 
table are met:   
Table 3.2 :  Minimum  and Maximum  Treatment Day Baseline and Expected Mean Log 10 
Reduction per Anatomical Site  
Anatomical Site  Minimum  and Maximum  
Treatment Day Baseline*  Expected Mean Log 10 
Reduction  
Abdomen 1.0 x 103 – 3.2 x 105 CFU/cm2
  
(3.0 Log 10 – 5.5 Log 10) 2.0 log 10 @ 10 -minutes  
Groin  1.0 x 105 – 3.2 x 107 CFU/cm2
  
(5.0 Log 10 – 7.5 Log 10) 3.0 log 10 @ 10 minutes 
*Note: For the Screening Day b aseline, the maximum upper limit does not apply.  Only the 
minimum criteria must be met.  
  
Responder status will be  calculated separately for the abdomen and groin, for each 
test substance, for each post -treatment sample time, and for each subject. The 
individual responses will then be grouped to generate an overall responder rate for 
each anatomical area, for each test substance, and for each post -treatment time . 
The primary efficacy goal for active products is to have the lower bound of the 95% 
confidence interval for the responder rates at 10 minutes  to be greater than or equal 
to 70%.   
 
Secondary Endpoint s/Analysis 
 Responder rates at 30 seconds will be calculated identically to the 10 minute rates. 
At 6 hours a site is considered a responder if it is below baseline; otherwise, 6- hour 
responder rates will be calculated identically to the 10-minute responder rates. The 
secondary efficacy goals are to have the 95% confidence intervals for the responder 
rates to be greater than or equal to 70% . Log
[ADDRESS_323439] article and the active control should be superior to the 
inactive control for the primary endpoint . The responder rates for both active and 
inactive treatments at 6 hours are near 100%. Therefore, comparison of responder 
rates at 6 hours is unlikely to show any difference. Differences in log
10 CFU/cm2 
reductions from baseline will be used at [ADDRESS_323440]:  ZX -ZP-[ADDRESS_323441] Protocol: [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_323442]: 865-[ADDRESS_323443] - Confidential  
   
3.3 Randomization and Blinding  
 
Subjects will be randomized before treatment , after screening eligibility is 
determined.  Subjects will be randomized to treatme nt using the following block 
design:  
 
Treatment Balance 
Each subject will receive two different treatments, one on the right side of the body and one on the left.    The treatment assignments will be balanced such that the number of readings per anatomical site matches  the calculated requirements.  
 
Left/Right Balance  
The application will be randomized so that each treatment is used on an equal 
number of left and right sides of the body . 
 
Site and Sample Time Balance 
Within each anatomical site, sampling order will be randomized for baseline, 30 second, 10 minute, and 6 hour  samples based on the statistical consultant’s 
randomization plan. 
 The randomization plan has been updated  
  
 
. 
 The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the randomi zation is followed. A 
basic outline of a randomization schedule for the abdominal  and groin sites is 
provided in Appendix 14.4. The final randomization schedule will be prepared before the initial treatment.  The test and control articles  will be labeled with the appropriate 
codes as designated by [CONTACT_265990].   
 Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_73976], a screening ID number, and a subject 
number corresponding to each body region in the study for which they qualify.  
Subject numbers will not be assigned until a subject has passed the screening 
criteria, including baseline bacterial counts (at least 1.0 x 10
5 CFU/cm2 in the groin 
and at least 1. 0 x 103 CFU/cm2 on the abdomen) . Subjects whose abdominal and 
groin regions qual ify will be assigned the subject number. Therefore, for each of the  
participating subject will be assigned two identification numbers .

5.2 Microbiological Methods 
 
5.2.1  Microbial Sample Collection / Scrub Cup Technique  
 
Quantitative cultures (screening baselines, treatment baselines and post 
treatment application) will be obtained by a modification of the cylinder sampling technique of Williamson -Kligman scrub cup technique.  To collect 
the samples, a sterile scrub cup  will be placed on the site and 
held firmly to the skin. Sampling solution (SS) ( ) will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_265982] a circular motion with moderate pressure for [ADDRESS_323514] 
solution collected.   
 
5.2.2  Sampling Solution  (SS) 
 The SS consists of sterile [75mM phosphate buffer (  
 containing  l
 ecithin,  Tween® 
80, and  Tamol, ]2 (SS). 
 
5.2.3  Bacterial Enumeration Methods  
 
Following sample collection, 10-fold serial dilutions (1 mL sample + 9 mL 
PBW) will be prepared using Butterfield’s phosphate buffered water with 
neutralizers (PBW ). One mL aliquots of appropriate dilutions will be pour -
plated in duplicate using trypticase soy agar containing neutralizers (TSA+N).  
Samples must be plated within 3 0 minutes of collection. After 72 ± 4 hours of 
aerobic incubation at 30 ± 2C, colonies will be counted and viable cells in the 
original sample will be calculated according to Standard Operating Procedures. After incubation, plates may be refrigerated up to [ADDRESS_323515]. The average number of microorganisms recovered 
(CFU/cm
2) of skin for the screening and treatment day baseline samples will 
be calculated using the following formul a to convert the plate CFU values into  
CFU/cm2 of skin:

Answers to the inclusion/exclusion questions (Inclusion/Exclusion CRFs) asked at 
the beginning of the screening and treatment phases will determine compliance to the Subject Instructions (Appendix 14.6) provided to each subject upon study participation. Documentation of the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria shall serve as confirmation of subject compliance with the Subject Instructions.  
 
6. Assessment of Efficacy 
 
6.[ADDRESS_323525] be calculated as log
10 CFU/cm2 changes from baseline, then 
the percentage of successes will be calculated from the log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction s 
(i.e. percent of subjects meeting required reductions = responder rate). A site is 
considered a responder for the treatment at 10 minutes if it achieves ≥ 2.0 log 10 
CFU/cm2 reduction on the abdomen or ≥ 3.0 log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction on the groin.  
 
Responder status will be calculated separately for the abdomen and groin, for each 
test substance, for each post -treatment sample time,  and for each subject. The 
individual responses will then be grouped to generate an overall responder rate for 
each anatomical area , for each test substance, and for each post -treatment sample 
time. The efficacy goal for active products is to have the lower bound of the 95% 
confidence interval for the responder rate to be greater than or equal to 70%.  
 Secondary Endpoint s/Analysis 
 
Responder rates at 30 seconds will be calculated identically to the 10 minute rates. 
At 6 hours a site is considered a responder if it is below baseline; otherwise, 6- hour 
responder rates will be calculated identically to the 10-minute responder rates. The 
secondary efficacy goals are to have the 95% confidence intervals for the responder rates to be greater than or equal to 70% . Log
[ADDRESS_323526] article and the active control should be superior to the 
inactive control at the primary endpoint . The responder rates for both active and 
inactive treatments at 6 hours are near 100%. Therefore, comparison of responder 
rates at 6 hours is unlikely to show any difference. Differences in log
10 CFU/cm2 
reductions from baseline will be calculated for [ADDRESS_323527]:  ZX -ZP-[ADDRESS_323528] Protocol: [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_323529]: 865-[ADDRESS_323530]’s skin condition and assign a skin irritation rating score (see Appendix 14.11).  A skin irritation score will be recorded at both the screening and treatment phases prior to baseline sample collections and prior to 
each post treatment application sample collection (30 seconds, 10 minutes, and 6 
hours).  
   
A corresponding rating score for each individual skin condition, for each site will be recorded in the subject’s CRF. (See Appendix 14.11, which includes the following four independent evaluation categories:  Erythema, Edema, Rash, and Dryness).  
If an irritation score of 1 or greater for any individual skin condition prior to the baseline sample collection (at either the screening or treatment day phases) is 
assigned, the subject will be excluded from the study (no study treatment will be applied).  
 If an irritation score of [ADDRESS_323531] will be discontinued from the study and an adverse event will 
be recorded. See Section 7.3 (Adverse Events).

 Definitions:  
 
Adverse Event/Experience 
 
An Adverse Event/Experience is any unexpected or undesirable experience 
occurring to a subject during  a study, which may or may not be related to the test 
article. All adverse event/experiences will be recorded and reported according to the 
Standard Operating Procedures of the laboratory.  
All adverse events, regardless of severity or the causal/effect relationship, will be recorded. The severity of the effect will be noted as “ Mild, ” “Moderat e,” or “Severe” 
according the following definitions:  
Mild Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated.  
Moderate  Discomfort to a degree as to cause interference with normal daily 
life activities and /or requiring medication.  
Severe  Incapacity with inability to work or do usual daily life activities and 
requiring medical attention/intervention.  
Causal Relations of Adverse Event/Experience  
When determining the causal/effect relationship to the test article, the relationship 
will be described as “ None,”  “Possible,” “Probable,” or  “Definite .” The following 
definitions will be utilized:  
 
  None  No association to the test article. Related to other e tiologies such as 
concomitant medications or conditions or subject’s known clinical 
state.  
 
Possible  Uncertain association. Other etiologies are also possible.  
 
Probable  Clear -cut association with improvement upon withdrawal of the test 
article. Not reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s known clinical 
state  
Definite  An adverse event with a clear -cut temporal association with 
exposure to study materials and cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s known clinical state.  Association with study material is

Serious Adverse Event/Experience 
 
A Serious Adverse Event/Experience is any adverse experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience;  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• An important medical event that may require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent one of the previously listed outcomes.  
Unexpected Adverse Event/Experience 
An Unexpected Adverse Event/Experience is any adverse drug event/experience 
not listed in the current labeling for the test article or the current Investigator’s 
brochure. Where test article labeling or Investigator’s brochure is not avail able, 
anticipated experiences will be based on the known pharmacological/toxicological 
properties of the test article or ingredients. 
 
Recording and Reporting 
 
The Investigator or designee records all adverse events on an Adverse Event 
Record in the subject’s CRF. Documentation includes the AE description, severity, 
seriousness, date of onset and resolution, relationship to the test article, action taken and outcome.  
The Investigator must promptly report all treatment related adverse events to the Sponsor . All serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor and to the IRB 
within 24 hours of the Investigator awareness/notification of the event.  
  If a subject has no adverse event during the study, the absence of such must be recorded on the CRF.  
 
7.4 Follow -up 
 
If an adverse event/experience occurs, the subject under the direction of the     
Investigator (or designee) may be referred to the nearest acute care facility for 
treatment. Serious or Unexpected Drug Event/Experience will be followed to 
resolution. Any adverse event will be documented on an Adverse Event Report.

  8. Statistics  
 
8.1 Data Sets Analyzed  
 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all subjects who pass the pre- test 
period prior to baseline screening and are assigned a subject number for treatment. 
The ITT population (all randomized subjects) will be used for the safety analysis.  
 
 
a Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT)  
Population will be used for analysis and consist of all subjects who have at least one 
site (left or right for abdominal or inguinal) that  passed the treatment day baseline 
and has CFU results for any other sample time for that site. Body sites will be 
included in the mITT population if and only if they meet the treatment day baseline 
criteria. The mITT  data set will be evaluated for efficac y. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_323544] 
and for each of the three non- baseline sites by [CONTACT_266001] 10 CFU/cm2 
values and then subtracting the log 10 CFU/cm2 values for the samples taken after the 
baseline. Therefore, a subject who completes all treatments and passes all baseline 
requirements will have 4 (sites) * 3 (post -application samples per site) = 12 changes 
from baseline reported.  Responder status will be calculated for each reported log 10 
CFU/cm2 reduction. The sites will be considered responders based on the sample 
time and body area:  
 
For the groin at 30 seconds or 10 minutes, a log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction ≥ 3.0 is 
considered a responder. 
 
For the abdomen at 30 seconds or 10 minutes, a log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction ≥ 
2.0 is considered a responder. 
 
For either the groin or the abdomen at 6 hours, a log 10 CFU/cm2 value less 
than baseline (i.e., a log 10 CFU/cm2 reduction > 0)  is considered a responder. 
 
Responder statuses will be grouped by [CONTACT_266002], sample time, and test substance. 
Exact confidence intervals will be calculated for responder rates.  The primary 
efficacy goal is to have the 95% confidence intervals for the responder rate at [ADDRESS_323545]:  ZX -ZP-[ADDRESS_323546] Protocol: [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_323547]: 865-[ADDRESS_323548] - Confidential  
  minutes  to be ≥ 70%. The secondary efficacy goals are to have the 30 second and 6 
hour 95% confidence intervals for the responder rates to be ≥ 70%.  
 
Differences in responder rates between treatments and their confidence intervals will 
be calculated using asymptotic (approximate) methods. If differences in responder 
rates are not reliable based on approximate methods, which happens when rates are 
near either 100% or 0%, log 10 CFU/cm2 confidence intervals for the differences will 
be used for comparison instead.  
 
Two-sided confidence intervals for log 10 CFU/cm2 changes from baseline will also be 
calculated. These calculations will use an ANOVA model with subject as a random 
variable and test substance as a fixed variable. Body area (abdomen or groin) will be 
a fixed variable. Sample times (30 seconds, 10 minutes, or 6 hours)  will be 
calculated separately using identical models . Differences in log 10 CFU/cm2 
reductions will be calculated based on the same model.  
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_323549] who is scored with a 1 or more at any observation [baseline (screening day and treatment day), post -application/prior to 30 second , 10 
minute, or 6 hour  sampling procedures], in any category for any site.    
 Adverse events (including post treatment skin irritation scores of 3 in accordance with Appendix 14.11, will also be summarized. Summary tables 
will present incidence rates of adverse events by [CONTACT_266003]. Listings of adverse events will be 
provided.  
 The statistical significance of differences in skin irritation between the three  
treatments will be evaluated using Fisher’s exact test on skin irritation data summarized as follows: any reaction above zero (no reaction) on the skin irritation rating scale for any category (erythema, edema, rash, and dryness) will be considered a positive signal for that substance. If Fisher’s exact test shows statistically significant skin irritation between the three treatments, a 
secondary analysis will be conducted to determine how the reactions differ.  
 
8.3 Sample Size Justification  
 
The number of subjects for the active treatments  (ZuraPrepTM and the active 
comparator) is based off of the following assumptions: the primary efficacy 
parameters are as defined above; the power is 80%; and the minimum responder 
rate for active substances is 77.8% . Using  for a single

  proportion method, this requires 267 subjects per active treatment. The number 320  
was used to make randomization blocking easier  and to be conservative. 
 
The numbers required for the inactive/negative control  group were based on results 
from . The sample size is designed to be sufficient to show there is 
a significant difference in responder rates between the active substances and 
inactive control at 30 seconds and 10 minutes  and a significant difference in log 10 
CFU/cm2 reductions from baseline at [ADDRESS_323554] Discontinuation Criteria  
 
The Investigator may discontinue individual subjects from the study at any time.  
Subjects may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time. The Investigator will 
provide a written report on the appropriate CRF including the date and reason for discontinuation.     
8.5 Procedures for Accounting for Missing Data  and Protocol Deviations  
 
Missing microbiologic al data at 30 seconds, 10 minutes , or 6 hour s will be reported 
as missing ; if the entire sample is missing the site will be treated as a nonresponder 
for that sample time. These subjects will be included in the mITT  data set based on 
the criteria defined above. Details of any other missing data handling w ill be specified 
in the statistical  analysis.  
 
8.6   Deviations to Statistical Plan  
 
Any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the final report.

  14.10  Procedure for Neutralization Validation  
 
1. Background  
 
The sampling solution, SS, sterile [75mM phosphate buffer (  
) containing  lec i thin,  Tween® 80, and 
 Tamol, ][ADDRESS_323618] on the growth of microorganisms and 
that the active ingredient is inactivated.  The density of normal human skin flora generally ranges from 10
2 to 105 CFU/cm2 
depending on the body site.  However, since significant neutralizer or toxic effects are more easily detected at a lower cell density, the efficacy and toxicity of this neutralizer system will be assessed against a lower bacterial concentration.  
 This is a test where the study materials are applied to the abdomen and the treated areas will be sampled. After sampling, , a selected 
representative of normal skin flora will be added into a portion of each sample. Each sample will then be processed using procedures in accordance with ASTM E1054- 08.  
  
2. Objective  
 
This control assay will determine the ability of the SS to completely neutralize the active ingredients in the test treatments when applied to the abdomen by [CONTACT_266010]- inhibitory 
levels.   
 
3. Subject Entry Criteria  
 
subjects will be used for the neutralization validation required for this study.  Each 
subject must meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 except for the baseline bacterial count, the 72-hour exclusion from 
showering/bathing and the length of the washout period. No minimum bacterial count is required and the washout period is only necessary for 7 days (not 14 days). The subjects will be asked to provide information on demographics and inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign the Consent and Authorization Forms before beginning the 7 -day 
washout period. When the subjects return to begin their participation in the study they will again be asked to provide information relative to inclusion/exclusion criteria.  If they

  meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may be enrolled. The subjects will be 
identified by [CONTACT_110179] “N” for neutralization and a subject number of . 
 
The test, vehicle and reference control articles will be applied to the abdomen regions 
using bila teral applications so that  applications are performed for each treatment 
using bilateral application (a total of  subjects). One area will be located on one 
side of the body and the remaining area on the other side.  
 The treatments per subject will  be randomized. The randomization scheme will be 
generated before the test.

PROTOCOL TITLE:  PHASE II CLINICAL PROTOCOL FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH PREVIOUSLY 
UNTREATED CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LE[LOCATION_006]EMIA WITH FOUR OR SIX CYCLES OF FLUDARABINE AND 
CYCLOSPHOSPHAMIDE WITH RITUXIMAB PLUS LENALIDOMIDE FOLLOWED BY [CONTACT_711668]/MAINTENANCE  
DATE PROTOCOL FINAL:  June 22, 2012 
INDICATION: Untreated CLL 
STUDY PHASE:  2 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:  In previously -untreated subjects with CLL, fludarabine and rituximab with or without 
cyclophosphamide (FR or FCR) produces complete responses  (CR)  of 40 -80%.  The objective of this study is to evaluate 
the minimal residual disease (MRD)  complete response rate (using the 2008 IWCLL guidelines) after [ADDRESS_967978] negative complete responder s (CR) they will stop at 4 cycles of FCR  followed by  [CONTACT_711669]/maintenance arm of the study.  If they have a MRD positive CR or partial response (PR) they 
will continue with 2 additional  cycles of FCR plus lenalidomide  followed by [CONTACT_711670]/maintenance.  They 
will be re -tested for MRD after the 6th cycle of FCR- and after [ADDRESS_967979] 
no response (NR) or progressive disease (PD) following 4 cycles of FCR- plus lenalidomide  they will be removed from the 
study.      
STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary:   
The primary objective is to evaluate the complete response rate following 4 cycles of FCR plus lenalidomide in previously 
untreated patients with CLL.  
Secondary:   
The first secondary objective is to evaluate the toxicity of patients with previously untreated CLL treated with FCR  plus 
lenalidomide , followed by [CONTACT_311409].  The second is to evaluate the overall response rate and overall survival of 
patients with previously untreated CLL treated with FCR  plus lenalidomide followed by [CONTACT_311409].  The third is to 
determine if two additional cycles of FCR plus lenalidomide after [ADDRESS_967980] + to CR MRD - . The fourth objective is  to determine whether adding lenalidomide as a 
consolidation/maintenance  therapy will eliminate bone marrow minimal residual disease in CR patients and whether 
Version Date March 14, [ADDRESS_967981] a PR after 6 cycles of FCR plus lenalidomide  will respond to  12 months of  lenalidomide.  The final 
objective is to determine whether the expression of ZAP -70, CD38, and chromosomes correlate with response rate, 
duration of response, and survival for previously untreated patients with CLL.  
STUDY DESIGN:  
2-stage phase [ADDRESS_967982] 5 CRs  after 4 cycles of FCR plus lenalidomide 
the study will accrue an additional 35 subjects  (see statistical section).  A secondary objective of this study will be to 
determine if MRD positive patients will become MRD negative with lenalidomide consolidation/maintenance  and whether 
PR patients will convert to CR s.  Lenalidomide will begin [ADDRESS_967983] dose of FCR in all subjects with CR.  It 
may begin as soon as 1 month after FCR plus lenalidomide  in subjects with PR.  Lenalidomide is given in 28 d cycles 
increasing the dose from 5 mg/d to 10  mg/d in cycle 2 and to 15mg in cycles 3- 6 if well - tolerated (no grade- 3 or -4 
toxicity ). Patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min and <60ml/min will start at 5 mg every other day  increasing to 5 
and 10mg daily in subsequent  cycles . Reduction to the prior dose is allowed for grade- 3/-[ADDRESS_967984] will be studied 
by [CONTACT_711671] s following 4 and 6 cycles of FCR- and after 6 and 12 
months of lenalidomid e in CR patients .    
 
 
STUDY ENDPOINTS  
Primary : 
Analysis of the P rimary Endpoint: The complete responses will be estimated by [CONTACT_711672]. Ninety -five percent confidence intervals for the true CR will be calculated.  
Toxicity:   
All toxicities that were  determined to be possibly, probably or definitely related to the treatment will be tabulated according 
to grade and type (according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 4 .0). The maximum grade for each type of 
toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns.

   for the true success proportion will be calculated.  Responses will be evaluated after 4  and 6  cycles of FCR plus 
lenalidomide  and after  6 and 12 cycles of  lenalidomide consolidation/ maintenance. The overall survival (OS) is defined as 
the time interval between the treatment starting date and the documented date of death. For a surviving patient, OS is 
censored at the last follow -up date when the patient is documented to be alive. Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined 
as the time interval between the treatment starting date and the documented date of disease progression or death, 
whichever occurs first. For an alive and progression free patient, PFS is censored at the last follow -up date when patient 
is documented to be progression free. The OS and PFS will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method. The median 
survival and the corresponding 95% confidence interval will also be reported. However, given the small sample size, these 
estimates will be largely exploratory in nature. The relation of these endpoints to the expression of ZAP -70, CD38, IgVH 
status and chromosomes will be explored by [CONTACT_711674].  
Monitoring:  
The principal inves tigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study periodically to identify accrual, toxicity, and any 
endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This study will be monitored according to the data and safety monitoring plan that is currently in place, and if necessary will report to the HUMC Data and Safety Monitoring Board for review.

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1. Disease Background  
 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia in the Western world. It is generally 
considered to be incurable with conventional doses of chemotherapy. Until recently there has been little enthusiasm for more aggressive approaches to this often indolent disease. However, with the advent of purine analogues and the 
high complete remission rates they bring, new interest has been kindled in the management of this disorder.  
 
The annual incidence of CLL in the [LOCATION_002] is approximately 10,000 cases/year (1). CLL is considered to be a 
disease of advanced age. The median age of patients at diagnosis is 72. However, increasingly younger patients are 
being diagnosed with this disorder (2). CLL is more common in males than in females (3). With the advent of “routine” 
blood tests, many patients are now being dia gnosed while still asymptomatic. The most common complaints of 
symptomatic patients are fatigue, weight loss, fevers, frequent bacterial and viral infections, and increased tendency 
to bleed. On physical examination lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are oft en found. Laboratory evaluation 
reveals an excess of mature appearing lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. These leukemic cells have a 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_711645], but characteristic, B cell immunophenotype. The patient may also have thrombocytopenia 
and anemi a. 
 
The diagnosis of CLL is made by a combination of morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria. Different diagnostic 
criteria have been set forth by [CONTACT_711675]. The National Cancer Institute- sponsored working group 
produced guidelines for CLL cl inical protocols. Their diagnostic criteria require that leukemic cells appear mature 
(morphologically resembling small lymphocytes) and that no more than 55% be prolymphocytes. The leukemic cells 
express an abnormal phenotype characteristic of CLL: co-express B cell antigens, such as CD19 and CD20, with CD5 
the T -cell antigen and have low density CD20 and slg on the cell surface. Other criteria include a minimal absolute 
lymphocyte count of 5,000/mm3, a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_711646] ~ 30% of all nucleated cells are lymphoid, 
and the exclusion of other lymphoproliferative disorders (4).  
 
The Rai staging criteria, as originally proposed, grouped patients on the presence or absence of lymphadenopathy (Stage I), splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly (Stage II),  anemia (Stage III), or thrombocytopenia (Stage IV). Patients 
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 8 of 57 
   with only a lymphocytosis were classified Stage 0 (5). The original Rai system was later modified to reduce the 
number of stages from five to three, without altering its prognostic capabilities (6). 
 
Patients with a good prognosis (Rai Stage 0) have a median survival of more than 12.5 years while intermediate risk 
patients (Rai Stage I and II) have worse prognosis with a median survival of less than 8 years. High risk patients (Rai 
Stage III and IV) have an expected survival of between 1.5 and 2.5 years (5, 7).  
 
Other prognostic indicators include: absolute blood lymphocyte count, bone marrow histological patterns, 
cytogenetics, lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), lactate dehydrogenase levels, beta -2 microglobulin, lymphocyte 
morphological subtypes, age, sex, and response to treatment (8, 9).  Patients with LDT of [ADDRESS_967993] a 
significantly worse prognosis than patients with a longer LDT (10).  Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin heavy 
chain variable region (IgVH) genes is seen in about 50% of patients and have a more favorable prognosis compared 
to patients who have leukemic cells with unmutated IgVH genes (11- 14). Expression of ZAP- 70 is associated with 
IgVH  mutations , with ZAP -70 exp ression often correlated with unmutat ed IgGVH , and may also be an independent 
prognostic marker (15).  Trisomy 12 and 17p (p53) chromosomal deletion also correlated with poor prognosis (16 -18).  
Expression of CD38 on CLL cells has also been associated with a poor prognosis(19).  
 
While partially related to stage, the pattern of infiltration of the bone marrow reflects the total burden of disease. 
Patients with a diffuse pattern (vs. nodular or interstitial) have a less favorable prognosis (20, 21). A high absolute 
blood lymphocyte count, high LDH, older age, male gender, increased percentage of prolymphocytes, and poor 
response to treatment also portend a poor prognosis. These prognostic indicators are more useful in early stage disease where there appears to be a subgroup of patients who have prolonged periods without disease progression. 
Efforts have been made to define a group of patients with “smoldering CLL” who have a prognosis that approximates that of the general population. Criteria that have been identified include peripheral blood lymphocyte doubling time greater than 12 months; non- diffuse bone marrow infiltration; absolute lymphocyte count <30 x 109/mm3 and 
hemoglobin >13 g/dL (8, 22).  
  
 
 
1.2. Treatment  
 As CLL remains largely an incurable disease, tr eatment will usually be initiated with palliative intent, and therefore, 
should not necessarily begin at the time of diagnosis. Studies to date have not demonstrated an improvement in survival with early intervention when compared to treating later in the course of the disease (23). In general, treatment 
should begin when the patient becomes symptomatic or there is evidence of frank progression of disease. As outlined 
above, symptoms include fever, excessive fatigue, weight loss, and symptomatic enlargement  of either lymph nodes 
or spleen. These symptoms are all relative indications for treatment and the urgency for initiating therapy will depend 
on the magnitude of the symptoms. For instance, minor well -tolerated lymphadenopathy does not mandate treatment. 
Infections are common in CLL and, consequently, may not necessarily be an indication to start cytotoxic therapy. In fact, patients having difficulty with recurrent infections as a consequence of disease -induced hypogammaglobulinemia 
may benefit from infusi onal therapy with intravenous gamma globulin. However, impaired bone marrow function, as 
evidenced by [CONTACT_108659], thrombocytopenia, or granulocytopenia caused by [CONTACT_711676]. Other life- threatening events include lymphadenopathy that compromises vital 
organs, autoimmune destruction of either platelets or red cells, and transformation of the CLL to a more aggressive 
malignancy. Finally, if patients are considering enrollment in an investigational therapeutic trial (e.g., bone marrow 
transplantation following cytotoxic therapy), treatment might be initiated earlier.  
 
Previously, chlorambucil has been considered the standard treatment for CLL. This choice has come about after initial 
studies demonstr ated improved response rates but no improvement in survival for chlorambucil and prednisone over 
single agent chlorambucil alone. Subsequent trials comparing chlorambucil and prednisone to other forms of 
combination chemotherapy (COP, CVP, CMP, CHOP) failed to demonstrate a significant improvement in survival with 
these more intensive and toxic regimens, even though they were able to demonstrate improved response rates (10, 
22, 24, 25- 27). The standard treatment recommendations are again being challenged wi th the advent of the 
nucleoside analogues.  
 
Fludarabine appears the most promising of this new class of drugs. Fludarabine monophosphate is the 2- fluoro, 5’ -
phosphate derivative of the anti -leukemic agent 9- B-D-arabinofuranosyl adenine (ara -A). Its intrace llular metabolic 
product F -ara-ATP suppresses DNA synthesis by [CONTACT_711677]. 
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 9 of 57 
   Grever et al. demonstrated the activity of fludarabine in previously treated CLL patients. Greater than 50% of the 
patients showed clinical improvement (28). Subsequent reports confirmed the activity of this agent in CLL (29). 
Response rates in previously untreated patients approximate 70% (29, 30). In addition, a preliminary report of a 
randomized clinical trial comparing chlorambuci l with fludarabine indicates a superior complete response rate with 
fludarabine (27% vs. 3%) but was not associated with improved survival (31).  
 
There is limited experience of multidrug combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_711647]. While the addition of 
prednisone to chlorambucil may increase the response rates when compared to the single agent, there was  no 
advantage to adding prednisone to fludarabine (32). There is also a report of an increase in atypi[INVESTIGATOR_95908], 
predominantly listeriosis or P neumocystis carinli pneumonia (PCP), in patients treated with fludarabine in combination 
with prednisone (32, 33). These infections have not been noted to the same extent in patients who were treated with 
fludarabine alone.  
 
There is laboratory data to sug gest that fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is a worthwhile combination with 
synergistic tumor killing when leukemia cells taken from patients with CLL are exposed to this combination in vitro 
(NCI Consensus conference). In a thymidine uptake assay, these i nvestigators have demonstrated that the DNA 
repair that normally occurs after exposure to cyclophosphamide is blocked by [CONTACT_711678]. Fludarabine is known to 
inhibit DNA polymerase which is needed for DNA repair. Studies  have shown enhanced cytotoxicit y of alkylating 
agents and decreased DNA repair with other nucleoside analogs (34, 35).  Clinical st uides have documented activity  
of FC (36, 37).  
 
Rituximab as a single agent has modest activity in CLL (38 -42).  No dose- limiting effects were observed in P hase I/II 
studies.  Reported adverse events including fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, and mild hypotension, 
occurred primarily during rituximab infusions and typi[INVESTIGATOR_711648] a sl ower rate.  Other adverse events included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and asthenia.   
 
Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions, including arrhythmia and angina, have had recurrences of these cardiac 
events during rituximab infusions.  Although rare,  tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in postmarketing studies 
and is characterized in patients with a high number of circulating malignant cells (>25,000 ul) by [CONTACT_711679], renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia.  In rare 
cases, severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock have occurred (4 -7/10,000 patients or 0.04- 0.07%.)  Nearly 
all fatal infusion- related events occurred in association with the first infusion.  The following immune serious adverse 
events have been reported to occur rarely (<0.1%) in patients following completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disor ders of blood vessels (vasculitis, serum sickness and lupus -like syndrome), lung disorders including pleuritis and 
scarring of the lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), eye disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis), and severe bullous skin reactions (including tox ic epi[INVESTIGATOR_409087]) that may result in fatal outcomes.  Patients may have 
these symptoms alone or in combination with rash and polyarthritis.  
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some 
patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.  The majority of patients received rituximab in 
combination with chemotherapy.  The median time to the diagnosis of hepatitis was approximately [ADDRESS_967994] causal relationship between rituximab 
and HBV viral reactivation has not been established.  
 
The combination of fludarabine and rituximab demonstrated excellent responses in a phase 2 randomized study of 104 patients. There were 28% and 47% complete responses in the sequential and combined arms respectively (58).  
Combining rituximab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide suggest that the three drug combination has ever 
greater activit y in patients with CLL than the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or fludarabine and 
rituximab.  Data from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center report complete responses of 58% and overall responses of 
94% ( 59).  These  data were confirmed by [CONTACT_711680] (GCLLSG) and FCR was approved by [CONTACT_711681]/refractory disease (60) . Recent 
data published by [CONTACT_711682],  suggest that low dose fludarabine and cyclophosphamide can be combined with 
rituximab to minimize hematologic toxicity with a comparable response rate and dur ation of response to standard 
dose FCR (74).

   Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulating drug with antitumor activity approve d by [CONTACT_711683].(43- 47)  Lenalidomide downregulates tumor 
necrosis factor -ά(48), alters  tumor microenvironment(49), activates T cells(50, 51), enhances antibody -dependent 
cytotoxicity(50, 52), and upregulates select tumor suppressor genes.(53)  Forty -five relapsed/refractory CLL patients 
were treated with 25mg of daily oral lenalidomide days 1 through 21 of a 28 day cycle.(54)  The overall response rate 
was 47% with 9% complete responses.  Grade 3/4 fatigue, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were seen in 10%, 
45% and 70% of patients, respectively.  A flare reaction consisting of pain, swelling and erythema at the sites of disease was seen in 58% of patients and was grade 3/4 in 8%.  Onset was typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] [ADDRESS_967995] dose 
with a median dur ation of 14 days.  In another study, 44 relapsed/refractory patients were treated with lenalidomide at 
5mg daily with dose escalation up to 25mg daily.(55)  An overall response rate of 32% with 7% complete remissions.  
Myelosuppression was the most common toxicity with grade 3/4 neutropenia in 41% of courses and grade 3/4 
thrombocytopenia in 16% of courses.  Tumor flare reactions were seen in 10% of courses which responded to a 6 day 
course of steroids.  In another study four patients with relapsed CLL treated with lenalidomide at 25mg/day had unacceptable toxicity with severe tumor flare in 3 patients and sepsis and renal failure in the fourth.(56)  Lenalidomide 
has also been studied in previously untreated CLL patients.  Two preliminary reports initiated s ingle agent therapy at 5 
and 5mg daily with dose escalation to 25mg daily for 21 days of a 28 day cycle.(56, 57)  Partial responses were 
reported in 65% of patients in one study  (57) and 54% in  the other study (56). Toxicity were manageable 
myelosuppression  and tumor flare in both studies.  
 
Due to activity demonstrated in the relapsed / refractory setting as well as its proposed novel mechanisms of activity, 
lenalidomide has been studied in combination in the relapsed/refractory and front line settings  with promising results. 
Lenalidomide has been studied in combination with fludarabine and rituximab in two recent studies. In one study 
toxicity was excessive when lenalidomide began on day 1 of chemo- immu notherapy (61) however in another Phase 
I/II study when the lenalidomide was initiated on day 8 of the cycle,  toxicity was acceptable (62) and activity was 
notable.  When lenalidomide was initiated on day 8 of therapy in combination with FR the ORR was 83% in 6 patients. 
Lenalidomide has also been studied in com bination with cyclophospamide and fludarabine in the relapsed setting 
(FCL). Using the FCL regimen, lenalidomide was given on days 1- 14 of each cycle with an ORR of 67% and a  
maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide of 5mg (63 ) per day.  
 
Our expectations of therapy in CLL have increased because the more active regimens have shown that CR with 
eradication of MRD is possible.  MRD -negative remissions have been observed after auto -HSCT, (6 4) alemt uzumab 
(65) and chemotherapy (66).  In all of these series, MRD -negative patients survive longer than MRD - positive patients.  
 
Quantitative assessment  of MRD in [ADDRESS_967996] (67 ).  Four -color flow cytometry showed that a low MRD was correlated with 
longer PFS regardless of treatment.  The FCR regimen had lower median MRD compared with FC, resulting in longer 
PFS.  Several clinical studies have also suggested that eradication of MRD may improve PFS, treatment -free survival 
and possibly OS (59,66,68 ), 
 
Another issue that has not been addressed is length of treatment required with the FCR regimen.  Two  trials have  
addressed dose of FCR suggesting that  lower  doses may be better tol erated and maintain efficacy (69, 70).  
Decreasing the cycles  of FCR may be possible with similar efficacy.  In this trial we will decrease the cy cles of FCR 
from [ADDRESS_967997] negative after 4 cycles . 
 
In this proposed trial  to minimize the potential for hematologic toxicity , FCR will be combined with lenalidomide using 
the schedule proposed by [CONTACT_711682] (74).  Cycle 1 will include rituximab given slowly on day 1 at 375 mg/m2 and 500 
and 500 mg/m2 on day 14 while fludarabine will be given at 2 0 mg/m2 and cyclophos phamide at 150 mg/m2 on days 
2-4.  The fludarabine and cyclophosphamide will be given at the above doses every four weeks on days 1 -3, 
immediately preceded by [CONTACT_4124].  Additionally rituximab will be administered  at 500 mg/m2 (cycle 2 -6) with 
subsequent c ycles. Based on previous work,  lenalidomide will begin in cycle 1 day s 8 – 28 at a 5mg  dose to be 
escalated to 10mg in cycle 2 and a maximum of 15mg in cycles 3 - 6 if there was no grade 3 or 4 toxicity at the prior 
dose.  Following FCR patients will receiv e 12 months of lenalidomide.  FISH panel will include the common recurrent 
CLL genetic abnormalities including 11q, 6q, trisomy 12, 13q, and 17p (p53).   All patients will have bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_711649].  Flow cytometry will be used to study bone marrow and peripheral blood for minimal residual disease.   
Version Date March 14, [ADDRESS_967998] used 6 cycles of chemoimmunotherapy for previously untreated CLL patients  (59, 68, 69) .  There 
exists no data r egarding reducing the cycles of chemoimmunotherapy to reduce exposure to cytotoxic agents  and 
minimum data combining lenalidomide sequentially in the induction therapy .  All of the patients who enter ed a CR 
responded quickly yet none of the studies to date have carefully evaluated patients for response prior to the 
completion of [ADDRESS_967999]+

studies followed by [ADDRESS_968000]+ 
CR patients and a proportion of the PR patients should respond to lenalidomide.   The International Worksho p on CLL 
criteria for treatment initiation and evaluation of respons e will be used in this study (71).

day of a 28 day -cycle  
 
Patients started with a reduced 5mg every other day lenalidomide dose due to baseline calculated creatinine 
clear ance ≥ 30ml/min but < 60ml/min within [ADDRESS_968008] their lenalidomide dose increased at the start of subsequent treatment cycles, if they tolerated the prior 
treatment cycle without requiring dose modifications, interruptions or delays due to toxicity.   For patients who initiate 
therapy at a 5mg every other day lenalidomide dose may increase to 5mg daily in cycle 2 and 10mg daily in cycles 3 -
12 if no grade 3/4 toxicities are observed in prior c ycles.  
The lenalidomide dose may only be increased at the start of a new cycle of therapy, may only be increased once 
every 28 days (or less frequently), and may only be increased if the prior treatment cycle was completed without 
requiring dose modificati ons, interruptions or delays due to toxicity.  The maximum allowable dose is lenalidomide 
15mg daily on Days 1 -28 of a 28- day cycle  or 10 mg daily for patients with cc ≥ 30 ml/min and ≤ 60 ml/min .

   7.0 STUDY DRUG  
7.1. Rituximab  
Rituximab is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative- free liquid concentrate for intravenous (IV) administration. 
Rituximab is supplied at a concentration of 5mg/mL in either 100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single- use vials. The 
product is formulated for intravenous administration in 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride, 7.35mg/mL sodium citrate 
dihydrate, 0.7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, and Sterile Water for injection. The pH is adjusted to 6.5.  
 
7.1.1.  Stability & Storage:  Rituximab vials are stable at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F).  Do not use beyond expi[INVESTIGATOR_334166]. Rituximab vials should be protected from direct sunlight.  
 
The sponsor -investigator of the trial is responsible for the maintenance of complete and accurate records of 
the receipt, dispensation, and disposal or return of all trial drug in accordance with Code of Federal 
Regulations, institutional standard operating procedures and Genentec h requirements.  
 
7.1.2.  Dosage & Administration:   
 
 Usual Dose:  The approved and accepted dosage of rituximab is 500mg/m2 given as an IV infusion once 
weekly for four doses (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). In this study rituximab is given at 375 mg/m2 for only the day 1  
dose and thereafter will be given at 500 mg/m2. Refer to protocol section 6.0 for treatment design details.   
Rituximab may be administered in an outpatient setting. DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  
 
Preparation for Administration: Use appropriate aseptic technique. Withdraw the necessary amount of 
rituximab and dilute to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL into an infusion bag containing either 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride USP or 5% Dextrose in Water USP. Gently invert the bag to mix the solution. Discard any 
unused portion left in the vial. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for  particulate matter 
and discoloration prior to administration. Rituximab solutions for infusion are stable at 2°  to 8°C (36° to 
46°F) for [ADDRESS_968014] been observed.  
 
Administration:  DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS. Hypersensitivity 
reactions may occu r. Premedications, consisting of acetaminophen and diphenhydramine, should be 
considered before each infusion of rituximab. Premedication may attenuate infusion- related events. Since 
transient hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding anti-hypertensive medications [ADDRESS_968015] Infusion: The rituximab solution for infusion should be administered intravenously at an initi al rate of 50 
mg/hr. Rituximab should not be mixed or diluted with other drugs. If hypersensitivity or infusion- related 
events do not occur, escalate the infusion rate in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 
400 mg/hr.  
 
Rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions.  In most cases, the infusion can be resumed 
at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., from 100mg/hr to 50mg/hr ) when symptoms have completely resolved.  
Treatment of infusion -related symptoms with diphenhydramine and ac etaminophen is recommended. 
Additional treatment with bronchodilators or IV saline may be indicated.  Most patients who have experienced non- life-threatening infusion- related reactions have been able to complete the full course of 
rituximab therapy.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_53311], antihistamines and corticosteroids should be available for immediate use in 
the event of a hypersensitivity reaction to rituximab (e.g., anaphylaxis).  
 
Subsequent Infusions: Subsequent rituximab infusions can be administered at an initial rate of 100 mg/hr, 
and increased by 100 mg/hr increments at 30- minute intervals, to a maximum of 400 mg/hr as tolerated.  
 
7.1.3.  Over dosage 
There has been no experience with over dosage  in human clinical trials. Single doses higher than 
500mg/m2 have not been tested in c ontrolled studies.  
 
7.1.4.  Safety Profile  
 
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 18 of 57 
   No dose- limiting effects were observed in the Phase I/II studies.   Reported adverse events including fever, 
chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, rhinitis, and mild hypotension, occurred primarily during rituximab 
infusio ns and typi[INVESTIGATOR_598329] a slower rate.   Other 
adverse events included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, asthenia, other hematologic events, cardiac and 
cardiopulmonary events, and tumor lysis syndrome.  
 
Fatal Infusion Reactions: Severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including angioedema, hypoxia, 
pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock, 
have been reported.  These severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_711651] 
30-120 minutes.  
 
Mucocutaneous Reactions:   Severe bullous skin reactions, including fatal cases of toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_7387], have been reported rarely in patients treated with rituximab.   Paraneoplastic pemphigus has 
been reported very rarely in NHL and CLL patients undergoing chemotherapy plus rituximab treatment.   The 
onset of reaction has varied from 1 to 13 weeks following rituximab exposure.  
 
Cardiac Events:   Patients with preexisting cardia c conditions, including arrhythmia and angina, have had 
recurrences of these cardiac events during rituximab infusions.  
 
Cardiopulmonary Events:   In rare cases, severe and fatal cardiopulmonary events, including hypoxia, 
pulmonary infiltrates, acute respir atory distress syndrome, myocardial infarction, and cardiogenic shock, 
have occurred (4- 7/10,000 patients or 0.04- 0.07%.)   Nearly all fatal infusion -related events occurred in 
association with the first infusion.  
 
Renal Events:   Rituximab has been associat ed with severe renal toxicity including acute renal failure 
requiring dialysis, and in some cases has lead to death.   Renal toxicity has occurred in patients with high 
numbers of circulating malignant cells (>25,000/mm2) or high tumor burden who experience tumor lysis 
syndrome.    
 
Hematologic Events:   In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated 
with rituximab; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%) .  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 days) and of 
neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days).   A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red 
cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following Ritu ximab therapy were reported.  
 
In addition, there have been a limited number of post marketing reports of prolonged pancytopenia, marrow 
hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia (defined as occurring [ADDRESS_968016] dose of rituximab) in patients with hematologic malignancies.   In reported cases of late onset neutropenia (NCI -CTC Grade 3 and 
4), the median duration of neutropenia was 10 days (range 3 to 148 days).   Documented resolution of the 
neutropenia was described in approximately one -half of the reported cases; of those with documented 
recovery, approximately half received growth factor support.   In the remaining cases, information on 
resolution was not provided.   More than half of the reported cases of delayed onset neutropenia occurred in 
patients who had undergone a prior autologous bone marrow transplantation.   In an adequately designed, 
controlled, clinical trial, the reported incidence of NCI -CTC Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in 
patients receiving rituximab in combination with fludarabine as compared to those receiving fludarabine alone (76% [39/51] vs. 39% [21/53]).  
 
Tumor Lysis Syndrome:   Although rare, tumor lysis syndrome has been reported in post marketing studies 
and is characterized in patients with a high number of circulating malignant cells (>25,000 ul) by [CONTACT_334230], renal insufficiency, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and 
hyperphosphatemia.  
 
Infectious Events: Rituxan induced B -cell depletion in 70% to 80% of patients with NHL and was associat ed 
with decreased serum immunoglobulins in a minority of patients; the lymphopenia lasted a median of 14 
days (range, 1- 588 days).  Infectious events occurred in 31% of patients: 19% of patients had bacterial 
infections, 10% had viral infections, 1% had fungal infections, and 6% were unknown infections.  Serious 
infectious events (Grade 3 or 4), including sepsis, occurred in 2% of patients.  
 
Immunization: Response rates may be reduced with non live vaccines.

Hepatitis B Reactivation:   Hepatitis B virus (HB V) reactivation with fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and 
death has been reported in some patients with hematologic malignancies treated with rituximab.   The 
majority of patients received rituximab in combination with chemotherapy.   The median time to the diagnosis 
of hepatitis was approximately four months after the initiation of rituximab and approximately one month 
after the last dose.  
 
Other Serious Viral Infections: The following additional serious viral infections, either new, reactivated or 
exac erbated, have been identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. The majority of patients 
received Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. 
These viral infections included JC virus , progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [PML]), 
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, varicella zoster virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis 
C. In some cases, the viral infections occurred up to one year following discontinuation of Rituxan and ha ve 
resulted in death.  
 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML is a rare disease caused by [CONTACT_711689].   Immunosuppression allows reactivation of the JC virus which causes 
demyelination and destruction of oligodendrocytes resulting in death or severe disability.   Rare cases of 
PML, some resulting in death, have been reported in patients with hematologic malignancies who have 
received rituximab.   The majority of these patients had received rituximab in combi nation with chemotherapy 
or as part of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Cases of PML resulting in death have also been reported 
following the use of rituximab for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The reported cases had multiple risk factors for PML, including the underlying disease and long- term immunosuppressive therapy or 
chemotherapy. Most cases of PML were diagnosed within [ADDRESS_968017], brain MRI, and lumbar puncture should be considered as clinically 
indicated.  In patients who develop PML, rituximab should be discontinued and reductions or discontinuation 
of any concomitant chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy should be considered.  
 
Bowel Obstruction and Perforation: Abdominal pain, bowel obstruction and perforation, in some cases 
leading to death, were observed in patients receiving Rituxan in combination with chemotherapy  for DLBCL. 
In post -marketing reports, which include both patients with low -grade or follicular NHL and DLBCL, the 
mean time to ons et of symptoms was 6 days (range 1−77) in patients with documented gastro- intestinal 
perforation. Complaints of abdominal pain, especially early in the course of treatment, should prompt a 
thorough diagnostic evaluation and appropriate treatment.  
 
Immunogenicity: Patients may develop a human anti -chimeric antibody (HACA) response with rituximab 
treatment. The clinical significance of this is unclear.  
 
Pregnancy: B-cell lymphocytopenia generally lasting less than 6 months can occur in infants exposed to 
rituximab in utero.  
 
Additional Safety Signals:   The following immune serious adverse events have been reported to occur rarely 
(<0.1%) in patients following completion of rituximab infusions: arthritis, disorders of blood vessels (vasculitis, serum sickness a nd lupus -like syndrome), lung disorders including pleuritis and scarring of the 
lung (bronchiolitis obliterans), eye disorders (uveitis and optic neuritis), and severe bullous skin reactions 
(including toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_598330]) that may result in fatal outcomes.   Patients may have 
these symptoms alone or in combination with rash and polyarthritis.

   7.2.10.  Nursing Implications  
It is recommended that the following precautions be taken:  
 Check CBC and platelet counts, particularly with cumulative  drug doses.  
 Premedicate with antiemetics.  
 Monitor for stomatitis, refer for oral health assessment if indicated.  
 Observe patient for CNS toxicity (vision changes, confusion, etc.).  
 Antic ipate tumor lysis syndrome in patients with bulky disease.  
 Monitor pulmonary function, especially in patients who have received chlorambucil.  
 
7.3. Cyclophosphamide  
 
7.3.1.  Other names  
 
Cytoxan, CTX, CPM, Neosar.  
 
7.3.2.  Classification  
 
Alkylating agent.  
 
7.3.3.  Mode of Action  
 
Cyclophosphamide prevents cell division primarily by [CONTACT_12783] -linking DNA strands. The cell continues to 
synthesize other cell constituents (RNA and protein), an imbalance occurs and the cell dies. 
Cyclophosphamide is considered cell cycle phase non- specific.  
 
7.3.4.  Storage and Stability  
 
Tablets and injectable powder are stored at room temperature. The temperature is not to exceed 90°F. 
Reconstituted parenteral solutions are stable for 24 hours at room temperature or 14 days if refrigerated.  
  
7.3.5.  Preparation  
 
Dissolve  the 100 mg, 200 mg, 500 mg, I gm, and 2 gm vials in 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ml of sterile water, 
respectively, resulting in a solution of 20 mg/mI. Shake vials vigorously and warm slightly in lukewarm water 
to facilitate dissolution. The lyophilized form i s more easily solubilized.  
 
7.3.6.  Administration  
 
IV infusion over 1 hour  
 
7.3.7.  Compatibilities  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Barbiturates, phenytoin, and chloral hydrate may increase the rate of hepatic conversion of 
cyclophosphamide to active metabolites, although the clinical importance of these interactions has not 
been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Corticosteroids may inhibit metabolism and reduce the effect of cyclophosphamide, although the 
clinical importance of this interaction has not been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  May prolong the neuromuscular blocking activity of  succinylcholine.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Imipramine and phenothiazines may reduce cyclophosphamide metabolism, increasing bone marrow 
suppression.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Possible potentiation of doxorubicin and daunorubicin cardiotoxicity.

   [IP_ADDRESS].  Cyclophosphamide (6 -8 mg/mI) and doxorubicin (0.4 -0.6 mg/m I) are compatible for 7 days at room  
temperature  
 
7.3.8.  Availability  
 
Commercially available.  
 
7.3.9.  Side Effects  
 Hematologic: Leukopenia, with nadirs about 8 -14 days after administration and recovery in 18- 25 
days; spares platelets.  
 
 Dermatologic: Alopecia.  
 
 Gastroi ntestinal: Nausea and vomiting (begins 6 -10 hours after administration).  
 
 Hepatic: Increased AST, ALT.  
 
 Neurologic: Headache, dizziness.  
 
 Pulmonary: Rarely Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.  
 Cardiovascular: Cardiac necrosis with high- dose cyclophosphamide.

SIADH, dose related, more common with single large doses greater than 2 gm/m2. 
 
 Other: Metallic taste during injection; nasal congestion; testicular atrophy, amenorrhea, may be long- term; rarely, anaphylaxis; teratogenic; may cause secondary neoplasms.  
 
7.3.10.  Nursing Implications  
 It is recommended that the following precautions be taken:  
 
 Monitor CBC, platelet counts.  
 
 Assess hydration and fluid balance. Patients receiving larger doses should force fluids up to 2 
liters/day for 72 hours after administration. Patient should void q 2- 3 hours to facilitate emptying 
of bladder.  
 
 A baseline 12 lead ECG may be obtained prior to high -dose therapy.  
 
 Premedicate with antiemetic s. 
 
 Advise patient of potential “metallic taste.”  Hard candy with a strong flavor may alleviate this side 
effect.  
 
7.4. Lenalidomide  
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti -angiogenic 
properties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3 -(4-amino -1-oxo 1,3- dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510] -2,6-dione and it has 
the following chemical structure:

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_711653] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 259.3.  
 
Lenalidomide is an off-white to pale- yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic solvent/water mixtures, and 
buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in organic solvent s and low pH solutions. Solubility was 
significantly lower in less acidic buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric 
carbon atom and can exist as the optically active forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture with 
a net optical rotation of zero.  
 
7.5. Clinical Pharmacology  
 Mechanism of Action:  
 
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide possesses 
immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro- inflammatory 
cytokines and increased the secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  
Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but not all cell lines.  Of cell 
lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line 
with a deletion of one chromosome 5) but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG -1 cells (human 
myeloblastic cell line, al so with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 5 
deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro.  
 
7.6. Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism:  
 
Absorption:  
 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_711654] 0.[ADDRESS_968018] -dose.  
Co-administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does reduce the maximal plasma 
concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC 
increase proportionately with increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose- regimen does not 
result in drug accumulation.  
Pharmacokinet ic sampling in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients was not performed. In multiple myeloma 
patients maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.[ADDRESS_968019] -dose both on Days 1 and 28.  
AUC and Cmax values increase proportionally with dose following single and multiple doses. Exposure (AUC) in 
multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
 
Distribution:  
 
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%.  
 
Metabolism and Excretion:   
 The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, approximately two-
thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through urinary excretion. The process exceeds the glomerular 
filtration rate and therefore is partial ly or entirely active.  Half -life of elimination is approximately [ADDRESS_968020]® 
program.  
 
7.8. Dosage form  
 
Lenalidomide will be supplied as 5mg and [ADDRESS_968021] caution statement as follows:  Caution: New drug - Limited by 
[CONTACT_44505].  The drug label must be clearly visible.  Additional labels mus t not cover the 
Celgene label.  
 
7.10.1 Prescribing Information  
 
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) will be provided to research subjects for the duration of their participation in this trial 
at no charge to them or their insurance providers.  Lenalidomide will be provided in accordance with accordance 
with the RevAssist® program of Celgene Corporation. Per standard RevAssist® requirements all physicians who 
prescribe lenalidomide for research subjects enrolled into this trial, and all research subjects enrolled into this 
trial, must be registered in and must comply with all requirements of the RevAssist® Program.  Prescriptions must be filled within 7days for females of childbearing potential and [ADDRESS_968022] sunlight and protected from excessive heat and cold.

7.14   
Drug dispensing requirements  
In investigational studies,  lenalidomide will be dispensed through a qualified healthcare professional (including but 
not limited to, nurses, pharmacists and physicians).   These healthcare professionals will be trained by [CONTACT_711690].  Once trained these healthcare staff will counsel subjects prior 
to medication being dispensed to ensure that the subject has complied with all requirements including use of birth 
control and pregnancy testing (FCBP) and that the subject understands the risks associated with lenalidomide.   
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 25 of 57 
   Counseling includes verification with the patient that required pregnancy testing was preformed and results were 
negat ive. A  Lenalidomide Information Sheet  (see Appendix  IV) will be supplied with each medication dispense.  
 
Pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential.  A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a sexually 
mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 
consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 c onsecutive months).  
 
Pregnancy tests must occur within 10 – [ADDRESS_968023] 28 days and 
then every 28 days while on lenalidomide therapy (including breaks in therapy); at discontinuation of lenalidomide 
and at Day [ADDRESS_968024] 28 days and then every  14 days while on lenalidomide therapy (including breaks in

Testing for Hepatitis  B includes: Hepatitis B surface antigen, surface antibody, and core antibody  
At a minimum, for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) monitoring purposes, subjects will have chemistry assessments weekly 
during at least the first [ADDRESS_968037] week of escalating, re- escalating or re-
initiating lenalidomide therapy.  
For subjects who do not experience any abnormalities in serum chemistry assessments for 2 consecutive cyc les while on 
a stable lenalidomide dose (without escalation or interruption) throughout these 2 cycles, the timing of chemistry 
assessments may be reduced to Day 1 and Day 15 in subsequent cycles . See section 12.3.3 for tumor lysis prophylaxis 
guidance.  
4 Urine/serum p regnancy tests for females of childbearing potential.  A female of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a  sexually 
mature female who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal  for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive 
months).  Pregnancy tests must occur within 10 – 14 days and again within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide 
(prescriptions must be filled within 7 day s).  FCBP with regular or no menstruation must have a pregnancy test weekly for 
the first 28 days and then every 28 days while on therapy (including breaks in therapy); at discontinuation of lenalidomide and at Day [ADDRESS_968038] 28 days and then every 14 days while on therapy (including breaks in therapy), at discontinuation of lenalidomide and at Day [ADDRESS_968039] dose of lenalidomide (see Appendix: Risks of Fetal Exposure,

12.0 DOSE MODIFICATION & TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
 
12.1.  Dose Modifica tion for Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide  
The dose modifications listed belo w refer to both fludarabine and c yclophosphamide. It is important to remember the 
following stipulations.  
A. Dose re -escalation after downward modification will not be permitted.  
B. The investigator should grade and report adverse  events according  to the Common Toxicity Criteria (version 
4.0). 
 
12.1.1.  Hematologic Toxicity  
 
Dose modifications should be based on the nadir of the patient’s platelet  count  and/or absolute neutrophil 
count  (mature pol ys + bands)  obtained immediately prior to the next planned treatment . There will be no 
dosage reduction for decreases in hemoglobin concentration.  
 
Adjustments for changes in the platelet count.

Patients who develop autoimmune hemolytic anemia, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, or other 
autoimmune disorders should discontinue protocol treatment.  
 
12.1.8.  Other Toxicity  
 
Patients who develop any other grade 3 toxicities not listed above, should receive 75% of fludarabine and 
cyclop hosphamide. Patients who develop any other grade [ADDRESS_968042] 
resolved.  In the event of severe or life -threatening anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue 
the patient from the treatment phase.  Do not  retreat with Rituximab.  
Carriers of hepatitis B should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory signs of active HBV infection 
and for signs of hepatitis throughout their study participation.  
Hematologic Events:   In clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated 
with RITUXAN; these include: lymphopenia (40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range 1 to 588 days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range 2 to 116 days).  A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure 
red cell aplasia) and two occurrences of hemolytic anemia following RITUXAN therapy were reported.  
In addition, there have been a limited number of post marketing reports of prolonged p ancytopenia, 
marrow hypoplasia, and late onset neutropenia (defined as occurring [ADDRESS_968043] dose of 
RITUXAN) in patients with hematologic malignancies.  In reported cases of late onset neutropenia (NCI -
CTC Grade 3 and 4), the median duration of  neutropenia was 10 days (range 3 to 148 days).  
Documented resolution of the neutropenia was described in approximately one -half of the reported cases; 
of those with documented recovery, approximately half received growth factor support.  In the remaining 
cases, information on resolution was not provided.  More than half of the reported cases of delayed onset neutropenia occurred in patients who had undergone prior  autologous bone marrow transplantation.  In 
an adequately designed, controlled, clinical tri al, the reported incidence of NCI -CTC Grade 3 and 4 
neutropenia was higher in patients receiving RITUXAN in combination with fludarabine as compared to 
those receiving fludarabine alone (76% [39/51] vs. 39% [21/53]).

Instructions for initiation of a New Cycle in all consolidation Cycles  
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if:  
• The ANC is ≥  1500/mm³;   
• The platelet count is ≥  75,000/mm³;  
• Any drug- related rash or neuropathy that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 severity;  
• No evidence of laboratory TLS by [CONTACT_164409] -Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (see 
Appendix V).  Subjects may be started on consolidation therapy with the combination of 
lenalidomide and rituximab upon correction of electrolyte abnormalities;  
• Any other drug- related adverse events that may have occurred have resolved to ≤ grade [ADDRESS_968046] will be evaluated weekly and a new 
cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the toxicity has resolved as described above.  If a lenalidomide 
dose reduction was taken during the previous cycle, and the cycle was completed without requiring 
further dose modification, then the next cycle will start at the same reduced dose of lenalidomide.  If 
lenalidomide dosing was omitted for the remainder of the previous cycle due to toxicity attributed to le nalidomide or if the new cycle is delayed due to lenalidomide -related toxicity newly 
encountered on the scheduled Day 1 , then the new cycle will be started with a one -level dose reduction 
of lenalidomide.  
 
Instructions for dose modifications or interrupti on  
For treatment interruptions during a cycle, the 28- day schedule of each cycle will continue to be followed.  
Missed doses of lenalidomide are not made up. For treatment interruptions that delay the scheduled start 
of a new cycle, when toxicity has resolved as required to allow the start of a new cycle (Section 8.3), the 
restart day of therapy becomes Day 1 of the next cycle.

12.3.1.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
 All subjects meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS according to the Cairo- Bishop 
Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (see Appendix) should receive vigorous intravenous 
hydration and should be considered for rasburicase therapy as needed to reduce hyperuricemia, 
until correction of electrolyte abnor malities.    
 In cases of laboratory TLS and Grade 1 TLS (see Appendix: Cairo- Bishop Definition of Tumor 
Lysis Syndrome), lenalidomide will be continued at the same dose without interruption or dose 
reduction.   TLS prophylaxis measures outlined in Section 8. 4.6 should be continued or re-
instituted.  
 Subjects with ≥ Grade 2 TLS (see Appendix: Cairo- Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome) 
will be managed as follows in addition to intravenous hydration and consideration for rasburicase 
therapy (above).    
 Hold (interrupt) treatment.  
 First epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]: restart lenalidomide at the current dose with appropriate TLS prophylaxis (Section 8.4.6) after resolution of electrolyte abnormalities to Grade 0.    
 Subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]: restart lenalidomide with appropriate TLS proph ylaxis (Section 
8.4.6) after resolution of electrolyte abnormalities to Grade 0.   At physician discretion, the 
lenalidomide dose may be restarted at the current dose or lenalidomide may be reduced 
by 1 dose level.    
 First or subsequent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]: subjects s hould be closely monitored for signs of TLS after 
resuming treatment.   To monitor for TLS, serum chemistry and uric acid tests should be 
performed at least every week following initiation of lenalidomide for 4 consecutive weeks 
and on Day 3 or 4 following initiation of lenalidomide.   See Section 10.3 Schedule of 
Study Assessments, for additional specifics regarding serum chemistry and uric acid testing.  
 
12.3.2.  Tumor Flare Reaction (TFR):  
 
Prophylaxis for (TFR) is not recommended.   Grade 1 TFR may be treated wit h NSAIDs (i.e. ibuprofen 
400-600 mg orally every 4 -6 hours as needed).   TFR ≥ Grade 2 may be treated with corticosteroids.   
Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for pain control in subjects experiencing ≥ Grade 2 
tumor flare.   If corticosteroids are used, the following dosage schedule is recommended; prednisone 
20mg PO daily x [ADDRESS_968047] 2 weeks of Cycle 1 should be recorded as an adverse event and 
not as progressive disease (PD).   For tumor flare occurring after the first 2 weeks of Cycle 1, 
differentiate tumor flare from progression.

   12.3.3.  Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Prophylaxis (allopurinol and hydration ) 
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), characterized by [CONTACT_496446], hyperuricemia, and hy perphosphatemia 
resulting from the rapid release of potassium, uric acid, and phosphate, has been reported in CLL 
patients treated with lenalidomide necessitating TLS prophylaxis including allopurinol and oral hydration.   
The risk of TLS is highest during the first cycle of therapy and may be elevated when lenalidomide is re-
started after treatment interruptions or when the lenalidomide dose is escalated.  
 
Allopurinol 300mg po daily beginning at least [ADDRESS_968048] 3 cycles of therapy, additional allopurinol should be given concurrent with any dose escalation (or re- escalation, if permitted) of lenalidomide.   In these instances, allopurinol should be 
started concurrent with (or if feasible, 3 days prior to) the escalation of lenalidomide, and continued through at least the end of the cycle.   A similar course of allopurinol should be considered when 
lenalidom ide is restarted after having been held for any reason within the first [ADDRESS_968049]’s cardiovascular status indicates the 
possibility of volume overload.   Within the first 3 cycles of therapy, additional oral hydration should be 
considered concurrent with any dose escalation (or re- escalation, if permitted) of lenalidomide, or when 
lenalidomide is restarted after having been held for any reason.  
 
Based on a patient’s reaction and laboratory parameters, TLS prophylaxis may be continued or restarted 
as needed at the Investigator’s discretion, see section 12.3.1 for guidance.  
 
12.3.4.  Anticoagulation Consideration  
Lenalidomide increases t he risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or with a history a 
thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to cause thrombosis. When 
lenalidomide is combined with other agents such as steroids (e.g. dexamethasone, pred nisone), 
anthracyclines (Doxil, Adriamycin) and erythropoietin the risk of thrombosis is increased.  
 All patients should receive prophylactic anti -coagulation.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 or 325 mg) is the recommended 
agent for anti -coagulation prophylaxis.  Low molecul ar weight heparin may be utilized in patients that 
are intolerant to ASA.  Coumadin should be used with caution and close monitoring of INR.  
 
Prophylactic anti -coagulation should be held for platelet counts < 50,000mm ³ 
and then restarted when platelet counts are above this level.  
 
Full therapeutic anti -coagulation should be considered for patients who have a history of venous 
thromboembolism.  Whether therapeutic anti -coagulation is used or not, patients with a history of 
venous thromboembolism should be c losely monitored throughout the study, especially during periods 
of fluctuating platelet counts.  
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION & REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
13.1.  Treatment Discontinuation  
 Progressive disease  
 Subjects who meet toxicity criteria for discontinuation  
 Subjects who wish to discontinue therapy  
 Physician discretion that the treatment is no longer in the best interest of the patient.  
 Pregnancy

    Subjects who are lost to follow -up. Lost to follow -up is defined as three (3) consecutive failed 
attempts to contact [CONTACT_711691] (3) consecutive missed protocol required follow up 
assessment appointments. Such instances should be well documented in the source documents.  
Every effort should be made to continue to follow patients according to schedule of events once 
treatment has ceased, however, patients that are unwilling or unable to comply with follow up 
schedule should, at the discretion of the investigator, be removed from the study.  
 
14.0 EVALAUTION OF RESPONSE  
14.1.  Assessment of Clinical Response  (2008 NCIWG Guidelines, 63)  
The major criteria for determination of the response to t herapy in patients with CLL include physical 
examination and evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow. It is recommended that the laboratory 
and clinical studies which are abnormal pre- study be repeated to document the degree of maximal 
response.

period.  Serious criteria, defini tions, and guidance for reporting follow.  
 An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in an investigational trial or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An adverse event can be an unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease associated 
with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether or not considered related to the 
investigational product.  
Serious  Adverse Event (SAE) Definiti on  
 
Serious adverse events (SAE) are adverse events occurring at any dose which meet one or more of the 
following serious criteria  and MUST BE REPORTED WITHIN 24HOURS AFTER SITE’S INITIAL RECEIPT 
OF INFORMATION : 
 
(a) Death;  
(b) A life -threatening AE/ADR ( i.e., the patient/subject was, in the view of the initial reporter/investigator, 
at immediate risk of death from the AE/ADR as it occurred. It does not refer to an AE/ADR that 
hypothetically might have caused death if more severe);

   (c) Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] ( i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711657]/ADR; excludes hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115224]);  
(d) A persistent or significant disability or incapacity ( disability  here means that there is a substant ial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions;  
(e) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
(f) An important medical event (i.e., AEs/ADRs that might not be immediately life- threatening, or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_711658] s erious when, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, they might jeopardize the patient/subject or might require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above);  
 
Sponsor -Investigator shall use his /her judgment to determine the relationship between the Serious Adverse Drug 
Experience and the Study Drug.  
 
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure.  
Unexpect ed adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current Investigator Brochure (I.B.) 
or not identified.  This includes adverse events for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B.  
 
Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition including either an increase in frequency 
and/or intensity of the condition 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a  
concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE).  
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” will not be reported as an AE or SAE. 
However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
 
All adverse events that meet these criteria are to be reported.  
   
Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_301913]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or  symptoms of the disease/disorder 
being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the 
procedure is an AE  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the 
start of the study that do not worsen

Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety 
assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from 
baseline,  and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator are to be 
recorded as AEs or SAEs.

   ALT levels of greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and simultaneous bilirubin levels of greater  
than [ADDRESS_968056] (>35% direct bilirubin; bilirubin fractionation required)  are to be recorded as SAEs.  
 
However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless 
judged by [CONTACT_1173]’s condition, are not to be reported 
as AEs or SAEs.  
Disease- Related Events and/or Disease- Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as SAEs  
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression) does not 
need to be reported as an SAE.  However, if the progression of the underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject or if the investigator considers that there was a causal 
relationship between treatment wit h investigational product or protocol design/procedures and the disease 
progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.  
Time Period and Frequency of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
All SAEs regardless of relationship to investigational product will be collected from the first dose of 
investigational product to [ADDRESS_968057] consents to participate in and completes the study, all SAEs assessed as related  to 
study participation  (e.g., protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or will 
be reported to the sponsor -investigator, and local IRB, if applicable.  
 Any pre -existing condition or signs and symptoms present prior to investigational product will be recorded as 
medical history.   
 Any SAE brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by 
[CONTACT_711692].  
 
Adverse Event Reporting:  
The following adverse reactions must be reported in the manner described below.  
 All serious adverse events (SAE) regardless of causality must be reported to the PI, and Celgene (within 24 
hours) or Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_711659]’s  IRB. 
See section 15.2 for specific reporting criteria for adverse events associated with rituximab. See section 15.3 for specific reporting criteria for adverse events associated with lenalidomide.

• An adverse reaction is considered serious  if it is fatal or life -threatening; requires or prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; produces a disability; or results in a congenital anomaly/birth effect.  
• An adverse reaction is considered to be of moderate or greater severity  if it requires medical 
evaluation (such as additional laboratory testing) and/or medical treatment; or if it is a serious 
adverse reaction.  
• An adverse reaction is considered to be unexpected if it is not identified in nature, severity, or 
frequency in the current IRB -approved research protocol or informed consent document.  
• An adverse r eaction is considered to be associated with the research intervention if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the reaction may have been caused by [CONTACT_711693] (i.e., a 
causal relationship between the reaction and research intervention cannot be ruled out by [CONTACT_093](s).  
 
HUMC requires SAEs to be reported on the MedWatch form and on the HUMC  IRB adverse event form.  The 
treating investigator must sign the HUMC  Adverse event form.  (This only applies to the John Theurer Cancer 
Center, a ll other participating sites will follow their own IRB guidelines and submit all SAE’s on a MedWatch form  
to [CONTACT_711705] at fax number [PHONE_14820] or via email to [EMAIL_13650]   
 
 
15.2.  Reporting A dverse Events Associated with Lenalidomide  
Toxicity will b e scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting.  A copy of the 
CTCAE Version 4 .0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage ( http:// ctep.info.nih.gov ).  All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by [CONTACT_56313], must be recorded, with details about the 
durati on and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s 
outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and for 
its seriousness.  
The investigator must apprai se all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical significance.  If any abnormal 
laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator must provide details about the action 
taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s outcome.  
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on lenalidomide, or within (insert time-
frame which must be at least [ADDRESS_968058] ’s last dose of  lenalidomide ), are considered 
immediately reportable events.  Lenalidomide is to be discontinued immediately. The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediatel y 
by [CONTACT_6972], or  email  using the Pregnancy Initial Report Form .. The female subject should be referred to 
an obstetrician- gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and 
counseling.  
. 
 The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify Celgene 
Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) using 
the Pregnancy Follow -up Report Form. If the outcome of the pregnancy was  abnormal (e.g., spontaneous 
or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal 
outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by [CONTACT_6972], o r email  within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s knowledge of the event using the 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.  
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_968059] to causality, as 
SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is related to the in utero 
exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s knowledge of  the event using the SAE Report 
Form.

The conduct of the study will comply with all FDA safety reporting requirements.   
 
IND Annual Reports  
If the FDA has granted an IND number, it is a requirement of 21 CFR 312.33, that  an annual report is 
provided to the FDA within 60- days of the IND anniversary date. 21 CRF 312.33 provides the data elements 
that are to be submitted in the report. The Annual Report should be filed in the study's Regulatory Binder, and a copy provided to Celgene Corporation as a supporter of this study as follows.  
 
IND Annual Reports  
Celgene Corporation  
Attn: Medical Affairs Operations  
Connell Corporate Park  
[ADDRESS_968062] includ e the patient number, age, sex, weight, severity of reaction (e.g. 
mild, moderate, severe), relationship to drug (e.g. probably related, unknown relationship, definitely not 
related), date and time of administration of test medications and all concomitant medications, and medical 
treatment provided. The investigator is responsible for evaluating all adverse events to determine whether 
criteria for “serious” and as defined above are present. The investigator is responsible for reporting adverse 
events to Cel gene as described below.  
 
 
Expedited reporting by [CONTACT_197000] (SAE) are defined above. The investigator must inform Celgene in writing using a 
Celgene SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A form of any SAE within [ADDRESS_968063] be completed and supplied to Celgene by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours/[ADDRESS_968064](s),. Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end 
date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) must be documented on a follow -up 
report. A final report to document resolution of the SAE is required . The Celgene tracking number 
(RV_CLL_PI_0530) and the institutional protocol number should be included on SAE reports (or on the fax 
cover letter) sent to Celgene.  A copy of the fax transmission confirmation of the SAE report to Celgene 
should be attached to the SAE and retained with the patient records.  
 
Report of Adverse Events to the Institutional Review Board  
The principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_101400]/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) of a serious adverse 
event according to institutional policy.  
 
  Trial Coordination Center Reporting Guidelines   
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 41 of 57 
   All Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_711660]’s Institutional Review Board guidelines for reporting. The Hackensack 
Research  staff will submit any reportable SAE reports to the IRB as per their guidelines, and report to other 
sub-sites, if applicable.  
 
15.3.  MedWatch 3500 Reporting Guidelines:  
 
In addition to completing appropriate pat ient demographic and suspect medication information, the report 
should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500 form:  
 
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
• Description of event, onset date, s everity, treatment, and outcome if known  
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to each investigational product and 
suspect medication  
 Follow -up information:   
 
Additional informati on may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_15482]:  
 
• Adding to the original MedWatch 3500 report and submitting it as follow -up 
• Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow -up with the original MedWatch 
3500 form  
• Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including subject identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. 
initial, subject number), protocol description and number, if assigned, brief adverse event description, and notation that additional or fol low-up information is being submitted  (The patient identifiers are important 
so that the new information is added to the correct initial report)  
 
15.4.  Trial Drug Relationship  
 
The investigator will determine which events are associated with the use of trial dr ug.  For reporting purposes, 
an AE should be regarded as possibly related to the use of the investigational product if the investigator  
believes:  
 
• There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and trial drug administration; and/or  
• There is a biologically plausible mechanism for trial drug causing or contributing to the AE; and 
• The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or procedures.  
 
Trial drug relationship will be assessed to rituximab and lenalidomide separately and specified on SAE form.  
 
15.5.  Adverse event updates/IND safety reports  
 
Celgene shall notify the Investigator via an IND Safety Report of the following information:  
 
• Any AE associated with the use of drug in this study or in other studies that is both serious and 
unexpected.  
 
• Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.  
 
It is the sponsor -investigator’s responsibi lity to ensure safety information is disseminated to any affiliate or 
sub-sites.  
 
The Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or 
significant risks to subjects in accordance with their IRB policy.

16.0  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
16.1.  Overview  
This study is designed to assess the toxicity and complete response rate of FCR - plus lenalidomide  
followed by [CONTACT_711694]. The patients will be evaluated for 
response and toxicity using a two -stage, phase II study design.  
  
16.1.1.  Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint of this trial is CR after 4 cycles of FCR - in patients with 
previously untreated CLL.  
 
16.1.2.  Secondary Endpoint:  Secondary endpoints are MRD measured by [CONTACT_66997] -color flow cytometry and 
response to lenalidomide overall survival, toxicity, duration of response, and the expression of ZAP -70, 
CD38, IgV H status, and chr omosomes.  
 
16.1.3.  Sample Size and Accrual:  Nineteen patients will be accrued in the first stage. If the study continues to the 
second stage, an additional 35 patients will be accrued. Accrual is expected to occur at a rate of 2- 3 
patients per month.  
 
 
16.1.4.  Analysis po pulation:  
Safety population:  All enrolled patients who received at least one dose of the combination drug will be included in the safety population.  
 
Evaluable population:  All enrolled patients who complete the 1 cycle of treatment and follow -up 
examinati on and evaluation will be included in the analysis of clinical 
response.  
 
16.2.  Statistical Considerations for the Clinical Trial  
 16.2.1.  Decision Rule, Power and Significance:  This study is designed to evaluate the CR rate of FCR- following 
four cycles of therapy in patients with previously untreated CLL.  The patients will be evaluated using an 
optimum two stage phase [ADDRESS_968066] one does of 
the study therapy will be included in the safety population.  
 
In the proposal for patients with untreated CLL we are interested in excluding an unfavorable CR of 20% 
versus a 40% CR rate under the alternative hypothesi s.  Assuming a significance level of 0.05 and 90% 
power, we need sample sizes in 2 stages as n1=19, and n2=35 (total maximum sample size = 54).  In the first stage, [ADDRESS_968067] who begin lenalidomide 
treatment.  Th e 95% exact -binomial confidence interval for the MRD elimination rate will be estimated using 
the Clopper -Pearson method.  Assuming the FCR - CR rate is 40% and that 50% of the patients 
experiencing a CR have MRD, then we would expect the MRD elimination rate to be estimated based on 
approximately 11 patients.  
16.2.2.  Analysis of Endpoint:   The complete responses will be estimated by [CONTACT_711695].  Ninety -five percent confidence intervals for the tr ue CR 
will be calculated.  
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 43 of 57 
   Analysis of the other Secondary Endpoints:   The overall response rate will be estimated by [CONTACT_711696].  Ninety -five 
percent confiden ce intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated.  The overall survival (OS) is 
defined as the time interval between the treatment starting date and the documented date of death.  For a 
surviving patient, OS is censored at the last follow -up date when the patient is documented to be alive.  
Progression- free survival (PFS) is defined as the time interval between the treatment starting date and the 
documented date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first.  For an alive and progre ssion free 
patient, PFS is censored at the last follow -up date when the patient is documented to be progression free.  
The OS and PFS will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761]- Meier method.  The median survival and the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval will also be reported.  However, given the small sample size, these 
estimates will be largely exploratory in nature.  The relation of these endpoints to the expression of ZAP -70, 
CD38, lgVH status and chromosomes will be explored by [CONTACT_711697].  
16.2.3.  Toxicity:  All toxicities  that were determined to be possibly, probably or definitely related to the treatment 
will be tabulated according to grade and type (according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 4.0). 
The ma ximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be 
reviewed to determine toxicity patterns.  
16.2.4.  Monitoring:  The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study periodically to 
ident ify accrual, toxicity, and any endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This study will be monitored 
according to the data and safety monitoring plan that is currently in place, and if necessary will report to HUMC Data Safety Monitoring Board for revie w monthly.  
   
 
16.3.  Data Safety Plan  
 
Monitoring and Quality Assurance:  
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_711698].  It is 
the responsibility of the PI (or designee) to monitor the safety data for this study. At minimum local  safety 
data should be reviewed by [CONTACT_711699] a monthly basis . All SAEs will be reported 
according to section 15.0, section 15.1, section 15.[ADDRESS_968068] events.  The Clinical Research Monitoring Coordinator (CRMCO) 
will track patient consent and enrollment.  The principal investigator, study statistician, and CRMCO will monitor 
safety data for all patients, including adverse events (AE’s) for all grades and attributions, serious adverse events 
(SAE’s), and study drug administration.  
 If any literature becomes  available which suggests that conducting this trial is no longer ethical, the study will be 
terminated and the IRB will be notified of the new findings.  Any modifications necessary to ensure patient safety 
are discussed and modifications will be submitted to the IRB.  Modifications to this study will not be implemented 
until approved by [CONTACT_1201]. The IRB will be notified of any changes in the risk/benefit ratio, which would affect 
whether the study should continue.   
 All patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_711700], patient safety and data quality. This monitoring 
will be done by [CONTACT_711701] (CRF’s). Source documents may be 
requested from sites for remote monitoring.  Any variation between the tw o data sets will be discussed and/or 
queried.  
 
The first level of ongoing oversight is carried out by [CONTACT_458], [CONTACT_711706] , primary research nurse 
and the study data coordinator. These individuals m eet at least monthly with each cycle to re view recently 
acquired data, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_711661]. The data recorded within the research charts and protocol 
database is compared with the actual data that is available from the medical record and clinical histories. All 
investigators in the protocol have received formal training in the ethical conduct of human research.  
Version Date March 14, [ADDRESS_968069] (DSMB) will be composed of 
medical and statistical independent reviewers and will meet to review the efficacy and safety data and determine 
a risk/benefit analysis in this subject population.  The purpose of the D SMB is to advise on serious safety 
considerations, lack of efficacy and any other considerations within the charge to the Committee.  The D SMB may 
request additional meeti ngs or safety reports as deemed necessary . The D SMB may stop the study following 
review of results from each interim analysis.  The first interim analysis will examine only safety information; the 
second interim, conducted when the database is more mature,  will examine both safety and efficacy.  Appropriate 
efficacy and safety data summaries will be provided to the D SMB after each interim analysis.  
 
 
 
16.4.  Correlative Analysis  
Median duration of response and overall survival will be estimated and Kaplan- Meier c urves will be 
presented for all subjects who begin protocol treatment. The mean, median and range of the duration of 
response and survival will be cross -tabulated against expression of ZAP -70, CD38, IgV H status and MRD 
measured by [CONTACT_7163]- color flow cytometr y.  Clinical response will also be tabulated against these laboratory 
endpoints.

   Appendix II:   Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines 
and Acceptable Birth Control Methods)  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy  
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human 
teratogenic active substance that causes severe life -threatening birth defects.  An 
embryofetal development study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced 
malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  
Therefore, a risk minimization plan to prevent pregnancy must be observed. 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophore ctomy or 2) has not been 
naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out 
childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any 
time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).  
Counseling  
For a female of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (i.e., all females of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study 
therapy):  
• She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child  
• She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study 
treatment, dose interru ption and 28 days after the end of study treatment  
• She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
• She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to notify her study doctor immediately if there  is a risk of pregnancy  
• She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study 
drug is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test  
• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on 
the frequency outlined in thi s protocol (Section Error! Reference source not 
found. ) 
• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide  
The investigator must ensure that for fe males of childbearing potential:  
• Complies with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding  
• Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements  
For a female NOT of childbearing potential, le nalidomide is contraindicated unless all of 
the following are met (i.e., all females NOT of childbearing potential must be counseled 
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 51 of 57 
   concerning the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study 
therapy):  
• She acknowledges that s he understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide  
Traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen.  Male patients taking lenalidomide 
must meet the following conditions (i.e., all males must be counseled concerning the 
following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
• Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a 
pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential  
• Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, 
if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of 
childbearing potential.   
Contraception 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable forms o f contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from 
heterosexual contact [CONTACT_137810]: 1) for at least 
28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_968072] include one highly effective method and 
one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider 
of cont raceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and 
additional effective methods of contraception:    
• Highly effective methods:  
− Intrauterine device (IUD) 
− Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants)  
− Tubal ligation  
− Partner ’s vasectomy  
• Additional effective methods:  
− Male condom  
− Diaphragm  
− Cervical Cap  
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_711664]. If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient 
should switch to one of the effective method listed above. The risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for 4 to 6  weeks after discontinuing combined oral 
contraception. The effi cacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co- treatment 
with dexamethasone  
Version Date March 14, 2014  
   Page 52 of 57 
   Implants and levonorgestrel -releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an 
increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. 
Prop hylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing  
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25  mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing 
potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below. 
Before starting study drug  
Female Patients:  
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to 
starting study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within [ADDRESS_968073] be performed within 24 hours prior to the start of study drug.  The patient may not receive study drug unti l the 
study doctor has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.  
 
 Male Patients : 
Must practice complete abstinence or  agree to use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a 
pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential while pa rticipating in the study, 
during dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation, 
even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.   
During study participation and for 28 days following study drug discontinuation  Female Pa tients:  
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests 
weekly for the first [ADDRESS_968074] 28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug 
discontinuation.   
• At each visit, the Investigator mus t confirm with the FCBP that she is 
continuing to use two reliable methods of birth control.   
• Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal 
exposure must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.  
• If pregnancy or a positive pre gnancy test does occur in a study patient, study 
drug must be immediately discontinued.  
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Study 
drug treatment must be discontinued during this evaluation.  
• Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation 
and for at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation.

   Male Patients:  
• Counseling about the requirement for complete abstinence or c ondom use 
during sexual contact [CONTACT_4490] a pregnant female or a female of childbearing 
potential and the potential risks of fetal exposure to lenalidomide must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days.   
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur i n the partner of a male 
study patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately.  
Additional precautions

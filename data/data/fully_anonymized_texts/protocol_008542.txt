To achieve this objective, we will pursue the following aims: 1. To determine the efficacy of a freeze-dried table grape powder, rich in phenolic compounds, to mitigate sarcopenia parameters in postmenopausal women. 1. To evaluate the effect of a freeze-dried table grape powder on key metabolic regulators of sarcopenia in postmenopausal women, specially irisin.  We hypothesize that daily dietary supplementation with a grape powder improves health span, mitigates sarcopenia parameters and increases irisin plasma levels in postmenopausal women.  The successful completion of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_134699]. This will provide strong preliminary results to apply for competitive grant (USDA) in order to expand these findings using a bigger sample size, multiple doses and various time-periods.   3) Background  As stated above, sarcopenia is defined as a loss of muscle strength and mass in older individuals. However, until recently, there has been no widely accepted definition of

Sarcopenia leads to fragility and disability, worsens the prognosis of many diseases, and significantly enhances morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a higher risk of death from all causes compared with non-sarcopenic subjects was found in > 60 years old and mainly in > 80 years old (13, 14). With the increasing life expectancy and rapid growth of the aged population, sarcopenia is becoming an emerging public health issue with huge socioeconomic burden.  In recent years, various international consensuses have brought these fundamental concepts to the clinical practice. The European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) developed a practical clinical definition and consensus diagnostic criteria for age-related sarcopenia, recommending the use of the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (strength or performance) for diagnosis. Recently, a new consensus (EWGSOP2) recommended low muscle strength as the primary parameter to assess sarcopenia and new cut-off points to increase harmonization of sarcopenia studies (15). Given the above, there is an ongoing intensive search for novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including dietary ones that can attenuate the loss of muscle mass and strength in the elderly (10, 16). Interestingly, a growing body of research indicate that nutritional factors can preserve muscle function from age-related decline. In particular, phenolic compounds, widely distributed in fruits including grapes, have shown beneficial effects in muscle health (17, 18). Phenolic compounds have garnered attention because they ability to alleviate disease pathologies through anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant

Page [ADDRESS_152564] sarcopenia is by [CONTACT_134700]. Irisin is a myokine regulated by [CONTACT_134701]-activated receptor gamma co-activator-1α (PGC-1α) and released into the bloodstream after cleavage of the Fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) (Fig 1.). Recent studies have indicated that circulating irisin can promote skeletal muscle growth (12, 19, 20). Lower irisin concentrations have been observed in sarcopenia patients (21) and dialyzed patients with cardiovascular disease (22). Furthermore, lower irisin plasma levels are associated with sarcopenia in postmenopausal women (10).  In a recent study, we have shown that phenolic compounds present in a grape pomace extract (GPE), prevent irisin downregulation in rats fed a high-fat diet and in L6 myotube cells. In particular, we documented that consumption of the GPE activates the FNDC5/irisin pathway, with a significant increase of PGC-1α and FNDC5 protein

Furthermore, supplementation with GPE led to the increase in irisin plasma level (Figure 2C)(11).  In order to understand the underlying mechanism involved in the GPE-related irisin increased levels, we next evaluated the effects of epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], one of the main flavonoids present in GPE, in L6 myotubes challenged with palmitate, to mimic a condition of fatty acids oversupply. Protein levels of PGC- 1α and FNDC5 were significantly higher in the EC and palmitate-treated cells, compared with palmitate-treated cells (Figure 3A-B). The same tendency was observed by [CONTACT_134702]-1α, while no differences were observed in FNDC5 fluorescence intensity among treatments (Figure 3D-E). In addition, EC induced a 2-fold increase in irisin levels secreted to the medium compared with cells treated with only palmitate (Figure 3C). These data strongly indicate that phenolic compounds enhance irisin levels in vitro and in vivo.  These intriguing data allow us to hypothesize that phenolic compounds present in grapes might have a positive effect in human health, specially preventing sarcopenia in elderly humans, in part, by [CONTACT_134703].   4) Enrollment Numbers  We chose the “changes in plasma irisin levels” as our primary outcome to determine the power calculations for sample size. Based on our preliminary data (11), 5 individuals per group are required to reach 80% power to detect differences in irisin levels between the groups, at a a=0.05, using a two-sided paired T-test. We propose to enroll 7 individuals per group, instead of 5, in the event of a patient drop out of the study (for any unforeseen circumstances). In total we will have 14 subjects.   5) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

The total compensation that a participant might earn is $325 for completion of all visits. Subjects that withdraw from the study early will be compensated based on the visit(s) they completed. 8) Screening procedures to determine eligibility:   After being pre-screened for eligibility by a phone interview, eligible potential participants will come to the Ragle Facility in a fasting (12 h) state for the in-person screening visit 0.  In this visit the participants will sign an informed consent form. The subject will read the information carefully and will be given the opportunity to seek more information if needed. The investigator or designee will obtain written (signed and dated by [CONTACT_423]) informed consent from each potential participant after adequate explanation of the aims, methods and potential hazards of the study. The investigator or designee will also explain to the potential participant that his/her participation is voluntary, and he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. The investigator or designee will sign and date the consent form to confirm that the consent process was completed correctly. The subject will also be provided with the option of taking the consent form home to review prior to making his/her decision. The subject will be provided with a copy of his/her signed and dated consent form. Once consent has been obtained, the pre-screening visit will proceed. After the subject has signed the informed consent, an identification number (ID) will be assigned and entered the screening and enrollment log. A diet history questionnaire (Attachment C) will be complete by [CONTACT_2299]. After this we will confirm if they meet the following inclusion criteria:

Following are the steps of the procedure [a detailed procedure will be added (Attachment D)]: - The participant will be asked to seat comfortably in a standard chair with legs, back support and fixed arms.  - The participant will be asked to rest their forearms on the arms of the chair with their wrist just over the end of the arm of the chair wrist in a neutral position, thumb facing upwards.  - The person in charge of the test will demonstrate how to use the handgrip dynamometer. - The participant will be asked to start with the right hand.  - The person in charge of the test will encourage the participant to squeeze as long and as tightly as possible or until the needle stops rising. Once the needle stops rising the participant can be instructed to stop squeezing.  - The person in charge of the test will read grip strength in kilograms from the outside dial and record the result to the nearest [ADDRESS_152566] hand dominance, i.e. right, left or ambidextrous (people who can genuinely write with both hands).   For those participants that meet the previous inclusion criteria the following parameters will be explore: 1. Seated resting blood pressure. 2. Weight and height.

Hand-grip strength: previously describe in the screening point 2. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB): the SPPB score will be based on three tests, as follows: balance test, gait speed test, and chair stand test (see Attachment E). Of note, these tests have been used as a predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in older people.   Following, the subjects will randomize into the study supplement: a) Placebo powder (46 g placebo powder in 180 ml of water); or b) freeze-dried table grape powder (46 g grape powder in 180 ml of water). The supplement will be supplied to the participants to complete the following 3 weeks supplementation until the next visit. The investigator or designee will explain the details regarding the preparation and consumption of the supplement [a dosing protocol will be uploaded too (Attachment F)].  Also a 24-hs food and physical activity questionary will be performed   Briefly, at visit 1: • Subjects will arrive fasted for at least 12 h prior to this visit (water ok). • A finger stick blood sample will be collected (to confirm fasting). • Concomitant medications and accomplishing of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed. • 24-hs food and physical activity questionary • Seated resting blood will be measured. • Weight will be measured. • Venous blood samples will be collected for analytical determinations (20 ml). • A hematocrit will be performed in order to discard anemia. • Snack ingestion • Hand grip strength and SPPB test will be completed.

To compare participants in the two diet groups (Placebo control and freeze-dried table grape powder) a paired Student’s t test (two-tailed) will be used. Data involving more than two repeated measures, such as grip strength tasks, or irisin levels, will be assessed by [CONTACT_134706] (ANOVA).  Differences will be considered significant at P < 0.05. Significant results will be also subjected to analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to account for group differences at baseline and post hoc comparisons using the Bonferroni correction.  Data confidentiality: After obtaining written informed consent, all subjects will be assigned an identification number (ID) and all data and specimens will be collected from individuals and stored using this ID number. The key linking the subjects’ personal information to their laboratory results will be kept in a locked drawer in the investigator’s office. Only authorized research personnel will have access to the study data. People outside the research process will not have access to results about any one person. Staff analyzing the data will only have access samples identified by [CONTACT_1766]’ ID number. The subjects’

If the participants start taking supplements. Also, if the participants experiment a remarkable increment in body weight, blood pressure and plasma glucose and cholesterol concentrations above 100 and 200 mg/dl. Finally, development of anemia during the study will be another reason for removal.    14)  Risks to Subjects Venipuncture: Risks of venipuncture include some discomfort, bruising, and rarely, infection. Blood collections will be performed by a registered nurse to minimize discomfort.    Blood volume: The amount of blood to be drawn during the study will be ~60 mL, collected over a period of 6-weeks. We will take a finger stick blood sample (~1 drop, equal to  ~100 ul) at visits 0,1, 2 and 3  and 20 mL/visit at visits 1, 2 and 3. These volumes are well within the recommended allocated volume for healthy adults. Nevertheless, the patients could experiment dizziness, nausea and physical weakness.    Study products: The components of the dietary supplement and placebo are detailed in Attachment I and Attachment J, respectively. The dose that the participant will consume daily is the equivalent to a ~150 g (1.5 cups) of fresh grapes, which won’t represent a health risk for the participant

However, subjects will receive general information regarding their overall health status.   16)  Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  Subjects will be assigned an identification number (ID) and all data and specimens will be collected and stored using this ID number. Personal information (name, phone number and email address) and consent forms will be kept in confidence and will be stored in a locked cabinet in the investigator’s office. The key linking the subjects’ personal information to their laboratory results will be kept separately in another locked drawer in the investigator’s office (See above for more on confidentiality).    At the Ragle Facility, the subjects will interact with the study coordinator and trained research personnel. The data collection (anthropometry, blood pressure and venipuncture) will be performed in individual secluded rooms by [CONTACT_59856]. We will ensure that the subjects feel comfortable with all research procedures. Questions and interactions between the subjects and the research team will be kept private.    17) Sharing of Results with Subjects Subjects will receive the results of their blood screen (once reviewed and approved) at the time of completion of the study (or early withdrawal). The research data will not be shared with the subjects, but a summary of the research can be provided to the subjects who express interest.  18) Data/Specimen Banking All samples, including those sent out for outside analysis will have only a numerical identifier and date/time. Specimens to be stored on site will be kept frozen at -80°C in secure laboratories.  Specimens will be stored as long as they are viable for analyses; records of storage will be kept by [CONTACT_093]’s lab staff; all records will be of the de-identified specimens. During analyses, the de-identified data will be entered in Excel

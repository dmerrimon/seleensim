STUDY SUMMARY  
 
Title:      Randomized open -label neo -adjuvant phase  II study  comparing  
ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575] (I) vs. ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642219] (IC) in Triple negative breast 
cancer patients  
 
Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
1. To determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) (breast and 
axilla) of  Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642220]  T1N1 -N3M0 or  
T2-4 N0 -3M0 diseas e who are Triple negative and who are candidates for 
preoperative chemotherapy.  
Secondary Objective(s):  
1. To evaluate overall objective response rate in both treatment groups.  
2. To assess toxicity of each regimen.  
Exploratory Objective s: 
1. To correlate the  expression of biomarkers such as PTEN, EGFR 
and EGFR -pathway associated genes ( including, but not limited to, 
TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, KRAS, AKT3, PTEN, MEK1 and KRAS 
amplicon genes) with the objective clinical and pathologic response.  
2. To potentially explore other gene/protein expression patterns , 
mutations and gene/chromosomal copy number alterations related 
to sensitivity or resistance to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], other anti -microtubule 
agents and cetuximab.   These additional exploratory analyses m ay 
include, but are not limited to, beta tubulin isoforms, ABC 
transporters, TACC3, HCAPG , GTSE1, Kallikreins  and defined  
gene models associated with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642221] .

Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 12 of 83 1.0 Synopsis : 
Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642234] (MBC) after failing an 
anthracycline and  a taxane regimen. Cetuximab is active in tumors that express 
EGFR with demonstrated activity in head and neck and colorectal tumors. A 
proportion of b reast cancer s are known to express EGFR. Cetuximab's 
mechanism of action suggests the possibility of effica cy in breast cancer patients  
and several studies show that it may be efficacious in Triple Negative Breast 
Cancer (TNBC) . This study seeks to evaluate Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642235] a possible way to increase antitumor activity.  
 
This is a randomized open -label phase II trial , one hundred sixteen triple 
negative breast cancer patients will be randomized equally between 1 ) 
Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642236] 2) Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642223] . Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_123573] (T1N1 -3M0 or T2 -4 N0 -3M0).  
At the  baseline all  patients will receive a physical assessment, imaging, a blood 
draw,  and a biopsy  prior to the start of treatment.   
 
 
1.1 Primary Objective(s):  
To determine the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) (breast and axilla) of   
Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642237]  T1N1 -N3M0 or T2 -4 N0 -3M0 disease who are 
Triple negative and who are candidates for preoperative chemotherapy.  
 
 
1.2 Secondary Objective(s):  
To evaluate overall objective response rate in both treatment groups.  
To assess  safety and toxicity  of each regimen . 
 
 
Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642216]163 -157                                                         TMHRI  
BMS -247550                                           Clinical Protocol                                         Version:     8                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
 
Date:  08/09/2012  V. 8 TMHRI&BMS  Page 13 of 83 1.3 Exploratory Objective(s):  
To correlate the expression of biomarkers such as PTEN, EGFR and EGFR -
pathway associated genes ( including, but not limited to TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, 
KRAS, AKT3, PTEN, MEK1 and KRAS amplicon genes) with the objective 
clinical and pathologic response.  
For all samples available, the following tests will be conducted:  
 Immunohistochemical detection of  EGFR , and the PTEN  expression in 
tumor tissue samples.   For those  EGFR -pathway associated genes 
(including , but not limited to, TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, KRAS, AKT3, PTEN, 
MEK1 and KRAS amplicon genes) an mRNA -based assay will be used.   
 Additional exploratory biomar ker analysis may be performed on tumor or 
blood samples during or following the study.  Such exploratory analyses 
may include ass essments  of somatic gene mutation, gene/chromosome 
copy number alteration and gene/protein expression for genes/proteins 
relate d to sensitivity or resistance to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], other micro -tubule 
agents and cetuximab.  These exploratory biomarkers may include, but 
are not limited to, beta tubulin isoforms, ABC transporters, TACC3, 
HCAPG, GTSE1, Kallikreins and gene models associated with ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642238].  
 
These analyses will allow for the correlation of biomarkers  expression and 
response to treatment.   Tumor tissue samples will be obtained from the original 
paraffin blocks or slides  containing tumor tissue from the initial diagno stic work -
up (see section 7.1) .  
 
 In addition to the diagnostic core needle biopsy  for biomarkers at  baseline a  
second search  for the same biomarkers will be done  at the time of  surgery . 
The following tests will be conducted (prioritized in the order below):  
 EGFR expression by [CONTACT_4658]  
 PTEN expression by [CONTACT_4658]  
 Estrogen receptor expression by [CONTACT_4658] (at baseline  only)

The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the effectiveness of each 
study group of chemotherapy in triple  negative breast cancer patients, and to 
evaluate the pathologic response rate for each group.    We will be collecting 
tissue from the primary  tumor for biomarker testing; the procedure will be done at 
baseline, and at the time of surgery .

treatment duration time of 4 to 6 months. Radiologic examinations are to be 
performed before chemotherapy a nd before surgery (from randomization to 
disease progression  or until surgery).  
The maximum number of treatment cycles allowed is 4.  
The sequence of events for up to 4 cycles is described below.  
2.2 Screening/Baseline visit  
Informed consent must be obtaine d before performing any study -related 
procedures. Screenin g procedures may be done up to 4  weeks prior the start of 
neo-adjuvant therapy. Screening evaluation will include blood work, pregnancy 
testing, medical history, physical exam (including tumor measu rements of the 
breast and lymph node,  height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate and 
temperature) electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram. Tumor measurements will 
be recorded as the largest dimension in centimeters.  Medical history should 
include relevant underlying conditions and concomitant medications. Baseline 
signs and symptoms are to be recorded and followed throughout the trial. A 
mammography and ultrasound will be performed to assess disease status.  
Prior to initiation of neo -adjuvant therapy, a cor e tumor breast biopsy and blood 
sample will be obtained for baseline biomarkers expression studies.  
If a patient entered the study (i.e. signed informed consent) prior to histological 
confirmation of breast cancer, this biopsy may serve the dual purpose of  
confirming the diagnosis and obtaining tissue for biomarkers research.  
Following confirmation of eligibility, a blocked randomization will be used to 
randomize patients to either arm [ADDRESS_859566] an optional serum 
samples taken for biomarkers expression; blood samples will be stored and the 
biomarkers expression will be done at later time (see lab manual).  Patients will 
be info rmed that they will not be excluded from the clinical study if they do not 
wish to participate in the (blood samples) biomarkers study.

Preclinical Metabolism and Potential for Drug Interactions  
In vitro studies suggest that CYP3A4 is the CYP isozyme primarily responsible 
for the oxidative metabolism of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642250]. Therefore, 
coadministration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect the pharmacokinetics of 
ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575]. In vitro studies also suggest that ixabe pi[INVESTIGATOR_347561] a weak inhibitor of

Cetuximab is a genetically engineered version of a mouse antibody that contains 
both human and mouse components.   It can be produced in large quantities in 
the laboratory. This new monoclonal antibody is believed to work by [CONTACT_24096] a 
natural protein called "epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506]" (EGFR) on the surface 
of cancer cells, interfering with their growth. Cetuxi mab is a chimeric monoclonal 
antibody, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] ( EGFR) inhibitor with 
demonstrated activity in colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer.  
Cetuximab is believed to operate by [CONTACT_642381], which include “cancer cells ”, preventing ligand 
binding and activation of the receptor. This  blocks the downstream signaling of 
EGFR resulting in impaired cell growth and proliferation. Cetuximab has also 
been shown to mediate antibo dy dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).  For 
patients with tumors that express EGFR and who no longer responded to 
treatment with irinotecan alone or in combination  with other chemotherapy drugs, 
the combination treatment of cetuximab and irinotecan shrank tumors in 22.9% of 
patients and delayed tumor growth by [CONTACT_3450] 4.1 months. For patients 
who received cetuximab alone, the tumor response rate was 10.8% and tumor 
growth was delayed by 1.[ADDRESS_859612] clinical trial with 57 patients. Safety data from an additional 111 
patients treated only with cetuximab  was also evaluated. All of the trials included

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN)  
Cetuximab is indicated in combination with radiation therapy for the initial  
treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head 
and neck, and as a single agent, is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck for whom 
prior pla tinumbased therapy has failed.  
Study 1 was a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial of 424 patients with locally 
or regionally advanced SCCHN. Patients with Stage III/IV SCCHN of the 
oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx with no prior therapy were randomi zed (1:1) 
to receive either cetuximab  plus radiation therapy or radiation therapy alone. 
Stratification factors were Karnofsky Performance Status (60 –80 versus 90 –100), 
nodal stage (N0 versus N+), tumor stage (T1 –3 versus T4 using American Joint 
Committee on Cancer 1998 staging criteria), and radiation therapy fractionation 
(concomitant boost versus once -daily versus twice -daily). Radiation therapy was 
administered for 6 –[ADDRESS_859613]. 
Cetuximab  was administered as  a 400 mg/m 2 initial dose beginning one week 
prior to initiation of radiation therapy, followed by 250 mg/m 2 weekly 
administered 1 hour prior to radiation therapy for the duration of radiation therapy 
(6–7 weeks).  
 Of the 424 randomized patients, the media n age was 57 years, 80% were male, 
83% were Caucasian, and 90% had baseline Karnofsky Performance Status ≥80. 
There were 258 patients enrolled in US sites (61%). Sixty percent of patients had 
oropharyngeal, 25% laryngeal, and 15% hypopharyngeal primary tum ors; 28% 
had AJCC T4 tumor stage. Fifty -six percent of the patients received radiation 
therapy with concomitant boost, 26% received once -daily regimen, and 18%

Cetuximab Pre -Clinical Data  
Howard Hughes Medical Institute researchers have found that four aberrant genes 
work together to promote the growth of primary breast tumors . Cooperation among 
the four genes also enables cancerous cells to escape into the bloodstream and 
penetrate through blood vessels into lung tissues.   Although shutting off these 
genes individually can slow cancer growth and metastasis, the researchers fo und 
that turning off all four together had a far more dramatic effect on halting cancer 
growth and metastasis.   Metastasis occurs when cells from a primary tumor break 
off and invade another organ. It is the deadliest transformation that a cancer can 
unde rgo, and therefore researchers have been looking for specific genes that propel 
metastasis.   Massagué et al at the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center, also 
found that they could reduce the growth and spread of human breast tumors in mice 
by [CONTACT_642382], using 
drugs already on the market. The researchers are exploring clinical testing of 
combination therapy with the drugs – cetuximab (Erbitux®) and celecoxib 
(Celebrex®) – to treat breast cancer me tastasis.   In an earlier study, Massagué and 
colleagues had identified [ADDRESS_859618] cancer’s ability to spread to the lungs. In the new study published in Nature, 
they focused on four of these genes. These gen es, which code for proteins called 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_13358], COX2, and matrix metalloproteinases [ADDRESS_859619] cancer  cells that had 
metastasised to the lung, and then tested these cells in mice. To silence the four 
genes, the scientists used a technique called RNA interference, in which RNA 
molecules are tailored to suppress expression of target genes.   The aggressive

aggressive tumors in the mouse mammary gland and also the ability to release cells 
from these tumors into the circulation.  “The remarkable thing was that while 
silencing thes e genes individually was effective, silencing the quartet nearly 
completely eliminated tumor growth and spread."   Microscopic analysis of blood 
vessel structure in the tumors revealed that knocking down all four genes greatly 
reduced growth of the tangle of blood vessels typi[INVESTIGATOR_642282]. Further 
experiments revealed that the tumor blood vessels that did form allowed fewer 
cancer cells to escape into circulation.   The researchers next explored how loss of 
the four abnormal genes affected the metas tatic capability of the cells in the lung. 
They injected cells deficient in the four genes directly into the circulatory system of 
mice. "When these cells reached the lung capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], they just got stuck there,"   
Cetuximab is an antibody that blocks the action of epi[INVESTIGATOR_642283]. Celecoxib is an inhibitor of COX2 that is used as an 
anti-inflammatory, and is being tested in clinical trials against many types of cancer. 
The researchers also tested whether cetuximab  and celecoxib would work effectively 
in concert to reduce metastasis in mice.  The combination of these two inhibitory 
drugs was effective, even though the drugs individually were not very effective.   
The establishment of distant metastases depends on th e capacity of small numbers 
of cancer cells to regenerate a tumor after entering a target tissue. The mechanisms 
that confer this capacity remain to be defined. Here we identify a role for the 
transcriptional inhibitors of differentiation Id1 and Id3 as se lective mediators of lung 
metastatic colonization in the triple negative [TN, i.e., lacking expression of estrogen 
receptor and progesterone receptor, and lacking Her2 (human epi[INVESTIGATOR_8199] 2) amplification] subgroup of human breast cance r. Although broad 
expression of Id1 has recently been documented in tumors of the rare metaplastic 
subtype, here we report that rare Id1 -expressing cells are also present in the more 
common TN subset of human breast tumors but not in other subtypes. We als o 
provide evidence that Id1 expression is enriched in clinically obtained hormone 
receptor negative lung metastases. Functional studies demonstrate that Id1 and its 
closely related family member Id3 are required for tumor initiating functions, both in

TBCRC 001: EGFR inhibition with cetuximab added to carboplatin in metastatic 
triple -negative (basal -like) breast cancer.  Basal -like breast cancer (BBC) has low

Preliminary results of a randomized phase II study of weekly Irinotecan

cetuximab in a randomized phase 2 study of weekly irinotecan (90 mg/m P2
P) and 
carboplatin (AUC 2), with or without cetuximab (250 mg/m P2
P). In the overall 
intention -to-treat study population, response rate improved marginally from 28% 
to 33% with the addition of cetuximab. Approximately half of the study population 
(78 patients) had triple -negative tumors. In that subgroup, cetuximab was 
associated with a response rate of 49% compared with 30% when chemotherapy 
was used alone. No significant differences in PFS or overall survival were 
observed in any subgroup, and significant toxicity led to dose reductions in 
starting doses of the chemother apy agents. Based on the available evidence, 
there is little reason to believe that either single -agent cetuximab or a small

8.0.1 PATHOLOGICAL RESP ONSE : The histologic response after treatment will 
be evaluated in the primary tumor and in the axillary lymph nodes removed by 
[CONTACT_642391]. In the primary tumor, cellular modifications will be evaluated in 
both the infiltrating tumoral component and in the possible ductal component, if 
applicable:  
− Analysis  of the viable residual infiltrating component (% of total tumoral mass)  
− Analysis  of the residual ductal co mponent (% of total tumoral mass)  
− Determination  of the mitotic index.  
In the axillary lymph nodes: analysis of the viable residual component.  
The criteria of pathological response will be defined according to the Sataloff  
Classification P46
P.  
The respon se in the primary tumor site will be graded from A to  D. 
Primary site response:  
T-A Total or near total therapeutic effect .

received 100 mg/m P2
P (total dose 185 mg) and was admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642359]. The  patient experienced myalgia (grade 1) and fatigue (grade 1) 
one day after infusion and was treated with a centrally acting analgesic. The 
patient recovered and was discharged without incident.  There is no known 
antidote for overdosage of Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575]. In case of overdosage, the patient should 
be closely monitored, and supportive treatment should be administered.

10.2 Common side effects of cetuximab:  
Dermatologic toxicities, including acneform rash, skin drying and fissuring, 
paronychial inflammation, and infectious sequelae (for example S. aureus sepsis, 
abscess formation, cellulitis, blepharitis, cheilitis) occurred in patients receiving 
cetuximab  therapy. Acneform rash occurred in 76 –88% of 1373 patients 
receiving cetuximab  in clinical trials. Severe acneform rash occurred in 1 –17 % of 
patients.     Acneform rash usually developed within the first two weeks of 
therapy and resolved in a majority of the patients after cessation of treatment, 
although in nearly half, the event continued beyond [ADDRESS_859663] 
patients to limit sun exposure during cetuximab therapy.   Acne -like rash (88%), 
nausea, vomiting (55%, 41%) tiredness or weakness (73%), diarrhea (72%),

Serious infusion reactions, requiring medical intervention and immediate, 
permanent discontinuation of cetuximab  included rapid onset of airway 
obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), hypotension, and/or cardiac 
arrest. Severe (NCI CTC Grade 3 and 4) infusion reactions occurred in 2 –5% of 
1373 patients in clinical trials, with fatal outcome in 1 patient.  
Appr oximately 90% of severe infusion reactions occurred with the first infusion 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_236904].    In patients evaluated during clinical 
trials, hypomagnesemia occurred in 55% of patients (199/365) receiving 
cetuximab  and was severe (NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4) in 6 –17%. The onset of 
hypomagnesemia and accompanying electrolyte abnormalities occurred days to 
months after initiation of cetuximab . Periodically monitor patients for 
hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypokalemia, during and for at least 8 
weeks following the completion of cetuximab .  
The safety of cetuximab  in combination with radiation therapy and cisplatin has

occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharm aceutical product and that does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this  treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with th e use of ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642360].  
During this clinical trial, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited 
during open -ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order 
to prevent reporti ng bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the 
specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.)  
 
 
A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:   
 results in death,  
 is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the pati ent was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe),  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9608],  
 results in persi stent or significant disability/incapacity,  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
 results in the development of drug dependency or drug abuse,  
 is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or r esult in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based 
upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient

SAE. The event responds to withdrawal of study drug (dechallenge ), and 
recurs with rechallenge when clinically feasible. (>95% certainty)  
 Probable: There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug 
and the SAE. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not 
required. (65% -95% probability)  
 Possible: There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and 
the SAE. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear. (35% -65% probability

 Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely 
important.  Full descriptions of each event will be followed by [CONTACT_103]. Thus, follow -up information which becomes available as the 
SAE evolves, as well as supporting documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129531]), should be collected 
subsequently, if not available at the time of the init ial report, and 
immediately sent using the same procedure as the initial SAE report.  
 An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion of any 
dose of a product that is considered both excessive and medically 
important.  For reporting purpos es, the sponsor considers an 
overdose, regardless of adverse outcome, as an important medical 
event.  
 AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, and reported as 
SAEs if they become serious. This also applies to subjects 
experiencing AEs that cau se interruption or discontinuation of 
ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575], or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of 
their participation in the study; such subjects should receive post -
treatment follow -up as appropriate.  
In BMS supported trials, all SAEs must be collected which occur within 30  days 
of discontinuation of dosing or completion of the patient ’s participation in the 
study if the last scheduled visit occurs at a later time.  In addition, the Investigator 
should notify BMS of any SAE that may occur after this time period which they 
believe to be certainly, probably or possibly related to ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575]. P 48

12.1 Sample size estimate  
The published study CA163 -080 has shown that the pathological complete 
response (pCR) rate is 18% based on a single agent Ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_642364], and is the 
same percentage that we assume for patients that will be treated with 
ixabepi[INVESTIGATOR_54575] (Treatment Arm 1). With total 108 patients (54 in each arm), we will 
be able to detect 25% difference in pCR rates between the arm with Ixabelpi[INVESTIGATOR_642365] (Treatment Arm 2) and Arm 1 with 81.9% power and a two -sided 
significance level of 0.05. A total of 116 patients will be enrolled to allow for 6.5% 
dropout before randomization of [ADDRESS_859669] hypothesized 25%, 27%, 29%, and 31 % difference in pCR rate in the 
treatment am [ADDRESS_859670] different differences of pathological complete response 
rates in the two arms with given sample siz e of 54 patients in each arm.

between expression of biomarkers (such as PTEN, EGFR and EGFR -pathway 
associated genes (including, but not limited to TGF-, CRYAB, NRAS, KRAS, 
AKT3, PTEN, MEK1 and KRAS amplicon genes) from the baseline and th e 
overall objective or pathologic response, controlled by [CONTACT_2939], age, and 
disease stage. The unpaired t -test will be applied to compare the difference of 
expression of biomarkers between the baseline and at surgery in the two arms. 
Benjamini and Ho chberg adjustment will be used to adjust multiple comparisons 
in expressions of all marks.  Safety and toxicity of each regimen will be tabulated 
by [CONTACT_642398]. . Radiographic efficacy 
assessment will be performed on all pati ents at the end of chemotherapy. 
Statistical significance is defined as 2 -tailed p=0.05 level. Stata Version 10 
(College Station, TX) will be used for all statistical analyses.  
12.3 Interim data analysis  
Safety  
Interim data analysis for monitoring safety w ill be conducted at every cycle for the 
two arms. Severity of adverse effects will be reported to the Data Monitoring 
Committee as part of the interim study reports.  
Interim data analysis for monitoring e fficacy  is not applicable for this protocol.

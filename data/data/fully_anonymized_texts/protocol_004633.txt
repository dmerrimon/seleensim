 CLINICAL TRIAL SUMMARY 
 
COMPOUND: GZ402665 
(olipudase alfa) STUDY No: DFI13803 
TITLE A phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, ascending dose study to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokineti cs, pharmacodynamics, and exploratory 
efficacy of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients aged <18 years with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multi-national and multi-center. More than one region as needed to allow 
enrollment of sufficient numbers of patients in a reasonable time. Potential 
countries include but are not limited to [LOCATION_002], [LOCATION_008], Italy, 
Brazil, [LOCATION_013], and [LOCATION_009]. 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 1/2 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) Primary objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa 
administered intravenously in pediatric patients every 2 weeks for 64 weeks. 
Secondary objective(s): To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile and 
evaluate the pharmacodynamics and explor atory efficacy of olipudase alfa 
administered intravenously in pediatric patients every 2 weeks for up to 64 
weeks.  
STUDY DESIGN This is a phase 1/2, multi-national, multi-center, open-label, ascending-dose study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa administered 
once every 2 weeks for 64 weeks in pediatric patients, aged <18 years, with 
non-neuronopathic acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD). 
At least 12 pediatric patients will be enrolled in a staggered fashion into the 
following 3 age cohorts and dose escalated to 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa or the 
highest tolerated dose (HTD): 
1. Adolescent cohort – patients aged 12 to <18 years  
2. Child cohort – patients aged 6 to <12 years  
3. Infant/early child cohort – patients from birth to <6 years of age. 
Initiation of dosing will be staggered among the three pediatric age cohorts. The adolescent cohort will begin dosing before the child cohort, and the child cohort 
will begin dosing before the infant/early child cohort. Patients in the child and 
infant /early child cohorts will not be dosed until a review of all safety data has 
occurred from the first [ADDRESS_246095] 8 additional pediatric patients (<12 years), corresponding to the age 
range of the child and the infant/early ch ild cohorts, will then be enrolled. These 
patients will be enrolled and treated without age cohort staggering.   
After the 64 week-treatment phase, eligible patients may enroll in the long-term 
study LTS13632 to continue receiving olipudase alfa.

 4 INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Human acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)  is a serious, rare, and life-threatening 
lysosomal storage disorder for which only palliative treatment exists. Patients with ASMD are 
unable to metabolize sphingomyelin properly due to mutations in SMPD1 , the gene encoding acid 
sphingomyelinase,  whose transcription and transla tion results in a defective acid 
sphingomyelinase (ASM) enzyme. Inactivity of ASM leads to the lysosomal accumulation of sphingomyelin and, secondarily, increases in choles terol and other related lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], mostly in the 
organs spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow. 
Historically, ASMD has been diag nosed as Niemann-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206308] (N PD) and of either types A or 
B disease. Type A (NPD A) is characterized as  the early-onset and acute neuronopathic form of 
Niemann-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206309], hepatosplenomegal y, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_206310], and death us ually before the age of 3 years ( 1). Niemann-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206311] B (NPD B) is a much milder disease with no or little neurological invol vement and is also a 
childhood disease. The most common disease manifestation is hepa tosplenomegaly; other, more 
variable features include liver dysfunction, pulm onary disease, retinal stigmata, and growth 
retardation. NPD B is usually diagnosed in ch ildhood after organomegaly is observed, typi[INVESTIGATOR_206312] [ADDRESS_246120] been reported. Patients with  this intermediate form (NPD  A/B) may develop neurologic 
symptoms during childhood and have a chronic neurodegenerative disease course. 
Genzyme is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a potential enzyme th erapy for ASMD with recombinant human acid 
sphingomyelinase (rhASM; olipudase alfa) fo r the treatment of the non-neurological 
manifestations of ASMD. This recombinantly-derived enzyme is expressed in Chinese hamster 
ovarian cells transfected with olipudase alfa  complementary DNA that encodes a 627-residue 
peptide chain. The resulting gene-product retains the enzymatic activity and lysosomal targeting of the native protein. 
Proof of concept for olipudase alfa enzyme replac ement therapy has been demonstrated in the acid 
sphingomyelinase knock out (ASMKO) mouse model of ASMD (2), which exhibits both systemic 
and neurological features of ASMD. Repeat intrav enous bolus administration of olipudase alfa to 
ASMKO mice led to dose-dependent reductions of sphingomyelin in visceral organs and in the 
lungs, to a lesser extent, but was unable to prev ent neurologic decline and prolong survival ( 3, 4). 
Although chronic dosing in the ASMKO animal model is limited as the animal succumbs to the neurologic disease resulting from the natural progression of complete ASMD and subsequent 
shortened lifespan of appr oximately 6 to 8 months. 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic , and toxicological studies conducted in the ASMKO mouse 
found significant reductions of sphingomyelin in the liver, lung, kidney, and spleen at olipudase 
alfa doses ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg in a time dependent manner; however, toxicity was 
observed in ASMKO mice given single hi gh bolus doses of olipudase alfa ( ≥10 mg/kg). The same

 single high doses did not cause toxic effects in normal mice, Sprague Dawley rats, or cynomolgus 
monkeys, which suggested that catabolites of sphingomyelin, and not olipudase alfa itself, were the cause of the toxic effects. Subsequent “debulking” studies in ASMKO mice demonstrated that a slow reduction in the sphingomyelin load over time using multiple low doses of olipudase alfa 
(4 doses of 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa administere d over 8 days) followed by a high dose (20 mg/kg 
3 days later) prevented the toxicity associated with the single initial high doses. These findings suggest that the observed toxicity is related to th e rate of substrate degradation and that step-wise 
removal of substrate likely mitigates toxicity. Furthermore, repeat, high dos es of olipudase alfa 
(30 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 7 doses) administered after a 7-day debulking period (3 mg/kg on Days 1, 3, 5, and 7), also did not cause toxicity. 
In the completed Phase 1 study ( 5), the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of 
single, ascending doses of oli pudase alfa were evaluated ( 5). Single doses of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 
and 1.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa were  infused sequentially by [CONTACT_2715] c ohort in 11 adult patients with 
ASMD. Study results found dose-related increases in ceramide, bilirubin, high sensitivity  
C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and ot her acute phase reactants in pa tients that peaked [ADDRESS_246121]-dose and resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 14. Reported a dverse events (AEs) involving constitutional 
symptoms (pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting) were consistent with first dose-related toxicity and occurred in a dose dependent fashion, as was pr eviously observed in the ASMKO mouse. Serious 
AEs (SAEs) related to olipudase alfa treatment were not report ed. The sponsor terminated the 
study subsequent to the single patient dosed at 1.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa presenting with 
hyperbilirubinemia and an acute-phase reaction with clinical symptoms. Of note, this patient was 
subsequently confirmed to have Gilbert’s syndro me. Because there were no other signs of liver 
toxicity or hemolysis, the observed hyperbilirubinemia may have been secondary to specific 
inhibition of bilirubin uptake into hepatocytes and/or glucuronide conjugation of bilirubin within hepatocytes. 
In a Phase 1b, open-label, multi-center, ascending  dose study (DFI13412) in 5 adult patients with 
ASMD, the safety and tolerabilit y of olipudase alfa was evalua ted during a 26-week treatment 
period ( 6). Patients received an initial intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg olipudase alfa and then 
dose-escalated in a step wise manner to a final target intravenous  dose of 3.0 mg/kg. All patients 
remained 3.0 mg/kg for the remainder of the treat ment period. Upon completion of the study, all 
patients enrolled into an open-label, long term tr eatment study (LTS13632) ( 7).  
Results from this trial demonstrated that the progressive, within-patie nt olipudase alfa dose 
escalation regimen was well tolerated in adult ASMD patients. No serious or severe AEs or deaths 
were reported in the study. Relate d AEs consisted predominantly of  infusion-associated reactions 
(IARs), the majority of which were  mild in severity with  all patients recovering without sequelae. 
At the end of the 6 month treatment period, a pos itive response to treatment  with olipudase alfa 
was observed in several individual efficacy parameters. This incl uded mean decreases in spleen 
and liver volumes by 25.3% and 17.1%, respectivel y; decreased interstitial lung disease scores; 
increased percent predicted  DL
CO; reduction in serum chitotriosidase, chemokine (CC-motif) 
ligand 18 (CCL18) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE); a positive trend towards a less 
pro-atherogenic lipid profile; and trends for impr ovement in quality of life assessments for fatigue 
and pain.  
A complete summary of nonclinical  and clinical experience with olipudase alfa can be found in 
the Investigator’s brochure.

 4.2 STUDY RATIONALE 
The sponsor believes that cumulative data from the single-dose Phase 1 study ( 5) and repeat-dose 
Phase 1b study ( 6) demonstrate both the safety and tolerability of the olipudase alfa dose 
escalation regimen and repeat dosing at 3.0 mg/k g; such data support the conduction of this 
repeat, ascending dose study of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients with ASMD.  
This Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, multi-national study is designed to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients less than 18 years of age with  non-neuronopathic ASMD. Olipuda se alfa will be administered every 2 weeks using a 
progressive, within-patient dos e escalation regimen, with dose escalation starting at 0.03 mg/kg 
and ending at 3.0 mg/kg. This study was al so designed to characterize olipudase alfa 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy throughout a 64-week treatment 
period.

 6 STUDY DESIGN 
6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
DFI13803 is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, ascending dose study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and explorator y efficacy of olipudase alfa 
administered once every [ADDRESS_246122] 12 patients will be enrolled in a staggered fashion into 3 age 
cohorts, with a minimum of 3 patients aged from 12 to <18 years (adoles cent cohort), 3 patients 
aged from 6 to <12 years (child cohort), and 2 patients with ages  ranging from birth to <6 years 
(infant/early child cohort).  
In this study, intravenous infusions of olipuda se alfa will be administered every 2 weeks for 
64 weeks. Patients will begin with a dose of 0.03 mg/kg olipudase alfa, which will be followed 
with dose escalation to 0.1mg/kg and then to 0.3 mg /kg olipudase alfa. Patients able to tolerate 
2 consecutive doses of 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa  will continue to dose escalate step-wise as 
indicated in Section  1.1 to 0.6 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, and the final target dose of 3.0 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa. Patients un able to tolerate 2 consecutive doses  of 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa will be 
replaced. Patients unable to to lerate the target 3.0 mg/kg dose will receive the highest dose 
tolerable every [ADDRESS_246123] 12 patients. The study will begin with the enrollment of patients from the adolescent 
cohort (ages 12 to less than 18 years). Subsequently, a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and the sponsor will review all safety data collected from the first [ADDRESS_246124] critical point in olipudase alfa 
safety. Pending the outcome of the DMC and sponsor review, patients from the child cohort (6 to less than 12 years) will be enrolled. When the first 3 patients in the child cohort complete the dose escalation phase, another DMC and sponsor review  will be conducte d. Pending the outcome of the 
DMC and sponsor review of safety data from the child cohort, the study will be opened for enrollment of the infant/early child cohort (patients younger than 6 years of age).  
To open enrollment in younger age cohorts, the sponsor and DMC will review at a minimum the 
following safety data: AEs/trea tment emergent AEs (TEAEs) incl uding IARs, clinical laboratory 
results including but not limited to hematology and clinical chemistry, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vitals, and any available immunology results as applicable. 
Following enrollment in the youngest age cohort,  an additional group of at least 8 patients <12 
years will be enrolled.  These pa tients will be included in the a ppropriate age cohort (at least [ADDRESS_246125] 2 patie nts in the infant/early child cohort) without 
staggering of enrollment/ treatment.

safety information as outlined in the DMC Charter, which is maintained separately from the study protocol.  
A formal safety review will be performed by [CONTACT_1363]:  
• When 3 patients in the adolescent cohor t complete the dose escalation phase.  
• Approximately every [ADDRESS_246129] DMC meeting until study end. Frequency 
can be adapted based on availability of patient data and key visits. 
• When 3 patients in the child cohort co mplete the dose escalation phase.  
• With all relevant data at  the end of the study. 
Relevant data for DMC reviews will be, at a minimum, AEs including IARs, clinical laboratory results including, but not limited to, hematology and clinical chemistry, ECG, vitals, and any available immunology results as applicable. 
The DMC will also review data on an ad hoc basis to assist in determining if AEs should preclude

into consideration the DM C opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] (as applicable). 
6.4 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN AND CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUPS 
The following points were taken into consid eration in the design of the study:  
Rationale for dose selection and escalation: The starting dose of 0.03 mg/kg in this pediatric 
clinical trial is [ADDRESS_246130] level (NOAEL) in single dose studies in ASMKO mice, and 1000 times below the NOAEL in repeat dose studies in ASMKO 
mice following a sphingomyelin debulking regimen. In addition, the starting dose of 0.03 mg/kg is [ADDRESS_246131] dose that was not associated with any related AEs in the Phase 1 single-dose study, 0.1 mg/kg ( 5).  
The target dose of 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa was se lected to evaluate a dose effect for olipudase 
alfa to clear sphingomyelin from the lungs in  patients with ASMD. In nonclinical studies, 
treatment of ASMKO mice with olipudase alfa led to dose depende nt reductions of sphingomyelin 
in tissues, with the liver and spleen clearing substantially more substrate than the lung, suggesting the need for a higher dose and/or longer treatment  duration to effectively treat the lung. As noted 
previously, chronic dosing in the ASMKO animal model is limited by [CONTACT_206346]’s shortened 
lifespan of approximately [ADDRESS_246132] repeat-dose for this study, 3.0 mg /kg, is supported by [CONTACT_206347]-dose 
toxicology data and experience from the adult Phase 1b trial. This dose is 10 times less than the 
30 mg/kg repeat dose NOAEL in ASMKO mice af ter a debulking regimen, and is 3.3 times less 
than the 10 mg/kg single dose, at which signifi cant toxicity and deaths were observed in ASMKO 
mice without prior debulking. In the Phase 1b study,  the safety and tolerability of within-patient 
dose escalation of olipudase alfa administered intravenously every two weeks for 26 weeks was studied. In this trial, 5 adult patients with NPD B were given as cending doses of olipudase alfa 
administered intravenously every two weeks, as tolerated, according to the following dose escalation schedule: 0.1, 0.3, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 mg/kg. The olipudase alfa dose was 
increased if the patient experienced no or only mild AEs at the lower dose. Patients were monitored in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206314] [ADDRESS_246133] 2 doses at the maximum tolerable dose; thereafter patients were maintained at their maximum tolerable dose until the end of the 26-week treatment period and discharged after dosing and a 3-hour minimum observational period. Study 
assessments included continuous AE reportin g and periodic evaluations of safety, 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,  and efficacy parameters.  
All 5 patients completed the dose escalation regimen, receiving 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa, the highest dose allowed per protocol, and remained at that dose for the remainder of the study. Three 
patients completed the dose escal ation regimen without a dose reduction or repeat. One patient 
had a dose reduction following a moderate IAR with the first olipudase alfa dose at 1.0 mg/kg;

GZ402665-DFI13803 - olipudase alfa Version number: 1 
 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 32 
 subsequently, this patient continued dose escalation to 2.0 a nd 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa. One 
patient repeated the 2.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa dos e following a moderate IAR and subsequently 
dose escalated to 3.0 mg/kg. Adverse events were mild or moderate with t hose considered related 
to olipudase alfa administrati on generally occurring between [ADDRESS_246134]-dose and attenuated with repeat dosing. 
The dose of 3.0 mg/kg will only be administered once a patient has safely escalated through the 
lower doses following the progressive dose esca lation regimen. By [CONTACT_2163], the same dose of 
olipudase alfa that caused toxic effects in ASM KO mice (ie, 10 mg/kg), did not cause toxic effects 
in normal mice, Sprague Dawley rats, or cynomolgus monkeys, suggesting that a sphingomyelin catabolite (eg, ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, or  phosphocholine) was 
responsible for the toxic effects,  and not olipudase alfa itself. 
Open label, no placebo control: Given that the primary purpose of the study is to understand the 
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and exploratory efficacy of repeat 
olipudase alfa dosing in pediatri c patients with ASMD, the study is designed as an open-label, no 
comparator group trial. 
Inclusion of infant/early child ASMD patients:  Given the rarity of ASMD and that patients with 
the non-neuronopathic form of the di sease can be diagnosed as early as birth, the age for the study 
includes patients from birth to <18 years of age.  Sixty-four week treatment period:  The 64-week treatment period will allow for a broader 
understanding of olipudase alfa safety and tolerability in a patient population rapi[INVESTIGATOR_206315]. Depending on the assessment, change from baseline in 
exploratory efficacy parameters will be evaluated through 52 weeks or 64 weeks of olipudase alfa administration. In addition, long te rm olipudase alfa safety and to lerability will also be further 
explored via the extension study LTS13632.  
Patient enrollment between age cohorts:  Enrollment of patients in DFI13803 for the first 12 
patients will begin with adolescent patients (ages 12 to less than 18 years), followed by [CONTACT_206348] (6 to less than 12 years) and ending with the enrollment of infant/early child patients (patients below 6 year s of age) as described in Section  6.1. The most critical phase for 
olipudase alfa safety is the dose escalation phase as indicated by [CONTACT_7609] 1b study data ( 6). For this 
reason, enrollment of child cohort patients will commence once 3 patie nts in the adolescent cohort 
complete the dose escalation phase, and resulting safety data reviewed by [CONTACT_206349]. The same process will occur with the enrollme nt of infant/early child patients based upon 
complete dose escalation safety data from [ADDRESS_246135] 8 patients <12 years will be enrolled.  These 
patients will be included in th e appropriate age cohort without  staggering of enrollment/ 
treatment. 
Number of patients:  A sample size power calculation wa s not performed for this study. The 
sample size approximation of [ADDRESS_246136] 12 patients will be enrolled in a staggered fashion to 3 age cohorts with a minimum of 3 
patients aged from 12 to <18 years, 3 patients aged  from 6 to <12 years, and 2 patients with ages

 ranging from birth to <6 years; followed by [CONTACT_120187] 8 additional patie nts <[ADDRESS_246137] 2 patients in the infant/early child cohort will be enrolled. 
Number of investigator sites:  In order to fully enroll the study, this will be a multi-center, 
multi-national trial. ASMD is an orphan disease with a limited number of patients available to 
participate in clinical trials. Multiple sites will allow for the inclusion of patients from multiple regions. 
6.4.1 Specific parameters rationale 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety 
Data collected in the phase [ADDRESS_246138]-dose and resolved by [CONTACT_2006] 14 ( 5). With the use of a 
progressive dose escalation regimen in the Phas e 1b adult ASMD, such increases in ceramide, 
bilirubin, hsCPR and other acute phase reactants were attenuated, with the majority of AEs being

As a result, safety biomarkers for the monitoring  of olipudase alfa in pediatric patients include, 
but are not limited to, hsCRP, ceramide, iron, fe rritin, cardiac-specific tr oponin I, calcitonin, 
interleukin (IL)-[ADDRESS_246139] ered recombinant protein plays a critical role 
in the safety of such compounds. Therefore, sa fety assessments will al so include blood samples 
for anti-olipudase alfa immunoglobulin G (IgG) an tibodies and neutralizing antibody formation in 
patients testing positive for IgG.  In the event that a patient experiences a moderate, severe, or recurrent IAR suggestive of 
hypersensitivity reactions, additional blood samp les will be collected for the evaluation of: 
• circulating immune comp lex detection; and 
• immunoglobulin E (IgE), serum tryp tase, and comple ment activation. 
Additionally, skin testing may be performed, as appropriate, in  patients who experience an IAR 
that meets the following criteria: 
• Infusion associated reaction is suggestive of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, with 
persistent symptoms of bronchospasm, hypotension  and/or urticaria requi ring intervention;  
• or any other signs or symptoms at the disc retion of the investigator or the sponsor. 
Skin testing may be another predictor of Ig E-mediated reaction and may be suggested for 
confirmation of the IgE results.

Exploratory efficacy of olipudase alfa in pediat ric patients will be assesse d by [CONTACT_206350], lung function and pulmonary imagi ng parameters, exercise testing, lipid profile, 
bone biomarkers, linear growth, and biomarkers know n to be elevated in ASMD. Such biomarkers 
include chitotriosidase, CCL18, and ACE ( 8). Several of the above assessments have been 
identified as potential indicators of clinical outcome in ASMD ( 9). 
Levels of the olipudase alfa enzymatic substr ate sphingomyelin and sphingomyelin metabolites 
will also be evaluated throughout the treatment period in plasma and/or dried blood spots.  
Changes in quality of life, fatigue and pain levels will be evaluated using age- appropriate scales, 
including the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue 
Scale and the PedsQL Pediatric Pain Questi onnaire. Changes in cognitive function will be 
evaluated in ASMD patients younger than 6 ye ars with the Developm ent Profile-3 (DP-3)

The study drug, olipudase alfa, is a sterile, non-pyrogenic white to off-white lyophilized cake 
supplied in single-use, [ADDRESS_246144] (IMP) infusions mu st be prepared by a qualified, 
authorized pharmacist (or designee) using aseptic technique. The pharmacist or designee will 
determine the quantity of vials required based on the patient’s weight a nd dose. Olipudase alfa 
doses should be adjusted every 4 weeks to account for patient growth.  
The study drug will be reconstituted with 5.1 mL  of Sterile Water for Injection to yield a 
concentration of 4.0 mg/mL olipudase alfa. The stud y drug will be further diluted in 0.9% sodium 
chloride for injection solution to  a specific volume based on dose. 
All infusions will be prepared based on patient weight (kg) and dose (ranging from 0.03 mg/kg to 
3.0 mg/kg). Therefore, the total volume of the infu sion will be dependent on  the patient's weight 
and total dose, as recommende d in the pharmacy manual.  
The diluted solution should be filtered through a 0.2 – 0.22 micron, low protein-binding, in-line 
filter during administration to remove any visible particles. 
Olipudase alfa should not be infused in th e same intravenous line with other products.

GZ402665-DFI13803 - olipudase alfa Version number: [ADDRESS_246145] administration 
For all dose levels, dosing with olipudase alfa is by [CONTACT_162147] 2 weeks (±3 days). 
The dose escalation phase and the 64-week treatme nt period begin with the first intravenous 
infusion of 0.03 mg/kg olipudase alfa on Day 1/Week 0 ( Section 1.1 ). All subsequent olipudase 
alfa administrations are to be scheduled relative to the Day 1/Week [ADDRESS_246146] infusion at 3.0 mg/kg or  with the identification of a patient-specific 
highest tolerated dose.  
Patients who tolerate the 0.03 mg/kg dose at Day 1/Week 0 (one re-challenge of the 0.03 mg/kg 
dose is allowed) will receive a dose of 0.1 mg/k g 2 weeks later. Patie nts who tolerate the 
0.1 mg/kg dose (one re-challenge of the first 0.1 mg/kg dose is allowed) will receive a dose of 
0.3 mg/kg dose 2 weeks later. Patients tolerating 2 consecutive doses of 0.3 mg/kg will be dose 
escalated step-wise to receive 2 consecutive doses at 0.6 mg/kg, followed by [CONTACT_206340] 
1.0 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg, and to the final target dos e of 3.0 mg/kg, which is maintained for the 
remaining duration of th e treatment period. Patient s unable to tolerate 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa 
will receive the highest tolerable dose every 2 we eks until the end of the treatment period. (Refer 
to Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 for patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].) 
Decisions regarding dose escalations may be made by [CONTACT_206351]. See Section  8.3.[ADDRESS_246147] in a monitored settin g with ready access to emergency resuscitation 
equipment and medications.  
Patients will receive intr avenous olipudase alfa over a period of approximately 20 minutes to 
4.5 hours, depending on the dose. The length of the infusion time may be adjusted based on the 
patient’s tolerance of the infusion. Infusions should be administered at approximate ly the same time of the day. There are no 
restrictions on the infusion timing with respect to meals.

 8.3.4 Escalation schema including dose-limiting toxicity criteria and maximally tolerated 
dose determination 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose escalation schema 
During dose escalation, patients will undergo in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206318]  10.3.1. The following criteria will determine th e next dose of olipudase alfa to be 
administered, provided the patient  does not experience an AE th at meets the patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31732] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1). Only AEs not related to the patient’s underlying condition will 
affect dose escalation. These criteria apply to AEs considered relate d to study treatment. 
1. If the patient experiences no AE or a mild AE , escalate to the next dose. 
2. If the patient experiences a moderate AE , repeat the same dose. Note:  Re-challenge for 
patients with a moderate AE at a dose of 0.03 or 0.1 mg/kg olipuda se alfa is permitted 
only once before the patient is discontinued from the study and replaced.  
3. If the patient experiences a severe AE , decrease to the prior dose. Note:  Patients with a 
severe AE at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg or 0.1 mg /kg olipudase alfa w ill be discontinued from 
the study and replaced. Re- challenge for patie nts with a severe AE at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa is permitted only once (at the lo wer dose of 0.1 mg/kg) before the patient is 
discontinued and replaced. 
If a patient presents on the day of infusion either with an unresolved AE or an acute illness, neither of which meets the patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1), the olipudase alfa infusion 
may be withheld or administered at the discreti on of the investigator. If it is not possible to 
administer a regularly scheduled infusion with in the 3-day window allowed per protocol, 
see Section  8.3.3.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose-limiting toxicity criteria 
For the purpose of this study, the even ts listed under patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1) are considered indicative of a potentia l DLT  for olipudase alfa at a given 
dose. If a potential DLT is observed, dosing will be temporarily stopped in an  individual patient or 
in the entire study, and the DMC will review the safety data. The DMC will then provide recommendation(s) to the sponsor re garding further patient treatment ( Section 6.3 ). Screening for 
eligible patients may continue  during DMC review of patient or study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_206319]. 
When olipudase alfa dosing is tem porarily halted for a particular pa tient, safety monitoring of the 
patient will continue. If the AE(s) is/are reversible and the clinical laboratory tests (including liver function tests) have reached pre-event levels, the patient will resume dosing and receive the previously-tolerated lower dose. Depending on th e patient's response, dos e escalation will either 
continue (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) or the patient will remain at the previously tolerated 
dose (ie, the patient’s highest tolerated dose [HTD]). 
The investigator is responsible for notifying his/her Institutional Review Board/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) in writing when a potential DLT is being evaluated at his/her investigative site.

infusion until the final visit will be recorded on the Prior and Concomitant Medication electronic 
case report form (e-CRF) as appropriate. 
Prior and concomitant medicati ons will be coded according to the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary. 
• Prior medications will be defined as medications that are taken [ADDRESS_246153] 
infusion of olipudase alfa in this study. 
• Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that are taken after the first infusion of olipudase alfa in this study. 
During the study, prohibited medications include those that may decrease olipudase alfa activity 
(eg, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine; tricyclic antidepressants [eg, imipramine, or desipramine]). See the study manual for a list of concomitant medicati ons that may decrease olipudase alfa activity. 
Cationic amphiphilic antihistamines, such as loratadine, desloratadine, astemizole, ebastine, 
terfenadine, and clemastine, may decr ease olipudase alfa activity. Therefore, the need for their use 
in oral or IV administration should be carefully  considered. There is no restriction on topi[INVESTIGATOR_206323].

 Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2.1), pre-treatment regimens (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, glucocorticoids) 
may be prescribed by [CONTACT_206357].  In particular, the need for cationic 
amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully considered given the 
potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity by [CONTACT_206358]. 
8.9.1 Treatment of infusion-associated reactions  
For management of mild IARs, infusion rate reductions (eg, reduced to half the rate) or temporary 
interruptions may mitigate the reaction. For moderate to severe or recurrent IARs, the investigator may consider the use of pre-treatment medications (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or glucocorticoids), if the symptoms are suggestiv e of hypersensitivity reaction, in addition to 
infusion rate reductions, interrup tions, or discontinuation.  In pa rticular, the need for cationic 
amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully considered given the 
potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity by [CONTACT_206358]. 
Patients experiencing symptoms suggestive of hy persensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic 
or anaphylactoid reactions, during olipudase alfa  infusion should be managed according to the 
general standards of care consistent with the treat ment of such reactions. If anaphylaxis or other 
severe allergic reactions occu r, immediate discontinuation of th e infusion should be considered, 
and appropriate medical treatment should be initia ted. Because of the potential for severe IARs, 
appropriate medical personnel and e quipment to perform resuscitation must be readily available in 
the event of a hypersensitivity reaction.

9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT - SAFETY 
Primary safety endpoints in clude data pertaining to the safety and tolerability of  olipudase alfa: 
assessment of AEs/TEAEs, including IARs; physi cal examinations; neurological examinations; 
clinical laboratory evaluations; vital sign m easurements; ECGs; safety biomarkers; Doppler 
echocardiography and liver ultrasound Doppl er; and immune response assessments.  
A site physician will assess safe ty findings as normal, abnormal but not clinically significant 
(NCS), or abnormal and clinically significant (CS). Any abnormal findings that meet the 
definition of an AE per Section 10.6  will be recorded on the AE e-CRF. 
9.1.1 Physical examination 
Complete physical examinations will be completed as indicated in Section 1.2  and will include the 
following observations/measurements: general app earance, examination of the skin; head, eyes, 
ears, nose, and throat; lymph nodes; heart, lung s, and abdomen; extremitie s and joints and body 
mass index. The patient’s weight will be measured without shoes and wearing the lightest possible 
clothing. At visits where height is measured, th e patient will be measured  without shoes. While 
patient height is included as part of the physical examination, z-score for height will be evaluated 
as an exploratory efficacy parameter.  
An abbreviated physical examination will assess only the general appearance of the patient and is 
only required when a complete exam is not indicated. 
Whenever possible, the same physician should pe rform the physical examination at all study 
visits.  
9.1.2 Neurological Examination 
Neurological examinations will be performed as specified in Section 1.2 . Assessments include, 
but are not limited to the patient’s mental status, posture, cranial nerves, motor system including 
muscle atrophy, tone and power, reflexes, sensor y system, coordination, ga it, and age-appropriate 
responses. The examination should be performed by  [CONTACT_206359],

 [IP_ADDRESS] Infusion associated reactions  
For a moderate/severe or recurrent IAR that is suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction (as 
defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2.1), additional blood sample s will be collected and sent to the sponsor 
for anti olipudase alfa antibody (IgG and IgE), tryptase activity, and complement activation 
testing as described below. Skin testing may also be performed if clinically indicated. 
• For IgE anti-olipudase alfa antibody testing th e same pre-infusion serum sample drawn for 
anti-olipudase alfa IgG testing (every 4 weeks) may be used if the IAR occurs at that study 
visit. If a pre-infusion sample was not drawn on that day, the patient should return to the study site or local laboratory at least 3 days after the event for a serum sample to be drawn. 
Testing is conducted for research purposes to gain additional informa tion as to individual 
patients’ responses to study trea tment and for aiding in the c linical management of patient 
safety. 
• Blood samples will be drawn within 1 to 3 hour s of an IAR for serum tryptase activity 
testing (serum) and complement activation testing (plasma), when clinically indicated. 
• Refer to the study manual for guidelines on the collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].

numbers, if relevant. The digital recording,  data storage, and transmission (whenever 
requested) need to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements (ie, FDA 21 CFR, part 11).  
The study site cardiologist should review the ECGs  in a timely manner to determine if there are 
any safety concerns and for clinical management of the patient. In the event of any CS or NCS 
abnormal findings that meet th e definition of an AE (see Section  10.6 for definitions and 
reporting), the investigator will continue to monitor the patient with additional ECGs until the ECG returns to baseline or the investigator dete rmines that follow-up is no longer necessary. The 
investigator’s or cardiologist’s assessments are to be captured in the e-CRF. 
All ECGs will also be collected and read centrally by a third party independent reviewer. 
9.1.6 Doppler echocardiogram 
A 2-dimensional and M-mode ec hocardiograph with Doppler will be performed at the visits 
specified in Section 1.2 .  
Examination will include but not be limited to: left ventricular cavity size, left ventricular mass, 
valve characterization, ejection fra ction, ventricular wall thickness,  regional wall motion, systolic 
and diastolic functions, pericardium characterization and congenital abnormalities. Pulmonary artery pressure will be dete rmined by [CONTACT_206363]. 
The review of these assessments will be performed locally by a certified cardiologist.  Whenever possible, the same cardiologist will perform all evaluations per patient.   
Wherever possible, the same physician should re view all echocardiographs for a given patient.

D-dimer. 
• Serology tests: hepatitis B antigen, hepa titis C antibodies, anti-human immunodeficiency 
virus-1 and anti-human immunodeficiency virus-2 antibodies. 
• Urinalysis: dipstick for pH, ketones, glucose, bilirubin, protein and blood.  
• If female of child bearing potential, β-hCG serum or urine test as appropriate per 
Section 1.[ADDRESS_246160] scor e all abnormal laboratory values as  either CS or NCS. Because 
some laboratory values may be outside of the nor mal value range due to the underlying disease, 
the study investigators should us e clinical judgment when considering clinical significance. 
Clinical significance is defined as any change in  laboratory parameters fr om baseline, which has 
medical relevance. If CS worsening of laborat ory values from screening levels is noted, the 
changes will be documented as an AE and scored per Section  [IP_ADDRESS].3. The study investigator 
will continue to monitor the patient with additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have 
reached normal range and/or screen ing levels, or, (2) in the judgment of the study investigator, 
abnormal values are not relate d to the administration of IMP or other protocol-specific 
procedures. 
9.1.9 Safety biomarkers 
Biomarkers for monitoring the safety of olipudase alfa include, but are not limited to hsCRP, ceramide, iron, ferritin, cardiac-specific troponin I,  calcitonin, IL-6 and IL-8. Samples will be

9.2 SECONDARY ENDPOINTS 
9.2.1 Pharmacokinetics  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sampling time 
Pharmacokinetic sampling will occur with the first infusion at 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg olipudase 
alfa and at Week 52. Specific time points and collection time windows are detailed in Section  1.[ADDRESS_246161] been 
selected for sparse sampling of pharmac okinetic parameters a nd microsampling methods 
(volumes ≤ 0.5 mL) may be used.   
If a patient receives only a partial infusion (e g, due to a safety concern), pharmacokinetic 
sampling will be repeated the next time the patient receives that dose. 
Depending on patient age, blood sa mples will be drawn for pharmac okinetic assessments using an 
indwelling catheter from an arm that is not used  for olipudase alfa infusions. The exact time of 
olipudase alfa infusions (start and stop times of infusion), rate of  infusion, time of infusion rate 
changes, and dose will be recorded along with exact sampling times.

10.4 DEFINITION OF SOURCE DATA 
Source data includes all information in original reco rds and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_2149], observations, or other activitie s necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation 
of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents. 
Source documents are original documents, data an d records (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and 
office charts, laboratory reports and notes, memo randa, patient diaries or  evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_206328] a nd complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, X-rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories, and at medical-tec hnical departments) involved in  the clinical study. Source 
documentation must be maintained to s upport information provided in the e-CRF. 
10.5 HANDLING OF TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION 
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be  fully documented in the source and e-CRF. In 
any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible.  
Pregnancy will lead to treatment discontinuation in all cases.

Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by [CONTACT_206375] 
1 infusion not administered to the patient. 
Temporary treatment discontinua tion (also referred to as treatment interruption) may be 
considered by [CONTACT_151332]. Re-initiation of treatment  with the IMP will be done under cl ose and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the investigator has cons idered to his/her best medical judgment that 
the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). Before 
re-initiation of treatment, the sponsor must be consulted to deter mine the starting dose and if dose 
escalation is required (see Section  8.3.3 and Section  8.3.4). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, the duration should be recorded by [CONTACT_206376] e-CRF. 
10.5.[ADDRESS_246204](s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at any time. 
10.5.[ADDRESS_246205] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patient may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if he/she decides to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the investigator’s or sponsor’s decision. All efforts 
should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuati on and this should be 
documented in the e-CRF. 
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons: 
• Unacceptable toxicity (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
• The need for intervention or therapy preclud ed by [CONTACT_990], and determination by [CONTACT_206377]. 
• Patient noncompliance with trea tment or if the patient wishes to be withdrawn from 
treatment. 
• The patient is no longer deriving clinical be nefit, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
• Pregnancy  
In addition, the sponsor may decide to discontin ue the trial prematurely for any other reason.  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter relevant to th e situation will be immediately 
rechecked for confirmation before making a deci sion of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for 
the concerned patient.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
Medical and scientific judgme nt should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206329] (ie, specific measures or corrective 
treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medicall y important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
a) Allergic bronchospasm, 
b) Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc),  
c) Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc). 
- Development of drug de pendence or drug abuse 
- Suicide attempt or any even t suggestive of suicidality 
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling) 
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions 
- Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study (only if judged unusual/significant by [CONTACT_206380]) 
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study (only if judged unusual/significant by [CONTACT_473]).

 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoin g monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_206381]. Such events may require further investigation in 
order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or 
removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548]. 
AESIs include the following: 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_246208] udy as well as pregnancy occurring in female 
partner of a male patient enrolled in this study. See Section 10.7  for additional details.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Infusion-associated reactions 
Some AEs may be manifestations of IARs, in cluding hypersensitivity reaction, acute phase 
reactions (APR), and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2.1, 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2.2, and Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2.3, respectively. However, original signs and 
symptoms must be reported as AEs. In the e-CRF , investigators are asked to identify whether a 
specific AE represents a clinical manifestation of the IAR. Infusion-associated reactions are defined as AEs that occur during the infusion or within up to 
24 hours after the start of infusion and are consider ed as related or possibly related to the study 
treatment by [CONTACT_8893]. An event occurring ≥24 hours after the start of an 
infusion may be judged an IAR at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor. For this study of 
olipudase alfa, IARs may present as different types of reactions, such as hypersensitivity 
reactions, APRs, and CRS. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.1 Hypersensitivity reactions 
Infusion-associated hypersensitivity reactions se en with other enzyme replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_206330]-mediated (IgG/IgE) and occur after sensitization. After subsequent 
exposure to the antigen typi[INVESTIGATOR_206331], a “sensitized” patient may 
experience a broad range of allergic reactions that can be mild to severe or life threatening. Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic reaction) is a serious, IgE mediated allergic reaction that is rapid in onset, and may cause death ( 15). Anaphylactoid, or non-immunologic  anaphylaxis, reactions may 
present with similar serious clini cal manifestations as anaphylaxi s, but without prior exposure to 
the drug and are due to nonimmunologic-m ediated mast cell de granulation. Although 
mechanistically different, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions are treated similarly. 
Common symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions seen with other enzyme replacement therapy 
include urticaria, rash, dyspnea, and less fr equently, angioedema. Other symptoms of 
hypersensitivity IARs, APRs and CRS include fe ver, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, 
pain, and headache. 
There were no IAR suggestive of hypersensitivity in the Phase 1b trial ( 6).

 [IP_ADDRESS].2.2 Acute phase reactions 
Acute phase reactions observed in the phase 1 and phase 1b studies are considered as one type of 
IAR, specific to the infused olipudase alfa therapy ( 5, 6). From observations in both studies the 
APR reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_118472] 12-72 hour s following an infusion of olipudase alfa and 
were indicative of an inflammatory response. APRs were associated with elevations in hsCRP and changes acute phase reactants including, but not  limited to, neutrophils, ir on, ferritin, fibrinogen, 
D-dimer, transferrin, albumin, protime, and par tial thromboplastin time. Patient AEs associated 
with the APR included (but are not limited to) pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and pain. Acute phase reaction is determined ba sed on combined significant laboratory findings and clinical 
symptoms. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2.[ADDRESS_246209] suggested th e possibility of cytokine releas e syndrome. The Phase 1 single 
dose study ( 5) demonstrated increases in IL-8 and IL-6; macrophage inflammatory protein 1, 
alpha component; macrophage inflammatory protein 1, beta com ponent; and other cytokines and 
biomarkers (based Myriad Rules-Based Medicine Human Multi-Analyte Profile® antigen panel) 
after a single dose of ≥0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa. In the Phase 1b trial, increases in mean IL-[ADDRESS_246210] admin istrations of olipudase alfa at doses 0.6 mg/kg 
through 2.0 mg/kg and tended to be conc urrent with acute phase responses (6). Unlike 
immunoglobulin-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, no prior antigen exposure is required for the development of CRS. Symptoms of CRS develop soon after exposure, and range from mild to 
severe. Although CRS shares some symptoms with other IARs (ie, hypersensitivity reactions and

 [IP_ADDRESS].2 Relationship to study treatment 
Assessment of the association between the AE an d study exposure is important for regulatory 
reporting. This assessment is to be made in bli nded studies and also for known comparators. For 
each AE/SAE the investigator is to deter mine whether there is a reasonable possibility 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_206383] a cau sal relationship between the study treatment and 
the AE according to the categories below: 
• Not Related: There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a cau sal relationship between exposure and the AE. 
• Unlikely Related: There is no evidence for a causal relationship between exposure and the 
AE; however, such a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• Possibly Related: There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure and the AE. 
• Related: There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between exposure and 
the AE. 
A relationship to the investigati onal product must be assigned for each AE/SAE recorded, even if 
there is only limited information at the time. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242]-up information, amending the AE/SAE report accordingly. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Severity of adverse event scoring 
Note that “severity” is not the same as “seriousness”, which is defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Intensity: 
• Mild = no modification of daily activities and does not require mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Moderate = hinders normal daily activities and/or requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic treatment 
• Severe = prevents daily activities and requires mandatory corrective/symptomatic 
treatment 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Outcome 
Outcome describes the status of the AE. The investigator will provide information regarding the 
patient outcome of each AE. Definitions for possible results of an AE include: 
• Fatal: The termination of life as a result of an AE. 
• Not recovered/not resolved: The patient has not recuperated or th e AE has not improved. 
• Recovering/resolving: The patient is recuperating or the AE is improving. 
• Recovered/Resolved: The patient has r ecuperated or the AE has resolved. 
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved  with sequelae: The AE has resolved, but the patient has 
been left with symptoms or pathology. 
• Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.

• Dose increased: Increase in the frequency, strength or amount of investigational product 
administered. 
• Dose not changed: No change in adminis tration of the inve stigational product. 
• Dose reduced: Reduction in the frequency, stre ngth or amount of investigational product 
administered. 
• Drug (investigational product) interrupted: Temporary interruption in administration of the 
investigational product. 
• Drug (investigational product)  withdrawn: Administration of the investigational product 
terminated (no further dosing). 
• Not applicable: Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. 
• Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 
10.6.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature [CONTACT_206411] [CONTACT_181286], are to be recorded  on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of 
the e-CRF. 
• Except for IARs, whenever possible, diagnos is or single syndrome should be reported 
instead of symptoms. For IARs, all symptoms must be separately recorded. 
• The investigator should specify the date of ons et, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_56390] a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by [CONTACT_2203]. 
• The investigator should take appropriate measures to follow a ll AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_760]. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS])

10.7 PREGNANCY REPORTING 
Female patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover they are 
pregnant. Pregnant female patients will be discontinued from the study.  
Male patients will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they discover that their 
sexual partner is pregnant. 
If the investigator learns of a report of pregnancy at any time after signing the informed consent, 
the investigator should follow the instructions in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  to contact [CONTACT_86622] 
24 hours. The investigator is to complete the AE  form, the Safety Complementary form and the 
Pregnancy forms. The patient will be followed un til the outcome of the pregnancy is known (eg, 
live birth or stillbirth). The investigator  will be responsible for this follow-up. 
If not otherwise established, the i nvestigator will inform the patient that the sponsor is required to 
gather information regarding the course and outco me of the pregnancy after exposure to a study 
product. The progress of the pregnancy must be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is 
known (ie, delivery, elective termination, or spontan eous abortion). If the pregnancy results in the 
birth of a child, additional follow-up information may be requested. 
The investigator will be asked to obtain follow-up information no later than 2 months after the 
gestational period to obtain mate rnal/fetal/neonatal outcome and any other relevant information.

 Follow-up information may be requested at additional time points. All study related visits/contacts 
involving a known pregnancy should include pregnancy status assessment until pregnancy outcome is known. 
Please note that pregnancy in and of itself is not an AE or an SAE. Pregnancy should not be 
entered into the e-CRF as an AE unless the investigator suspects an interaction between the study 
treatment and the contraceptive method. Additionally all informati on received will be assessed for 
any AEs and SAEs and processed per study guidelines. If the patient is discontinued because of pregnancy, pregnancy will be documented as th e reason for study discontinuation. Spontaneous 
abortions and stillbirths are reported as SAEs. 
10.8 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the s ponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at le ast reasonably related to the IMP (suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction), to the health authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate and to the investigators. 
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the health authorities, according to local regulations. 
The sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct  of the trial in the clinical 
study report. 
10.9 ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 
All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and included in the final clinical study report.

 withdrawn due to intolerance of 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa, their safety data will be reported 
up to and including the time of withdrawal, and follow-up for AEs, where applicable.  
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before study drug 
administration. 
Selected safety data may be pr esented by [CONTACT_206343]. 
For all safety data, the observation period will be divided into three segments: 
• The pre-treatment period is defined as the time between when the patient gives informed 
consent and the start of the first IMP administration (excluded);  
• The on-treatment period will be defined as the time from the start of IMP administration (included) and till end of Week  64, or end of study (EOS); 
• The post-treatment period is defined as the time after the EOS visit (excluded). 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG. 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by [CONTACT_142539]/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by [CONTACT_206384], vital signs, and ECG. 
• Potentially clinically signif icant abnormality criteria will de termine which patients had at 
least 1 PCSA during the treatment emergent pe riod, taking into account all evaluations 
performed during the treatment emergent pe riod, including unscheduled or repeated 
evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the treatment emergent PCSA percentage. 
• Treatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time from first infusion to the last study drug infusion + 14 Days.

Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse event incidence tables will be presented by [CONTACT_53157] (SOC) (sorted by [CONTACT_56496]) and preferred term (PT) sorted 
in decreasing number of patients within SOCs and further alphabetical order within the same 
number of patients over different PTs for each age group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of 
patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment period. The denominator for computation of 
percentages is the safety population for the entire study and each age group cohort. 
Adverse events will be classified into pre-define d standard categories according to chronological

pharmacodynamic markers and between sphi ngomyelin levels from different sources. 
These analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_654] c ohort – in overall population as well as by 
[CONTACT_206343], as appropriate. 
11.4.5 Exploratory efficacy analyses 
Efficacy assessments are described in Section 9.2.2 . 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the modified intent-to-treat analysis set. For each 
exploratory efficacy assessment, observed m easures, change from baseline and/or percent 
change from baseline to week 52 or 64,  as a ppropriate, will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics overall and separately by [CONTACT_206390], including 
95% confidence intervals. 
Categorical variables (eg, pulmonary imaging, chest X-ray) will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages according to time points collected from screening or baseline to Week 52 (or last study assessment). 
The same efficacy analyses will also be performed by [CONTACT_206343]. 
11.4.6 Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses 
Exploratory PK-PD analyses may be performed to elucidate exposure- response relationships 
with biomarkers of safety and/or efficacy . The PK-PD relationships may be explored 
graphically. If a relationship is apparent, PK-PD modeling may be attempted and results 
reported, as appropriate.  
11.5 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
Analysis of data, including summary tables, fi gures and listings, may be  conducted intermittently 
during the study and upon completion of a cohor t’s key milestones, eg, week 26 or 52 efficacy 
assessments.

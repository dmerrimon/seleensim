Official Title:  A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind Study of the Effects of Magnesium 
Compared to Conventional Therapy on Acute Migraine  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Date:  9/10/[ADDRESS_776913].
Patients
were
randomized
to
receive
one
of
three
study
drugs
(magnesium
sulfate
2
g,
metoclopramide
10
mg,
or
prochlorperazine
10
mg)
via
computer
randomization.
Study
drug
randomization
and
preparation
was
the
responsibility
of
the
IV
room
pharmacist
who
was
not
part
of
the
study.
The
ED
pharmacists,
physicians,
and
nurses
participating
in
administration
of
the
medications
were
blinded
to
which
drug
was
selected.
Magnesium
sulfate
2
g/50
mL
D5W,
prochlorperazine
10
mg/50
mL
D5W,
or
metoclopramide
10
mg/[ADDRESS_776914]
using
the
11-point
Numeric
Rating
Scale
(NRS)
and
recorded
on
a
data
collection
tool.
NRS
is
a
validated
tool
commonly
used
to
measure
different
types
of
pain
[15].
Secondary
endpoints
included
change
in
pain
score
from
baseline
to
60
min
and
120
min
after
initiation
of
infusion
(as
defined
on
a
11-point
NRS),
ED
length
of
stay,
and
necessity
for
rescue
analgesia
at
any
time
following
the
study
drug
administration.
Safety
endpoints
included
monitoring
for
common
adverse
effects
related
to
the
study
drugs—primarily
hypotension,
flushing,
akathisia,
dystonia,
nausea,
vomiting,
dizziness,
drowsiness,
or
other
self-reported
adverse
effects
[16-18].
Patient
baseline
characteristics
were
also
collected,
which
included
patient-reported
past
medical
history
and
analgesic
use
prior
to
presenting
to
the
ED.
Analysis
A
sample
size
of
264
subjects
(88
subjects
per
treatment
arm)
was
calculated
to
detect
a
difference
of
1.4
points
in
the
NRS
between
groups
to
achieve
a
power
of
80%
[19].
Statistical
significance
was
defined
a
priori
as
p
<
0.05,
and
normality
was
assessed
using
the
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk
test.
Descriptive
statistics
were
used
for
nominal
data,
while
ordinal
and
categorical
data
were
evaluated
using
Mann-Whitney
U
and
Pearson's
χ2
,
respectively.
Between-group
comparisons
were
made
using
one-way
ANOVA
and
Kruskal-Wallis,
as
appropriate
for
all
continuous
data.
A
post
hoc
non-inferiority
analysis
of
the
primary
endpoint
was
conducted
using
Welch's
t-test
with
a
non-inferiority
margin
of
1.4.
Data
analysis
was
performed
through
SAS
software
for
Windows
(Version
9.4).

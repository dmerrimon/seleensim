7.Background and Significance:  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_116019], no consistent pharmacological treatments exist for  this 
disorder.  Nabilone (Cesamet®) is a synthetic cannabinoid FDA -approved for  cancer 
chemotherapy with behavioral and physiological effects that overlap with Δ9-THC (Stark 
and Dews 1980, Mendelson and Mello 1984).   Nabilone is safe and well -tolerated, with 
side effects that diminish with repeated administration (Lemberger et al. 1 982).  
Nabilone’s properties make it an attractive option for study as an agonist treatment, and 
it may be a better choice than dronabinol for agonist treatment because nabilone is not 
cross -reactive with urine assays used to detect recent cannabis use (Fr aser and 
Meatherall 1989).  
 
8.Research and Design Methods:  
 
8.1. Overview  
We will conduct a Stage 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_116020] a 
medication to treat cannabis dependence. (FIGURE 1) In a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled trial, 60 cannabis -dependent subjects ages 18 -45 will receive 
medical management (MM) over a 10 -week period, with half receiving nabilone 
treatment and half receiving placebo.  Participants will receive either 6 mg nabilone or 
placebo in addition to medical management (MM) over a [ADDRESS_129594] (IRB)

[ADDRESS_129595]. Hill.  
 
8.2. Participants  
      Male and female participants  (ages 18 -45) will be recruited from the [LOCATION_011] 
metropolitan area via websites, newspaper advertisements, flyers, and word -of-mouth.  
In order to meet our target sample of 60 study completers - (participants who complete 
all study procedures), we expect to recruit about [ADDRESS_129596] 90 sign the 
informed consent form . (Our target sample size is 60 completers with 30  per group: 30 
Placebo and 30 Nabilone).  From ongoing studies of cann abis smokers at McLean, we 
expect to recruit at least 3 participants a month for our study.   
 
8.2.1.  Study Procedure  
8.2.1.a. Recruitment and Intake.  
Interested individuals will respond to advertisements by [CONTACT_47067] a message (first 
name [CONTACT_116042] ) in the BPRL recruiting voice mailbox.  Research 
assistants will call them back with [ADDRESS_129597] an initial phone screen 
that takes about 15 minutes.  It will cover basic inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well 
as a brief description of t he study to determine if the person is interested in participating. 
If the volunteer is appropriate and agrees to participate, they will be invited to come to 
the BPRL for a physical and psychiatric evaluation (SCID).  Treatment alternatives will 
also be o ffered to the prospective participant if they decide not to participate or are not 
eligible for participation.  
The initial assessment interview will be done by a research assistant and the study 
physician and take about [ADDRESS_129598] be asked to sign the informed 
consent (see 8.2.1.b ). Once they have agreed to participate, they will undergo a 
comprehensive evaluation that will include medical, psychiatric, and drug use histories 
as well as physical, psychiatric, and laboratory examination s. The study will be 
explained and an intake package, including all Drug and Alcohol and Mood and 
Impulsivity Assessments (see Table 8.1), will be administered.  More specifically, the 
participants will undergo the following screening procedures:a) Detaile d history of 
cannabis use; b) Review of DSM -IV criteria for cannabis dependence; c) Medical history 
and concomitant medication record; d) Physical examination; e) Laboratory screen that 
includes CBC, electrolytes, and BUN/creatinine; f) Urine measurement o f THC; g) 
Urinalysis and urine pregnancy test for women; h) 12 -lead electrocardiograph (EKG) i) 
urine toxicology screen; j) blood alcohol testing; k) Columbia Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS). Suicide risk will be assessed by [CONTACT_116030].

[ADDRESS_129599] consent 
documentation.  Prior to the volunteer being asked any question about his/her health, 
the volunteer will be given a consent form to read.  The research assistant will go  over it 
in detail with the volunteer .  After a physician investigator answers any questions the 
volunteer may have concerning the study, he/she will be asked to provide their informed 
consent to the licensed physician investigator. If  enrolled in the stud y, consent to 
communicate with their other clinicians will be obtained.  Clinicians will be notified of 
their patients’ enrollment in the study, thus allowing them to carefully monitor for 
changes in mood while they are undergoing treatment to stop use of cannabis.  
 
8.2.1.c. Randomization.   Participants will be stratified according to their self -reported 
frequency of cannabis use in the past 30 days:  1) daily use; and 2) non -daily use.  The 
stratification procedure will guard against the possibility that on e of the experimental 
conditions (i.e., nabilone or placebo) will be overrepresented by [CONTACT_116031], while non -
daily users will predominantly be randomized into the other condition.  
 
8.2.1.d. Availability and Flow of Subjects into Treatment.   We plan to scr een 120 
participants in the course of 20 months to achieve our desired sample size.   
 
8.2.1.e. Study Visits.   Participants will come to the clinic twice a week.  One visit will 
include a medical visit (dispensing of pi[INVESTIGATOR_116021]; see Sectio ns 
8.3.1.b, 8.3.2) and research assessments, including a urine screen (see Section 8.5.2.a 
and Table 8.2 ).  The other visit will consist only of a urine screen (see Section 8.5.2.a).  
After the [ADDRESS_129600] 1 weekly 
Diary/Actiwatch visit to hand in their daily diaries, have their Actiwatch data 
downloaded, and provide a urine sample.  
 
8.2.1.f. Clinical Emergencies .  If a participa nt is intoxicated, the participant will be 
evaluated medically, sent home in a taxi when safe, and the appointment re -scheduled.  
If a participant experiences a problem that requires clinical intervention during the 
course of the study (e.g., mania, suicid al ideation, or dangerous intoxication), we will 
evaluate the situation medically, make an appropriate recommendation, and help the 
participant to implement this plan.  This could involve hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116022], referral 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s outpatient pro gram, or other medical or psychiatric treatment, as 
clinically appropriate.  
 
8.2.1.g. Participant Payments  
 
Volunteers will receive a $50 remuneration for attending the initial assessment interview 
and an additional $50 for the baseline visit.  They may ear n $[ADDRESS_129601] 5 weeks of treatment and then $[ADDRESS_129602] 5 weeks of treatment, and they may earn $50 
for attending the follow -up assessment at 14 weeks. They ma y earn $30.00 for each of 
three Actiwatch /Diary visits at weeks 11, 12, and 13 as well as $50 for the final follow -
up visit.  Additionally they may receive a $40 bonus for attending all follow -up visits and 
returning the Actiwatch.  They may also receive a  bonus of up to $[ADDRESS_129603] (IRB)

8.3. Treatment.  
8.3.1 Nabilone.  
8.3.1.a. Rationale for Dose. Nabilone (Cesamet®, Meda  Pharmaceutical s, Somerset , 
NJ) is a potent synthetic cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) agonist that received FDA 
approval in 2006 for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer 
chemotherapy (Cesame t® product information).  Nabilone will be titrated to [ADDRESS_129605]. Haney’s group used up to [ADDRESS_129606] (IRB)  
                                   Nabilone for Cannabis Dependence Detailed Protocol       
   
5 daily without incident (Haney et al. 2013, Bedi et al. 2013) in cannabis -dependent 
participants and anothe r group have used up to 3 mg daily in a participants with 
peripheral neuropathy (Toth et al. 2012, Bestad and Toth 2011).   As a result, the FDA 
has permitted a maximum dose of nabilone [ADDRESS_129607]. Hill’s IND 107862.    
 
  
8.3.1.b. Procedures for Dis pensing Medication.    
Subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo or nabilone.  [CONTACT_116044] or the 
research assistants will present [ADDRESS_129608] will receive  blister packs containing 1 week of medication  or placebo, separated 
into daily doses.  Subjects will be asked to return unused pi[INVESTIGATOR_116023]; study staff will then perform a pi[INVESTIGATOR_116024].  All groups will receive 
capsules following the same schedule: 4 capsules  twice daily for 10 weeks.  Each 
capsule will contain either nabilone or placebo, and riboflavin 25 mg (to help assess 
compliance).  Subjects in the nabilone group will take 1 mg of nabilone at bedtime for 1 
week, then increase to 1 mg of nabilone twice da ily (between 7:00 -9:00 a.m. and 9:00 -
11:00 p.m.)  for [ADDRESS_129609] 
pharmacotherapy (CSAT 2004).  Participan ts will remain in the natural settings 
laboratory for [ADDRESS_129610] 1) pulse rate less than 120 beats per minute; 
2) blood pressure less than 140/90 . 
 
8.3.1.c. Dose Adjustment .    
Subjects who cannot tolerate dose i ncreases either subjectively or by [CONTACT_116032] (hypotension, for example), will remain at the dose they were taking prior to 
the increase (4 mg daily, 2 mg daily, or 1 mg daily).  Subjects who experience 
uncomfortable side effects (e.g., drow siness or vertigo) may have their dose lowered 
from 6 capsules a day to 4 or from 4 capsules a day to 2; a subject receiving active 
nabilone, for example, could then have a dose reduction from 6 mg of nabilone daily to 
4 mg daily (or lower).  None of the s ubjects in Study [ADDRESS_129611] (IRB)  
                                   Nabilone for Cannabis Dependence Detailed Protocol       
   
[ADDRESS_129612] will continue to be 
followed for research visits.  
 
 
 
 
8.3.2.  Medical Management Visits.  
 
8.3.2.a. Weekly Visit s with the Study Physician.   Participan ts will be seen weekly during 
treatment by [CONTACT_116033].  In addition to dispensing the study 
medication, the physician will utilize Medical Management (MM) (Pettinati et al 2004) , a 
manualized treatment that was used in the NIAAA COMBINE Study.  MM was derived 
from empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -tested manualized therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Carroll and O'Malley 1996, Mason and 
Goodman 1997)  that were originally designed to approximate a primary care approach 
to the treatment of a lcohol dependence.  The treatment is delivered by a medical 
professional who monitors medication side effects, provides strategies to increase 
medication adherence (Volpi[INVESTIGATOR_116025]. 1997) , and supports abstinence.  The initial [ADDRESS_129613] as well  as the “Frequency and Intensity of Side Effects 
Rating/Global Report of Side Effects Burden” (Wisnie wski et al. 1997) , a [ADDRESS_129614] a favorable safety profile; it 
has been well -tolerated in several clinical trials and no adverse events have been 
reported (Ware et al. 2008, Frank et al. 2008, Skrabek et al. 2008).  Drug -drug 
interactions are not a major concern with nabilone because it does not induce 
cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzymes and lacks significant 3A4 inhibitory effect (Nahas et 
al. 2002). Nonetheless, we will monitor safety through the standardized methods 
described above in the MM visits.  We will have a low threshold for obtaining additional 
medical workup during the study if the subject reports medical symptoms.  If a 
participan t has a clin ically significant laboratory or other medical abnormality that cannot 
be attributed to another cause, the participan t’s medication will be discontinued and the 
participan t will be followed for research visits.

7  As discussed above in Section 8.2.i.a, the  study physician will perform a physical 
examination and obtain an ECG at baseline and at 14 weeks.  Laboratory data 
(urinalysis, blood chemistries, complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function 
tests) will be done at baseline and at [ADDRESS_129615] urine pregnancy tests  weekly each time a urine sample 
is given in addition to pregnancy tests at weeks at 4, 10, and 14 weeks during 
treatment; women who become pregnant will have their medication discontinued and 
will be referred to an obstetrician; like all participan ts, they will still be followed for 
research visits.  
 
8.5. Research Measures.  
See Table 8.2  for the schedule of assessments.   
 
8.5.1.  Diagnostic Assessment.   To make the diagnos is of cannabis dependence, the 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID) (First 1996)  will be used.   
 
8.5.2.  Drug and Alcohol Use Assessment.   
8.5.2.a. Urine Screens .  The primary outcom e measure will be cannabis use, as 
measured by [CONTACT_27656] -weekly quantitative urine screens during treatment.  Cannabis is a 
particularly challenging drug of abuse for measuring outcome because of the false -
positive urine screens that can occur as the result of  long-term accumulation of 
cannabis metabolites. In an attempt to avoid false -positive results, we will obtain 2 
supervised urine samples weekly:  1 at the medical visit and 1 on another day, ordinarily 
with 3 -4 days separation from the clinical visits (e. g., Monday -Thursday, Tuesday -
Friday, or Monday -Friday); this should maximize the time frame covered by [CONTACT_116034].  We will send the urine samples to Quest Diagnostics Laboratory  (Cambridge, 
MA, a NIDA -certified laboratory), where the urines will b e screened by [CONTACT_116035] 11 -nor-carboxy -∆ 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC -COOH) as well as 
other drugs of abuse.  Urine creatinine concentrations will also be measured to assess 
urine concentration.  The threshold for detection of THC -COOH will be 20 ng/ml. 
Samples positive for this metabolite will undergo further analysis by [CONTACT_116036] -mass spectroscopy to obtain quantitative  THC-COOH concentration; 
we will then calculate the ratio of this metabolite to urine creatinine concentr ation.  We 
will adopt the method of Heustis and Cone (1998)  to differentiate new marijuana use 
from residual drug excretion as a result of previous use; these recommendations are 
based on their contr olled clinical studies of urinary excretion profiles of creatinine and 
marijuana metabolites following marijuana administration in humans.  We will label a 
urine negative (i.e., abstinent from cannabis) if 1) the ratio of THC -COOH to creatinine 
in the urin e does not increase by >50% from the ratio obtained in the previous urine 
screen, and 2) the participan t also reports using no cannabis since the previous urine 
test.

[ADDRESS_129616] -worn, battery -operated activity monitors that are 
excellent devices for monitoring multiple drug use, drug craving, and sleep/wa ke activity 
(Licata et al., under review).  We will provide participan ts with a packet of 1 page, self -
addressed, prepaid postage Daily Diary  pages which participan ts will be asked to fill out 
between 7:00 and 9:[ADDRESS_129617] cannabis 
use data using the Timeline Follow Back (TLFB) (Sobel a nd Sobel 1992) protocol that 
was developed for alcohol.   
 
8.5.2.c. Other Drug and Alcohol Use Assessment. Severity of cannabis and other 
substance use and its associated problems will be assessed at baseline and weeks 
4,10, and 14 with the Addiction Severit y Index  (ASI, 5th edition) (McLellan et al. 1992) , a 
widely -used and independently -validated interview that measures the severity of 
problems in 7  areas of functioning that are frequently affected in patients with SUDs:  
drug use, alcohol use, employment, legal status, medical condition, social functioning, 
and psychological status.  In addition to our primary focus on cannabis  use (urine 
screens pl us days of use), we will examine other substance use (using urine screens 
plus days of other substance use).  We will use this method to determine the number of 
days of cannabis  use and of any substance use (and conversely, days of abstinence).  
We will ex amine ASI composite scores as secondary measures of substance use 
outcome.  We will also use the self -administered Drug and Alcohol Use Questionnaire .  
This measure, administered at baseline, addresses the context of lifetime and recent 
drug and alcohol us e, as well as sociodemographic data.  At each treatment visit, 
patients will complete a brief Weekly Drug and Alcohol Use Inventory , indicating their 
number of days using marijuana, other drugs, and alcohol during the previous week.  
The Marijuana Goals Qu estionnaire  (Griffin et al. 1989)  is a brief questionnaire  
administered at baseline to assess treatment goals, specifically, whether a participan t is 
seeking abstinence or reduction in cannabis  use.  A 12 -item self -administered 
questionnaire, the Marijuana Craving Questionnaire (MCQ) , will be used to assess 
cravi ng at baseline and weekly during treatment and at the 14 -week follow -up visit 
(Heishman et al. 2009).  A short form of the Marijuana Withdrawal Checklist (MWC) will 
be used to assess withdrawal symptoms at baseline and weekly during treatment and at 
the 14 -week follow -up visit (Budney et al. 1999). If there is a discrepancy among results 
obtained by [CONTACT_116037], we will meet with the 
participan t and have a conversation about their substance use.  After the conversation, 
we will  use our clinical judgment to determine the level of use that we believe is most 
accurate for that participan t.  A new 6 -page questionnaire that we created, the 
Marijuana Perceptions of Risk and Experiences Questionnaire (MPRE),  will be 
distributed at base line, and once during weeks 4, 10 and 14 to assess each participant’s 
perceptions of cannabis risk/harm and his or her motivations to quit/continue using 
cannabis throughout the course of treatment.  
 
8.5.3. Mood and Impulsivity Assessments.   We will monitor  participan ts’ mood 
throughout the study using 3 assessments. The Beck Anxiety  Inventory  (BAI) is a [ADDRESS_129618] (IRB)  
                                   Nabilone for Cannabis Dependence Detailed Protocol       
   
9 item self -report measure that can be used to a ssess the severity of anxiety . The Quick 
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS -SR) is a short self -report questionnaire 
for depressive symptoms used successfully in the STAR*D project.  The Positive and 
Negative Affect Scale(PANAS)  is a 20 -item self -report scale in which mood variables 
are rated by [CONTACT_116038] a 1 -5 scale.   The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS -11) is a 
commonly used tool to measure impulsivity in various neuropsychological disorders as 
well as in substance abuse.  Three dimensions can be assessed using this scale, which 
include Cognitive Impulsivity, Motor Impulsivity, and Non -plannin g Impulsivity.

8.6.Medication Adherence Assessment.   The proposed studies involve chronic 
administration of medication given under double -blind conditions. Three methods of 
McLean Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_116017] (IRB)  
                                   Nabilone for Cannabis Dependence Detailed Protocol       
   
10 medication adherence will be used as multiple methods are preferred (Weiss 2004): 1) 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_116026]; 2) participan ts will record when they take their capsules on the 
ActiWatch -Score device; 3) urinary riboflavin levels (a 25 mg dose will be given with 
each dose of medication) will be measured using a UV spectrophotometer.  If there is a 
discrepancy among results obtained by [CONTACT_15252], we will meet with the participan t 
and have a conversation about their medication adherence.  After the conversation, we 
will use our clinical judgment to determine the level of adherence that we believe is 
most accu rate for that participan t. 
 
8.8. Data Management  
All data collected will be de -identified with participan t ID numbers and used for 
research purposes only.  Written records will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked 
office.  They will be destroyed after [ADDRESS_129620] of nabilone on cannabis use patterns, we 
propose to use the generalized estimating equations (GEE) approac h to longitudinal 
analysis, appropriately accounting for the positive correlation among repeated urine 
screen assessments within the same individual.   
Analyses of secondary substance use outcomes will focus on the number of days of 
cannabis use and of any  substance use (and conversely, days of abstinence) during 
treatment and post -treatment follow -up.  In addition, we will also examine the ASI Drug 
and Alcohol composite scores.  Frequency of days of cannabis use (and any substance 
use and days of abstinenc e) will be analyzed via a log -linear (or Poisson) regression 
model, controlling for pre -treatment frequency of days of cannabis use.  Although log -
linear regression methods are considered appropriate for the analysis of count or 
frequency data, in many bio medical applications, count data have variability that far 
exceeds that predicted by [CONTACT_116039]; we expect that days of cannabis use 
(and any substance use and days of abstinence) will not be an exception.  Linear mixed 
effects models will be  used to examine the effect of treatment group on changes in the 
ASI Drug and Alcohol composite scores during treatment and post -treatment follow -up 
assessments (as determined by [CONTACT_48990] -by-time interaction in the linear mixed effects 
regression models).   The linear mixed effects model will include random intercepts and 
slopes to appropriately account for correlation among repeated measures and 
heterogeneity of variance over time; the model will be fit using PROC MIXED in SAS.

[ADDRESS_129621] -treatment follow -up, using the QIDS , BAI, and PANAS; changes in 
risk of mood epi[INVESTIGATOR_116027] -treatment follow -up assessments will 
be analyzed via a logistic regression  model (similar to the logistic model above) that will 
be fit using the GEE approach (as implemented in PROC GENMOD in SAS) to account 
for correlation among repeated binary outcomes on the same individual.  To examine 
the effect of nabilone on changes in r isk for mood epi[INVESTIGATOR_116027] -
treatment follow -up, the logistic regression model will include the effects of treatment 
condition and the baseline measureof the outcome.  
 
9. Human Subjects and Recruitment Strategies:  
 
9.1. Sample Size:  In order to meet the target sample of  [ADDRESS_129622] 90 of them sign the informed consent 
form.  
 
9.2. Advertising:  Participan ts will be recruited via websites, newspaper 
advertisements, flyers on campu s, and word -of-mouth.  We will not specifically recruit 
participan ts from particular patient units at McLean.  Participan ts may not be inpatients

 Page [ADDRESS_406795] injury (SCI) results in rapid and severe osteoporosis with decreases in bone mass of up to 45% within the first [ADDRESS_406796] bone metabolism and bone turnover. Bone is a highly vascularized organ with an extensive network of arteries, arterioles, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_329247], maintenance, and repair; [1], [2] without sufficient and well-regulated blood flow, bone cannot maintain its integrity. [3] Thus, reductions in bone perfusion may be a key contributor to bone loss post SCI. There is extensive arterial remodeling below the lesion that occurs soon after injury, leading to significant structural maladaptations such as decreased femoral artery diameter and increased wall thickness. [4], [5] These changes relate to significant alterations in both vasoconstrictor and vasodilatory response. For example, decreases in flow with leg dependency are greater in those with SCI, indicating enhanced myogenic vasoconstriction. [6], [7] Moreover, increases in leg blood flow with with reactive hyperemia are markedly less in those with SCI, indicating impaired myogenic vasodilatory capacity. [7]–[9] Hence, the extensive structural changes post SCI likely result in diminished flow to the leg due to both greater vasoconstriction and lesser vasodilation. This potentially leads to restricted flow to bone in those with SCI. Furthermore, these hypothesized alterations in vasoconstrictor and vasodilatory capacity may also relate to changes in functional blood flow responses in bone. Compressive loading increases bone metabolism requiring greater blood flow. However, if bone perfusion in response to loading is impaired in SCI due to structural changes, strategies to improve bone health based on loading could be largely ineffective. In addition, the structural changes occurring post injury, relate to alterations in nitric-oxide (NO) mediated vasodilation, another potential key mechanism of maintaining appropriate perfusion to bone. While there is almost no research investigating NO vasodilation in bone in humans, a handful of studies suggest that in skeletal muscle, those with SCI have increased NO-mediated vasodilation compared to controls.[10], [11] This implies that there is either increased NO production or similar peripheral NO that are unopposed by [CONTACT_329264]. However, given the lack of information on NO mediated vasodilation in the tibial vasculature, it would be prudent to first establish it potential role in healthy individuals prior to exploration in those with SCI. Afterwards, we will investigate the impact of peripheral vascular remodeling on bone perfusion after SCI. Furthermore, we propose to investigate the effect of mechanical loading, on bone perfusion in those with SCI compared to able-bodied individuals.  A critical limitation to the study of bone blood flow in humans has been the lack of noninvasive assessments. The dense nature of bone makes it difficult to investigate perfusion and the techniques used to quantify circulation in other tissues are either difficult or impossible to apply to bone in vivo. This study will use a recently developed custom-made near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device that can non-invasively assess blood content in bone. [12] While NIRS has been used to assess perfusion in soft tissue, [13], [14] it has not been extensively used to assess perfusion in bone. However, NIRS has been shown to provide reproducible results in controlled

 Page 3 of 13 Bone blood flow in SCI v7, May 24, 2022    conditions, [15] and can track dynamic changes in bone perfusion. [16], [17] In our preliminary work, we used NIRS to assess physiological changes in blood content in the tibial cortical bone in humans. Here, we aim to extend our preliminary work by [CONTACT_329265].   II. SPECIFIC AIMS  1) Determine if popliteal artery structural changes are reflected in altered myogenic control of tibial bone perfusion post SCI. Hypothesis: Compared to able-bodied, those with SCI will demonstrate greater popliteal artery wall thickness and smaller diameter that will relate to both greater myogenic vasoconstriction (in response to leg dependency) and lesser myogenic vasodilation (in response to reactive hyperemia) in tibial bone.   2) Determine if popliteal artery structural changes are reflected in lesser increases in tibial bone perfusion during compressive loading post SCI.  Hypothesis: Compared to able-bodied, those with SCI will demonstrate greater popliteal artery wall thickness and smaller diameter that will relate to smaller increases in bone perfusion with increasing loading conditions.  3) Determine if nitric-oxide mediated vasodilation is present in the tibial bone vasculature of able-bodied. Hypothesis: In able-bodied, the tibial bone vasculature vasodilates in response to a nitric oxide donor.  All able-bodied volunteers will complete both aim1 and aim2. Only a subset of volunteers with SCI – those with time since injury between [ADDRESS_406797] injury – will be included for aim 2. The proposed study will investigate the control of bone perfusion in the SCI population as it relates to vascular remodeling and loading conditions.  III. SUBJECT SELECTION  Inclusion criteria  We anticipate we will recruit 29 individuals (males and females) aged 18 to 40 years with injuries, American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_329248] (AIS) A and B and C. For aim 2, only individuals with SCI with complete injuries between [ADDRESS_406798] injury will be included. In addition, we will recruit 29 healthy individuals (males and females) age and gender matched to enroll for this study.  Exclusion criteria (for both able-bodied and SCI groups)  
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 4 of 13 Bone Blood Flow in SCI v7, May 24, 2022 Clinical signs or symptoms of heart disease, hypertension, coronary disease, diabetes, other neurological disease, cancer, abnormal resting ECG, pregnant women, underweight and obese individuals (body mass index between 18.5 and 29.9), use of amphetamines (Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta) in the past [ADDRESS_406799] no recent weight changes > [ADDRESS_406800] severe anemia. Nitroglycerin is contraindicated in patients with severe anemia (large doses of nitroglycerin may cause oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin and could exacerbate anemia). Those with SCI will have no extreme spasticity to avoid spontaneous contractions and cannot be on baclofen due to its potential autonomic effects.  IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT We will recruit from eligibile ASRT participants study (Partners IRB Protocol # 2013P000604. Additionally, we will reply on word of mouth and referrals from the spi[INVESTIGATOR_329249], the outpatient therapy department, and the Exercise for Persons with Disabilities (ExPD) program at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network to enroll participants in this study. Flyers will be posted at SRH outpatient sites and/or given to pontential subjects along with a phone number to call if they are interested in learning more about the study. Our laboratory has been regularly enrolling SCI patients for research from the SRN. For the able-bodied participants, in the past, we have successfully recruited young males and females by [CONTACT_329266]/or by [CONTACT_329267]. The website ad has a short description of the project and a number to contact [CONTACT_329268]. When the potential subject makes contact [CONTACT_162376], we use a phone screening of health questions and a short description of the study. This process usually takes [ADDRESS_406801] their current or future care at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_329250].  V. STUDY PROCEDURES Study Visit 
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 5 of 13 Bone blood flow in SCI v7, May 24, 2022    Once recruited for the study, the volunteers will visit the laboratory for a health screening session to further determine eligibility. This 30-minute screening session includes obtaining informed consent, health history, and obtainingt weight and tibial length measurements.  Once volunteers complete the screening process and meet the study inclusion criteria they will continue the visit to investigate tibial perfusion in response to leg dependency, reactive hyperemia, and increasing loading conditions . The study visit will take approximately 3 hours for participants that complete both aims and approximately 1.5 hours for those with SCI that complete only aim 1.   Detailed procedures At the beginning of the study visit, we will obtain measurements of the popliteal artery thickness and lumen diameter using Doppler ultrasound (SonoSite Edge II, Fujifilm SonoSite). Throughout the study for the first aim, we will measure whole leg blood velocity in the popliteal artery using Doppler ultrasound (Multidop T2, DWL). Throughout the protocol, volunteers will be instrumented for measurement of tibial blood flow using a NIRS system (see Measurements below). The measurements will be taken in the same leg.  Assessing tibial perfusion in response to leg dependency and reactive hyperemia (able-bodied and volunteers with SCI) We will use leg dependency and reactive hyperemia to assess myogenic vasoconstriction and myogenic vasodilation, respectively. This approach will provide insight to the relation between popliteal artery structure and myogenic vasoconstrictor response (leg dependency) and myogenic vasodilator response (reactive hyperemia), respectively.  Leg dependency (i.e. the limb is lowered below heart level such that the knee is flexed at 90deg) results in an increased arterial transmural pressure, thereby [CONTACT_329269]. [6] Past work showed that those with SCI have more pronounced decreases in blood flow during leg dependency compared to able-bodied. [7] Thus, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses might be enhanced in the paralyzed legs. In addition, reactive hyperemia (i.e. increased calf blood flow in response to sustained ischemia via proximal thigh cuff inflation) is significantly lesser in SCI compared to able-bodied. [7]–[9] Thus, the myogenic vasodilatory capacity of the arterieres in the legs of those with SCI might be impaired.  Throughout this aim, we will monitor continuously calf blood flow and tibial bone perfusion in the same leg. With the subject in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], we will obtain a 5 minutes resting baseline, followed by 5 minutes with the limb lowered below heart level (knee flexed at 90 deg). After [ADDRESS_406802] supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], a pressure cuff placed above the knee will be inflated to supersystolic values (>200 mmHg) for 10 minutes. Data will be obtained for a 5 minutes resting baseline, 10 minutes during cuff inflation, and 5 minutes after cuff release.  
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 6 of 13 Bone Blood Flow in SCI v7, May 24, 2022 Assessing tibial perfusion in response to exogenous nitric-oxide (NO) (able-bodied)  We will use an exogenous NO donor to assess NO-mediated vasodilation in the tibial bone vasculature of able-bodied. We will use one tablet of sublingual nitroglycerine (Nitroglycerine 0.4mg Sublingual table) as the NO donor. With the subject in supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], we will obtain a 5 minutes resting baseline, followed by [CONTACT_329270], for 15 minutes. Throughout, we will continuously monitor heart rate and blood pressure, and calf blood flow and tibial bone perfusion in the same leg.  Assessing tibial perfusion in response to increasing loading conditions (able-bodied and individuals with SCI with time since injury between 3 and 24 months) This approach will define the relationship between popliteal artery structure and magnitude of bone perfusion during loading of different magnitudes.  We will use a custom tibial loading device (see Measurements below) to provide three periods of static bone loading, in random order: 1) 10% of body weight, 2) 30% of body weight, 3) 50% of body weight. After [ADDRESS_406803] of a 5 minutes resting baseline, 10 minutes of loading, and 5 minutes of recovery.  Measurements  Tibial Blood Flow. A custom made bone optical spectropsopy device that uses near-infrared (NIR) light will be used to continuously monitor tibial perfusion. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a safe, non-invasive, and inexpensive alternative to analyze hemodynamic changes in the biological tissues using light in the range of 600 to 1000 nm. The system has been previously used in Protocol #2014P002003 without any side effects. The system has two detectors allowing estimation of hemoglobin changes in a two layer (skin and bone) model and uses a broadband light source and high-sensitivity spectrometers to yield full NIR spectral information. The instrument uses a white-light tungsten halogen lamp (Fostec DCRII, Dallas, TX) to deliver light through a large optical fiber bundle to the skin. Two detector fibers are coupled with spectrometers (Mini-spectrometer TG C9405CB, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan), placed at 1 and 2 cm distances from the source. Both spectrometers allow measurement of the diffusely reflected light between 650 nm and 800 nm with 5 nm resolution. The light source and the two detectors are attached to a custom made probe head placed on the skin surface directly over the tibia. Light propagates between the source and the detectors in “banana-shaped” sensitivity functions and penetrates shallower for more closely separated source-detector pairs and more deeply for wider separated pairs. Thus, the detector 1 cm from the source probes the relatively thin (2 mm) skin layer, whereas the detector [ADDRESS_406804] tibia where the bone lies directly under the skin minimizes the effects of soft tissue and local changes in skin

The extended modified Beer-Lambert law for a two-layer model will be used to determine hemoglobin content changes in tibial bone from changes in light absorption.  Tibial Loading Device. The custom-made device allows for controlled, compressive loading of the bone. The system consists of a boot with 2 inch strap over the knee. Wires pull vertically down on the brace via a cam-type device on a motor (Lesson, 90V DC). The load is monitored by [CONTACT_329271]. The servo-controlled pressure adjusts the load such that it remains at the predetermined level.  This allows for full control of the magnitude and pattern of loading on the lower leg. This system can apply static or cycling loading on the tibia. This approach has been modeled after a mouse tibial loading model that has been successfully employed to examine bone adaptations under imposed physical loading conditions. The system is able-to non-invasively apply loading in a physiological direction and axially loads a single skeletal element – the tibia. The system also allows for isometric muscle contractions in the calf (plantar flexion) that can be performed in synchrony with the compressive loading and provides a stimulus that more closely mimics walking. The leg of the volunteer is placed in the boot of the device and secured with the strap over the knee. This ensures that the knee is maintained at [ADDRESS_406805] 4 MHZ Doppler probe (Multidop T2, DWL) is placed against the skin under the knee to isolate the popliteal artery proximal to the bifurcation. Popliteal Artery Structure. A linear 6- to 15- MHz Doppler ultrasound (SonoSite Edge II, Fujifilm SonoSite, Bothell, WA) will be used to measure popliteal artery thickness and lumen diameter. The measurements will be taken at the distal popliteal artery above 2cm above arterial take-off, with the subject in supi[INVESTIGATOR_329251] 45deg. The arterial diameter will be measured on transverse images, with the ultrasound beam perpendicular to the artery. [18]  Tibial Length. Tibial length will be measured in sitting position with a tape measure.  Body Weight. Weight will be measured on a scale.  VI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Sample Size Our prior work found a borderline significant increase (p=0.06) in tibial perfusion after exercise in able-bodied. Power analysis at 80% of these data showed that [ADDRESS_406806] provided a p<0.[ADDRESS_406807] any sex-related difference; moreover, the SCI population is comprised primarily of males. To ensure a sufficient sample size for NO-mediated vasodilation, we will aim to recruit an additional of 17 individuals in each group. Therefore, we will recruit 29 individuals with SCI (men and women) and 29 healthy individuals (men and women) to participate in the study.  Statistics Data from NIRS monitoring will be used to determine hemoglobin content changes in tibial bone from changes in light absorption on a moment-by-moment basis. A detailed description of the analysis can be found in our previous work. [12] Briefly, NIRS monitoring provides a change in hemoglobin content from one state to another. This is due to the fact that absolute intensity of the scattered light measured across the tibia cannot be used for an absolute measure of perfusion. However, as perfusion increases, there is a proportional increase in absorption (and vice versa). Thus, percent change in total hemoglobin detected reflects the relative change in perfusion.  The main outcomes assessed will be popliteal artery thickness and lumen diameter, tibial perfusion, and whole leg blood flow. This project will employ a simple and straightforward statistical approach to compare responses within and between groups. Statistical significance will be set at 0.05, and power at 80%. Descriptive statistics will be presented including mean, median, standard deviation, and range. Differences/relations will be considered as statistically significant at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_406808] methods. If assumptions for parametric tests do not hold, non-parametric alternatives will be employed. The analysis plan is written as though there are no distributional problems; assumptions for all analyses will be checked and analogous methods calling for fewer and/or weaker assumptions will be used, if called for. For the data from aim 1, unpaired t-tests will be used to assess changes in perfusion between groups and reactive 
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 9 of 13 Bone blood flow in SCI v7, May 24, 2022    hyperemia/leg dependency. Since the two conditions result in distinct and opposite responses, they should be considered separately. For the data from aim 2, for the three passive loading conditions (10%, 30%, 50% body weight without associated muscle contractions), a 2x3 ANOVA will be used to assess changes in perfusion between groups across loading conditions.  The results of this study will provide invaluable insights into bone perfusion in the paralyzed legs of those with SCI. For both aims, we anticipate that individuals with SCI will have less bone perfusion compared to able-bodied due to the extensive vascular maladaptations. Even if the results are not different between those with SCI and able-bodied, this study will have explored a potentially key contributor to SCI-related bone loss, with major implications in treating osteoporosis. VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS The tibial bone loading device should pose minimal risks – the device applies loading at loads less than full body weight – from 10% to 50% body weight. This should pose minimal risk to volunteers with SCI since they will be less than [ADDRESS_406809] after cuff release. In those with SCI, cuff inflation can also cause autonomic dyreflexia. The NIRS system is non-invasive and poses little risk to the patients. Initial trials showed minor reddening of the skin; however, this was temporary and it quickly went away. Nitroglycerin (0.4 mg Nitroglycerin sublingual) at the small doses given is considered low risk, and any higher risk patients are excluded during the eligibility process. Sublingual nitroglycerin may result in headaches, weakness, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, mild burning or tingling with the tablet in the mouth, and flushing (warmth, redness, or tingly feeling under the skin) as the body adjusts to the medication. Some serious but unlikely side effects include fainting and fast and irregular heart rate. Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored continuously, and the nitroglycerin will be removed immediately if large declines in blood pressure (>20 mmHg) occur. VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS This research may help physicians and scientists explore the potential contribution of vascular maladaptations to SCI related bone loss, with major implications in treating osteoporosis.

 Page 2 of 13 Bone Blood Flow V11, March 24, 2021   I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE   All tissues of the human body require adequate perfusion to provide oxygen and nutrients to meet metabolic demands. It has been long recognized that the arterial system in bone is of overwhelming importance, adequate circulation being necessary for nearly all skeletal functions, including development, growth, homeostasis, and repair. [1], [2] There is an extensive network of arteries, arterioles, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_329258]. [3] For example, inadequate flow has been associated with bone loss,[4] impaired growth,[5] and delayed fracture healing.[6]   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_329259], the regulation of blood flow to bone has been relatively unstudied in humans and the mechanisms that regulate bone blood flow are not well understood. The majority of work in bone perfusion has been in various animal models (mice, rats, rabbits, dogs, cats, etc.) with the preponderance of data suggesting that there are key systemic effectors of acute changes in bone perfusion. One of the potential factors controlling blood flow regulation is the sympathetic nervous system, the bone vasculature being innervated by a rich network of sympathetic nerves. Although no studies in humans have been conducted, most of animal data demonstrates that sympathetic activation reduces blood flow to bone. Application of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_329260] [7], [8] and isolated bone. [9] Likewise, stimulation of sympathetic nerves decreases flow to bone [7]  via alpha-adrenergic receptor activation.[9] Moreover, the smooth muscle of the arterioles in bone respond as expected to infused vasodilators and vasoconstrictors.[10], [11] Hence, the sympathetic innervation of bone vasculature serves a functional purpose in the control of blood flow. If this were not the case, independent of the link between bone metabolism and bone flow, the arterial network in bone would act as a simple pressure passive system. Here, we propose to investigate the role of vascular sympathetic activity in blood flow regulation in humans.   A critical limitation to the study of bone blood flow in humans has been the lack of noninvasive assessments. The dense nature of bone makes it difficult to investigate perfusion and the techniques used to quantify circulation in other tissues are either difficult or impossible to apply to bone in vivo. We recently developed a custom-made near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device that can non-invasively assess blood content in bone. [12] While NIRS has been used to assess perfusion in soft tissue,[13], [14] it has not been extensively used to assess perfusion in bone. However, NIRS has been shown to provide reproducible results in controlled conditions,[15] and can track dynamic changes in bone perfusion.[16], [17] In our preliminary work, we used NIRS to assess physiological changes in blood content in the tibial cortical bone in humans. Although our preliminary work is intriguing, it provided insufficient insight to regulation because this study was unable to disentangle the various possible contributors to bone perfusion. Thus, we aim to extend our preliminary work by [CONTACT_329278].  In addition, we will contrast these responses with those seen in individuals with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI). SCI represents a human ‘model’ of chronic reduced loading with loss of sympathetic regulation below the level of injury that alters control of bone perfusion. Contrasting the response of tibial perfusion to vascular sympathetic activity and systemic perfusion pressure in able-bodied individuals and individuals with SCI will set the basis for future work that will define whether alterations in perfusion may relate to pathophysiologies of bone.   Hypothesis   
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 3 of 13 Bone Blood Flow V11, March 24, 2021   We hypothesize that bone blood perfusion decreases proportional to increases in leg vascular sympathetic outflow.   II. SPECIFIC AIMS  1) Determine the effect of increased vascular sympathetic activity with maintained blood pressure on tibial perfusion.  2) Determine the effect of increased vascular sympathetic activity with increased systemic pressure on tibial perfusion.   3) Compare the changes in tibial perfusion in response to systemic factors between able-bodied and those with SCI.  Knowledge of tibial perfusion in response to increased sympathetic outflow, with or without changes in systemic pressure, will allow us to determine the sympathetic contribution to bone blood flow.   III. SUBJECT SELECTION   Inclusion criteria   It is anticipated that 34 healthy males and 34 healthy females aged 18 to 40 years will be recruited and enrolled for this study.    Also, we anticipate we will recruit 17 males with SCI, aged 18 to 40 years, with injuries American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_329248] (AIS) A and B and C, with full hand function. We will only enroll males with SCI since the SCI population is predominantly male (about 75%).  Exclusion criteria (for both able-bodied and SCI groups) Clinical signs or symptoms of heart disease, hypertension, coronary disease, diabetes, other neurological disease, cancer, recent weight change >15 pounds, abnormal resting ECG, pregnant and/or breastfeeding women, underweight and obese individuals (body mass index between 18.5 and 29.9), use of amphetamines (Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta) in the past [ADDRESS_406812] successfully recruited young males and females by [CONTACT_329266]/or by [CONTACT_329267]. The website ad has a short description of the project and a number to contact [CONTACT_329268]. When the potential subject 
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page [ADDRESS_406813] with the study staff, we use a phone screening of health questions and a short description of the study. This process usually takes 15 to 20 minutes. If individuals meet eligibility requirements from the phone screening and are interested in participating, they are then scheduled for a physical screening. At that time, we mail a consent form to give opportunity to read and understand the specifics of the study.   We will recruit SCI participants from the outpatient therapy department and the Exercise for Persons with Disabilities (ExPD) program at Spaulding Rehabilitation Network. Flyers will be posted at SRH outpatient sites and/or given to potential subjects along with a phone number to call if they are interested in learning more about the study. Our laboratory has been regularly enrolling SCI patients for research from the SRN. For the able-bodied participants, in the past, we have successfully recruited young males and females by [CONTACT_329266]/or by [CONTACT_329267]. The website ad has a short description of the project and a number to contact [CONTACT_329268]. When the potential subject makes contact [CONTACT_162376], we use a phone screening of health questions and a short description of the study. This process usually takes [ADDRESS_406814] of sympathetic outflow to tibial perfusion. The study visit will take approximately 3.5 hours to complete. The screening visit and the study visit may occur on the same day or on different days.    Detailed procedures  Throughout the protocol, able-bodied volunteers will be fully instrumented for measurements of tibial blood flow, muscle/bone sympathetic activity, popliteal blood flow velocity, ECG, beat-by-beat arterial pressure, brachial arterial pressure, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (see Measurements below). All those with SCI enrolled in this study will have complete injuries and thus vascular sympathetic control is disrupted below the level of injury. Hence, in individuals with SCI the arterial network in bone might act as a simple pressure passive system. Given the disrupted vascular sympathetic control, in those with SCI we will not record muscle/bone sympathetic activity.   In able-bodied, we will use direct microneurographic measures of nervous activity to the lower leg vasculature in the common peroneal nerve as a measure of sympathetic activity to the bone 
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 5 of 13 Bone Blood Flow V11, March 24, 2021   vasculature of the tibia throughout the protocol. Our assumption is that peroneal nerve sympathetic activity reflects vasomotor output to both muscle and bone of the lower leg. Though this assumption is not testable prior to having data in hand, we assume that Hilton’s law prevails. According to Hilton’s law, bone innervation derives from the peripheral nerves of the muscle that overlies the bone. The common peroneal nerve primarily innervates the fibula, but also the deep peroneal branch innervates the tibialis anterior which overlies the tibia. Though we acknowledge this is potentially inexact, our sympathetic nervous activity measure should broadly reflect sympathetic outflow to the lower leg.   We will use three approaches to increase sympathetic outflow to the leg vasculature: head tilt, cold pressor test, and isometric handgrip exercise (IHE) to fatigue. In those with SCI, we expect that bone vasculature will respond as a pressure passive system.  Subjects will lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_329261]. After instrumentation, the subject will perform three maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) on a handgrip  dynamometer. This is to determine 30% MVC for sustained isometric exercise. Afterwards, an adequate nerve recording will be obtained. To ensure that a good nerve recording is obtained, the subjects will be asked to perform a Valsalva maneuver, which results in an expected increase in sympathetic activity. Invented by [CONTACT_329279] 17th century, the Valsalva maneuver, a prolonged expi[INVESTIGATOR_244579] a closed glottis, is widely used because of its safety and ease of quantification. This voluntary act of straining creates transient changes in intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal pressure with concomitant increases in sympathetic activity. To achieve this, subjects will be asked to breathe through a tube with a small vent in the glottis to prevent them from increasing mouth instead of chest pressure. A pressure gauge attached to this tube will allow the subject maintain a target pressure of 40 mmHg for 15 seconds. Data will be obtained for 1 minute prior to the maneuver, 1 minute after, with 2 minutes of recovery.   Assessing tibial perfusion in response to increased sympathetic outflow with maintained blood pressure  This approach will provide insight to the relation between moment-by-moment bone perfusion and beat-by-beat increases in vascular sympathetic activity without alterations in systemic pressure. During head-up tilt, decreases in central blood volume and circulatory adjustments are proportional to the angle of the head-up tilt [20]. Sympathetic activity increases and muscle blood flow decreases significantly by a tilt angle of 30 degrees [21]. In addition, head-down tilt to 6-8 deg results in a decrease in sympathetic activity [22]. Hence, increased levels of head-up tilt provide a strong stimulus for active vasoconstriction in the leg, while maintaining system pressure constant. This provides a stimulus that progressively increases sympathetic activity with a maintained systemic perfusion pressure.  Data will be obtained for a [ADDRESS_406815] provokes a nociceptive response that causes increases in sympathethic activity, blood pressure, and heart rate [23]. Past work showed that these responses are water temperature dependent. Graded increases in sympathetic activity, accompanied by [CONTACT_329280], were seen during immersion at 0 and 7oC, but not at 14oC [24].  A [ADDRESS_406816]. Afterwards, participants will undergo a cold pressor task, consisting of immerion of a hand for 3 min in 0oC water. This will be followed by 3 minutes of recovery data collection.   Isometric handgrip to fatigue (IHE) results in time-dependent, progressive increases in peroneal nerve sympathetic outflow and blood pressure [25]. With sustained handgrip forces greater than 25% of maximal voluntary contraction, sympathetic activity increases progressively to end exercise. Hence, IHE provides a strong stimulus for active vasoconstriction in the leg that contributes to the exercise pressor response.   A [ADDRESS_406817] performing IHE at 30% MVC sustained to fatigue. An oscilloscope will be calibrated to provide the subject visual feedback on force generation; subjects will be verbally encouraged to maintain force throughout; fatigue will be determined by [CONTACT_329281] [ADDRESS_406818] that bone blood flow will respond as a pressure passive system and hence will track blood pressure response.   In able-bodied, tibial blood perfusion, an adequate nerve recording, and popliteal flow will be obtained. These time series will allow derivation of relations between nerve activity and tibial perfusion, and between nerve activity and popliteal flow. Nerve activity will serve as an index of vasoconstriction activity to the entire leg, while tibial perfusion and popliteal flow will represent a measure of downstream leg vascular responses. If nerve activity is not obtained, the subjects will still perform the procedures described above. In that case, the relationship between tibial blood perfusion and popliteal flow will be assessed.  In those with SCI, tibial blood perfusion and popliteal flow will be obtained. The relationship between tibial blood perfusion and popliteal flow will be assessed. These approaches will provide insight to the proportionality between sympathetic outflow and bone blood flow, as well as the hypothesized pressure passive bone vasculature in those with SCI.  Subjects may be asked to repeat any of the study assessments if there is difficulty obtaining results that meet our quality standards or there are equipment issues that arise.  Measurements   Tibial Blood Flow. A custom made bone optical spectropsopy device that uses near-infrared (NIR) light will be used to continuously monitor tibial perfusion. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) provides a safe, non-invasive, and inexpensive alternative to analyze hemodynamic changes in the biological tissues using light in the range of 600 to 1000 nm. The system has been previously 
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 7 of 13 Bone Blood Flow V11, March 24, 2021   used in Protocol #2014P002003 without any side effects. The system has two detectors allowing estimation of hemoglobin changes in a two layer (skin and bone) model and uses a broadband light source and high-sensitivity spectrometers to yield full NIR spectral information. The instrument uses a whitelight tungsten halogen lamp (Fostec DCRII, Dallas, TX) to deliver light through a large optical fiber bundle to the skin. Two detector fibers are coupled with spectrometers (Mini-spectrometer TG C9405CB, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan), placed at 1 and 2 cm distances from the source. Both spectrometers allow measurement of the diffusely reflected light between 650 nm and 800 nm with 5 nm resolution. The light source and the two detectors are attached to a custom made probe head placed on the skin surface directly over the tibia. Light propagates between the source and the detectors in “banana-shaped” sensitivity functions and penetrates shallower for more closely separated source-detector pairs and more deeply for wider separated pairs. Thus, the detector 1 cm from the source probes the relatively thin (2 mm) skin layer, whereas the detector [ADDRESS_406819]-ganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity will be recorded with a tungsten microelectrode in the peroneal nerve only in the able-bodied population. The peroneal nerve will be mapped at the fibular head via low voltage transcutaneous electrical stimuli. Subsequently, the microelectrode is inserted manually through the unanesthetized skin and initially provides low voltage electrical stimuli (1-4 volts) to help locate the nerve. When the microelectrode enters a nerve fascicle innervating muscle, involuntary twitches are induced. The microelectrode is then used to record sympathetic efferent nerve outflow to calf muscle. This procedure is safe and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_329262] 1000 experiments since 1991 without complication. The raw nerve signal will be amplified, rectified and integrated for visual inspection during experiments (Nerve Traffic Analyzer, Model 662c-3, University of Iowa Bioengineering, Iowa City, IA) and the amplified raw signal will be directly sampled at [ADDRESS_406820] 4 MHZ Doppler probe (Multidop T2, DWL) is placed against the skin under the knee to isolate the popliteal artery proximal to the bifurcation.

 Page [ADDRESS_406821] access to the internet, a paper copy of the MSNA questionnaire will be mailed to his/her address.  VI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  Sample Size  Our prior work found a borderline significant increase (p=0.06) in tibial perfusion after exercise in able-bodied. Power analysis at 80% of these data showed that [ADDRESS_406822] provided a p<0.05 increase in perfusion. Therefore, for this study, we based our sample size on this calculation. However, we will recruit equal numbers of men and women to explore potential sex-related differences. Also, due to individual anatomic differences and day-to-day variability in success, microneurographic recordings can be obtained in approximately two out of three volunteers. To ensure successful sympathetic nerve recordings in 17 individuals, we will need to recruit ~30% more subjects. Thus, we will recruit 34 healthy males, 34 healthy females, and 17 males with SCI.  Statistics  Data from NIRS monitoring will be used to determine hemoglobin content changes in tibial bone from changes in light absorption on a moment-by-moment basis. A detailed description of the analysis can be found in our previous work. [12] Briefly, NIRS monitoring provides a change in hemoglobin content from one state to another. This is due to the fact that absolute intensity of the scattered light measured across the tibia cannot be used for an absolute measure of perfusion. However, as perfusion increases, there is a proportional increase in absorption (and vice versa). Thus, percent change in total hemoglobin detected refects the relative change in perfusion.   The main outcomes assessed will be tibial perfusion, whole leg blood flow, and sympathetic activity. Descriptive statistics of the time series of these outcomes will include mean, median, standard deviation, and range. Differences/relations will be considered statistically significant at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_406823], isometric handgrip exercise, and head tilt, in those with SCI we will assess the relationship between changes in mean arterial pressure and changes in tibial perfusion.    VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
PARTNERS HUMAN RESEARCH COMMITTEE DETAILED PROTOCOL  
 Page 9 of 13 Bone Blood Flow V11, March 24, 2021   The proposed study will utilize cardiovascular monitoring techniques with minimal risks. The attachment and removal of ECG electrodes and inflation of the blood pressure cuff may cause mild discomfort. Recordings from the peroneal nerve with a microelectrode may cause the minor discomfort of muscle weakness and/or pi[INVESTIGATOR_14073], which resolve spontaneously within a few days. The immersion of the hand in ice-cold water may cause mild to moderate discomfort. The risks associated isometric handgrip exercise are minimal, but may cause mild to moderate discomfort. The NIRS system is non-invasive and poses little risk to the patients. Initial trials showed minor reddening of the skin; however, this was temporary and it quickly went away. The tilt test may cause subjects to feel dizzy, nauseous, sweaty or pale and may increase heart rate or decrease blood pressure; however, this is temporary and it goes away in a few minutes after the subject are brought back to neutral position.

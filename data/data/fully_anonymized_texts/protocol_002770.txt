 1.1 Primary Objectives:  
1.[ADDRESS_912614] ratio of the combination 
of weekly paclitaxel and pazopanib compared to weekly paclitaxel and 
placebo in patients with persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or 
primary peritoneal cancer.   
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives :

of response in each arm.  
 
1.3 Translational Research Objectives : 
 
 1.31 To explore the association between plasma cytokines and angiogenic 
markers and progression -free and overall survival.  
 1.32 To explore the association between single -nucleotide polymorphisms 
(SNPs) and progression -free and overall survival.

die of ovarian cancer in 20 10.1 Although about 75% of patients with epi[INVESTIGATOR_675244] r espond to first -line chemotherapy with platinum and 
paclitaxel, most patients with advanced stage epi[INVESTIGATOR_675245]. 
While there are several active cytotoxic agents for the treatment of recurrent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296], median surviva l after recurrence is about 2 years.2  
Therefore, there is a need for developi[INVESTIGATOR_675246].   
 
2.2 Pazopanib  
 
Pazopanib is a potent and selective, orally bioavailable, adenosine triphosphate 
competitive, small molecule inh ibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 
receptor (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3, platelet -derived growth factor receptor 
(PDGFR) -α, -β, and c -KIT tyrosine kinases (TKs) (Investigator’s Brochure, 
2010).  In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), pazop anib inhibited 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912617] -spectrum clinical utility.  
 
Mechanism of Action  
Pazopanib inhibits VEGFR -1, -2, and -3 with concentrations causing 50% 
inhibition (IC 50) values of 10, 30, and 47 nM, respectively, and inhibits PDGFR -
α, -β, and c -KIT with IC 50 values of 71, 84, and 74 nM, respectively 
(Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).3,[ADDRESS_912618] cancer cells expressing them.  
 
Nonclinical Efficacy  
Pazopanib selectively inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs stimulated with 
VEGF (IC 50=21 nM) compared to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) 
(IC 50=721 nM).  In a cell proliferation assay using a panel of 282 human tumor 
cell lines, pazopanib inhibited the proliferation of only 7 cell lines (IC 50<1000 
nM), suggesting that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of proliferation in the majority 
of human cell line s tested in vitro .  Pazopanib also showed weak inhibitory 
activity in the colony forming unit assay induced by [CONTACT_86501] -macrophage 
colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF) and Flt -3 ligand alone.  However, the 
inhibition by [CONTACT_675280] (a ligand 
for c-KIT), consistent with its activity against c -KIT kinase.  
 
Inhibition of VEGFR -[ADDRESS_912619] tha t plasma concentrations of ~40 mcM  or 
higher are required for the optimal inhibition of VEGFR -2 phosphorylation in 
mice.  This concentration is also consistent with the antiangiogenic and antitumor 
effects seen in mouse exposure studies.  Pazopanib given o rally at ≥30 mg/kg 
inhibited bFGF and VEGF -induced angiogenesis in a variety of animal models 
including the Matrigel plug and corneal micropocket models in Swiss nu/nu or 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 6 - C57B1/6 mice.  Pazopanib also showed generally dose -dependent inhibition of 
aberrant ocular angiogenesis in laser -induced choroidal neovascularization in 
C57B1/6J mice (≥8 mg/kg orally) and Brown Norway rats (2.25 mg/kg, eye 
drops) as well as corneal neovascularization in a suture -induced model in New 
Zealand white rabbits (≥0.3 mg/kg, eye  drops).  
 
Pazopanib has been evaluated in human tumor xenograft models in mice as a 
single agent as well as in combination with other TK inhibitors and with various 
chemotherapeutic agents.  The combination with lapatinib (an EGFR/ErbB2 TK 
inhibitor) showe d a modest increase in tumor growth inhibition of both BT474 
and in NCI -H322 tumor xenografts in SCID mice compared to either agent alone; 
however, the differences were not statistically significant.  Pazopanib  has also 
been evaluated in combination with v arious other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 
topotecan, irinotecan, 5 -fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or docetaxel) against HT29 
tumor xenografts.  The effect of any of the combinations on tumor growth was not 
significantly different from that of either agent al one.  Follow -up studies were 
done with pazopanib and docetaxel with an endpoint of time to reach two tumor 
doublings.  Pazopanib was administered orally (PO) at 100 mg/kg daily and 
docetaxel was administered intraperitoneally (IP) at 50 mg/kg once weekly f or [ADDRESS_912620] in mice treated with both pazopanib and docetaxel 
concomitantly.  These results clearly show an advantage of combining pazopanib 
with docetaxel (and likel y other chemotherapeutic agents) for better tumor 
control.  
 
The combination of pazopanib with AKT and B -Raf kinase inhibitors was 
evaluated in human colon, ovarian, and renal xenografts in mice.  There was no 
increase in tumor growth inhibition in colon and renal xenografts with the 
combination as compared to the b est single agent.  However, an increased 
inhibition was seen in the ovarian carcinoma model at the highest dose of both 
compounds in combination compared to either agent alone.  Pazopanib in 
combination with a B -raf inhibitor, SB -590885, in mutant B -raf V600E xenografts 
showed a modest increase in tumor inhibition with the combination compared to 
either agent alone.  The combination of pazopanib and bevacizumab was studied 
in human colon tumor xenografts:  RKO, SW620, and HT29.  A modest increase 
in tumor i nhibition was observed with the combination compared to either agent 
alone, suggesting a potential benefit of combining the two agents.  In human 
ovarian cancer cells as well as in OVCAR -3 mice xenografts, pazopanib 
compared to paclitaxel exerted different  effects on the expression and secretion of 
CA-125 and was not always associated with changes in tumor burden, suggesting 
cautious use of CA -125 as an independent marker of antitumor activity of 
pazopanib in clinical studies.  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology  
In safety pharmacology studies, there were no pazopanib -related central and 
peripheral nervous system, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or cardiovascular effects in rats or 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 7 - monkeys given single oral doses of up to 300 mg/kg and 500 mg/ kg.  However, 
following a single IV dose of 3.75 mg/kg to monkeys, a mild, reversible decrease 
in heart rate was observed with no effects on arterial pressures, body temperature, 
or ECG waveform changes.  At the limit of pazopanib solubility for in vitro  
assays, there was minimal (~19%) inhibition of hERG tail current repolarization 
and no treatment -related effects on isolated dog Purkinje fibers.  The toxicity 
profile of pazopanib has been defined in single -dose studies in rats and dogs and 
repeat dose stu dies in mice (13 weeks), rats (26 weeks), and monkeys (52 weeks).  
The principal nonclinical toxicities are believed to be directly associated with 
VEGFR -2 inhibition and include effects on bone and bone marrow, incisor teeth, 
ovary, kidney, pancreas, nail s, testes, adrenal, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], trachea, hematologic 
tissues, salivary glands, and developi[INVESTIGATOR_472556]/fetus.  The onset of these effects 
varied with dose and systemic exposure with the earliest onset seen after 4 days of 
dosing in the rat.  Neither rats nor monkeys tolerated oral doses in the range of 
300-500 mg/kg/day for >[ADDRESS_912621] also been noted occasionally in rodents.  
 
Nonclinical reproductive toxicology studies indicate reduced fe male fertility, fetal 
teratogenic effects, and reduced fetal body weight in pregnant rats and/or rabbits 
given pazopanib.  In rats, pazopanib caused a reduction in the number of stage I -V 
round spermatids at ≥300 mg/kg/day, resulted in female reproductive tract target 
organs effects at 300 mg/kg/day, and caused early embryo resorptions.  The agent 
was found to be non -mutagenic and non -clastogenic in a range of genetic toxicity 
tests.  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
Mean bioavailability ran ged from 47% in dogs to 72% in rats.  There was a 4 - to 
5-fold decrease in exposure in fed compared to fasting dogs, but in monkeys the 
exposure did not change substantially on feeding.  Pazopanib is highly (>98.8%) 
plasma protein bound in mouse, rat, dog,  monkey, and human plasma.  In vitro  
data indicate that pazopanib is highly permeable across membranes and is a 
substrate for the P -glycoprotein (P -gp) transporter and breast cancer resistant 
protein (BCRP).  Following oral administration of radiolabeled p azopanib, 
excretion of drug -related material was rapid and essentially complete.  Circulating 
metabolites observed in humans were minor and were also noted in the 
nonclinical species.  Metabolism appeared to be predominantly mediated by 
[CONTACT_097]3A4 and to a les ser extent by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP2C8.  The majority of the 
dose was excreted via feces in humans, rats, and monkeys.  
 
Clinical Experience  
Approximately [ADDRESS_912622] been enrolled in clinical studies of 
pazopanib as of September 2009.  In Octob er 2009, the FDA approved pazopanib 
tablets for the treatment of subjects with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).  In 
addition, several clinical studies evaluating pazopanib in non -small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, breast cancer, soft tissu e sarcoma (STS), 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 8 - carcinosarcoma of the uterus, cervical cancer, hepatocellular cancer (HCC), 
multiple myeloma (MM), and glioma are in progress or have been completed.   
 
Clinical Efficacy  
In a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled phase 3 study eval uating the 
efficacy and safety of pazopanib monotherapy in treatment -naive and cytokine -
pretreated subjects with advanced RCC, the median progression -free-survival 
(PFS) was significantly prolonged with pazopanib compared with placebo in the 
overall study population (9.2 vs. 4.2 months).  The objective response rate (RR) 
was 30% with pazopanib and o nly 3% with placebo .8  In subjects with ovarian 
cancer, 31% of subjects experienced a CA -125 response to pazopanib, with a 
median time to response of 29 days an d median duration of response of 113 days 
(Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  Median PFS was 84 days and the overall RR 
was 18%.  In advanced or metastatic STS, the rate of PFS at 12 weeks was 43.9% 
for leiomyosarcoma, 48.6% for synovial sarcoma, 26.3% for a dipocytic sarcoma, 
and 39% for other types of sarcoma .9  In a phase 2 trial of subjects with early -
stage NSCLC, 86% of subjects experienced a reduction in tumor volume after 
short -term, preoperative use of pazopanib (~2 -6 weeks) as assessed by [CONTACT_5019] -
resolut ion CT scanning .[ADDRESS_912623] cancer showed that the 
clinical benefit rate was 26% .11  The median TTP was 3.7 months, and 50% of 
subjects with measurabl e target lesions had some decrease in size.  PFS at 3 and 6 
months was 55% and 28%, respectively.  Preliminary results from a randomized 
study in subjects with first -line advanced ErbB2 -positive advanced or metastatic 
breast cancer showed that a higher res ponse rate (36.2% vs. 22.2%) was observed 
in subjects on combination lapatinib 1000 mg once daily + pazopanib 400 mg 
once daily compared to monotherapy lapat inib 1500 mg once daily . 12  In a 
randomized phase 2 study of pazopanib vs. lapatinib vs. the combi nation of 
pazopanib/lapatinib in advanced and recurrent cervical cancer, there was a 34% 
reduction in risk for progression in subjects receiving pazopanib relative to 
lapatinib.  The median PFS was 17.1 weeks in the lapatinib group and 18.1 wee ks 
in the pa zopanib group.13 Interim analysis of data from 26 subjects showed that 
pazopanib has both a favorable toxicity profile and promising clinical activity in 
subjects with advanced and progressive differentiated thyroid cancers .14  Five 
confirmed partial respo nses (PRs) (19%) were reported.   Pazopanib has not shown 
efficacy in phase 2 studies conducted in MM or glioma (Investigator’s Brochure, 
2010)  
 
Safety  
The randomized, phase 3 study in mRCC subjects provided a key comparison of 
safety with  pazopanib compared to placebo.8  The overall frequency of adverse 
events (AEs) reported during the study was higher in the pazopanib arm (92%) 
compared with placebo (74%).  The most common AEs reported in >20% of 
subjects in the pazopanib arm were diarrhe a (52%), hypertension (40%), hair 
color change (depi[INVESTIGATOR_371]; 38%), nausea (26%), anorexia (22%), and 
vomiting (21%).  Most of the events were grade 1 or 2.  A higher number of grade 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 9 - 3 AEs were reported in the pazopanib arm (33%) compared with the placeb o arm 
(14%).  The most frequent grade 3 AEs in the pazopanib arm were increased 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
hypertension, and diarrhea.  The frequency of grade 4 and grade 5 AEs was 
similar between the pazopa nib and placebo arms:  grade 4 in 7% and 6%, 
respectively; grade 5 in 4% and 3%, respectively.  
 
A comprehensive review of all completed and ongoing pazopanib clinical trials 
with a cut -off date of September 2009, lists [ADDRESS_912624] commonly occurring serious 
AEs (SAEs) (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  Vomiting and diarrhea are the most 
commonly reported SAEs across all the pazopanib studies.  As a consequence of 
this, dehydration is also seen with pazopanib treatment.  For most reports, the AEs 
resolved after s upportive treatment such as antiemetics, antidiarrheal agents, and 
IV fluids.  GI perforation is commonly associated with VEGF pathway inhibitors.  
This may manifest as abdominal pain which is not uncommon in cancer subjects 
for many reasons.  Of the [ADDRESS_912625] the 
underlying disease under treatment.  Anemia is commonly seen in cancer subjects 
in association with chemotherapy, hemorrhage, or infe ction.  The SAEs of pyrexia 
were attributed to multiple causes:  concurrent infections, the underlying 
malignancy, hepatic events, other concomitant medications, and unknown causes.  
Hepatic events are thought to be on -target tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI ) class 
effects, as hepatic enzyme elevations have been seen with other agents of this 
class.  Careful clinical evaluation is, therefore, warranted in subjects with hepatic 
abnormalities.  Pneumonia can be a complication of chemotherapy or can result 
from debilitation and advanced disease.  Review of the [ADDRESS_912626] been 24 SAEs 
of pulmonary embolism (PE) reported in pazopanib trials.  This is of particula r 
relevance since other members of this class have been associated with PE and 
other venous thromboembolic events.  
 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912627] been reports of cardiac and cerebral ischemic events, GI 
perforation or hemorrhage, pulmonary hemorrhage, cerebrovas cular hemorrhage, 
QT prolongation, and Torsades de P ointes in pazopanib clinical trials.  
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
The oral bioavailability of pazopanib reflects absorption that is limited by 
[CONTACT_675281] 800 mg once daily (Investi gator’s Brochure, 2010 ).15  
Increases in doses above 800 mg to 2000 mg, in the fasted state will not result in 
increased systemic exposure.  Geometric mean pazopanib t ½ values ranged from 
18.1-52.3 hours.  The mean t ½ was 30.9 hours in the 800 mg once daily group,  in 
phase 2 and 3 trials.  Oral absorption is significantly enhanced when dosed with 
food; therefore, it is recommended to administer pazopanib on an empty stomach, 
at least 1 -2 hours after a meal.   
 
Preliminary information on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of  pazopanib administered 
in combination with lapat inib has been reported . 16  Thirty -three subjects received 
doses of lapatinib ranging from 750 -1500 mg once daily along with pazopanib at 
doses of 200 -500 mg daily.  Preliminary mean plasma concentrations 24  hours 
after administration (C 24) on day 22 were ~19 mcg/mL and 23 mcg/mL after 
pazopanib doses of 250 mg and 500 mg, respectively.  These values are similar to 
the mean C 24 values observed after administration of 800 mg pazopanib alone 
(23.1 mcg/mL).  Pla sma lapatinib concentrations at 750 -1500 mg daily were 
similar to those observed after monotherapy.  Concurrent administration of 
pazopanib and lapatinib was generally well tolerated; coadministration of 
lapatinib may alter the PK of pazopanib . 16 
 
Prelimi nary PK information on the combination of pazopanib and paclitaxel 
administered to subjects with advanced c ancer has been reported .17  Twelve 
subjects received paclitaxel (15 -80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days) and

Coadministration of pazopanib increased paclitaxel mean C max and AUC 0-8 
approximat ely 20 -35%.17 
 
Age, body weight, gender, and race had no signif icant influence on pazopanib PK.  
 
Potential Drug Interactions  
Pazopanib is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, and systemic exposure to 
pazopanib is altered by [CONTACT_675282].  The concomitant 
use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.  If co-administration of a 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted, a dose reduction to 400 mg is 
recommended.  Grapefruit may also increase plasma concentrations of pazopanib 
and should be avoided.  CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_675247]; therefore, an alternative concurrent medication with none 
or minimal e nzyme induction should be used.   
Concomitant medications that have narrow therapeutic windows and are 
substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2D6 or CYP2C8 should be used with cau tion.  If

Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 11 - possible, medications that are not substrates for these enzymes and/or do not have 
narrow therapeutic windows should be substituted.  
 
Dose Selection  
Pharmacodynamic data indicate that pazopanib, at a monotherapy dose of 800 mg 
once daily, result s in effects consistent with inhibition of the VEGF receptors and 
angiogenic factors (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  Concentration -effect 
relationships were observed between trough plasma pazopanib concentrations and 
the development of hypertension as we ll as the percent change from baseline to 
the nadir  of soluble VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2), a marker of VEGFR inhibition.  
Decreases in sVEGFR2 have been correlated with increased clinical benefit in 
RCC with oth er small molecule TKIs .[ADDRESS_912629] relationships 
were similar (15.3 mcg/mL for hypertension and 21.3 mcg/mL for sVEGFR2) .    
Pazopanib monotherapy has been approved as an 800 mg once daily dose for the 
treatment of advanc ed RCC in the US.  In a phase 1  dose-finding study in subjects 
with HCC, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for single -agent pazopanib in 
subjects was determined to be 600 mg once daily (Investigator’s Brochure, 2010).  
The 800 mg once daily dose was not wel l tolerated resulting in 40% of subjects 
experiencing dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs).  No DLTs were observed at [ADDRESS_912630] had a grade 4 GI 
hemorrhage and grade 4 transaminase increase s. 
 
2.3 Rationale for the use of pazopanib in ovarian, peritoneal and tubal cancers  
 
 Angiogenesis targeting and Pericyte targeting   
 
Currently, the GOG (in concert with CTEP and/or the pharmaceutical companies) 
is running several single arm phase II biologic agent trials in the 170 -queue.  To 
date, clinical activity has been reported in seven . One of these agents has 
demonstrated clinic al activity considered significant for further clinical 
development, bevacizumab (GOG -0170D).19  It is not a surprise that agents 
targeting the processes of angiogenesis would be of some importance in this 
disease, which has been documented both pre -clinically and clinically to be 
vulnerable to inhibition of VEGF and/or its receptors and be associated 
prognostically with fluctuating levels of pVEGF.  Multiple reports have shown 
that angiogenesis, as measured  by [CONTACT_39697], is associated with worse 
survival for ovarian cancer patients.20-24  Bevacizumab is already in front -line and 
recurrent phase III investigation , and has been shown to increase the progression -
free survival by 3.8 months in the upfr ont setting.25  Burger et al. demonstrated a 
21% response rate with a median response duration of 10 months for patients with 
recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_675248].19  
Nevertheless, new agents are vitally necessary, spec ifically those that may offer 
clinical response in women previously exposed to VEGF targeted therapy by 
[INVESTIGATOR_182556] #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912631] on tumor growth, and in some 
clinical trials has led to undesirable toxicities, such as fluid accumulation – 
largely explained by [CONTACT_675283] a more immature vascular phenotype devoid 
of pericytes.28 Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that dual targeting of VEGF 
and PDGF would le ad to enhanced anti -angiogenesis therapy.  Preclinical models 
using  specific  agents (fusion proteins against VEGF and PDGF) or multi -targeted 
(SU6668) agents have supported this effect in various tumor models.27,29  Another 
study reported efficacy in contr olling malignant ascites from ovarian cancers in a 
murine model.30 Clinically, trials are ongoing in ovarian cancer with agents 
targeting VEGFR and PDGFR .  Recently, a phase II trial of sunitinib 
demonstrated a response rate of 13% - 1 partial response and 3 CA125 responses. 
31  In addition, a phase II study of sorafenib, a multi -targeted receptor kinase 
inhibitor, including VEGFR and PDGFR  in combination with gemcitabine 
demonstrated an objective response rate of 4% , and a CA125 response of 28%.  
23% of pa tients were progression free for at least [ADDRESS_912632] single -agent activity, with substantial toxicity, in GOG 
170F where 69 patients were enrolled.  PRs were observed in 3% of measurable 
patients and nearly 24% were no n-progressive at 6 months.   
 
As  mentioned previously, p azopanib is a potent angiogenic small molecular 
inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases VEGRF -1, -2, -3, PDGFR, and c -kit which has 
been evidenced by [CONTACT_675284] -2 phosphorylation and endothelial cell  
migration. 34-36   Friedlander et al. studied pazopanib in 36 patients with recurrent 
platinum sensitive and resistant epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_675249].  Patients with elevated CA125 with or without non -bulky (no 
mass > 4cm) measurable disease were eligible.  The CA125 response rate w as 
31%, median time to response was [ADDRESS_912633] common adverse events included fatigue  , gastrointestinal issues 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and headache .  Only 1 patient had a grade 4 toxicity - 
peripheral edema. 37 
 
2.4 Weekly Paclitaxel and Safety of Combination Weekly Paclitaxel/Pazopanib  
 
Weekly paclitaxel has been studied in recurrent ovarian cancer as a single agent in 
a number of clinical settings including in the GOG -0126 mechanism.38-40 In each 
of these cases, real or suspected taxane -resistance has been a feature of enrolled 
patients.  Activity, measured as objective response, from these studies is 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 13 - approximately 20% and appears to be among the most active chemotherapeutics 
in the resistant phenotype .  Dose -dense therapy of taxanes has recently proved to 
be a significant advance in primary ovarian cancer with the reporting of a 
Japanese phase III trial comparing weekly administration to bolus administration 
of paclitaxel, both in combination with bolu s carboplatin. PFS was improved by 
11 months in the dose -dense arm (17 mos vs 28 mos, P = 0.0014).41 Unique to the 
infusion schedule was the absence of a “break” week, which is attributed to the 
low rate of completion of unaltered infusion. Compliance is i mproved with this 
recovery week but the impact on response remains to be tested.  The theoretical 
advantage to lower dose, frequent administration of paclitaxel is its impact on 
local cytokines, which may provide an addition anti -angiogenic effect.42-[ADDRESS_912634] the expression of thrombospondin -I, a natural 
inhib itor of neovascularization and angiogenesis.  Phase I data support the safety 
of pazopanib at 800 mg po daily with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2. 48  In this study 25 
patients with advanced cancer were treated with escalating doses of pazopanib 
(400 mg – 800 mg) in combination with weekly paclitaxel (15 mg/m2 – 80 
mg/m2) days 1, 8 ,15 on a 28 day cycle.  One DLT was observed at this dose (Gr 3 
groin abscess).  Dose alterations for each agent at this dose over the course of 
therapy occurred in 7 patients for pazopanib  (liver enzyme elevation) and in 11 
patients for paclitaxel (dose delay) or dose reductions (5 patients).  Pazopanib 
increases the bioavailability of paclitaxel by 40% (C max) to 45% (AUC). The 
optimal treatment dose in this trial was determined to be pazop anib at 800 mg po 
daily with paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 IV, days 1, 8, and [ADDRESS_912635] been associated with ovarian cancer and identified as potential 
therapeutic and diagnostic tools for the disease.50-52  Additionally, levels of 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been found to correlate 
significantly with patient  survival and to be an independent prognostic indicator 
in overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer.[ADDRESS_912636] included p lasma studies to 
evaluate the correlation between cytokine levels (e.g., IL-6, IL -8, IL 11, IL -1a, Il -3, 
IL-4, VEGF, TPO, G -CSF, GM -CSF, osteopontin, and sVEGFRs  ) with progression -
free and overall survival in patients treated with pazopanib, which targets  VEGFR 
1,2, and 3.  Previous studies indicate that the pre -treatment levels of VEGF in 
plasma, not serum, are associated with progression -free and overall survival in 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 14 - patients with persistent or recurrent gynecologic malignancies, including ovarian, 
uterin e, and uterine leiomyosarcoma.54-56 Since p latelets can upload cytokines and 
the actual level of cytokines/growth factors can be affected by [CONTACT_675285] , 
plasma markers are preferable for identifying potential predictive markers to 
treatment.  In additio n, SNPs will be examined for associations with progression -
free and overall survival . 
 
2.6 Rationale for Clinical Trial Design  
 
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled phase II trial. All patients will receive 
IV paclitaxel days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 da ys  in combination with either oral 
pazopanib or an oral placebo.  Blinding will preserve the integrity of the 
progression -free survival and overall survival endpoints by [CONTACT_675286], the declaration of disease progr ession and the 
institution/selection of future therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Therefore, it is understood that 
investigators, patients and research personnel will not know whether or not 
patients have received pazopanib or placebo. Because of the intent -to-treat 
analysis, thi s rule applies to patients who enter the study and then are later found 
to be ineligible. The only indication for un -blinding to treatment arm is a serious 
adverse event in which it is determined by [CONTACT_675287] -blinding would 
improve patient sa fety. 
 
2.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
The Gynecologic Oncology Group and GOG participating institutions will not 
exclude potential subjects from participating in this or any study solely on the 
basis of ethnic origin or socioeconomic status.  Every  attempt will be made to

multi dose vials containing 30mg/5mL, 100mg/16.7mL, or 300mg/50mL 
of paclitaxel .  In addition to 6mg of paclitaxel, each mL of sterile non -
pyrogenic solution contains 527mg of purified Cremophor® EL 
(polyoxyethylated castor oil) and 49.7% (v/v) dehydrated alcohol, USP.  
 
4.12 Storage:   Unopened vials of paclitaxel are stable to the date indicated on 
the package when stored between 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F).  Protect from 
light. 
 
4.13 Stabili ty: Commercially available paclitaxel will be labeled with an 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_78288].  All solutions of paclitaxel exhibit a slight haziness 
directly proportional to  the concentration of drug and the time elapsed 
after preparation, although when prepared as descr ibed below, solutions of 
paclitaxel (0.3 -1.2mg/ml) are physically and chemically stable for 27 
hours.  
 
4.14 Preparation:   Paclitaxel must be diluted prior to infusion.  Paclitaxel 
should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP; 5% 
Dextrose In jection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in Ringer’s Injection to a final 
concentration of 0.3 to 1.2mg/mL.  The solutions are physically and 
chemically stable for up to 27 hours at ambient temperature 
(approximatel y 25°C / 77°F) and room lighting conditions.  
 
NOTE:  In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP, 
which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel 
solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, polypropylene) or plas tic 
(polypropylene, polyolefin) bags and administered through polyethylene -
lined administration sets.  
 
Paclitaxel should be administered through an inline filter with a 
microporous membrane not greater than 0.22 microns.  Use of filter 
devices such as IVEX -2® or IVEX -HP®, which incorporate short inlet 
and outlet PVC -coated tubing, has not resulted in significant leaching of 
DEHP.  
 
All patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids, 
diphenhydramine, and H 2 antagonists prior to paclitaxel administration  in 
order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions.  Patients who 
experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to drug may need to repeat 
the premedication and to be re -challenged with a dilute solution and slow

hypromellose, polyethylene glycol  400, and polysorbate 80. (01/12/2015 ) 
 
4.28 Storage : Store tablets at USP controlled room temperature  (20° to 25° C or 
68° to 77° F ). (01/12/2015 ) 
 
4.29 Stability : Stability studies are ongoing. An opened original container of 
tablets is stable for [ADDRESS_912657] quantity is dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, the supply 
should be assigned a  30-day expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].   If tablets of patient -
specific/blinded supply are dispensed in a pharmacy bottle, all of the 
information of the CTEP applied label (including the Julian Date) 
MUST be on the bottle dispensed to the patient.  (01/12/2015 ) 
 
4.210  Administration : Oral. Take on an empty  stomach either 1 hour before or 2 
hours after food.  The tablets should be swallowed whole and cannot be 
crushed or broken.  (01/12/2015 ) 
 
4.211  Potential Drug Interactions: In vitro  data indicate that pazopanib is 
primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 isoenzyme.  Potent CYP3A4 inducers 
and inhibitors are prohibited on pazopanib trials.  Pazopanib is also a 
substrate for p -glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) 
transporters and concomitant administration of inhibitors such as lapatinib 
will result in increased plasma pazopanib concentrations.  
 
Clinical studies indicate that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, and CYP2D6.  Use caution when combining pazopanib with 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 substr ates known to have a narrow 
therapeutic window.   
 
In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib is a potent inhibitor of 
UGT1A1 and  OATP1B1. Pazopanib may increase concentrations of drugs 
primarily eliminated through these systems.  
 
Avoid co -administration  of pazopanib with medicines that increase gastric 
pH. If the concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is medically 
necessary, pazopanib should be taken without food once daily in the 
evening with the PPI. If the concomitant administration of an H 2-receptor 
antagonist is medically necessary, pazopanib should be taken without food 
at least [ADDRESS_912658] 1 hour before or 2 hours after 
administration of short -acting antacids.  
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 25 -  
Avoid co -administration of pazopanib with simvastatin. Concomitant use 
of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the risk of ALT elevation. Data are 
not sufficient to assess the risk of concomitant administration of other 
statins and pazop anib.  
 
Precautions : Pazopanib /placebo  should be used with caution in patients 
with a history of QT interval prolongation, in patients taking 
antiarrhythmics or other medications that may prolong QT interval, and 
those with relevant pre -existing cardiac dis ease. Monitor ECGs and serum 
electrolytes (e.g., calcium, magnesium, potassium) at baseline and 
periodically and maintain within the normal range.   
 
For patients who develop hepatic impairment, refer to the protocol 
document for appropriate dose modificat ion or dose delay.  (01/12/2015 ) 
 
4.212   Availability : Pazopanib is an investigational agent supplied to  
investigators by  [CONTACT_329208] (DCTD), 
NCI.  
 
Pazopanib is provided to the NCI under a Collaborative Agreement 
between  [COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Corporation  and the DCTD, NCI (see 
Appendix VI).  
 
4.213  Clinical Supplies / Drug Ordering  
 
Clinical Supplies :  Pazopanib ( IND#[ZIP_CODE], NSC 737754) and matching 
Placebo will be provided free of charge by [CONTACT_675290] 
(PMB), Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), Division of Cancer 
Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI).  
 
Each blinded, patient -specific bottle will be labeled with … 
 
• the protocol number (i.e., “GOG -0186J”)  
• the bottle number (i.e., “Bottle 1 of 2” and “Bottle 2 of 2”)  
• the number of capsules (i.e., “34 tablets”)  
• the patient ID number (e.g., "0186J -YYY", where “0186J -YYY” 
represents the protocol number and sequence numb er which represents 
the unique patient ID number assigned by [CONTACT_675291])  
• the patient initials (i.e., First initial, Middle initial, Last initial [e.g., 
“FML”])  
• the agent identification (i.e., “ Pazopanib 200 mg or Placebo ”) 
• a blank line for the pharmacist to enter the patient’s name  
[INVESTIGATOR_182556] #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 26 - • administration instructions (i.e., “Take __ tablets every day for 28 
days.”)  
• storage instructions (i.e., “Store at controlled room temperature 
between 20° and 25° C).”  
• emergency contact [CONTACT_73875]  
• a Julian date  
 
The Julian date indicates the day the bottle was labeled and shipped and is 
composed of the last two digits of the calendar year (e.g., 2009 = 09, 2010 
= 10) and a day count (e.g., January 1 = 001, December 31 = 365).  For 
example, a bottle labeled and shipped on January 1, [ADDRESS_912659] a 
Julian date of ‘[ZIP_CODE]’ and a bottle labeled and shipped on December 31, 
[ADDRESS_912660] a Julian date of ‘[ZIP_CODE]’.  The Julian date will be used by 
[CONTACT_675292].  When a lot expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], PMB will determine the last date the 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_311303] (i.e., both pazopanib  and 
Placebo) shipped on or before that date thus eliminating any chance of 
breaking the blind.  
 
Drug Ordering : 
 
BLINDED (pazopanib or placebo) THERAPY   
 
No blinded  starter supplies will be available for this study.   Blinded, 
patient -specific clinical supplies will be sent to the registering investigator 
at the time of randomization.  This randomization will be performed by 
[CONTACT_675293] (SDC) i n Buffalo, NY.  The patient 
ID number assigned by [CONTACT_675294].  Once a patient has 
been registered with the GOG SDC, the GOG SDC will electronically 
transmit a clinical drug request for that patient to the PMB.  This request 
will be entered and transmitted by [CONTACT_675295].  Shipments within the Un ited States 
will be sent by [CONTACT_629537] (generally two to three day delivery).  
Thus, if a patient is registered on Monday, the GOG SDC would enter a 
clinical drug request for that patient on Monday and PMB would process 
that request on Tuesday and sh ip the drug on Wednesday.  Sites could 
expect to receive their order approximately Friday or Monday.  Shipments 
to [LOCATION_002] sites can be expedited (i.e., receipt on Thursday in 
example above) by [CONTACT_675296]/randomized.  
 
The initial shipment will be for 8 – 34 tablet bottles  (a 2-cycle / 8 -week 
supply at a dose of 4 tablets per day) of pazopanib or matching Placebo.  
Six weeks after the initial shipment,  sites may reorder an additional 8 – 34 
tablet bottles  (a 2-cycle / 8 -week supply at a dose of 4 tablets per day) by 
[INVESTIGATOR_182556] #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912661] em 
(OAOP) .  The assigned patient ID number (e.g., " 0186J -YYY") and the 
patient initials (e.g., "FML") should be entered in the "Patient or Special 
Code" field.  The agent name [CONTACT_675322] “Pazopanib or Placebo”.  All drug orders should be shipped 
directly to the physician responsible for treating the patient.  
 
4.214  Drug Accountability :  The investigator, or a responsible party designated 
by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a careful record of the receipt, 
disposit ion, and return of all drugs received from the PMB using the NCI 
Investigational Agent Accountability Record available on the CTEP home 
page (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  A separate NCI Investigational Agent 
Accountability Record must be maintained for each p atient ID number 
(e.g., "0816J -YYY”) on this protocol.  
 
The Julian Date -Order number (e.g., 2014352 -003) from the patients -
specific label must be used as the Lot number on the NCI DARF. 
(01/12/2015 ) 
 
4.215  Drug Returns :  Only undispensed clinical supplies should be returned 
to the PMB .  When it is necessary to return study drug (e.g., sealed bottles 
remaining when a patient permanently discontinues protocol treatment, 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_629479]), investigators should return the study 
drug to the PM B using the NCI Return Drug List available on the CTEP 
home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  The patient ID number (e.g., "0816J -
YYY” ) and the patient initials (e.g., "FML") should be entered in the "Lot 
Number" field.  Opened bottles with remaining capsule s should be 
documented in the patient -specific NCI Investigational Agent 
Accountability Record (i.e., logged in as “returned by [CONTACT_4676]” and logged 
out as “destroyed  on site”) and destroyed on -site in accordance with 
institutional policy.  
 
Questions about drug orders, transfers, returns, or accountability 
should be addressed to the PMB by [CONTACT_3379] (301) 496 -5725 Monday 
through Friday between 8:30am and 4:30pm Eastern Time.  You may 
also contact [CONTACT_675297] e -mail at [EMAIL_087] . 
 
Drug Transfers :  Bottles MAY NOT  be transferred from one patient to 
another patient or from one protocol to another protocol.  All other 
transfers (e.g., a patient moves from one participating clinical site to 
another participating clinical site, the principal investig[INVESTIGATOR_136]or  [INVESTIGATOR_136] a given 
clinical site changes) must be approved in advance by [CONTACT_452287].  To obtain 
an approval for transfer, investigators should complete and submit to the 
PMB (fax number 301 -480-4612) a Transfer Investigational Agent Form 
available on the CTEP home p age ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ).  The patient ID

5.1 Patient Entry and Registration  (10/09/2012 ) 
 
When a suitable candidate has been identified for protocol entry, the following 
steps should be taken:  
 
OPEN (Oncology Patient Enrollment Network) Registration: All site 
staff will use OPEN to enroll patients to this study.   OPEN can be accessed on the 
GOG  web menu page by [CONTACT_675300].   
  
Prior to accessing OPEN , site staff should verify the following:  
  
• All eligibility criteria have been met  within the protocol stated 
timeframes.  Site staff should use the  registration forms provided on the 
group web site as a tool to verify eligibility.  
• All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIP AA 
authorization  form  (if applicable).   
  
Access requirements for OPEN:  
  
• Site staff will need to be registered with CTEP and have a valid and activ e 
CTEP -IAM account. This is the same account (user id and password) used 
for the CTSU members' web site.  
• To perform registrations, the site user must have been assigned the 
'Registrar' role on the GOG or CTSU roster.  
• To perform registrations you must hav e an equivalent 'Registrar' role on 
the Lead Group roster.   Role assignments are handled through the Groups 
in which you are a member.

registration and treatment information.    Please print this confirmation for your 
records.   
  
Further instructional information is  provided on the CTSU  members' web site 
OPEN tab or within the OPEN URL.  For any additional questions contact [CONTACT_1359] 1 -[PHONE_103] or ctsucontact@west at.com .  
 
5.2 Treatment Plan  
 
5.21 Patients will be stratified according to their platinum -free interval PFI 
(those with a PFI less than or equal to 182 day s versus those with PFI 
greater than  182 days), measurable disease status (measurable versus non -
measurable or “detectable” disease), and prior use of bevacizumab therapy 
(no use versus prior use).  
 
Regimen 1: Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 
(1-hr IV infusion ) with placebo PO daily . 
 
Regimen 2:  Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered weekly on days 1, 8, and 
15 (1 -hr IV infusion ) with  pazopanib 800mg PO daily . 
 
One cycle equals 28 days.  
 
Patients are instructed to swallow tablets once a day (preferably in the 
morning) o n an empty stomach, either 1 hour before or 2 hours after food 
with about 1 cup (240 mL) water.  Tablets should be swallowed whole ; 
they must not be chewed, broken, or crushed.  
 
Patients will be given a Patient Medication Calendar to complete daily 
(Append ix II).  The Patient Tablet Calendar should be reviewed prior to 
the start of each cycle.  
 
All prescription and over -the-counter medications as well as alternative 
medicines that have been taken within [ADDRESS_912664] dose of 
pazopanib/placebo should be reviewed for potential drug -drug interactions 
(see Section  4.211, 5.33 and Appendi ces III). 
 
5.211  Recommended preparative regimen for paclitaxel ( to reduce the 
risk associated with hypersensitivity reactions ):  This regimen 
should include a standard dose of dexamethasone (either IV or 
PO), an anti -histamine H1 (diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg  IV or 
orally, or an equivalent dose of an alternate H1  blocker such as 
loratadine or fexofenadine), and a standard dose of antihistamine 
H2 IV (such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine). The 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 37 - preparative regimen can be altered at the discretion of the  treating 
investigator.  
 
5.22 See the GOG General Chemotherapy Guidelines (Appendix V).  
 
5.23 If side effects are not severe, a patient may remain on study indefinitely 
until evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
 
5.3 Concomitant Medications :  
 
Information for drug interactions with cytochrome P450 isoenzymes may be 
found at http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/   
Additional information can be found in Appendix III and Section 4.211.  
 
5.31 Specific recommendations regarding anticoagulants :  Results from drug -
drug interaction studies conducted in subjects with cancer suggest that 
pazopanib has no effect on the metabolism of S -warfarin.  H emorrhagic 
events , however,  have been reported  in clinical stud ies with pazopanib ; 
therefo re, pazopanib  should be used with caution in subjects with 
increased risk of severe bleeding or who are receiving concomitant 
anticoagulant therapy (e.g., warfarin or its derivatives, low molecular 
weight heparin) .  Subjects taking concomitant anticoagulan t therapy 
should be monitored regularly for changes in relevant coagulation 
parameters as clinically indicated, as well as for any clinical bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . 
 
5.32 Specific recommendations regarding hypoglycemic therapy including 
 insulin :   
  
Results fro m drug -drug interaction studies conducted in subjects with 
cancer suggest that there will be no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic 
interaction between pazopanib and hypoglycemic agents.  Transient 
decreases in serum glucose (mainly Grade 1 and 2, rarely G rade 3) have 
been observed in clinical studies with pazopanib.  In addition, decreases in 
blood sugar have been recently reported in subjects treated with another 
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib ( British Journal of 
Cancer 2008: 99, 1380 ).  Such changes may require an adjustment in the 
dose of hypoglycemic and/or insulin therapy.  Subjects should be advised 
to report symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g. confusion, visual disturbances, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], sweating).  Serum glucose should be tested dur ing treatment 
with pazopanib as outlined in the protocol and as c linically indicated.  
 
5.33 The Effects of Pazopanib on Other Drugs : 
 
  In vitro  data indicate that pazopanib is a potential inhibitor for CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912665] on CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 metabolism .  Therefore,  concomitant use of 
pazopanib with certain medications (substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and 
CYP2D6) with a narrow therapeutic window should be undertaken with 
CAUTION due to the potential for alterations in the pharmacologic 
effects of these medications or a n increased risk for serious or life 
threatening adverse events associated with such medications secondary to 
the inhibition of specific CYP enzymes by [CONTACT_107395].   
 
 See Section 4. 211.  Additional information for drug interactions with  
   cytochrome P450 isoenzymes may be found at  
 http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/  
 
 In addition, the potential for drug interaction with such medications, 
although diminished, may persist after the last dose of pazopanib due to its 
long half -life (i.e., mean 30.9 hours); t herefore, continue to exercise 
CAUTION  for at least [ADDRESS_912666] dose of 
pazopanib when administering these medications.  
   
5.34 The Effects of Other Drugs on Pazopanib :  
 Results from in vitro  studies suggest that the oxidative meta bolism of 
pazopanib in human liver microsomes is mediated primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A4, 
with minor contributions from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.  Furthermore, in 
vitro data suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for p -glycoprotein.  
Substances that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may alter the pharmacologic 
effects of pazopanib and should be used with CAUTION .   
  
Pazopanib, [ADDRESS_912667] on CYP2C9, CYP1A2 , or 
CYP2C19 in vivo but does in vitro .  Therefore, therapeutic doses of 
warfarin, a substrate of CYP2C9, and omeprazole, a substrate of 
CYP2C19 are permitted.  Caffeine, a substrat e of CYP1A2, is also 
permitted.     
  
Medications that inhibit CYP3A4 may result in increased plasma 
pazopanib con centrations.  S election of an alternate concomitant 
medication with no or minimal potential to inhibit CYP3A4 is 
recommended.    
 
See Section 4.211. Additional information for drug interactions with  
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes may be found at

- 39 - 5.4 Precautions/Warnings  (See Appendix III)  
 
5.41 QTc prolongation and Torsades de Pointes is a rare but serious adverse 
event associated with pazopanib.  Therefore, the following is required:  
 
5.411  Intensive QTc m onitoring.  A baseline EKG  is required prior to 
study registration, and subjects with QTc  > [ADDRESS_912668] be performed during the week 4, 
cycle 1 visit.  If the QTc interval at 4 weeks is ≥ 500 msec, the 
EKG  should be repeated within 7 days and, if the QTc interval 
remains ≥ [ADDRESS_912669] should be removed from the 
study.  Additionally, if the QTc interval is increased by 60 msec or 
more from baseline but the QTc interval remains at <  500 msec, an 
EKG  should be repeated within 7 days.  If the repeat EKG  again 
shows a ≥  [ADDRESS_912670] be questioned about family history of prolonged 
QTc, personal history of prolonged QTc, cardiac disease, and 
concomitant medications which are  associated with a high risk of 
causing QTc prolongation prior to study registration  (see s ections 
3.114 and 3.25) .   
 
5.[ADDRESS_912671] dose of pazopanib /placebo .  A comprehens ive list of agents that 
are associated with a risk of prolonging the QTc interval is provided 
in Appendix III.  Subjects who begin any drugs with a high risk for 
QTc prolongation while receiving pazopanib /placebo  should be 
monitored carefully for signs of potential problems with QTc 
prolongation (syncope, etc.).  An EKG  is not mandated in this 
circumstance; however, it should be performed at the treating 
physician’s discretion.     
 
5.[ADDRESS_912672] dose of pazopanib /placebo  
and frequently thereafter (as described in Section 7.1 ).   
 
Abnormalities in potassium, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium 
levels should be managed as detailed in Section 6.26.   
 
  5.42 Hypertension  is an important AE associated with pazopanib.  Frequent  
blood pressure (BP) monitoring  is important  in subjects receiving 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912673] is off study.  
Experience to date suggests that increases in BP may occur following 
dosing with pazopanib for a number of weeks and that these increases may 
occur relatively quickly.  It is imperative that the investigator institute 
appropriate measures to control BP.  This may necessitate changes to 
existing antihyper tensive medication, addition of new medication(s) 
and/or interruption/withdrawal of pazopanib.  Recommendations for 
hypertension management are presented in Appendix IV. 
 
5.43 Renal function  (creatinine and urinary protein) should be frequently 
monitored a s suggested by [CONTACT_675301].  Specific 
guidelines for management of proteinuria and elevated creatinine are 
presented in Section 6 .273. 
 
5.44 Hepatotoxicity (07/12/2013) 
 
Cases of hepatic failure, including fatalities, have been reported during the 
use of GW786034.  Two of 977 patients (0.2%) died with disease 
progression and hepatic failure in trials that supported the renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC) indication.  One of 240 patients (0.4%) died of hepatic 
failure in the randomized soft tissue sarcoma (STS) trial.  In RCC 
monotherapy trials using GW786034, increased alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been reported as very 
common (≥10%) , and abnormal hepatic function and hyperbilirubinemia 
have been reported as common (≥1% to <10%) adverse reactions.  In STS 
monotherapy trials using GW786034, increased ALT and AST have been 
reported as common (≥1% to <10%) adverse reactions.  
 
Elevated AL T (>3X ULN) and concurrent elevated ALT (>3X ULN) and 
bilirubin (>2X ULN) have been observed primarily between weeks 3 and 
9 of therapy in GW786034 clinical trials.  A comparison across trials with 
GW786034 indicates ALT >3X ULN in 1% and approximately 5% of 
patients treated with GW786034 at weeks [ADDRESS_912674] new 
cases of ALT >3X ULN occurred by [CONTACT_5875] 9.  More frequent monitoring 
between weeks 3 and 9 may lead to earlier detection of elevated serum 
liver tests and hepatotoxicity in patients taking GW786034.  
 
See Section 7.1 for the Risk Mitigation Plan  where s erum liver function 
tests should be monitored before initiation of treatment with GW786034 
and at weeks 3, 5, 7, and 9.  Thereafter, monitoring should occur at 
months 3 and 4, and as cli nically indicated.  Periodic monitoring should 
continue after month 4.

6.112  Patients will NOT receive prophylactic thrombopoietic agents.  
 
6.113  Patients may receive erythropoietin (EPO), iron supplements, 
and/or transfusions as clinically indicated for management of 
anemia. Treating physicians should be aware of prescribing 
information for the erythropoiesis stimulating agents (including 
Aranesp, Epogen and Procrit) which note that there is a potential 
risk of shortening the time to tumor progression or disease -free 
survival, and that these agents are administered only to avoid red 
blood cell transfusions. They do not alleviate fatigue or increase 
energy. They should not be used in patients with uncontrolled 
hypertension. They can cause an increased incidence of thromboti c 
events in cancer patients on chemotherapy. The updated package 
inserts should be consulted.

Maximal interruption is 2 weeks.   
1 The dose delays and modifications for anemia apply only to anemia which is due to hemorrhage or 
bleeding.  No specific dose delays or dose reductions are required for anemia due to other causes, but 
the investigator should dose delay and dose -decrease, if he/she feels it is necessary, in a manner 
consistent with good medical practice.

- 44 - 6.2  Dose and Treatment Modifications for Pazopanib /Placebo  
 
6.21  Management of Hypertension:  See Appendix IV 
 
Increases in blood pressure (BP) and cases of hypertension have been 
associated with many drugs acting on the VEGF pathway.  The proposed 
mechanism for this increase is through inhibition of VEGF -induced 
peripheral vasodilation.  Hypertens ion following pazopanib treatment has 
been seen in animal studies as well as clinical trials.  Specific guidelines 
for monitoring and management of this AE are provided below and in 
Appendix IV. 
 
• While subjects are receiving treatment with pazopanib /placeb o, the early 
initiation of antihypertensive treatment for grade 1 or 2 hypertension to 
minimize more severe or persistent hypertension is not considered a grade 
3 AE. 
 
• Decisions to hold or decrease the pazopanib /placebo  dose during treatment 
must be based on BP readings taken in the clinic by a medical 
professional.

biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least [ADDRESS_912727] be >[ADDRESS_912728] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 
mm).  A t baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 
≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis),  are considered non -measurable disease.  
Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal /pelvic  masses ( identified by [CONTACT_592847]), are considered  as non -measurable.  
 
Note s: 
Bone lesions :  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with 
identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_675305].  Blastic bone lesions are 
non-measurable.  
 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 62 - Cystic lesions  that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple 
cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable 
nor non -measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.   ‘Cystic 
lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases ca n be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described 
above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, 
these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesio ns up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions  and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions wi th 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, and in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible m easurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis 
for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimens ion of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified 
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of thes e lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
 8.12 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a 
ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely 
as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks 
before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_165324](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are 
assessable by [CONTACT_51748].  
 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 63 - mm diameter as assessed  using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of 
skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to 
estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when th ey are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, 
CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI : This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_912729] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the 
minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans), but NOT 
lung.   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent co ntrast, spatial, 
and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition 
variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is 
variable globally.  As with CT,  if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the 
modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline , 
and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  
It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI 
pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  
Ideally, subsequent image acquisitio ns should use the same type of 
scanner and follow the baseline imaging protocol as closely as possible.   If 
possible, b ody scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning 
techniques.  
 
PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of 
a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for 
use with RECIST measurements.  PET -CT scans are not always done with 
oral and IV contrast.  In addition, the PET portion of the CT introduces 
additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or 
serially performed.  For these reasons, the GOG will not allow PET -CT 
use for RECIST 1.1 response criteria.  
 
FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response assessments need add itional study, 
it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to 
complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly 
possible “new” disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging 
can be identified according to t he following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 64 - b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site o f 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD  will be 
the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease 
on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, 
this is not PD.  
 
Note:  A  “positive ” FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the 
attenuation corrected image.  
 
Ultrasound :  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and 
should not be used as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations 
cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later 
date and, because they are operator dependent, it c annot be guaranteed that 
the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment 
to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_13192], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about 
radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected 
instances.  
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy : The utilization of these techniques for objective 
tumor evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful 
to confirm complete pathological respon se when biopsies are obtained or 
to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete 
response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 
CA-125 (Ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_321853]) : 
CA125 cannot be used to assess r esponse or progression in this study .  
If CA125 is initially above the upper normal limit, it must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines 
for CA -125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) have been publ ished 
[JNCI  96:487 -488, 2004].     In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer 
Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_912730] -line trials 
in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534 -1535, 200 0]. 
 
Cytology, Histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases , 
e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where 
known residual benign tumors can remain .

  8.13 Response Criteria  
 
  Determination of response should take into consideration all target (See 
8.131) and non -target lesions (See 8.132) and, if appropriate, biomarkers 
(See 8.133).  
 
    8.131  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) 
must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.   
       
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of 
the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline 
sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum 
of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is 
the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more  new lesions 
is also considered progressions).  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for 
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference 
the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
 
    8.132  Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target 
lesions . All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 
mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If CA -[ADDRESS_912732] normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target 
lesion(s) Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/2015  
- 66 - new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  of existing non -
target lesions.  Unequivocal progressio n should not normally 
trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.  
 
Not evaluable (NE):  When at least one non -target lesion is not 
evaluated at a particular time point.  
 
Although a clear progression of only “non -target” lesions is 
exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_147782], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investiga tor). 
 
8.[ADDRESS_912733] Overall (unconfirmed) Response  
 
The best overall response is the best time point response 
recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest sum recorded since baseline ).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both me asurement and confirmation criteria  in 
some circumstances .

*If a CR is truly  met at first time point, then any disease seen at a 
subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR criteria relative to 
baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must 
have reappeared after CR).  However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed whe n subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely 
still present and in fact the patient had PR or SD, not CR at the first 
time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be 
changed to PR or SD and the best response is PR or SD.  
 
In non -randomized trials where response is part of the primary 
endpoint, confirmation of CR or PR is needed to deem either one 
the “best overall response.”   Responses (CR and PR) require 
confirmation at greater than or equal to 4 weeks from initial 
documentation.  
 
For this study, the minimum criteria for SD duration is 8 weeks.  
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment or die without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported to be o ff study 
treatment due to “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should 
be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  
  
  8.14 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is 
measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR 
(whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measur ements recorded since the 
treatment started).

treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since date of study entry , including the 
baseline measurements.

10.12  Reporting Expedited Adverse Events  
 
Depending on the phase of the study, use of investigational agents, and 
role of the pharmaceutical sponsor, an  expedited AE report may need to 
reach multiple destinations.  For patients participating on a GOG trial, all 
expedited AE reports should be submitted by [CONTACT_642966] (AdEERS).  All AdEERS submissions are 
reviewed  by [CONTACT_133954].  Submitting a report 
through AdEERS serves as notification to GOG, and satisfies the GOG 
requirements for expedited AE reporting. All AdEERS reports will be 
immediately directed to the Study Chair for further action . 
 
The requirement for timely reporting of AEs to the study sponsor is 
specified in the Statement of Investigator, Form FDA -1572.  In signing the 
FDA -1572, the investigator assumes the responsibility for reporting AEs 
to the NCI.  In compliance with FDA re gulations, as contained in 21 CFR 
312.64, AEs should be reported by [CONTACT_093] .

NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor (NCI) ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not 
they are considered related to the investigational a gent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342864] ≥ 24

4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threate ning, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. (FDA, 21 CFR  312.32; ICH E2A and ICH E6).  
 
ALL SERIOUS  adverse events that meet the above criteria MUST  be immediately reported to the NCI via

10.141  AdEERS Expedited Reports : Expedited reports are to be submitted 
using AdEERS available at http://ctep.cancer.gov. The CTEP, NCI 
Guidelines: Adverse Event Re porting Requirements for expedited 
adverse event reporting requirements are also available at this site.   
 
AML/MDS events must be reported via AdEERS (in addition to  
routine AE reporting mechanisms). In CTCAE v4.0, the event(s) 
may be reported as either: 1) Leukemia secondary to oncology 
chemotherapy, 2) Myelodysplatic syndrome, or 3) Treatment -

For the purposes of expedited reporting of adverse events to CTEP, 
unexpected events are those not listed in the Agent Specific 
Adver se Event List (ASAEL). The ASAEL is a subset of AE’s 
within the Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks List 
(CAEPR). This list of events is based on CTEP’s clinical 
experience with this agent and defines “expected” Grade 2 and 3 
AE’s not requiring  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_675264]. The CAEPR is a complete list of reported and/or

- 76 - 11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The purpose of this study is to asses s the relative activity of Arm 2  (the combination 
regimen)  to Arm 1  (the control of  paclitaxel ) through the hazard ratio of disease 
progression or death (PFS endpoint) as a superiority study.  The combination regimen 
must demonstrate  a reduction in the hazard rate  before it can be deemed inter esting and 
worthy of further investigation.  A reduction in the hazard rate by 37.5% is considered 
important to detect.  If the combination regimen has a hazard rate roughly equal to the 
control, then there would be little benefit seen from adding the expe rimental drug to 
paclitaxel  with a potential added risk through new drug toxicities.  Therefore, a 
combination regimen yielding roughly equal hazard rates to the control should be 
rejected.  
 
Patients will be stratified according to their platinum -free interval PFI (those with a PFI ≤ 
182 day versus those with PFI > 182 days), measurable disease status (measurable versus 
non-measurable or “detectable” disease), and prior use of bevacizumab therapy (no use 
versus prior use).

depending on the results of an interim analysis and rates of local IRB 
approval.

- 77 - 11.3 Study Plan:  
 
Given that this is a Phase 2 study, the probabilities of type I and type II errors 
being equal to 10% and 20% respectively, are considered acceptable.  Patients 
will be randomized equally to each arm.  The level of reduction in the hazard ratio 
of Arm [ADDRESS_912747] is 37.5%.  The null 
hypothesis is therefore Ho: Δ ≥ 1 versus Ha: Δ ≤ 0.625 (or  
0:0H and
: 0.4700aH
where 
  is the natural logarithm of the hazard r atio).  This 
alternative hypothesis is comparable to the experimental therapy increasing the 
cumulative proportion  of patients alive and progression -free at 5 months from 
50% to 65%.  Using Schoenfeld’s equation to approximate the number of required 
events  to achieve the study ’s desired operating  characteristics, we obtain D = ( Z α 
+ Z β )2 x (R + 1)2 / ( R x ln {Δ}2) = 81.63  when Z α = 1.2816, Zβ = 0.8416,  and R = 
1.  Z α = 1.28 since the alternative hypothesis is one -sided.  R is the ratio of 
patients assigned to the experimental therapy to the control therapy  which equals 
one since patients will be assigned to the arms with equal probability .  Based on 
these desired char acteristics, it is necessary to observe approximately 82 events.  
To assure data maturation in a timely manner, up to 110 patients could be accrued 
to the clinical trial.  Further justification for the final sample size when utilizing 
an interim analysis i s provided below:  
 
At approximately the 42nd  event (taking events from both treatment arms), an 
interim futility analysis will be conducted using the method provided by [CONTACT_675307]’s 
et al.[ADDRESS_912748] 
ratio is greater than 1. This decision rule will stop the study early 50% of the time 
when the hazard ratio is truly one.  On the other hand, there  could be  a non -trivial 
probability of falsely declaring active regimens not interesting. To correct this 
problem, group sequential methods will be utilized that incorporate the futility 
rule as outlined by [CONTACT_411515]60 (p49, eq. 3.1).  The standardized test 
statistics, related to the log hazard ratio at the interim and final analyses will be 
designated by Z1 and Z2, respectively.  Specifically,

where Ik is the information obtained at the kth stage of the design with

and d k being the total number of observed events at that time.  Since the use of 
Weiand et al. plans on observing Z 1 at 50% information time, the covariance 
between Z1 and Z2 is about 0.707.  The cumulative distribution function of Z1 and

Under H 0, the desired probability of rejecting the regimen is 90% (when the null 
hypothesis is true, alpha = 1 – 90% = 10%).  Searching algorithms can quickly 
find the value of 
2 1.25 c  which deviates slightly from the nominal value of -

report forms and summarized for review by [CONTACT_64362], Developmental 
Therapeutics Committee, and GOG SRC in conjunction with each semi -annual

Branch (IDB) and Clinical Investigation Branch (CIB).  
 
 All serious and/or unexpected eve nts are communicated to the Study Chair, 
sponsor, and regulatory agencies as mandated in the protocol. These reports are 
reviewed by [CONTACT_64362] (or designated co -chair) for consideration of 
investigator notification, amendment, or immediate study susp ension.  All 
participating institutions will then receive notification of the toxicities and reason 
for study suspension.   Under these circumstances, accrual cannot be re -activated 
until the study is reviewed by [CONTACT_675309].   
How ever, patients currently receiving treatment may continue to receive treatment 
in accordance with protocol guidelines at the discretion of their physicians, unless 
directed otherwise.  
 
11.5 Secondary and Exploratory Analyses : 
Toxicities will be characteriz ed by [CONTACT_675310].  Differences in 
the level of toxicities by [CONTACT_675311].  
Differences between measurable versus  non-measurable disease status on PFS 
and OS will be examined with plots of survival curves, estimates of quartiles and 
hazard ratios.  Formal tests for differences will be carried out with a Cox model or 
log-rank test if appropriate.  The effects of treat ment on the proportion r esponding 
by [CONTACT_675312]125 will be examined.  An examination of 
response by [CONTACT_28474]125 (stratified by [CONTACT_3148]) will also be conducted in those 
patients who have measurable disease to assess the level of agreement between  
the two methods of evaluation.  The impact of additional, various prognostic 
factors  or biological markers  will be examined with  exploratory analyses 
including log -rank tests with characterization with hazard ratio estimates.  
 
11.6 Translational Research  
 
Translational research (TR) data can be fairly difficult to analyze statistically for 
various reasons including data that are highly skewed (non -normal) or of ordinal 
quality where differences between observations are not meaningful.  It has 
become custom ary to dichotomize biomarker data61 to help overcome these 
difficulties and ease the interpretation of the results.  
 
For this study, biomarker data will be dichotomized (if feasible) at the median or, 
less commonly, whether or not expression is observed in  the patients.  
Dichotomizing at the median tends to have an advantage by [CONTACT_675313] (relative to other cut points) when there is a significant 
association between the biomarker and clinical outcome.  
 
Depending on the number  of events and biomarkers under examination, one of 
two strategies will be taken with regard to prognostic variable assessment.  If the 
number of biomarkers is relatively large (but no more than 25) and the nature of 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912751].  After consultation with the 
TR co -chair, a finalization of the primary questions  (relatively few) will be done 
and recorded.  The other half of the data will then be addressed with these specific 
questions for validation.  On the other hand, if the number of questions is 
relatively small to begin with (no more than 3 questions) or the  total number of 
events relatively small, then the entire dataset can be used to ask these questions.  
The benefit to having a smaller number of questions is greater statistical power, 
but important questions may be overlooked.  The benefit to data splitti ng is 
having validated conclusions after screening many prospects.  
 
The marginal probability of detecting a biomarker’s prognostic effects on the 
hazard of death or progression depends on its true hazard ratio,
 , the level of 
significance, 
 , and the number of events in the study,
D , through the normal 
cdf, provided by 
 as follows:  
 
/2 Power = 2Dz
 
 
The equation above holds since  we expect ½ of the patients to score high.  This 
study is planning a total of 84 PFS endpoints, so the probabilities of detection 
under this assumption are provided in Figure 11.2 (assuming a high proportion of 
patients participating in the TR aspect of t his study).  
 
Figure 11.[ADDRESS_912752] ratio for patients with high levels of expression 
versus those  with low levels of expression when assessed with the entire dataset 
(D=84)  
 
NCI Protocol #: GOG -0186J  
Version  Date: 03/09/[ADDRESS_912753] ratio for progression on the 
experimental treatment to the control treatment depends on the level of biomarker 
expression (high versus low).  Using Peterson and George’s notation, let Delta1 
be the hazard ratio for low levels of biomarker expression and Delta2 be the 
hazard ratio for the high levels of biomarker expression.  When 
12/1   , the 
biomarker contains no predictive value for treatment effectiveness.  The hazard 
ratios are the same regardless of the level of biomarker expression (however, the 
biomarker could still be prognostic).  
 
Because these tests amount to tests of interaction between treatment and 
biomarker level, the amount of power is drastically reduced.  Therefore, there is 
no luxury of data splitting.  All analyses will involve the full dataset and be 
exploratory (hypothesis generating) in nature.  The equation for calculating power 
is similar to the one above except the relevant number of events is now only 21 
(84 events for 2 treatments cut  into four cells is 21; see Peterson and George for 
full details).  Note that roughly equal numbers of patients with high levels of 
biomarker expression are expected to be randomized to the treatments; also, the 
power calculations are robust as shown in Ta ble 3 of publication.

and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_675265]62).  Patients that progress before the last time of tissue collection (in 
the entire sample) will not be included in the analysis.  The starting point will be 
adjusted from the date of entry to approximately the start of cycle 2 (when th e 
post-treatment samples are collected) for these particular analyses.  Because a 
number of patients (and some events) will be eliminated, the overall power of 
these analyses will not be as high as described previously.  However, the powers 
listed previous ly should be fair approximations since the number of patients that 
progress should be few.

In some instances of treatment for hypertension, a lower dose of the medication may be sufficient to 
provide the required antihypertensive control.  In other instances, the standard dose of such a 
medication may be associated with AEs because of increased exposure.  Alternatively, the 
investigator may choose to replace the medication with another in the same pharmacologic class that 
is less likely to interact with pazopanib /placebo .  If such a medication is discontinued and replaced, 
the transition period s hould occur no less than [ADDRESS_912770] dose of pazopanib.  Based on 
prior clinical experience with pazopanib, the use of calcium channel blockers (dihydropyridine 
category) and ACE inhibitors as first -line and second -line therapy is recommended .

APPENDIX V  
 
GOG General Chemotherapy Guidelines  
 
• For [ADDRESS_912771] a new cycle of 
chemotherapy delayed up to 7 days (without this being considered to be a protocol 
violation) for major life events (e.g., serious illness in a family member, major holiday, 
vacation which is unable to be re -scheduled).  Documentation to justify this decision 
should be provided.  
• It will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses to be delivered within a “24 -
hour window before and after the protocol -defined date” for “Day 1” treatment of 21 or 
28 day cycles.   If the treatment due date is a Friday, and the patient cannot be treated  on 
that Friday, then the window for treatment would include the Thursday (1 day earlier 
than due) through the Monday (day [ADDRESS_912772] due).  
• For weekly regimens, it will be acceptable for individual chemotherapy doses to be 
delivered within a “24 -hour window,” for example; “Day 8 chemotherapy” can be 
delivered on Day 7, Day 8, or Day 9 and “Day 15 chemotherapy” can be given on Day 
14, Day 15, or Day 16.  
• Chemotherapy doses can be “rounded” according to institutional standards without 
being considered a protocol violation ( most institutions use a rule of approximately +/ - 
5% of the calculated dose ). 
• Chemotherapy doses are required to  be recalculated if the patient has a weight change 
of greater than or equal to 10%.   Patients are permitted to have chemotherapy dos es 
recalculated for <10% weight changes. (10/09/2012)  
• Maximum body surface area used for chemotherapy dose calculations will be 2.0 m2.  
For chemotherapy dose calculations that use mg/kg, there will be no maximum 
kilogram amount used (doses will be calcula ted on actual weight in kg).

Policies if the following condition is satisfied: Each patient in question must have provided 
permission for the use of her specimens for cancer and/or non -cancer research. The patient’s 
choices will be documented on the in formed consent document that the patient signs for the 
protocol and on the online Specimen Consent Application (available on the GOG web -site).  
 
GOG Institutions can amend a patient’s choices regarding the future use of her specimens 
at any time  if the pat ient changes her mind.  
 
If the patient does not give permission for the use of her specimens, the GOG Tissue Bank will 
be instructed to destroy (incinerate) any remaining specimens to insure that the patient’s wishes 
are honored .

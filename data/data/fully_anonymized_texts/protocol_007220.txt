 1. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
 
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_147304] -200 ophthalmic 
solution (betamethasone sodium phosphate [BSP] , 0.02% or  0.04% ) compared to vehicle when 
dosed twice daily (BID) for 2 weeks and followed for an additional 8 weeks for assessment of 
rebound and safety in subjects with a diagnosis of Dry Eye Disease (DED) and experiencing an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_534212] . 
 
2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
This study is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -masked, dose -ranging, vehicle-
controlled, parallel -group clinical trial. Subjects 18 years of age and older with a diagnosis of dry 
eye disease and experiencing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_534213]. 
The investigator and his/her staff will not know which study medication the subject is receiving 
but will be able to determine this in the event of an emergency.  
 
Prior to enrollment, the study will be discussed with prospective subjects and those wishing to enter will be asked to give written informed consent. Informed consent will be obtained prior to 
any study related procedures being performed. Once informed consent has been obtained, the 
subjects will be questioned regarding their medical history to determine whether or not they are  in 
satisfactory health to enter the study and to determine if they meet the specific entry criteria.  
 
There will be a total of 7 study visits:   
Screening Visit 1 (Day - 14 to Day 0), Baseline/Randomization Visit 2 (Day 1), Visit 3 (Day 8), 
End of Treatment Visit 4 (Day 15), Visit 5 (Day 28), Visit 6 (Day 49) and Study Completion/Early 
Discontinuation Visit 7 (Day 70).

 Screening (Day - 14 to Day 0) , Randomization (Day 1) , and Dosing Phase (Day 1 to Day 14) :  
 
During the screening phase of the study, subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio: 40 subjects in the 0.02% BSP group, 40 subjects in the 
0.04% BSP group, and 40 subjects in the vehicle group. D uring the dosing phase (Day 1 to Day 
14), subjects will instill study drug BID for 14 days. Subjects will receive instructions for dosing 
at home and for completing a Study Drug D osing Diary with Drop Comfort Questionnaire during 
the study dosing phase (Day 1 to Day 14) . Subjects (or their caregivers) will be instructed to store 
the study drug at room temperature (15°-  25°C; 59° -  77°F), to protect the study drug from light 
and to not freeze the study drug, as well as to instill 2 doses (preferably 8- 12 hours apart) every 
day for [ADDRESS_693899] follow the same dosing regimen as the study eye.  
 Visit 3 (Day 8)  
 Subjects will be  assessed  for safety and efficacy assessments.  
 Visit 4 (Day 15):  Improvement  
 
Subjects who achieve a 1 unit or better 
improvement in University of North Carolina 
(UNC) Dry Eye Management Scale (DEMS)  
score and a 0.5 point or better improvement in 
conjunctival hyperemia  at Visit 4 (Day 15) 
when compared to their baseline score s will 
then be followed for 8 weeks during the 
evaluation phase (Day 15 to Day 70) to assess 
for a rebound and safety.  
 
Rebound Assessments at Visit 5 (Day 28), 
Visit 6 (Day 49), and Visit 7 (Day 70)  
 
Rebound is ass essed at Visit 5 (Day 28),  
Visit 6 (Day 49) and Visit 7 (Day 70) when 
compared to Visit 4 (Day 15) as a 1 unit or 
more worsening in UNC  DEMS sco re and a 0.5 
point or more worsening in conjunctival 
hyperemia. Subjects who meet this definition 
of having a rebound will complete the current 
visit (e ither Visit 5 [Day 28], Visit 6 [Day 49] 
or Visit 7 [Day 70]) and then be discontinued  
from the study prior to receiving another 
possible treatment.  Visit 4 (Day 15):  No Improvement -  Early 
Discontinuation  
Subjects who do not achieve a 1 unit or better 
improvement in UNC DEMS score and a 0.5 
point or better improvement in conjunctiva l 
hyperemia at Visit 4 (Day 15) when compared to their baseline score will complete the Early 
Discontinuation Visit (Visit 7).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Subjects will be instructed to bring all their study drug (used and unused) and subject diaries with 
them to Visit 3 (Day 8) for review with site staff, and to return their study drug (used and unused) 
and subject diaries at Visit 4 (Day 15).  
Clinical  Study Protocol  
Study  No. C-200-001 Amendment 1,  Redacted  – Clinicaltrials.gov  
(including Statistical Analysis Pla n) 
 SURF -[ADDRESS_693900] s’ safety will be evaluated throughout the study. The safety parameters to be assessed are 
the incidence, severity, and relationship of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuations due to AEs, changes in visual acuity (VA) and int raocular pressure (IOP), 
and biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic findings in treated eyes.  
 
Efficacy will be assessed as follows:  All analyses will be done descriptively. No confirmatory 
statistical testing will be performed, but exploratory statistical tests may be used to evaluate the efficacy parameters. Data for the study eye will be used for all efficacy analyses.  
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
 
The primary efficacy analysis planned is listed below. Each active treatment group (0.02% and 
0.04% BSP) will be independently compared to the Vehicle group. As this is a Phase 2 study, no 
superiority claims are being tested; therefore, no adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.  Comparisons will be made with a two -sided Fisher’s exact test with an alpha- level 
of 0.05.  
 
1. The proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in UNC 
DEMS score at Visit 3 (Day 8) will be summarized for each treatment group. A clinically 
significant improvement is defined as a minimum reduction in UNC DEMS score of 1 unit 
or more. Subjects who receive another therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms 
of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy at or prior to Visit 3 (Day 8) will be 
treated as failures.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  
 The two secondary efficacy analyses planned are listed below.  
 
1. The proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in UNC 
DEMS score at Visit 4 (Day 15) will be summarized for each treatment group. A clinically 
significant improvement is defined as a minimum reduction in UNC DEMS score of 1 unit 
or more. Subjects who receive another therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms 
of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy at or prior to Visit 4 (Day 15) will be 
treated as failures.  
 
2. The proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in 
conjunctival hyperemia (using a consistent light source, examiner and exam room from 
visit to visit) in the study eye at Visit 3 (Day 8) will be summarized for each treatme nt 
group. A clinically significant improvement is defined as an improvement of 0.5 points or more. Subjects who receive another therapeutic treatment for the  signs and symptoms of 
their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy at or prior to Visit 3 (Da y 8) will be treated 
as failures.  
 Biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy study examinations should be performed by [CONTACT_147327]-
certified ophthalmologist or a board- certified or state licensed optometrist (that would allow them 
legally to diagnose and treat patients independently) from visit t o visit. All other ratings and 
procedures should be performed by [CONTACT_147323].

5. STUDY DRUG/INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND ADMINISTRATION  
 The study drug will be masked, packaged and labeled in a manner consistent with the study design.  
The Sponsor or designee shall provide the packaging of and labeling of the study drug. The study 
drug will be identified as a new drug, limited by [CONTACT_44505] , manufactured 
and packaged for Surface Pharmaceuticals . The study number, unique kit number, Sponsor 
information, storage instructions and dosing instructions will be identified on the label. Fields for 
the site staff to write -in the subject number to which the study drug kit will be assigned as well as 
the subject’s unique randomization number will also be present on the label . 
 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive masked study drug ( either 0.02% or 0.04% BSP  
ophthalmic solution  or vehicle)  for 1 4 days BID. Subjects will receive instructions for dosing at 
home and for completing a dosing diary with a drop comfort questionnaire during the study dosing 
phase (Day - 1 to Day 14) .  
 During the 14- day dosing period, a total of 28 doses (2 doses each day, once in the morning and 
once in the evening, preferably 8- 12 hours apart) will be instilled in the study eye  and, if applicable, 
in the fellow eye  by [CONTACT_423] (or their caregiver).  
 6. CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
 Contraindications : Betamethasone sodium phosphate (BSP), as with other ophthalmic  
corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most active viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epi[INVESTIGATOR_534215] (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also 
in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal disease s of ocular structures.  
 Warnings and Precautions : Ocular adverse reactions which may occur with SURF -200 based on  
marketed ophthalmic corticosteroids include the following:  
• Prolonged intensive use of corticosteroids may result in IOP increase, glaucoma with 
damage to the optic nerve, posterior subcapsular cataracts, thinning of the globe and 
eventual perforation, secondary ocular infection, reduced visual acuity and visual fi eld 
defects, mydriasis, ptosis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_534216], and corneal calcification may occur.

Surface Ophthalmics Inc.  12  
 • Delayed healing -  The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and 
increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the 
cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826].  
• Bacterial infections -  Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response 
and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In acute purulent 
conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection.  
• Viral infections -  Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate 
the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).  
• Fungal infections -  Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop 
coincidentally with long -term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be 
considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal culture should be taken when appropriate.  
 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use :  
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_534217].  
• Persistent visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_121464]. Persistent symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances should be 
evaluated for possible causes which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases 
such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of 
systemic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930].  
 Undesirable Effects : 
• Hypersensitivity reactions usually of the delayed type, leading to irritation, burning, stinging, itching and dermatitis.  
• Corneal calcification has been reported very rarely in association with the use of phosphate -containing eye drops in some patients with significantly damaged corneas.  
 Overdose:  Long term intensive topi[INVESTIGATOR_534218]. 
Oral ingestion of the contents of a single -dose container of SURF -200 is unlikely to lead to any 
serious adverse effects.  
 Drug -Drug Interactions: No topi[INVESTIGATOR_147317]- drug interactions are known for SURF -200. 
Corticosteroids (including betamethasone sodium phosphate) are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4. Ketoconazole has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by [CONTACT_8622] 
60%, leading to an increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. Coadminis tration with other strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors ( e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat -containing products) 
may lead to increased exposures of corti costeroids and therefore the potential for increased risk of 
systemic corticosteroid side effects. ( Celestone Soluspan PI 2018) .  
 
Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines : SURF -[ADDRESS_693908] or operate hazardous machinery unless vision is clear.

 7. CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
 
Disallowed medications include corticosteroids and NSAIDs (except oral doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_9601]  
81 mg/day or lower) within 2 weeks of the initiation of study drug at Baseline/Randomization Visit 2 (Day 1) and for the remainder of the study. Stable use of inhaled and nasal corticosteroids and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_534219] (except on the eyelids) are allowed . 
 Disallowed medications also include inhaled, ingested, sublingual, transdermal or topi[INVESTIGATOR_534220], tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD) within [ADDRESS_693909] dose of study drug at Baseline/Randomization Visit 2 ( Day 1) and for the remainder of 
the study.  
 
Administration of any concomitant medication must be reported in the appropriate section of the 
source documents and Concomitant Medications Case Report Form.  
 A prohibited drug may be administered in an emergency situation if the subject's safety is in 
jeopardy. If possible, the sponsor should be consulted prior to administration of the prohibited drug 
(if not feasible, then as soon as possible afterwards) to de termine whether the subject may continue 
in the study.  
 
Concomitant medications (both prescription and nonprescription [including over the counter 
medicine, vitamins, supplements, and herbal supplements]), taken within 3 months prior to 
Screening Visit 1 (Day - 14 to Day 0) will be recorded in the source documents and entered on the 
appropriate electronic case report f orm (eCRF). Doses of concomitant medications should remain 
stable, if possible, during the study. All concomitant medications taken throughout the course of 
the study, including any medications required to treat AEs or concomitant illnesses and any changes in concurrent medications, will also be recorded in the source documents and entered on 
the appropriate eCRF . Concomitant medications used for ocular exams, including but not limited 
to Fluress
®, proparacaine, benoxinate or fluorescein, will not be collected.

 SURF -[ADDRESS_693911] : Schirmer tear tests will be conducted with anesthesia in both eyes at Visit 1 
(Screening; Day - 14 to Day 0) and only at Visit 2 (Day 1)  if Visit 2 is >5 days following Visit 1. 
Schirmer tear tests (with anesthesia) will also be conducted in treated eye(s) at Visit 3 (Day 7) 
through Study Completion/Early Discontinuation Visit 7 (Day 70 ) to assess aqueous production.  
 Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications:  At each study visit, subjects will be queried for 
new adverse events and, if applicable, previously unresolved adverse events. Also, concomitant medications will be documented.  
 Diary: At Visit 2 through Visit 4 (Day 1 through Day 15), subjects’ Dosing Diaries will be 
reviewed and compliance with study drug dosing and completion of the Drop Comfort Questionnaire will be evaluated.  
 Biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy study examinations should be performed by [CONTACT_147327]-
certified ophthalmologist or a board- certified or state licensed optometrist (that would allow them 
legally to diagnose and treat patients independently) from visit t o visit. All other ratings and 
procedures should be performed by [CONTACT_147323].  
 9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Throughout the course of the study, the investigator must remain alert to possible adverse events 
or untoward findings. If adverse events occur, the first concern will be the safety of the subject. 
Appropriate medical intervention will be provided by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator.  
 Adverse Event (AE) Definition: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a study drug in a clinical investigation subject, whether or not considered related to the study drug.  
 Adverse Event Reporting Period:  The AE reporting period for this trial begins upon signing the 
ICF and ends at the completion of the subjects’ final study visit exam. All AEs reported by [CONTACT_137825], or elicited by [CONTACT_147329], or noted as a 
result of procedures carried out on the subject, during the AE -reporting period must be recorded 
by [CONTACT_147330], whether or not the event is considered related to the study drug. In addition, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE 
reporting period that the investigator  assesses as related to the study drug should also be reported 
as an AE.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition:  A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any 
untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening or immediately sight- threatening in a treated eye(s)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above

SAE Reporting:  SAEs must be immediately reported (within 24 hours of awareness of the event) 
to designated contract research organization (CRO) and will be clearly documented in the source documents and on the appropriate AE eCRF and SAE Report Form. The investigator mus t also 
notify the IRB of any SAEs, according to the IRB’s guidelines.  
 
Pre-existing Conditions:  In this trial, a pre -existing condition (i.e., a disorder present before the 
AE-reporting period started and noted on the Systemic and/or Ocular Medical History Forms) 
should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or epi[INVESTIGATOR_534222] -reporting period.  
 
BCVA:  A worsening of 3 lines or more in log of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) score 
in the study eye from baseline or any prior visit should be captured in the source documents and on the appropriate eCRF as an AE.  
 IOP:  An increase from baseline or any prior study visit of 10 mmHg in IOP in the study eye should 
be captured in the source documents and on the appropriate eCRF as an AE. An IOP of 30 mmHg or higher will be reported as an SAE.  
 Biomicroscopy:  Slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed to observe the overall health of the 
eye, including the lid/lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Any biomicroscopy observations noted prior to Screening (Visit 1) should be recorded as ocular 
medical history. Any treatment- emergent findings (i.e., findings that were not present prior to 
treatment or a worsening relative to the pretreatment baseline) should be recorded as an AE.  
 
Ophthalmoscopy:  A new finding or a significant worsening (2 units or more) from baseline 
should be recorded as an AE.  
 AE Considerations:  Additional exams may be scheduled as necessary to ensure the safety of the 
subjects during the study period. Subjects discontinued due to an AE should be seen for post -study 
follow -up visits, as needed. Adverse events considered related to study drug that have not resolved 
or stabilized by [CONTACT_147331] -study follow -up visits at the 
discretion of the investigator until the incident has resolved or stabilized and will be documented 
in the source documents and AE eCRF. Where appropriate, additional written reports and 
documentation will be provided. Adverse events considered not related to study drug that have not 
resolved or stabilized by [CONTACT_147332], follow ed at the 
discretion of the investigator, and recorded in the source documents.  
 
Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, any complication related to pregnancy 
would be considered an AE and recorded in the source documents and, if applicable, on the AE eCRF. If an SAE is associated with the pregnancy, the SAE should be reported on the SAE Report 
Form.

 10. STATISTICAL A NALYS ES 
 
10.1. Randomization, Stratification, and Masking  
 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to each of the SURF -200 and vehicle groups in a 1:1:1 
ratio according to a validated SAS® computer -generated central randomization schedule. The 
randomization schedule contains the coded treatment assignments for  each randomization number. 
The randomization plan will be based on the study design, number of treatment groups and number of sites.  
 The randomization is generated by [CONTACT_137980]- masked statistician who is not affiliated with the study. 
The randomization plan will be based on the study design, number of treatment groups, and 
number of sites . It is shared with the Sponsor’s designee responsible for final clinical packaging 
and labeling to allow for proper packaging and labeling of the study drug supply. Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled according to the Sponsor designee ’s Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs).  
 
The randomization is not unmasked until the study is complete and the database is locked. The 
Sponsor will confirm in writing that there are no regulatory or quality issues which preclude the 
unmasking of the study.  
 Unmasking of the randomization code prior to study completion due to a medical emergency will 
be managed in accordance with the Sponsor designee’s SOP. All unmasked cases will be fully 
documented. Otherwise, the study mask will remain intact.  
 
In this double -masked study, the investigator and his/her study staff, the subject (including 
caregiver, if applicable) and Sponsor/designee (other than as stated above) are masked to the identity of the study drug.  
 10.2. Efficacy and Safety Variables  
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint : 
• The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in UNC DEMS score at Visit 3 (Day 8).  A clinically significant 
improvement is defined as a minimum reduction in UNC DEMS score of 1 unit or more.  
Subjects who receive another therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy at or prior to Visit 3 (Day 8) will be treated as 
failures.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s: 
• The proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in UNC 
DEMS score at Visit 4 (Day 15). A clinically significant improvement is defined as a 
minimum reduction in UNC DEMS score of 1 unit or more. Subjects who receive another  
therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of 
efficacy at or prior to Visit 4 (Day 15) will be treated as failures.  
• The proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in 
conjunctival hyperemia  (using a consistent light source, examiner and exam room from visit 
to visit) in the study eye at Visit 3 (Day 8). A clinically significant improvement is defined

 as an improvement of 0.5 points or more.  Subjects who receive another therapeutic treatment 
for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy at or prior to 
Visit 3 (Day 8) will be treated as failures.  
 
Safety Variables : AEs (including SAEs) , BCVA, IOP, biomicroscopic and ophthalmoscopic  
findings.  
 
10.3. Analysis Populations  
 Intent -to-Treat Population : The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subjects  
regardless of whether post -baseline measures are collected, or study drug is received . Subjects in 
the ITT  population will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were assigned by [CONTACT_429433], regardless of which study drug they receive.  
 
Per Protocol  Population : The per -protocol (PP) population includes  all subjects who received at 
least one dose of study drug and had no significant protocol deviations .  
 
Safety Population: The safety population includes all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of the 
study drug. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed in the treatment group for the study drug they received.  
 10.4. Data Handling: Handling of Missing Data  
 All missing data will generally not be imputed unless otherwise specified. For subjects who are 
withdrawn from the study prior to study completion, all data compi[INVESTIGATOR_147320]. All study discontinuations will be included in all analyses up to the time of study discontinuation.   
 For the classification  of treatment  emergent  adverse events  (TEAEs)  and concomitant  medications, 
the following will be applied in case of missing/incomplete dates: 
• If all dates/times (start and stop) are missing, the event/medication will automatically 
be classified as a TEAE/ concomitant medication . 
• For AE/medication  with a missing  start date/time,  if the event  end date/time  is prior  to 
first study drug administration, the event will not be classified as a TEAE /concomitant 
medication , as applicable.  
• If only the AE start year/medication  end year is present  and is the same  or is after the 
first study  drug administration  year unit, the event/medication  will be classified  as a 
TEAE/ concomitant medication , as applicable.  
• If the AE start month  and year/medication  end month  and year are present  and are the 
same or  after the first study  drug administration  month  and year units, the 
event/medication  will be classified as a  TEAE/concomitant medication , as applicable.  
 
10.5. Statistical Methods : General Considerations  
 All final statistical analyses  will be performed  after the study database has been  locked,  unmasked, 
and released  for statistical analysis.  All tables,  statistical analyses,  figures,  and subject  data listings 
will be generated using SAS® Version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, 
[LOCATION_002] of America).  
Clinical  Study Protocol  
Study  No. C-200-001 Amendment 1,  Redacted  – Clinicaltrials.gov  
(including Statistical Analysis Pla n) 
 SURF -[ADDRESS_693912] number and assessment visit, as appropriate.  
 Unless otherwise stated, continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including number of non- missing observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum and maximum values. The minimum and maximum values will be presen ted to the same 
number of decimal places as the e CRF or laboratory reported data; mean, SD, and median will be 
presented to one more decimal place than the source data.  
 
Categorical  variables  will be summarized  with frequency counts  and percentages.  The population 
size (N for sample size and n for available data) and the percentage (of available data) for each class  of the variable will be presented.  Percentages  will be rounded  to one decimal  place,  with the 
denominator being the number of patients in the relevant population, unless otherwise stated.  
 
Only data from nominal protocol scheduled visits will be included in the summary tables. Data 
from unscheduled visits will not be included in the summary tables but will be included in the 
figures and listings.  
 It should be noted that in this study the analysis unit is subject. When data from both eyes are 
available, data will not be pooled together for the analysis because eyes from the same subject are 
not independent samples. Statistical analysis generally req uires independent samples. Each subject 
has a designated study eye as per the protocol. Therefore, separate analysis will be conducted for study eye and fellow eye as appropriate.  
 
All confidence intervals (CIs) of the parameter estimates will be two -sided and at the significance 
level of 0.05 unless otherwise stated.  
 
All data summaries and data listings will use the nominal visit names as captured in the e CRF and 
as per the protocol schedule of visits. Derived visit windows will not be used for the data analysis. For all ‘by [CONTACT_765]’ summary analyses of efficacy and safety endpoints, if a subject has an early 
discontinuation before Visit 6/Day 84, the data fr om the early discontinuation visit will be included 
in Visit 6/Day [ADDRESS_693913] has an early discontinuation after Visit 6/Day 84 but before Visit 7/Da y 98, the data from the early discontinuation visit will be included in Visit 7/Day 
98 assessment.  
 
10.6. General Derived and Transformed Data  
 Age, in completed years, at informed consent date will be defined as: Age (years) = integer value 
(Date of Informed Consent – Date of Birth + 1) / 365.25).  
 Study day will be calculated using the first dosing date as the reference date. If the date of interest 
occurs on or after the first dosing date, then study day will be calculated as (date of interest –  date 
of first dosing) + 1. If the date of interest oc curs prior to the first dosing date, then study day will 
be calculated as (date of interest –  date of first dosing). The day of the first dosing will be identified 
as Study Day 1 according to Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) standard.  
If a subject is dosed but dosing dates are missing, then the randomization date will be used as the 
first dosing date for the calculation of study day. Data listings will present study days in addition

 SURF -[ADDRESS_693914] dosing with study 
drug, will be used for the derivation of baseline value.  
 
Change from Baseline: Assessment value at post -dosing visit – baseline value. It should be noted 
that if the derived baseline as above is missing for one parameter, then the change from baseline will not be available for this parameter. Imputation of baseline data will not be conducted.  
 Percentage Change from Baseline:  
(Assessment value at post -dosing visit – baseline value)*100 / baseline value  
 
11. EFFICACY 
 11.1. Primary and Secondary Efficacy Analysis : UNC DEMS Reduction  
 UNC DEMS is used to measure the primary and one of the secondary endpoints. UNC  DEMS 
score is rated from 1 to 10, with a higher score associated more severe dry eye symptoms. Data are NOT collected separately for study/fellow eyes. UNC DEMS is assessed at  each study visit.  
 
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in UNC DEMS score at Visit 3 (Day 8). A clinically significant improvement is defined 
as a minimum reduction in UNC DEMS score of 1 unit or more. Subjects who receive another 
therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy 
at or prior to Visit 3 (Day 8) will be treated as failures.  
 
One of the secondary endpoints is the proportion of subjects with clinically significant 
improvement from baseline in UNC DEMS score at Visit 4 (Day 15). A clinically significant 
improvement is defined as a minimum reduction in UNC DEMS score of 1 unit or more. Subjects 
who receive another therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534223] a lack of efficacy at or prior to Visit 4 (Day 15) will be treated as failures.  
 
Responder Analysis  
 Subjects with 1 unit or more reduction in UNC DEMS score from baseline are defined as 
responders, and response rates will be summarized at Visit 3 (Day 8) and Visit 4 (Day 15). All 
other subjects with non- missing data will be treated as non -responders. Further, subjects who 
receive another therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy at or prior to Visit 3 (Day 8)/Visit 4 (Day 15) will be treated as failures. It should 
be noted that subjects will b e treated as non -responders from the time point that they received non-
study treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy.  
 
For the ITT  responder analysis, the a nalysis will be conducted based on the observed available

 data without any imputation for missing data.  
 
The responder  rate will be summarized at Visit 3 (Day 8) and Visit 4 (Day 15) by [CONTACT_1570], 
along with its 95% CI which will be estimated by [CONTACT_94532] -Pearson exact method. The difference 
in responder  rates between each of the SURF - 200 formulations and vehicle at each visit will be 
compared by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact method.  
 
11.2. Secondary Endpoint: Conjunctival Hyperemia Grade Reduction  
 
Conjunctival hyperemia grade is used to measure one of the secondary endpoints, and will be 
assessed using a consistent light source, examiner and exam room from visit to visit. Conjunctival 
hyperemia is graded from 0 to 3, with a higher grade (score) associated more severe conditions.  
Data are collected separately for study/fellow eyes. Conjunctival hyperemia is assessed at  each 
study visit.  
 The proportion of subjects with clinically significant improvement from baseline in conjunctival 
hyperemia in the study eyes at Visit 3 (Day 8) will be summarized for each treatment group. A 
clinically significant improvement is defined as a reduction of 0.5 points or more. Subjects who 
receive another therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] 
a lack of efficacy at or prior to Visit 3 (Day 8) will be treated as failures.  
 
Responder Analysis  
 Subjects with 0.5 point  or more reduction in conjunctival hyperemia grade (score) from baseline 
are defined as responders, and respon der rates will be summarized at Visit 3 (Day 8). All other 
subjects with non- missing data will be treated as non -responders. Further, subjects who receive 
another therapeutic treatment for the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of eff icacy at or prior to Visit 3 (Day 8) will be treated as failures. It should be noted that subjects 
will be treated as no n-responders from the time point once they received non- study treatment for 
the signs and symptoms of their epi[INVESTIGATOR_534214] a lack of efficacy.  
 
For the ITT responder analysis, the first analysis will be conducted based on the observed available 
data without any imputation for missing data.  
 
The same responder analysis as conducted for the primary endpoint will be conducted for 
conjunctival hyperemia response analysis. That is, for each treatment group, the responder  rates 
and their Clopper -Pearson exact 95% CIs will be estimated at Visit 3 (Day 8). The responder  rate 
difference and its 95% CI between each of the SURF -200 formulations (0.02% and 0.04% BSP) 
vs vehicle at Visit 3 (Day 8) will be estimated as well. The difference in respon der rates between 
each of the SURF -200 formulations and vehicle at each visit will be compared by [CONTACT_3493]’s exact 
method.  
 
The responder analysis for conjunctival hyperemia grade is only applicable to study eye data.

 12. SAFETY  
 
12.1. Adverse Events  
 Adverse events will be summarized separately for those occurring in the study eye, in the fellow 
eye, and non- ocular events. For overall AE incidence summary, one table for ocular AEs (study 
eye and fellow eye combined) will be reported. In this table, eac h subject will be counted only 
once in each summary category, to avoid correlated data. However, the results should be 
interpreted with caution because fellow eyes are selective samples by [CONTACT_91939]. Regardless of 
whether the fellow eye is treated or no t, all AEs reported for the fellow eye will be included for 
the safety analysis. AEs marked as ‘Both Eyes (OU)’ from the AE CRF page will be summarized both for study eye and fellow eye.  
 All AE verbatim terms will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA ) version 23.0 Update. Terms will be coded to the full MedDRA hierarchy, but the 
system organ class ( SOC ) and preferred term (PT ) will be of primary interest for the analysis.  
 Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that first occurred or worsened 
on or after the date of first administration of study drug. If missing dates or time prevent a clear determination as to whether the AE is treatment emergent, the AE will be regarded as a TEAE.  
 While all AEs will be summarized, the main AE summaries will be restricted to TEAEs only. 
Treatment emergent adverse events will be summarized descriptively. For the summary of TEAEs, 
if a subject experienced the same AE multiple times, this will only be c ounted once for the purpose 
of counting the number of patients experiencing that AE. Summary tables will include the number 
of subjects (%) experiencing an AE and the number of AEs.  
 The TEAE summaries will include:  
• Overall Summary of Subjects with at Least One Adverse Event  
• Summary of TEAEs by [CONTACT_3592]  
• Summary of TEAEs with an Incidence >=5% by [CONTACT_3592]  
• Summary of Serious TEAEs by [CONTACT_3592]

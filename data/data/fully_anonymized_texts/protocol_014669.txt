For a full list of eligi bility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1.[ADDRESS_587759] Dosage and Administration:  Subjects will be randomized to 
receive denosumab or placebo every 6  months in a 2:[ADDRESS_587760] through month 18.  
Denosumab will be administered at a dose of 1  mg/kg BW (up to a maximum of 60  mg).   
Denosumab and placebo will be manufactured and packaged by [CONTACT_21931].  Denosumab will be 
presented as a 70  mg/mL solution containing 1.[ADDRESS_587761] every 6  months for 24  months (last injection to be 
administered at month 18).  All SC injections must be administered by [CONTACT_1747].  
The injection should not be administered in the same arm from which blood is drawn.  
Investigational product should be administered only after all other study visit procedures have 
been completed.  If a subject misses a scheduled dose of denosumab during a study visit, then 
he/she sh ould return to the clinic to receive the missed dose within the visit window allowed for 
that particular visit.  The clinical monitor should be contact[CONTACT_460259] a subject 
cannot receive his/her dose within the allowed visit window.  
Procedures:   Key procedures for this study involve various imaging techniques.   Bone 
densitometry assessments of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_460223], lateral 
radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], anteroposterior (AP) radiographs of b oth knees (to 
calculate the metaphyseal index Z -score of each knee), and dental radiographs will be used to 
assess GiOP in this pediatric population.  Subjects will also undergo a visual inspection of the 
oral cavity to look for the presence of unerupted m olars.   
Several instruments will be used to assess the subject’s health -related quality of life, physical 
functioning, and pain intensity:  the CHQ -PF-50, CHAQ, and the WBFPRS.

Section  7 and the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2).   
Statistical Considerations:    
Sample Size Considerations : 
The study will enroll 24 subjects.  Assuming that approximately 10  of subjects will not be 
evaluable at month 12 for the primary efficacy endpoint due to dropout, the a nalysis set for the 
primary efficacy endpoint will include approximately 20  subjects.   
Analyses : 
The primary analysis will be conducted at the time of the final analysis.  The final analysis for the 
study, including the analysis of the primary endpoint, w ill be performed when all enrolled subjects 
have had the opportunity to complete the 36 -month follow -up. 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the change from baseline in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_9210] Z -score at 
12 months and will be analyzed based on the primary DXA analysis set using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment (denosumab vs placebo), baseline age (age at 
informed consent), and baseline BMD Z -score.  Missing baseline and postbaseline BMD Z -scores 
will not  be imputed.  The superiority of denosumab compared to placebo for the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be estimated from the [ADDRESS_587763] -squares (LS) mean of the treatment difference 
(denosumab – placebo) and the corresponding 95  confidence interval.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Disease  
Glucocorticoid (GC) -induced osteoporosis (GiOP) is the most common condition of 
medication -induced bone loss in children (Ward et al, 2010).  Glucocorticoid -induced 
osteoporosis is the result of profound effects of GCs on bone cells, which include 
inhibition of osteoblastogenesis and promotion of osteoblast apoptosis, resulting in 
significant reductions in bone formation, as well as increase in osteoclast -mediated bone 
resorption (Leonard, 2007; Ward, 2005; Canalis et al, 2004; Bianchi, 2002; 
Weinstein  et al, 1998).  Decreased BMD has been described in various pediatric 
disorders that require GCs, such as asthma,  juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory 
bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and organ transplantation 
(Burnham  and Leonard, 2004; Daniels et al, 2003; Leonard and Zemel, 2002; 
Boot et al, 1997).  Some of the detrimental bone effects attribute d to GCs may be 
caused by [CONTACT_460260].  Inflammatory 
cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor -, known to be increased in rheumatoid 
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and inflammatory bowel disease, suppress bone 
formation and promote bone resorption (Parfitt et al, 1996).  The GC -induced decrease 
in bone mass is associated with an increase in fracture risk.  A population -based study 
reported increased fracture risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.32; 95  confidence interval:  
1.03, 1.69) in children who required  4 courses of glucocorticoids (van Staa et al, 2003).  
There are currently no widely accepted guidelines for or approaches to the treatment of 
osteoporosis in the pediatric population.  Bisphosphonate s (BP) are not licensed for the 
treatment of osteoporosis in children, but they have been evaluated in exploratory 
clinical studies in the setting of childhood osteoporosis.   Most BP studies in pediatric 
GiOP have shown significant increases in either BMD Z-scores (Inoue et al, 2008; 
Acott  et al, 2005) or lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_9210] (Simm et al, 2011; Bianchi et al, 2000).  

Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  [ADDRESS_587784] therapy for pediatric GiOP (Ward et al, 2 010).   Thus, an unmet need 
remains in children with GiOP.  
2.[ADDRESS_587785] Background  
Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity and 
specificity to and neutralizes the activity of the receptor activator of nuc lear factor 
kappa - B ligand  (RANKL), preventing activation of its receptor, RANK, on the surface of 
osteoclast precursors and osteoclasts.  Denosumab is currently indicated for the 
treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, treatment of men with 
osteoporosis, treatment of bone loss in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for 
prostate cancer, and treatment of bone loss in women receiving aromatase inhibitor 
therapy for breast cancer.  
2.[ADDRESS_587786] a risk profile comparable to that observed in adults.  Additional 
information on specific risk s in this pediatric population is provided in Sections 2.3.1  
through 2.3.6 .  The extensive denosumab clinical development program includes pi[INVESTIGATOR_6921]  3 studies in bone loss settings in adults, ie postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis (Study  20030216) or low bone mass (Study  20040132); bone l oss 
associated with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer (Study  20040138) or 
aromatase inhibitor therapy for breast cancer (Study  20040135); men with osteoporosis 
(Study  20080098), and in adult subjects with GiOP (Study  20101217 [Saag  et al, 2018]).  
There is an ongoing study in pediatric subjects with osteogenesis imperfecta 
(Study  20130173).  In addition, denosumab has been studied in adolescent subjects with 
giant cell tumor of bone at a dose of 120  mg every 4  weeks (Study  20062004).  
In clini cal studies to date, there has been a comparable incidence of adverse events 
overall between the denosumab and placebo or active -comparator treatment groups and 
a low incidence of treatment -related adverse events, serious adverse events, 
withdrawals due to  adverse events, and deaths.  Most adverse events have been mild to 
moderate in severity, transient, and considered unrelated to denosumab.  Adverse 
reactions to denosumab include hypocalcemia; hypersensitivity; skin infections, 
predominantly cellulitis, l eading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; osteonecrosis of the jaw; atypi[INVESTIGATOR_460224]; eczema (including dermatitis, allergic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and 
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  [ADDRESS_587787] dermatitis); cataracts in males with prostate cancer receiving androgen 
deprivation therapy; p ain in the extremities; and musculoskeletal pain.  Multiple vertebral 
fractures and hypercalcemia may occur following discontinuation of denosumab 
treatment.  
In the bone loss setting, denosumab use is contraindicated in pregnancy, in patients with 
hypocal cemia, and in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of 
the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Volumes of blood withdrawn for analysis in association with clinical monitoring will be 
minimized as appropriate for this pediatric population based on body weight (BW) 
(European Union Ethical Considerations, 2008).  
2.3.1  Hypocalcemia  
Skeletal turnover rates vary by [CONTACT_460261].  These higher 
bone turnover rates expected at baseline in children may increase the risk for 
hypocalcemia an d hypophosphatemia resulting from denosumab -mediated reduction of 
bone turnover.  In addition, recent clinical reports of denosumab administration in 
pediatric patients with disorders of high bone turnover (eg, fibrous dysplasia and juvenile 
Paget’s diseas e) have described disturbances in mineral metabolism, including 
hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia (Grasemann et al, 2013; Boyce et al, 2012).  
To minimize such risk, the following strategies will be employed:  
 Calcium and vitamin D supplementation will be g iven to all study subjects  
 Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations will be monitored throughout the 
study on a regular basis  
 Subjects will not be eligible to participate if they have evidence of hypocalcemia; 
diseases that increase the risk of hypocalc emia, including, but not limited to, 
malabsorption and chronic kidney disease (as defined by [CONTACT_460262]  60 mL/min/1.73  m2); or additional risk factors for detrimental effects of 
hypocalcemia, eg, a history of long QT syndrome  
 Occurrence of severe or symptomatic hypocalcemia will prompt discontinuation of 
study medication and institution of appropriate medical treatment  
2.3.[ADDRESS_587788] been observed in patients, including those 
with developi[INVESTIGATOR_460225], at the end of every 3 month s (Q3M ) dosing period or in 
those  who had previ ously received off -label denosumab.  These incidents of 
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  [ADDRESS_587789] occurred in patients who had used denosumab at higher doses and/or 
frequencies than those being used by [CONTACT_460263] .  In pediatric 
patients with osteogenesis imperfecta , severe life -threatening adverse events of 
hypercalcemia have been reported at or near the end of the denosumab 1 mg/kg 
Q3M dosing period (>  60 days from the previous  dose)  in Study 20130173.  In 
ongoing XGEVA Study  20062004  (in subjects with giant cell tumor of bone), a [ADDRESS_587790] developed clinically significant hypercalcemia approximately 8  months after 
the discontinuation of XGEVA dosing (denosumab 120  mg every 4  weeks).  Therefore, 
hypercalcemia , including  off-treatment hypercalcemia, is a potential risk in this 
pediatric population receiving Prolia. 
2.3.[ADDRESS_587791] activity is necessary to remove the cartilaginous anlagen of bone.  
Genetic deficiency in RANKL leads to osteopetrosis, a disorder of poor bone quality, 
retained cartilage, frequent fractures, and a high bone mass typi[INVESTIGATOR_460226], club -shaped metaphyses.  Significant reduction of this 
resorpt ion-based modeling can lead to osteopetrosis -like changes with a similar 
abnormal geometry (Whyte et al, 2003).  In nonclinical studies of denosumab, the 
severity of phenotypic changes observed in the growth plate and bone was consistent 
with the rate of l ongitudinal growth in the bone, with limited and reversible effects in the 
adolescent monkey.  The most rapid increase in stature in humans occurs during the 
first [ADDRESS_587792] 2 years of life (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011).  Based on 
these data, the potential for significant alterations of skeletal growth and morphology is 
lower in children  5 years of age, who will be enrolled in this study.  The limited an d 
reversible bone effects of denosumab in the adolescent monkey (the second most rapid 
growth phase), lack of negative biomechanical consequences seen in the infant mice, 
and the radiographic monitorability minimize the risk of denosumab administration in 
pediatric patients whose growth rates approximate that of adolescent monkeys.  
Strategies to assess changes to the skeleton include the following:  
 Physical examination and radiographic assessments will be performed on a regular 
basis throughout the study to  monitor for possible detrimental skeletal changes; such 
assessment will also include evaluation of metaphyseal index via knee X -ray to be 
performed every [ADDRESS_587793]:  Denosumab

CONFIDENTIAL    
 Changes in growth plate morphology as observed in the [ADDRESS_587794] that the use of 
denosumab in the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_460227].  
To minimize this risk, molar eruption and mandibular shapi[INVESTIGATOR_460228] X -ray a ssessments.  
2.3.5  Serious Infections  
RANKL is expressed on activated T and B lymphocytes and in lymph nodes.  Therefore, 
RANKL inhibition may theoretically increase the risk of infection.  In a clinical trial of over 
7800  women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, the overall incidence of infections, 
including opportunistic infections, was similar between the denosumab and placebo 
groups.  However, serious skin infections leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_460229].  Subjects on concomitant 
immunosuppressant agents, such as GCs, may be at increased risk of serious 
infections.  
While the completed clinical study of denosumab in adult GiOP 
(Study  20101217  [Saag  et al,  2018]) has not shown an excess risk for s erious infection 
associated with denosumab use, strategies have been implemented in this pediatric 
study to minimize the risk for serious infections and include the following:  
 Subjects who have initiated a biologic agent for the treatment of underlying 
inflammatory disease 4 weeks prior to screening or are on  1 biologic agent for 
the treatment of underlying inflammatory disease will not be eligible for study 
participation  
 Any subject who develops a serious opportunistic infection will permanently 
discon tinue study medication

CONFIDENTIAL    
 Any subject who develops a serious infection during the study and is receiving a 
biologic agent for the treatment of underlying inflammatory disease will permanently 
discontinue study medication  
2.3.[ADDRESS_587795] discontinuation.  Discontinuation of 
osteoporosis treatment for subjects who continue to administer systemic GCs for the 
underlying non -malignant condition(s) at the end of the treatm ent period may be 
inconsistent with standard of care, particularly as subjects were required to have a 
clinically significant fracture history to participate.   
With the identified risk for multiple vertebral fractures after denosumab cessation in a 
settin g where study subjects are at high risk for fracture, the mandated observation 
period will be managed as follows:  to minimize the risk of  multiple vertebral fractures 
following treatment discontinuation, subjects who currently are administering systemic 
GC therapy for the underlying non -malignant condition(s) upon completing the [ADDRESS_587796] of care for pediatric subjects with GiOP may include BP use.  It is recognized 
that BPs are not approved for the treatment of pediatric GiOP, and BP use is considered 
off-label in this setting.  However, BP therapy is often recommended in children  with 
clinically significant fracture history and ongoing risk factors, eg, systemic GC therapy 
(Ward et al, 2016).  Therefore, the decision to use BP in these subjects will be left to the 
medical judgment of the investigator, and BP use would not be prosc ribed by [CONTACT_460264].

2.4 Rationale  
A non -clinical study in skeletally mature (8 -month -old) human RANKL knock -in mice  
challenged with subcutaneous (SC) slow -release prednisolone pellets showed that 
denosumab treatment fully prevented the red uctions in BMD and strength of lumbar 
vertebrae observed in vehicle -treated mice and was associated with significant 
reductions in bone resorption parameters.   These findings indicate that denosumab can 
prevent loss of bone mass and strength secondary to G C therapy.  
Clinical data currently available with denosumab that are relevant to GiOP include a 
subset of adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving GCs in the 
denosumab phase  2 Study  20040144, in which administration of denosumab 60  mg or  
180 mg every 6  months (Q6M) led to increased BMD at lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_390066] 
(Dore  et al, 2010).  In addition, denosumab has been investigated in a clinical trial of 
adults with GiOP (Study  20101217  [Saag et al, 2018]).  
This study is part of a Pediatric  Investigation Plan for denosumab (Prolia) that was 
agreed upon with the European Medicines Agency.  The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK of denosumab (1  mg/kg BW, up to a maximum of 
60 mg, administered SC Q6M) in pediatric  subjects with GiOP.   The selection of the 
1 mg/kg BW Q6M dose is based on the following considerations:  
 The pharmacodynamic effects of denosumab were similar in neonatal and 
adolescent animal models  
 The pharmacodynamic effect of denosumab on inhibition of  bone resorption in 
clinical studies in adult subjects is maintained over the 6 -month dosing interval  
 The PK profile of monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab 
(Erbitux  prescribing  information, 2012), bevacizumab (Glade Bender et al, 2008; 
Gordon et al, 2 001), and infliximab (Fasanmade et al, 2011), is similar in pediatric 
and adult populations  
 The PK of denosumab is not affected by [CONTACT_460265], with an 
age range of 28  to 87  years (Sutjandra et al, 2011)  
Based on these data, the PK a nd pharmacodynamics of denosumab are expected to be 
similar between the adult and pediatric populations, thus supporting selection of the 
1 mg/kg BW Q6M dose.  This dose is equivalent to the approved 60  mg adult dose for 
denosumab (assuming a [ADDRESS_587797] ), which was also the dose investigated in the 
adult GiOP trial (Study  20101217  [Saag et al, 2018]).  In addition, denosumab PK will be 
assessed throughout the study to further characterize exposure/response relationship in 
the pediatric GiOP population.

A feasibility analysis of the study sites has shown difficulties in identifying appropriate

for evidence of at least 1 vertebral compression fracture of Genant grade  1 or higher,

3.5.2  End of Study  
Primary Completion :  The primary completion date is defined as the date when the last 
subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data for the 
primary endpoint(s), whether the study concluded as planned in the protocol or was 
terminated early.  
The primary completion date is the date when the last subject has completed the 
assessments for month 12.    
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion date originally planned in the 
protocol (ie, early termination of the study), then the prima ry completion will be the date 
when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study 
(ie, last subject last visit).

4. SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY  
Investigators will be expected to maintain a screening log of all potential study 
candidates that includes limited information about the potential candidate (eg, date of 
screening).  This log may be completed and updated via an Interactive Voice Response 
(IVR)/Interactive Web Response (IWR) system.  
Before any study -speci fic activities/procedure, the appropriate written informed consent 
must be obtained (see Section 11.1).  In addition to written informed consent fr om a 
legally acceptable representative, the assent of the child also must be obtained, as 
appropriate if requested by [CONTACT_21980]/independent ethics committee 
(IRB/IEC).  
If the subject reaches the age of consent during the duration of th e study, once the 
subject reaches the age of maturation (usually 18 years), the previously acquired 
parental consent is no longer applicable and the participant’s consent must be obtained.  
Per International Conference for Harmonisation (ICH) E11 (R1), dur ing clinical studies 
there is a requirement for obtaining adequate informed consent for continued 
participation from pediatric participants once a child reaches the age of legal consent.  
Local regulations related to confidentiality and privacy of pediatri c participants must be 
followed.

5. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
Before subjects begin participation in any study -specific activities/procedures, [COMPANY_010] 
requires a copy of the  site’s written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol, ICF, and all other 
subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable  (see Section  11.2).  All 
legally acceptable representatives must personally sign and date the ICF, and subjects 
should sign the subject assent form as applicable by [CONTACT_460269]/procedures.  
A subject is considered enrolled wh en the investigator confirms that the subject has met 
all eligibility criteria.  The investigator is to document this decision and date in the 
subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form (CRF).  
Each subject who enters into the screen ing period for the study (defined as when the 
informed consent and subject assent forms are duly signed) receives a unique subject 
identification number before any study -related activities/procedures are performed.  The 
subject identification number will b e assigned by [CONTACT_25003]/IWRS.  This number will be 
used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study 
documentation related to that subject.   
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical 
study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is 
rescreened.  This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number 
assigned for the study.

5.2 Randomization  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1  allocation ratio to receive either denosumab or 
placebo  respectively, in a double -blind manner.  The randomization will be performed by 
[CONTACT_75595]/IWR system .  The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical 
record and on the enrollment CRF.  
5.[ADDRESS_587828]’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the 
treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study.  
Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation.  
The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact [CONTACT_460270]’s treatment assignment, but must do so within 1  working day after 
the event.  
6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES  
Subjects will be randomized to receive denosumab or  placebo every 6  months in a 
2:[ADDRESS_587829] 12  months.  At the end of the initial 12 -month period, all 
subjects will receive open -label denosumab Q6M for 12  months .  Denosumab 
administered at a dose of 1  mg/kg BW (up to a maximum of 60  mg) and matching 
placebo are considered to be IPs in this study.  A manual containing detailed information 
regarding the storage, preparation, and administration of investigational product are 
provided separately in the Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM).  
All subjects will receive a SC injection of investigational product Q6M for the first 
12 months.  At the end of the initial 12 -month placebo -controlled period, all subjects will 
receive open -label denosumab Q6M for 12  months  (last injection to be administered at 
month 18).  All SC injections must be administered by [CONTACT_1747].  The 
injection should not be administered in the same arm from which blood is drawn.  
Investigational product should be administered only after all other  study visit procedures 
have been completed.  If a subject misses a scheduled dose of investigational product 
during a study visit, then he/she should return to the clinic to receive the missed dose

7.2 General Study Procedures  
All on -study visits and dosing should be scheduled from day  1.  It is important to perform 
study assessments and obtain samples at the time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). 
When it is not possible to perform the study visit at the specified time point, the visit may 
be performed within the visit window noted in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2).  If 
a study visit is missed, subsequent visits should resume on the original visit schedule.  
Missed assessments at prior visits should not be duplicated at subs equent visits.  
With the exception of screening or rescreening visits, all study procedures for a visit 
must be completed on the same day.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all procedures are performed 
according to the protocol.  
Details regarding each type of procedure are provided in Section 7.3. 
7.2.1  Screening  
Screening and day  1 visit cannot occur on the same day.  The day  1 visit needs to occur 
within 35  days of the screening date (unless the subject is rescreened).   
The following procedures are to be completed during the screening period at time points 
designated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2): 
 Confirmation that the ICF and Assent form (if applicable) have been signed  
 Demographic data including sex, date of birth, age, race, and ethnicity will be 
collected in order  to study their possible association with subject safety and 
treatment effectiveness.  Additionally demographic data will be used to study the 
impact biomarker variability and PK of the protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 Registration in IVR/IWR system

7.3.17  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Samples  
All subjects receiving denosumab will have PK samples assessed.  Blood sample(s) for 
PK testing are to be collected for the measurement of pharmacokinetic concentrations.   
7.4 Antibody Testing Procedures  
Blood sample(s) for antibody testing are to be collected for the measurement of 
antidenosumab binding antibodies.  Samples testing positive for binding antibodies will 
also be tested for neutralizing antibodies and may be further charact erized for 
quantity/titer, isotype, affinity, and presence of immune complexes.  Additional blood 
samples may be obtained to rule out antidenosumab antibodies during the study.   
Sites will be notified of any positive neutralizing antibody results to denos umab or 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  If results are not provided, no neutralizing antibodies to 
denosumab or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460245].  
Subjects who test positive for neutralizing antibodies to denosumab (eg, [COMPANY_010] or 
non-[COMPANY_010] IPs) o r protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460246] -up testing.  This testing is to occur approximately 
every 3  months starting from when the site has been notified of the positive result, until:  
(1) neutralizing antibodies are no longer detectable or (2) the subject has been followed 
for a period of at least 1  year ( 4 weeks) postadministration of denosumab (eg, [COMPANY_010] 
or non -[COMPANY_010] IPs) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  All follow -up results, both positive 
and negative will be communicated to the sites.  More frequent testing (eg, every month) 
or testing for a longer period of time may be requested in the event of safety -related 
concerns.  Follow -up testing is not required where it is established th at the subject did 
not receive denosumab or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Subjects who test positive for binding, non -neutralizing antibodies and have clinical 
sequelae that are considered potentially related to an anti -denosumab (eg, [COMPANY_010] or

7.7 Sample Storage and Destruction  
Any blood PK sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2) can 
be analyzed for any of th e tests out lined in the protocol and for any tests necessary to 
minimize risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure  analytical methods 
produce  reliable and valid data  throughout the course of the study .  This can also  
include, but is not limited to, investigation of unexpected results, incurred sample 
reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer and comparability.  
All samples and associated results will be coded prior to being shipped from the site for 
analysis or storage.  Samples will be tracked using a unique identifier that is assigned to 
the samples for the study.  Results are stored in a secure database to ensure  
confidentiality.    
If permitted by [CONTACT_460281]’s legally 
acceptable representative(s),  [COMPANY_010] can do additional testing on remaining samples 
(ie, residual and back -up) to investigate and better understand GiOP , the dose response 
and/or prediction of response to denosumab, and characterize aspects of the molecule 
(eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites).  Results from this analysis are to be 
documented and maintained, but are not necessarily reported as part  of this study.  
Samples can be retained for up to [ADDRESS_587891]’s

8. WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY  
8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw  
Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason 
without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018].  
Subject s (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving 
investigational product and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44810].  If this occurs, the 
investiga tor is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation  
from investigational product, device or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460248]  
(Table  2) including different options of follow -up (eg, in person, by [CONTACT_648]/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other treating physicians, from the

survei llance and/or collection of outcome data.  The investigator must document the 
level of follow -up that is agreed to by [CONTACT_423].   
Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive 
further protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_460249], and the subject does not wish to or is 
unable to continue further study participation.  Subject data up to withdrawal of consent 
will be included in the analysis of the study, and where permitted, publically available 
data can be included after w ithdrawal of consent.  The investigator is to discuss with the 
subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  
8.2 Investigator or Sponsor Decision to Withdraw or Terminate 
Subjects’ Participation Prior to Study Completion

The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying d isease 
(eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or 
duration more than would be expected, and/or has an association with a significantly 
worse outcome than expected.  A pre -existing condition that has not worsened m ore 
than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves 
an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, 
is not considered an adverse event.   
If the severity of an adverse even t worsens from onset to resolution, a single event for 
each increased level of severity should be recorded on the Events eCRF .  
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be 
removed from treatment due to an adverse event.  In the event a subject, or subject’s 
legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21884], refer to Section  8.[ADDRESS_587899] 1  of the 
following serious criteria:  
 Fatal  
 Life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapa city 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Other medically important serious event  
Product:  Denosumab

CONFIDENTIAL    
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],” if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).   
If an investigato r considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event.”  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix  A for 
drug-induced liver injury reporting criteria), or events that neces sitate an emergency 
room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.  
9.2 Safety Event Reporting Procedures  
9.2.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious 
Criteria  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all ad verse events observed by [CONTACT_460282] s CRF.  
The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
 Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms) ; 
 Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved) ; 
 Did the event start prior to first dose of investigational product, other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  
 Assessment of seriousness;  
 Severity (or toxicity defined below);  
 Assessment of relatedness to investigational product or other protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ;  
 Action taken; and  
 Outcome of event  
The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events.  The grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix  A.  If the 
severity of an adverse event worsens from onset to resolution, record a single event for 
each increased level of severity.  
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the  
investigational product(s) and/ or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  This relationship is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility 
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  [ADDRESS_587900](s) and/or other 
protocol -required thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_014]?   
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol -required 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and/or procedure (including any screening procedures).  This rela tionship is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, administration of 
investigational product, protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and/or procedure)”?  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be 
recorded as adverse events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment 
or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applica ble, 
clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse 
event.  
The investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or 
reversibility.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events  
The inves tigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by 
[CONTACT_304400] [ADDRESS_587901]’s medical record and are 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] .  All serious adverse events must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] within 
24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Events CRF.    
If the electroni c data capture (EDC) system is unavailable for more than 24 hours to the 
site staff to report the serious adverse event, the information is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] 
via a paper -based Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form (also referred to as 
the ele ctronic Serious Adverse Event [eSAE] Contingency Report Form) within 24  hours 
of the investigator’s awareness of the event.  See Appendix  B for a sampl e of the 
electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form.  For EDC studies where 
the first notification of a serious adverse event is reported to [COMPANY_010] via the eSerious 
Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  [ADDRESS_587902] and/or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   This relationship is 
indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_460283]/or other 
protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ?  Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to 
support a relationship between investigational product and the event.  
The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization 
or reversibility.  
New information relating to a previously reported seriou s adverse event must be 
submitted to [COMPANY_010] .  All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_587903] be submitted to [COMPANY_010].  
Serious adverse event(s) should be reported to [COMPANY_010] (regardless of causality) if the 
investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event.   
To co mply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment 
assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events 
may be unblinded by [CONTACT_21960].  
[COMPANY_010] will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs 
in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good 
clinical pra ctice (GCP) .  
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB/IEC of serious adverse events occurring 
at the site and other adverse event reports received from [COMPANY_010], in accordance with 
local regulatory requirements and procedures.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Method of Detecting Ad verse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events and/or serious 
adverse events.  Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the 
preferred method to inquire about adverse eve nt occurrence.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial adverse event/serious adverse event report, the investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and 
serio us adverse events will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to 
[COMPANY_010] within [ADDRESS_587904] be consistent with that 
recorded on the Events CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required 
Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following 
the protocol -required reporting period (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) or after end of 
study.  However, these serious adverse events should be reported to [COMPANY_010] (regardless 
of causality) if the investigator becomes aware of them.  In some countries (eg, 
European Union member states), investigators are required to rep ort serious adverse 
events that they become aware of after end of study.  If serious adverse events are 
reported, the investigator is to report them to [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event.  The investigator should use the paper -based 
Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form to report the event.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period will be 
captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of exp edited 
reporting.

10.2 Samp le Size Considerations  
The study will enroll 24  subjects.  Assuming that approximately 10 of subjects will not 
be evaluable at month  [ADDRESS_587913] access to unblinded information until the study is 
formally unblinded at the final analysis.  Unblinding and potentially unblinding information 
should not be distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study 
being formally unblinded at the final analysis, except as specified (eg, Section  5.3 and 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  

Product:  Denosumab  
Protocol Number:  20140444  
Date:  [ADDRESS_587914] treatment assignments will be maintained by [CONTACT_21926]/IW RS.  Any 
unplanned unblinding occurring during the study period will be documented and reported 
in the final clinical study report.  The Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
members and the Independent Biostatistical Group will have access to the tr eatment 
assignments and subject level data from the clinical trial database.  [COMPANY_010] staff 
members who are involved in randomization, biological sample management, performing 
PK and anti -denosumab antibody assay analysis will have treatment assignment 
information but will not have access to the subject level data from the clinical database.  
10.4 Planned Analyses  
10.4.1  Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis is planned for the study.  
10.4.2  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)  
An external, independent DMC will be used to oversee progress of the study and make 
recommendations relating to early closure/extension or alteration of the study based on 
ongoing monitoring of the study data.  The DMC will be comprised of members external  
to [COMPANY_010].  The DMC members will have access to treatment assignments in order to 
monitor safety and efficacy results to protect subjects.  To minimize the potential 
introduction of bias, the DMC members will not have any direct contact [CONTACT_460285] , site personnel, or subjects.  An independent statistical service provider will 
generate unblinded reports for review by [CONTACT_1363].  If at any time there are safety 
concerns, the DMC will communicate the concerns to a representative from [COMPANY_010] 
senior manage ment.  A charter specifying the DMC functions will be written with the 
agreement of the DMC members.  Last DMC was in March [ADDRESS_587915]:  Denosumab

Date:  [ADDRESS_587916] deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be 
summarized using counts and percentages.  
10.5.2  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The change from baseline in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_9210] Z -score at 12  months will be analyzed 
based on the primary DXA analysis set using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model including treatment (denosumab vs placebo), baseline age (age at informed 
consent), and baseline BMD Z -score.  Missing baseline and postbaseline BMD Z -scores 
will not be imputed.  The superiority of denosumab compared to placebo for the primary 
efficacy endpoint will be estimated from the [ADDRESS_587917] -squares (LS) mean of the 
treatment difference (denosumab – placebo) and the corresponding 95  confidence 
interval.   
A sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpo int will be conducted in the 
DXA analysis set, in subjects with baseline and ≥ 1 postbaseline valid DXA 
assessments, using a repeated measures analysis.   Treatment (denosumab vs 
placebo), study visit (6, and 12 months), baseline age, baseline BMD Z -score, will 
be included as fixed effects, and treatment -by-visit included as an interaction.   
Study visit will be treated as a categorical variable.   The 12 -month LS mean of the 
treatment difference (denosumab – placebo) and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval and associated p -value will be estimated.   Unstructured 
variance –covariance structure will be used for estimation in the repeated 
measures analysis.   Other variance -covariance structure may be substituted if 
convergence problem arises.   
10.5.3  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will be assessed without multiplicity adjustment.

readily available.  
 Updates to CRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit 
trail.”  
 To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data 
management review is performed on subject dat a received at [COMPANY_010].  During this 
review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent 
discrepancies.  In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and 
GCP.  To resolve any questions arising from the clinical da ta management review 
process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution 
and subsequently closed by [CONTACT_53435].  
 The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this EDC study or 
the investigator applies an electronic signature [CONTACT_198068].  This signature [CONTACT_198069], the data queries, and agrees with the 
content.  
[COMPANY_010] (or designee) will perform self -evident corrections to obvious data errors in the 
clinical trial database.  Self -evident corrections will be documented in the CRF Standard 
Instructions and the CRF Specific Instructions, both of these will be availab le through the 
EDC system.  Examples of obvious data errors that may be corrected by [CONTACT_11337] 
(or designee) include deletion of obvious duplicate data (ie, the same results sent twice 
with the same date with different visit, [eg, week 4 and early termination] ) and updating a 
specific response if the confirming datum is provided in the “other, specify” field (eg, for 
race, reason for ending study).  
12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection  
The investigator is responsible for complying with the requirem ents for all assessments 
and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) as 
stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.  For subjects who withdraw prior 
to completion of all protocol -required visits and are unable or unwilling to continue the 
Schedule of Assessments  (Table  2), the investigator can search publically available 
records [where permitted]) to ascertain survival status.   This ensures that the data set(s)

The committee is expected to solicit input and assistance  from other investigators and to 
collaborate with authors and [COMPANY_010] staff as appropriate  as defined in the Publication 
Charter .  Membership on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff) does 
not guarantee authorship.  The criteria described bel ow are to  be met for every 
publication.  
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis 
of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) Recommendations for the 
Conduct of Reporting, Editing, and Publicati ons of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, 
which states:  
 Authorship credit should  be based on (1) substantial contributions to conception and 
design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the 
article or revising it criti cally for important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the 
version to be published; and (4) agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the 
work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the 
work are appropr iately investigated and resolved.  Authors should meet conditions 1, 
2, 3 and 4.  
 When a large, multicenter group has conducted the work, the group should  identify 
the individuals who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript.  These individuals 
shoul d fully meet the criteria for authorship defined above.  
 Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general supervision of the research 
group, alone, does not justify authorship.  
 All persons designated as authors should  qualify for authorship, and all those who 
qualify should  be listed.  
 Each author should  have participated sufficiently in the work to take public 
responsibility for appropriate portions of the content.

Drug -induced Liver Injury Reporting and Additional Assessments  
Reporting  
To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT 
and TBL and/or INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.4 require 
the following:  
 The event is to be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a serious adverse event within 24  hours of 
discovery or notification of the even t (ie, before additional etiologic investigations 
have been concluded)  
 The appropriate CRF (eg, Events eCRF) that captures information necessary to 
facilitate the evaluation of treatment -emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed 
and sent to the [COMPANY_010] . 
Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse 
events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are 
withheld (either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI (Section 6.4.1 ) or who 
experience AST or ALT elevations  [ADDRESS_587937] (except for subjects with 
dystrophinopathies) are to undergo a period of “close observatio n” until abnormalities 
return to normal or to the subject’s baseline levels Assessments that are to be 
performed during this period include:  
 Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), and INR as clinically necessary 
until laboratory abnormalitie s improve.  
 Obtain pediatric gastroenterologist or pediatric hepatologist consult  
 The diagnostic approach (including blood tests) to investigate alternative causes 
for abnormal liver tests is to be determined in consultation with a pediatric 
gastroenterolog ist or hepatologist.  
 The “close observation” is to continue until all laboratory abnormalities return to 
baseline or normalize and subject’s clinical condition improves.

Study ID: [REMOVED]  
 
Amendment Date:  10 July 2023  
 
Rationale:  
The protocol has been amended to remove specific endpoints that will not be met for 
end of study  and to align with European Medicines Agency/ Paediatric Committee 
(EMA/PDCO ) Modification Summary Report provided by [CONTACT_23357].   Changes including, 
but not limited to, the following are being incorporated into the protocol:  
 Updated secondary objectives and endpoints:  
o Replaced “from pre -treatment to post -treatment” with “compared to 
baseline” to clarify that the determination of improving vertebral fracture is 
to compare with baseline spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] X -ray. 
o Removed language ‘overall among subjects with clinical fracture 
reduction, and amo ng subjects with clinical fracture increase’ as it is not 
statistically meaningful to perform a subgroup analysis in a study that has 
only enrolled globally [ADDRESS_587944] of denosumab in 
children with Glucocorticoid (GC) -induced osteoporosis (GiOP).  
 Updated Section 1.3:  Safety to delete the evaluation of metaphysical index and 
Molar eruption and mandibular shapi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 Added footnote q stating that after the protocol required reporting period or after 
end of study, serious adverse events will be reported to [COMPANY_010].  
 Added language to Section  2.3.[ADDRESS_587945]:  Denosumab

Amendment Date:  20 April 2021  
 
Rationale:  
The following changes were made to the protocol dated 20 April 2021 . 
 Updated the nu mber of subjects enrolled in the study . 
 The study was initially designed to enroll [ADDRESS_587949] 
100 evaluable patients for the primary analysis and has been running since 
June  2017; however , as of December 2020, only [ADDRESS_587950]  been enrolled 
at 36 cli nical sites activated globally.  
 Following agreement from the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and the 
European Medicines Agency ( EMA ), [COMPANY_010] made a decision to end enrollment 
into this study.  The primary reason to re quest FDA and EMA agreement for early 
discontinuation is that there are too few children with the disease or condition to 
study, and this is not due to safety or efficacy concerns.  In order to maximize the 
value of the data from this study in this rare pe diatric population, subjects who 
have been enrolled in the study will be allowed to complete the study , as defined 
in the protocol (ie,  to last visit at 36 months).  As of January 2021, enrolment of 
subjects i nto this study has been closed.  The study is a nticipated to end when 
the remaining su bjects will have reached the 36  months visit.  
 Aligned the protocol with current [COMPANY_010] protocol template and safety reporting 
language.  
 Administrative and editorial changes were completed as part of this amendment.

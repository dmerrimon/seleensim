STUDY OBJECTIVE(S)  Primary objective:  
To collect b lood samples, in a new cohort of RMS patients   who have 
developed Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) after LEMTRADA  
treatment, for future DNA analysis as part of a global biomarker project

4.1 INTRODUCTION  
Multiple sclerosis (MS ) is a demyelinating disease of the centr al nervous system (CNS ) that  
affects more than  2.3 million people worldwide (1). Its clinical course is typi[INVESTIGATOR_458155],  followed by a phase 
of cumulative deficits that may increase with each new epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Most  relapsing patients 
eventually develop secondary progression leading to a constellation of chronic  sequelae includ ing 
profound muscle weakness, impaired gait and mobility, bladder and bowel  dysfunction, and 
cognitive and visual impairments.  MS is believed to arise from the interplay of polygenic 
inherited susceptibility and as yet  unidentified environmental agents. Ag e of onset typi[INVESTIGATOR_458156] [ADDRESS_585176] due to the complex interplay of inflammation,  demyelination, axonal injury, astrocytosis, and 
tissue atrophy. Lymphocytes are believed to play a  central role in MS pathogenesis.  
Alemtuzumab ( LEMTRADA®) is a humanized m onoclonal antibody that binds to CD52, a cell  
surface antigen present at high levels on T and B lymphocytes, and at lower levels on natural  
killer cells, monocytes, and macrophages (2). Alemtuzumab acts throug h antibody -dependent 
cellular cytolysis and complement -dependent cytotoxicity following cell surface binding to T and 
B lymphocytes.  The mechanism by [CONTACT_458166], but may  involve immunomodulation throug h the depletion and repopulation of 
lymphocytes  subsets.  It effects rapid and sustained lymphocyte depletion and has shown potent 
efficacy in treatment -naïve as well as treatment -refractory patients with relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Treat ment with alemtuzumab 12 mg/day is efficacious in patients 
with RRMS and is associated with clinically meaningful and statistically significant 
improvements in clinical endpoints, imaging endpoints and composite disease measures, 
compared with subcutaneous  (SC), high -dose, high -frequency interferon -beta-1a (IFNB -1a). 
The most important adverse r eactions are autoimmunity (eg, i mmune thrombocytopenic purpura 
(ITP), thyroid disorders,  nephropathi es, cytopenias), infusion -associated reactions, and serious 
infections. Serious events of ITP have been observed in approximately 2% of patients with 
relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS ) treated  with alemtuzumab in clinical trials. The onset of ITP 
generally occurred between [ADDRESS_585177] alemtuzumab exposure but might also 
occur later.  Fatality in the index case of ITP, which was reported in the Phase 2 study, highlights 
the seriousness of the risks associated with the disorder.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 14 4.2 STUDY RATIONALE  
In a previous analysis on  a small number of  patients  from the Ph3 clinical trial population , a 
specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP ) genetic set  was identified show ing a strong 
correlation with development of ITP after treatment by [CONTACT_43585]  (unpublished internal data) . 
However samples from an independent cohort of post -marketing RMS patients who have 
developed I TP would be needed to confirm these data.  
The current study  will focus on the collection of blood samples to extract  DNA from patient s who 
developed ITP consequently to Lemtrada treatment. The DNA will be subjected to  further 
sequencing  pre-identified sp ecific candidate genes of interest to evaluate their polymorphism 
status and correlate these assessments with demographic and clinical data from the patients as 
well as the occurrence of LEMTRADA -induced ITP.  DNA sequencing and corresponding 
analysis are n ot part of this study . 
Complementary to these objectives  serum, plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC s), 
and RNA samples will be collected and stored to be further explored in t his patient population to 
potentially identify new safety and LEMTRADA  treatment response markers . 
This study is part of a global biomarker project that aims to collect samples from different studies 
to potentially confirm correlations between ITP and othe r autoimmune conditions and specific 
SNP genetic set. Genomic data collected in other studies from MS patients who are treated with 
LEMTRADA  but did not develop any autoimmune condition will be used as controls to validate 
the preliminary findings.  The ultimate goal of this global biomarker project is to enhance the 
benefit/ risk ratio of LEMTRADA  with the objective of discovering a panel of biomar kers to 
predict which patients are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_458157] -immunity events .

All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, an d

10.2 DEFINITIONS OF ADVER SE EVENTS  
10.2.1  Adverse event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject which does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
Adverse even ts and SAEs  related to study procedures will be recorded spanning from the 
signature [CONTACT_458187]. As there is no investigational product 
administration, assessment of the relationship of AE s or SAEs to procedures (ie, blood sampli ng) 
will be performed by [CONTACT_29548].  
Adverse even ts will be graded according National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE ) v4.03 and classified by [CONTACT_9313] / preferred term 
according the last available version of the MedDRA dictionary. For AEs not included in the NCI 
CTCAE, the Investigat or will be required to assess the intensity of the adverse drug/biologic 
experience using the CTCAE general guideline:  
 Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2:  Moderate; min imal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL ). Instrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_458158], using the telephone, managing money, 
etc. 
 Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL. Self -care ADL refer to bathing, d ressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications and not bedridden.  
 Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5:  Death related to AE.

A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any un toward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death, or  
 Is life -threatening, or  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not ref er to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
 Is a congenital anomaly/bi rth defect, or  
 Is a medically important event:  
- Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_458159].  
Note: Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency roo m or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, alanine 
aminotransferase ( ALT )> 3 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ) + total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_585188]

10.3 OBLIGATION OF THE IN VESTIGATOR REGARDING  SAFETY REPORTING  
10.3.1  General guidelines for reporting adverse events  
All AEs  related to stud y procedure s, regardless of seriousness , spanning from the signature [CONTACT_458188] [CONTACT_760], are to be recorded on the corresponding 
page(s) or screen(s) of the case report form  (CRF ) for included subjects. For screen failed 
subjects, recording in the CRF  is only performed in case of SAE occurring during the screening 
period or in case of AE when some screening procedures expose the subject to safety risks 
(eg, any substance administered as pretreatment or for phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], invasive tests performed or 
chronic treatment interrupted).  
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensit y (see definitions in Section  10.2.1 ), 
correc tive treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed (eg, in the case of 
dermatologic lesions photographs are required), outcome, and Investigator’s /Sponsor’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] .

2.1 Overview of Ovarian  Cancer  
Ovarian cancer (including primary peritoneal and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351]) is the fifth 
leading cause of cancer -related deaths in women in the [LOCATION_002] and the most 
lethal  gynecologic  cancer  [1]. It was estimated  that in 2016,  more  than 22,000 women 
will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer leading to more than 14,000 deaths [2]. The median age of diagnosis of women with ovarian cancer is 63, with increased comorbidities  leading  to treatment -related  toxicities  in older  women  [3]. The inability  to 
receive adjuvant chemotherapy negatively impacts overall survival (OS). Number of cycles  of chemotherapy  also appears  to be important.  For example,  elderly  women  who 
receive  more  than three  chemotherapy  cycles  have been  found  to have improved  OS [3]. 
Further  study  to identify  factors  to improve  treatment  tolerability  and reduce  treatment - 
related morbidity in ovarian cancer patients are  warranted.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_898588]  that it plays  a role in many  diseases such 
as autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer risk and cancer survival.  The correlation  of low serum  25(OH)D  with elevated  risk for malignancy  has 
been best studied in colorectal cancer [4]. Decreased levels of serum 25(OH)D have been correlated with increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. [5]. 
Women receiving chemotherapy and anti -hormonal therapy for breast cancer experience 
treatment -induced  bone  loss due to premature  ovarian  failure  or direct  cytotoxic  effects 
of chemotherapy. This causes  an increase  in the osteoporosis  and skeletal  morbidity 
risk[6].  Similar  effects  can be estimated  in ovarian  cancer  patients  given  that standard 
treatment  requires  surgical  menopause  as well as cytotoxic  therapy  in the majority  of 
patients.   
The majority of studies pertaining to vitamin D and ovarian cancer concern the association  of low serum  25(OH)D  with increased  cancer  risk. Limited  study has been 
performed  investigating the correlation  of serum  vitamin  D and ovarian cancer  prognosis 
or treatment -related morbidity. A study performed in Australia investigated serum 
25(OH)D  levels  at the time of diagnosis  of ovarian  cancer  in 670 women.  They noted  a 
significant  association  between  higher  circulating  25(OH)D  concentrations  and longer 
survival  in women  with ovarian  cancer  when  adjusting  for other  clinical predictors  of  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
7  survival [7]. Similarly, Walentowicz -Sadlecka et al. reported low serum 25(OH)D 
concentrations  in women  with ovarian cancer  undergoing  primary  cytoreductive  surgery 
to be associated  with lower  overall  survival[8].  The impact  of repletion  of vitamin  D in 
ovarian,  primary  peritoneal,  or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_665166].  
 
Findings  from an unpublished  study performed  at the University  of Oklahoma  have 
shown  an inverse  correlation  between  low levels  of serum  vitamin  D and treatment - 
related morbidity in women aged 65 years and older with ovarian cancer. More 
specifically,  when  comparing  median  serum  25(OH)D  levels  between  patients  who 
experienced chemotherapy delay >7days versus those who did not, lower mean 
25(OH)D  levels  were significantly  associated with chemotherapy  delays  (23.6 ng/dL, 
n=28 no delay  versus  14.6 ng/dL, n=30 delay,  p=.0112).  (Figure  1)[9].  
 
Figure 1. Serum 25(OH)D levels by [CONTACT_665177].  
Delay  (>7 days)  n=30,  median  25(OH)D  14.6 ng/dL.  No delay  n=28,  median  25(OH)D  23.6 ng/dL 
(p=0.0112).  
 
 To date, there have been no prospective or randomized controlled trials evaluating 
serum  25(OH)D  and treatment -related  risks in cancer  patients.  No data exists  regarding 
the effect  of repletion  of vitamin  D and prevention  of ovarian  cancer  treatment -related 
morbidity. As previously mentioned, number of cycles of chemotherapy received appears 
to correlate  with improved  OS in women  with ovarian  cancer  [3]. Given  the findings  of 
the above -mentioned study correlating low serum 25(OH)D levels and  chemotherapy   
 
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
8  delay,  vitamin  D represents  a potentially  modifiable  factor  that could  improve  treatment 
tolerance among women with ovarian cancer.  
 
2.3 Leptin and Ovarian  Cancer  
Leptin  is an adipokine  that appears  to stimulate  growth  of cancer  cells while  decreasing 
apoptosis [10]. Serum leptin levels have also been linked to elevated levels of pro - 
inflammatory  cytokines  in malignancy  [11]. Retrospective  analysis  of data from NHANES 
III revealed an inverse relationship between serum leptin levels and cancer death in 
women[12].  In ovarian  cancer, there  is some  data to show  that lower  leptin  levels  may 
be associated  with increased  initial  tumor  burden  and subsequent  increases  in leptin 
may correlate with complete cytoreduction [13]. Further study is needed to better 
understand the role of leptin in ovarian cancer. Vitamin D receptors are involved in production  of adipokines such as leptin;  however,  the response  of serum  leptin  levels  to 
repletion of vitamin D remains unclear [1]. Conflicting data exists between meta - 
analyses investigating changes in leptin following correction of vitamin D levels in humans [1]. This study aims to assess for potential relationships between serum 25(OH)D  levels  and leptin  levels,  including  any changes  that may occur  during  repletion 
of 25(OH)D.   
 
Women  with treatment -related  morbidity  often  experience delays  in treatment,  changes 
in chemotherapeutic regimens and surgical or chemotherapy -related complicatio ns 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Identifying modifiable risk factors among patients with ovarian 
cancer (including fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_665167]) that can prevent 
treatment -related  morbidity  represents  an important  goal in the care of these  women. 
Safety:  
 
Cholecalciferol  is a generally  safe and well-tolerated  medication.  Repletion  of vitamin  D is 
considered standard of care and will be undertaken utilizing current available 
guidelines[14].  
 
 
 
Translational Research Background:  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
9  Vitamin  D receptors  (VDR) are extensively  expressed in epi[INVESTIGATOR_665168].  VDR functions  as a transcriptional  regulatory  factor  involved  in 
decreasing cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis [15]. As such, this may carry 
implications for ovarian cancer tumorigenesis. The VDR rs2228570 ( FokI) single 
nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) represents  the most  common  and best studied  SNP in 
the VDR gene leading to an alteration of VDR protein structure and  decreased 
transcriptional  activity  as compared  to the wild type [15, 16]. Meta-analyses  of several 
small  studies  have associated  FokI SNP with increased  risk of ovarian  cancer, [15, 16]. 
One such study  performed  a meta -analysis  with pooled  odds  ratios  and 95% confidence 
intervals to assess the associations between VDR polymorphisms ( Cdx-2, FokI, BsmI, 
ApaI, and TaqI) and risk for breast  and ovarian  cancer.  Only the FokI SNP was found  to 
be associated  with increased  risk of breast  and ovarian  cancers[17].  Currently,  no data 
exists  to correlate  VDR SNP polymorphisms to circulating  25(OH)D  levels  at the time of 
diagnosis  of ovarian  cancer.  There  is limited  data to suggest  that in both prostate  cancer 
and colorectal  cancer,  the homozygous  VDR FokI SNP (prostate) and homozygous  VDR 
TaqI SNP (colorectal) are associated both with increased risk of the respective 
malignancy  and lower  circulating  25(OH)D  levels  [18, 19]. 
 
 
3.0 Study Design  
 
This study will contain 2 cohorts, those with normal serum 25(OH)D and those with low 
serum 25(OH)D at enrollment. The study will take place in women with ovarian, primary 
peritoneal, and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_76351], subsequently referred to as ovarian cancer in this 
document due to the overlap in disease and treatment. 
Patient s who have given  written  consent  to enroll in the study  will have a serum  25(OH)D 
drawn  in a gold-topped  tube (1 to 5mL volume)  at time of enrollment  and prior to initiation 
of treatment  for their cancer.  Serum  25(OH)D  levels  will be analyzed  per laboratory  protocol 
in our University CLIA certified lab. Blood will also be drawn for analysis of serum leptin 
levels and VDR FokI SNP genotype. A purple -topped tube (7 to 10mL volume) and red- 
topped tube will be collected from prospective patients. The Stephenson Cancer Center 
Biospecimen  Bank will process the red and purple -topped  tube into plasma  and Buffycoats, 
label them  with a de-identified  code and transfer  them  to [CONTACT_665194]’s  lab. The plasma  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  will be used to evaluate  leptin  by [CONTACT_665178]. Retrospective  serum  specimens  will be used to measure  leptin.  
 
Patients  with low serum  vitamin  D levels,  defined  as <20 ng/mL, will be provided  a supply 
of cholecalciferol  (vitamin  D3), 50,000 IU weekly  for 8 weeks  that will be dispensed  in the 
Stephenson  Cancer  Center  outpatient pharmacy  in order  to standardize  therapy.  They will 
then be provided with a prescription for 2,000 IU of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) daily 
following completion  of 8 weeks  of therapy  based on current  Endocrine  Society  guidelines  in 
agreement  with U.S. Preventive  Services  Task Force  recommendations  [14]. Treatment  with 
cholecalciferol  will not impact  initiation  of treatment  for ovarian  cancer. Compliance  with 
cholecalciferol repletion will be assessed with medication reconciliation at every 
gynecologic  oncology  visit.  
Vitamin  D therapy  will be stopped  in any patient  developi[INVESTIGATOR_665169] <30, inability to tolerate oral medications , malabsorption syndrome, or primary 
hyperparathyroidism.  In the unlikely  event  of evidence  of vitamin  D toxicity,  treatment  with 
vitamin D will be stopped. The Stephenson Cancer Center laboratory defines vitamin D toxicity as levels >100 ng/mL. Based on I OM literature, it would highly unlikely for 
individuals  to experience  vitamin  D toxicity  at the prescribed doses.  Symptoms  of vitamin  D 
intoxication  are caused  by [CONTACT_665179],  weight  loss, 
polyuria, arrhythmias, fatigue, and soft tissue calcifications [20]. Patients experiencing these symptoms would receive testing for serum calcium and vitamin D. Vitamin D 
treatment  would  be stopped  for any value  indicative  of toxicity.  
 
Demographic,  clinical,  and disease  characteristics  and outcomes  will be collected  from all 
patients prospectively. The patient’s treatment course information will also be collected prospectively,  but will not be dictated  by [CONTACT_15365].  Serum  25(OH)D  and leptin  levels  will 
be collected  again  at the completion  of primary  therapy,  6 months  after the completion  of 
primary  therapy,  and at the time of disease  recurrence.  If disease  recurrence  occurs  prior to 
6 months after completion of primary therapy, this time point will be omitted. If disease 
recurrence  does not occur  prior to 1 year, serum  25(OH)D  and leptin  levels  will be drawn  at 
the time of the [ADDRESS_898589] or primary care 
physician  for further  work -up and treatment  of their vitamin  D deficiency. Patients  who are 
vitamin  D deficient  at completion  of therapy  but were not previously  on supplement  will be  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  referred  to a primary  care physician  for further  management.  Data collection  will continue 
for 1 year or until the time of disease recurrence. Patient’s will no longer have data 
collected  after obtaining  serum  25(OH)D  and leptin  levels  at the time of recurrence.  
A retrospective  cohort  of women  with low serum  25(OH)D  that did not receive  repletion  of 
vitamin D will be used as a control group for comparison. This control group will be 
identified  from available  tumor  bank serum  samples  including  those  previously  identified  in 
the above -mentioned  unpublished  study  at the University  of Oklahoma.  These  samples  will 
be used to evaluate serum levels of 25(OH)D, leptin, and evaluate Buffycoats VDR SNP 
polymorphism  for FokI.

11.1 Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  11.1.1  Definitions  (per 21 CFR 312.32(a)):  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
 20 
IRB NUMBER: 7488  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 03/25/2019   Adverse  event:  “Any untoward  medical  occurrence  associated  with the 
use of a drug in humans,  whether  or not considered  drug related .” Life- 
threatening  adverse  event  or life-threatening  suspected  adverse  reaction:  “An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “lifethreatening” 
if, in the view of either the investigator  or sponsor,  its occurrence places  the 
patient  or subject  at immediate  risk of death.  It does not include  an adverse 
event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  that, had it occurred  in a more  severe 
form,  might  have caused  death. ” Serious  adverse  event  or serious  suspected 
adverse reaction: “ An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered  “serious”  if, in the view of the investigator,  it results  in any of the 
following  outcomes:  
Death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_665173],  a persistent  or significant  incapacity 
or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  life functions,  or a 
congenital  anomaly/birth  defect.  Important  medical  events  that may not 
result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20967], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes listed  in this definition.  Examples 
of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment  in an emergency  room  or at home,  blood  dyscrasias  or convulsions 
that do not result  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or the development  of drug 
dependency  or drug abuse .” 
Suspected  adverse reaction:  “Suspected  adverse  reaction  means  any adverse 
event  for which  there is a reasonable  possibility  that the drug caused  the 
adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility”  means  there  is evidence  to suggest  a causal relationship between 
the drug and the adverse  event.  Suspected adverse  reaction  implies  a lesser  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  degree  of certainty  about  causality  than adverse  reaction,  which  means  any 
adverse  event  caused  by a drug.” 
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction. “ An 
adverse  event  or suspected  adverse  reaction  is considered  “unexpected”  if it 
is not listed  in the investigator  brochure  or is not listed  at the specificity  or 
severity  that has been observed;  or, if an investigator  brochure  is not required 
or available,  is not consistent  with the risk information  described  in the 
general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as 
amended.  For example,  under  this definition,  hepatic  necrosis  would  be 
unexpected  (by [CONTACT_183432])  if the investigator  brochure  referred 
only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism  and cerebral  vasculitis  would  be unexpected  (by [CONTACT_665182])  if the investigator  brochure  listed  only cerebral  vascular 
accidents.  “Unexpected,”  as used in this definition,  also refers  to adverse 
events  or suspected  adverse  reactions  that are mentioned  in the investigator 
brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties  of the drug,  but are not specifically  mentioned  as 
occurring  with the particular  drug under  investigation .”

Furthermore,  this study  will fall under  the purview  of the Stephenson  Cancer 
Center  Data Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC).  
11.1.2  Reporting Expedited Adverse  Events  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/[ADDRESS_898601]  report  all such 
events promptly to the appropriate IRB/EC per their  requirements.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_898602]  be documented  on the forms  provided and approved 
by [CONTACT_665183]. Additional  follow -up information  (e.g., test results,  autopsy,  and 
discharge  summary)  may be obtained  to supplement  AE reports.  A copy of all 
initial and follow -up reports  will be included  with the patient’s  study  files. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_898603] been  caused  by [CONTACT_24384]. 
This definition  applies  to those  AEs that are considered  definitely,  probably, 
and possibly  related  to the use of the study  drug:  
Definitely Related: An AE that follows a temporal sequence from 
administration  of the study drug;  follows  a known  response  pattern  to 
the study drug; improves after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648] (positive 
dechallenge) and reappears after repeat exposure (positive  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  rechallenge); and cannot be reaso nably explained by [CONTACT_665184]'s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_665174]:  An AE that follows  a reasonable  temporal  sequence 
from administration of the study drug; follows a known response 
pattern  to the study  drug; improves  after dechallenge;  and cannot  be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564]'s clinical  state or by [CONTACT_130583][INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Possibly Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence  from administration  of the study  drug and follows  a known 
response  pattern  to the study  drug but could  have been  produced  by 
[CONTACT_102]'s clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014]. An AE may be considered  not associated  with the use of study  drug if there  is not a 
reasonable  possibility  that the AE may have been  caused  by [CONTACT_50464].  This definition  applies  to those  AEs that are considered  unlikely 
or not related  to the use of the study  drug:  
Unlikely  to be Related:  An AE assessed  as unlikely  to be related  to 
study  drug is defined  as an AE for which  sufficient  information  exists 
to indicate  a high improbability  that the event  is related  to the study 
drug. 
 Not Related:  An AE assessed  as not related  to study  drug is defined 
as an AE for which  sufficient  information  exists  to indicate  that the etiology  is 
unrelated  to the study  drug.  Two or more  of the following  variables  apply:  
- The AE does not follow  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  after 
administration of the study  drug.  
- The AE is readily  explained  by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical  state  or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  - Negative  dechallenge —the AE does not abate  upon  dose reduction 
or cessation of therapy (assuming that it is reasonable to expect 
abatement  of the AE within  the observed  interval).  
 
 
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_898604]  be graded  as follows: 
Mild, Moderate, Severe, Life -threatening, and Fatal according to the following 
definitions:  
 Mild:  The AE is noticeable  to the patient  but does not interfere  with routine 
activity.  
Moderate:  The AE interferes  with routine  activity  but responds  to 
symptomatic therapy or  rest. 
Severe:  The AE significantly  limits  the patient's  ability  to perform routine 
activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795]. 
 
 Life-threatening: The AE places the patient at risk of death at the time of the  
event.  
 
 Fatal: The AE results in the death of the patient.  
 
11.2 Study  Monitoring  
 
Safety oversight will be performed by [CONTACT_176133]’s  (SCC)  internal 
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  (DSMC). The DSMC is composed of 
individuals with the appropriate expertise in adult and pediatric hematology and 
medical oncology, radiation oncology, translational and correlative science , 
pharmacy, nursing and biostatistics. The DSMC operates under the rules of an 
approved data safety monitoring plan  which  complies with the National Cancer 
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  Institute (NCI) guidelines published as Essential Elements of a Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan for Clinical Trials Funded by [CONTACT_665185] 2005 and the 
“NIH Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring ,” NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, 
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/not98 -084.html . 
 
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee is charged with oversight of participant 
safety, study conduct and the validity and integrity of data for clinical trials at SCC. While the focus of the DSMC is to monitor interventional investigator initiated trials (I ITs) that are not subject to external monitoring, it has the 
authority to monitor any SCC protocol when potential concerns are identified. The DSMC also has the authority to suspend or close a study until the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_665175] t may cause harm or increase risks to 
subjects.  The DSMC r eports all findings to the Institutional Review Board (IRB ). 
 Under the direction of the DSMC chair, a full board meeting is convened on a biannual basis to review the accumulated safety data, accr ual information, and 
additional information as stated in the DSMC plan.  
 DSMC Auditing  
In addition to monitoring, the DSMC oversees an internal auditing process to ensure subject safety and data quality. All cancer -related clinical trials active at 
the SCC  are eligible for audit; however, priority is placed on those clinical trials 
that are not monitored or audited by [CONTACT_176135]. If an external entity conducts an audit of a clinical trial at the SCC, then the findings of that audit are reported to th e DSMC, either through the formal audit report provided by [CONTACT_665186], if available, or from the PI, who will report any findings communicated during the audit process.

All reports  and communications  relating  to patients  in this study  will identify each 
patient only by [CONTACT_230332]. Medical information resulting from a patient’s  participation  in this study  may be given  to the patient’s  personal  physician 
or to the appropriate  medical  personnel  responsible  for the patient’s  welfare.  Data 
generated  as a result  of this study are to be available  for inspection  on request  by 
[CONTACT_665187],  the clinical  trial office 
auditors and monitors, the Investigational Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) and the Institutional  Biosafety  Review  Committee  (or equivalent).  De-identified 
data generated by [CONTACT_665188] -
investigator  ([CONTACT_665195]) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for 
the purposes of data analysis and manuscript preparation.  
All laboratory  specimens,  evaluation  forms,  reports,  and other  records  that leave  the 
site will be identified  by a coded  number  to maintain  patient  confidentiality. All study 
records  will be kept in a locked  file cabinet  or other  secured  area.  All computer  entry 
and networking programs will be identifiable only by [CONTACT_24655]. Patient 
personal  medical  information  may be reviewed  by [CONTACT_665189], of the IRB, or of  regulatory 
authorities in the course of monitoring the progress of the clinical trial. Every 
reasonable  effort  will be made  to maintain  such information  as confidential.  
 
12.0 Statistical Methods  
 
Upon  analysis,  patients  will be divided  into two groups:  Vitamin  D Deficient  Women 
and Vitamin  D Normal  Women.   
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  Outcomes  to be analyzed  include  differences  in demographics,  clinical,  and tumor 
characteristics  between  groups,  and differences  in treatment -related  morbidity  or 
mortality  between  groups,  including  completion  of treatment and treatment  delays, 
and survival. Both 30 -day postoperative surgical morbidity and chemotherapy -related 
morbidity will be assessed. The ability to normalize 25(OH)D levels with oral 
supplementation  in the vitamin  D deficient  group  will be evaluated.   
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the demographic and clinical 
characteristics  of patients.  Chi-square  and t-tests will be used to make  comparisons 
between groups. Survival will be estimated with Kaplan -Meier curves and Cox 
proportional  hazards  regression. The anticipated  enrollment  is [ADDRESS_898606] 25 of the prospectively enrolled  patients  will be vitamin  D deficient.  All of the vitamin  D deficient  women  will 
be repleted  with oral vitamin  D. We will compare  outcomes  between  these  patient s 
and 75 vitamin  D deficient  ovarian  cancer  patients  from previous  years  (these  will 
include  patients  from the above -mentioned  previous  retrospective  review  as well as 
other  patients  with banked  blood  samples)  using  logistic  regression.  We will control 
for age, stage, and histology. With [ADDRESS_898607] 80% power  to detect  differences  of 32% in chemotherapy  delay 
between ovarian patients who were not vitamin D deficient (33%) and who were vitamin  D deficien t (65%).  
 
Additionally, the association between serum leptin and 25(OH)D levels will be compared  among  groups,  including  any change  in leptin  levels  observed  in the 
vitamin  D supplementation  group.  Because  there  is a positive  linear  association 
between  BMI and serum  leptin  levels,  BMI will be corrected  for during  analysis for 
potential relationships between serum leptin and  25(OH)D.  
 
The proportion of patients with VDR FokI SNP will be assessed. We will also 
compare  levels  of vitamin  D at diagnosis,  differences  in treatment -related  morbidity 
or mortality  including  completion  of treatment,  treatment delays,  survival and

and documented.  The Investigator  will be responsible  for reviewing  all data and CRF 
entries  and will sign and date the designated  pages  in each subject’s  CRF, verifying 
that the information  is true and correct.  The Investigator  is responsible  for the review 
and approval of all responses.  
13.2 Data Management 
 
All CRF data will be entered  into a validated  database  maintained  by [CONTACT_665190] (REDCap). REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, 
web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, 
providing  1) an intuitive  interface  for validated  data entry;  2) audit  trails  for tracking 
data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless  data downloads  to common  statistical  packages;  and 4) procedur es for 
importing  data from external  sources  [21] All data entry,  verification  and validation 
will be performed  in accordance  with written  standard  operating  procedures  of the 
OU Clinical Trials  Office.  The database  will be authorized  for lock once all defined 
procedures are  completed.  
13.[ADDRESS_898609]  adhere  to applicable  data privacy  laws and regulations.  The 
investigator is responsible  for ensuring  that sensitive  information  is handled  in  
IRB NUMBER: 7488
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 11/23/2021
 
  accordance with local requirements (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability  Act of 1996 [HIPAA]).  Appropriate  consent  and authorizations  for use 
and disclosure and/or transfer (if applicable) of protected information must be 
obtained.  Only the subject  number  and subject  initials  will be recorded  in the CRF, 
and if the subject  name  [CONTACT_665193]  (e.g., laboratory  report),  it 
must  be obliterated  on copi[INVESTIGATOR_665176].  The subjects will be informed  that 
representatives of the Stephenson Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring 
Committee,  IRB, or regulatory  authorities  may inspect  their medical  records  to verify 
the information collected, and that all personal information made available for inspection  will be handled  in strictest confidence  and in accordance  with local data 
protection  laws.

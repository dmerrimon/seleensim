Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of medical or research treatments 
they would want to receive (such as blood tra nsfusions).  If you have such beliefs, please discuss them with your NIH 
doctors or research team before you agree to the study.  
 
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much time as you need to ask any que stions and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other 
health professional.  
 
BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
 What is a Research Study?  
 A research study is a carefully supervised study that is done in humans to answer specific questions about a study drug or 
a new way of using an approved drug.  Research studies are used to determine whether study drugs or treatments are 
safe and effective in humans.  
 You are being asked to take part in this study, also known as a clinical trial, because you have kidney cancer related to 
von Hippel -Lindau (VHL) disease.   You are invited to join this phase II study of an investigational (research) drug called 
ZD6474 ( also known as vandetanib or ZACTIMA).

 What is this document?  
 This document is an informed consent form that will provide you with information about this research study.  Before you 
can make a decision about whether or not to participate, you should understand what this study involves and the possible risks and benefits associated with this study.  If you have any questions after reading this document, please ask the study 
doctor or study nurse to explain any words or information that you do not understand.  If you agree to participate in this 
research study, you should be sure that all your questions are answered and that you understand your rights as a study 
subject.  After you sign this form you will be given a copy to keep.  
 
Why is this study being done?  
 The purpose of this research study is to determine if the study drug ZD6474 can be used as a treatment for kidney 
tumors in people who have VHL and whether it can safely be given to patients with  VHL.   ZD6474 is an experimental 
drug that is being tested as a new medication for a variety of cancers, including clear cell renal carcinoma  which is the 
type of kidney cancer seen in VHL patients . ZD6474 is given once daily by [CONTACT_181632] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_572361].  
 Why might ZD6474 work  in cancer patients ?  
 One way tumors are able to grow is by [CONTACT_572373] d vessels which bring nutrients and oxygen 
to the tumor.  This process happens because proteins (called receptors) on the surface of cells lining blood vessels and 
cancer cells receive chemical signals that encourage the growth of new blood vessels.  Cance r cells also have other 
receptors on their surface that promote growth of cancer cells directly in response to proteins called ‘growth factors’. In 
laboratory experiments, ZD6474 works by [CONTACT_572374] s or on the 
lining of blood vessels within cancers.  Blocking these receptors may cause cancer cells or the blood vessels to stop growing.  
 
ZD6474 has been tested in adults who have a variety of different cancers  in clinical trials, but the drug has not b een 
approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) as a cancer treatment.  We do not know whether ZD6474 will 
slow or stop the growth of renal cancer or whether this drug will be effective in your cancer.  
 One of the goals of this study is to try an d understand better how ZD6474 may work in humans with kidney cancer. At 
specific times throughout this study, your blood will be collected and analyzed.   These samples will be studied to look for special markers that may help researchers understand how Z D6474 is affecting you and/or your tumor and to develop 
tests that may be helpful in the study of
 kidney cancer . 
 How many people will participate in this study?  
 The study will initially involve [ADDRESS_751566] tumors that 
shrink following treatment with  ZD6474, another 25 patients can enter the study. The plan is to enter up to 37 patients 
with VHL on to this study.    
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH  STUDY?  
 
What are the chances  that I will get the study drug?

 All eligible subjects enrolled in this study will receive the study drug ZD6474.  This study is an open label study, which 
means that both you and your doctor will know what amount of ZD6474 you are taking.  
How often will I need to visit the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], clinic, or doctor’s office?  
 You will visit the NIH clinical center to help your doctors determine whether you are a suitable candidate for this study. 
This visit will involve meetings with doctors, nurses and other staff conducting this study as well as blood and urine tests 
and x -rays. Once you decide to participate in the study, you will need to come to the NIH every [ADDRESS_751567] 
four weeks, you will need to return for a visit once every four weeks.  The length of each visit will depend upon the 
number of tests that are being done.  Some visits will be longer than other visits.  
 
What will I be responsible for if I participate in this study?  
 During this study you will not be able to receive any other cancer treatments other than ZD6474.  You will be asked not 
to participate in any other clinical trials involving another experimental treatment while you are being treated in this 
study.  
Several medications (both prescription and non -prescription), ‘alternative/complementary’ or herbal preparations, dietary 
supplements, and foods such as grapefruit juice, can have undesirable interactions with ZD6474. You will not be allowed 
to take certain medications , supplements, and grapefruit juice  during your participation in this study.  Your doctor or the 
study staff will review the list of drugs that you are currently taking, as well as those that you took prior  to participating in 
this study.  Once you are on study, please talk to your NIH doctors prior to starting any new drugs, dietary 
supplements or herbal or complementary medications . 
 
Drugs that affect the normal growth of blood vessels can delay or complicate wound healing following injury or surgical 
procedures. You should not schedule any elective surgeries while you are being treated in this study.  If you have an 
unplanned surgery, inform you doctor immediately, as you may not be able to continue study drug 
treatment.  
 You need to keep your scheduled NIH visits and follow the instructions of your physicians and study nurse.  If you cannot 
keep one of your planned visits, call your research nurse and reschedule the visit.  
 You will also be asked to keep a diary of when you take the medication and any side effects that you experience.  You 
will also need to bring your ZD6474 pi[INVESTIGATOR_572362]6474 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].   
You will be given a blood pressure cuff and be  taught how to take your own blood pressure.  You will be asked to take 
your blood pressure at home periodically and keep a diary of the readings. If you experience any worrisome side 
effects or if your systolic blood pressure (upper or higher number) is above 150, or if your diastolic (lower number) is above [ADDRESS_751568]  before you are given 
ZD6474.  An appropriate and effective method of birth control (which may include abstinence) must be used by [CONTACT_572375] a child and is receiving ZD6474.  Birth control must be continued and 
breast feeding avoided for three months after the last dose of ZD6474 is given to ensure that most of the drug is out of 
your body.  If you become or are found to be pregnant while receiving ZD6474, you must notify one of the doctors listed

If you are a woman of child -bearing potential:  
• By [CONTACT_50841], you confirm to the best of your knowledge that you are not pregnant now and you do not intend to become pregnant during this study  
• A pregnancy test w ill be done to confirm that you are not pregnant before you take part in this study  
• You must avoid becoming pregnant and use an acceptable method of birth control during this study.  
If at any time during this study you think you might be pregnant, or later  learn that you were pregnant during the study, 
you must contact [CONTACT_572376] -
up. 
MALE Patients  
The study drug used in this study could affect your sperm and could potentially harm a child that you may father while in 
this study.  You must avoid unprotected sex with a pregnant partner (or woman of child -bearing potential not using birth 
control) or donating sperm during the study and for three months following the las t dose, since the potential for problems 
with the fetus has not yet been thoroughly investigated.  Men should use a condom during the trial and for three months 
following the last dose.  
If your partner becomes pregnant, you must notify the study doctor of any outcomes of the pregnancy from the date of 
the first dose until three months after last dose of  ZD6474.  
 
TYPES OF TESTS OR PR OCEDURES INVOLVED WITH THIS STUDY   
 
Once you meet with your doctors and research team at the NIH and undergo the necessary tests to determine if you are a suitable candidate for this study, you can decide whether you want to participate. If you choose to take part, then you 
will be started on ZD6474.  This drug is given by [CONTACT_572377] ( treatment periods are divided arbitr arily into 
cycles -a cycle of ZD6474 is 28 days). You will be instructed about how to take ZD6474.  
 During the [ADDRESS_751570] the following tests and procedures.  They are part of 
regular cancer care.

 ● V ital signs (pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], oral temperature, and blood pressure), weight, and performance status 
will be taken at each study visit . 
● Blood will be collected for chemistry, hematology, and other labs to determine if the study drug is causing any ill 
effects on your body.  These s amples will be taken at each study visit.  About 3 -5 teaspoons will be taken each 
time you visit the doctor for this study.   
● If you are a female and able to get pregnant, a pregnancy test will be done within the week before starting  the 
study and once every four weeks  during treatment  before your continue with each new cycle.   
The following tests and procedures will also be done. Even though they are part of regular cancer care, it is possible they 
are being done more often because you are in this study.    
● You will have imaging scans (CT or MRI) done approximately every  12 weeks to assess the size of your tumors 
(or sooner if your doctor feels it is necessary)  
● You will have urine collected during the 1st week of every cycle.  
● You will have an electrocar diogram (E KG) and routine blood work done every week during the 1st two cycles.  If 
you stay on the drug longer, then EKGs will be performed every four weeks .  This means that some of the EKGs 
and blood work will need to be performed locally near your home and the results sent to the NIH.    
The following research studies will be done to see how ZD6474 is affecting your body.  
● Your blood will be taken before and after the ZD6474 dose at weeks [ADDRESS_751571] cycle, and every four 
weeks  after that, as well as the end of treatment to look for special markers affecting you and/or your tumor that 
may be helpful in the study of  kidney cancer .  About 8 tablespoons will be collected for this portion of the 
research tests.

Having uncontrolled blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack and 
stroke in adults.  High blood pressure  may be associated with no symptoms;  however, dizziness, headache or nose bleed 
can occur  in patients with high blood pressure . You will be asked to record your blood pressure at least once a day. If 
your systolic blood pressure (upper or higher number) is above 150, or if your diastolic (lower number) is

as soon as possible.  
 
We will monitor your heart function closely by [CONTACT_572382]/EKGs periodically to look at your heart rate and rhythm. 
This procedure is associated with minimal discomfort.  Abnormalities on the EKG have been reported in patients taking 
ZD6474 on other trials. Some of these abnormalities can have serious or life -threatening consequences if appropriate 
action is not taken (usually stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_572365]6474 and/or ensuring that blood electrolyte levels are 
normal). However, as a result of close monitoring and timely intervention, no serious problems or symptoms related to these EKG abnormalities have been reported so far.  
 
[COMPANY_008] has observed changes in ECGs in some patients being treated wit h vandetanib. These changes in the 
ECG may be drug -related and usually occur without symptoms; accordingly, frequent safety follow -up visits have 
been built into all studies. Similar changes in the ECGs of patients receiving other medications have led to h eart 
rhythm changes, some of which have been life threatening. However, it is estimated that between 0.1 to

 1% of patients receiving vandetanib [ADDRESS_751576] experienced bleeding (including one case of 
bleeding into the brain) it  is not clear how frequently bleeding occurs or whether these are related to ZD6474. Other 
drugs (including some drugs that are approved by [CONTACT_572383]) have been associated with 
bleeding, which, in some cases have been life -threaten ing or fatal. Since patients with VHL have tumors at multiple 
locations within the body, bleeding from tumors can have serious or life -threatening consequences, especially if it involves 
hemangioblastomas in areas such as the brain, the spi[INVESTIGATOR_572366].  
 
Drugs that affect the normal growth of blood vessels can delay or complicate wound healing following injury or surgical 
procedures. You should not schedule any elective surgeries while you are being treated in this study.  If you have an 
unplanned surgery, inform you doctor immediately, as you may not be able to continue study drug treatment.  
 
The long -term side effects of ZD6474 are not known.  It is possible that there may be temporary or permanent side 
effects of ZD6474 that have not ye t been identified.  
 
The effects of ZD6474 on the human fetus or nursing infant are not known. ZD6474 is harmful to fetal development in 
animals. 
 Known side effects of the procedures that will be done in this research study  
 
Blood Collection  
 The risks associated with blood collection include discomfort, pain, bleeding, bruising, redness, swelling and/or bruising where the blood is drawn from your arm.  Fainting and infection are rare, but can happen with blood collection.  By 
[CONTACT_50841], you are authorizing NIH investigators to use your blood samples for those procedures identified 
in the study protocol.  
 
ECG 
 A recording of the normal electrical activity of your heart is taken by [CONTACT_572384] (pi[INVESTIGATOR_572367]) on the skin of your chest, arms, and legs.  There is minimal discomfort and there are no risks.

in use for many years, their potential long term effects on the body are still being learned.  
 
MRI Scan  
 
There are no known harmful effects from the strong magnetic field used for MRI. However, the magnet is so powerful that it may affect pacemakers, artificial limbs, and other medical devices that contain iron.  You should tell the study staf f 
about any metal devices that you may have in your body.

 The MRI scan is pe rformed in a long narrow tube.  You may experience discomfort related to lying still in an enclosed 
space for a prolonged period of time.  The study staff prior to performing the procedure will provide additional instructions to you.  If this occurs, cool air can be blown over you by a fan if desired or your doctor can order a medicine 
to help you relax during this scan.  Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_572370].  
 
CT Scan  
 If a contrast agent (the special dye) is given with the scan there is a small risk of having a reaction to the contrast.  
These reactions can include nausea, pain in the vein where the contrast was given, headache, a metallic or bitter taste in 
the mouth, and a warm or flushing feeling that lasts from [ADDRESS_751578] scan. 
 
The radiation dose you receive, if your scans include the use of X -rays or radioactive chemicals, is within the safe limits 
defined by [CONTACT_572385], and is considered essential for your medical care.  
 
Delay in surgical resection of kidney tumor(s)

 organs.  Removing your kidney tumors does not mean that your cancer has been ‘cured’.  Even if you have surgery to 
remove your kidney tumor(s), it is possible that you will develop new tumors and may need surgery again in the future.  
 
Your tumors may or may n ot be large enough to require surgical resection in the near future. If they are large enough to 
require surgery, a delay in surgery may result  if you choose to participate in this study  and your tumors do not decrease 
in size with ZD6474.  We feel that delaying surgery for approximately [ADDRESS_751579] possible time and will exclude you from the current study.  
 
Potential Benefits of Participation  
 You are being offered this experimental drug (ZD6474) because it may be of benefit to you in treating your VHL disease.  
One potential benefit may be shrinkage of your tumors that would enable you to delay or avoid surgery.  Another possible benefit might be changes to the tumor environment (such as decreased blood supply) that may make surgical removal of 
your tumor(s) easier.  However, there is no guarantee that this drug is of benefit to humans or that you will benefit from taking part in the study.  The drug you receive may even be harmful to you.  
 Individual patients will not have a benefit from taking part in the investigational procedures such as research done on 
your blood samples or tumor tissue.  However, future patients may benefit from what is learned.   
Your participation in this study is voluntary.   
 Potential Benefits to Society  
 The knowledge gained from this study may benefit others.  Your participation may help to determine if ZD6474 treatment 
can be safely and effectively given to other patients with VHL.  
 
Alternative to Participation/ Alternative Approaches or Treatments  
 You may choose not to participate in this study.  Other treatment options may be available to you.  Your doctor is very 
willing to discuss the benefits and side effects of other ways to treat your tumors including the option of surgical resection 
of your tumor(s), treatment of your symptoms only, and other investigational protocols that may be available for your 
condition.  
 
Your other choices may include:
 
 
• Getting care for your cancer without being in a study  
 
• Taking part in another  study  
 
• Surgical removal of your tumor(s)  
 
• Getting no treatment

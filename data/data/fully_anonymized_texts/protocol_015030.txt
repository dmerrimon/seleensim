 General Information  
 
Study Title  - The Clinical Efficacy And Safety Of SkinStylus  Microneedling System for 
Treatment of Ventral Torso Hypertrophic  Scars: Clinical Results  With The  SkinStylus ® 
System for 30 Patients . 
A. Background  
 
Device under investigation – The SkinStylus® Microneedling System is a handheld 
device that creates channels as well as microinjuries into the skin, by [CONTACT_57216] a 1A DC 
motor that rapi[INVESTIGATOR_661335] [ADDRESS_892034] 1/8” headphone plug on the device side.  
The motor body is comprised of anodized aluminum with a dial mechanism that controls 
the depth of penetration of the microneedles from 0 mm to a maximum of 2.5mm.  
The removable nosecone interface provides the Ski nStylus® the unique ability to have an 
interface between the motor and the cartridge that can be autoclave sterilized.  
The SkinStylus® cartridge is designed in three  configurations, an 11 needle array  with all 
needles @2.5mm, 36 needle array  with all needles @2.5mm and a 36 needle array with 
18 needles @2.5mm and 18 needles @1.0mm alternating in row. . The needle array is 
housed in a specially designed (pat ented ) cartridge housing that prevents liquids from 
entering the motor body via the insi de lumen of the cartridge. This has been an issue with 
other microneedling systems.

 The SkinStylus ® will be used to improve the appearance of ventral torso hypertrophic 
scars, such as abdominoplasty and breast augmentation sca rs.  
 
Microneedling hypertrophic scars has an impeccable safety record as evidenced by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_892036] notably in 2017, 
researcher Hou, et al, performed a comprehensive overview of the available l iterature 
regarding the efficacy and safety of microneedling performed for dermatologic conditions 
in human subjects. Hou’s group stated the following with respect to adverse events 
associated with all of the studies analyzed,  
 
“Microneedling is associate d with a low rate of AE. Histologic examination taken [ADDRESS_892037] 
common.6”  
 
This study protocol was based, in part, on a microneedling study performed by [CONTACT_661350] 
M, and Laaff H. titled, “A prospective controlled assessment of microneedling with the 
Dermaroller device.”  and published in Plastic Reconstructive Surgery 2011; 127:146e –
148e. This study was reviewed by [CONTACT_661351]. Al  and there were no adverse events reported 
in this study.  
 
Indications for Use/Intended Use  
 
The purpose of the trial is to provide objective evidence the SkinStylus  may be used 
safely and effectively for the treatment of ventral torso hypertrophic  scars .   
 
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 
1) Participants must be at least 23 years old  
2) Each participant shall have at least one suitable ventral torso hypertropic scar of 
sufficient length that it may be easily visualized in two halfs . 
3) The scar(s) present along a flat surface suitable for application of the SkinStylus®  
device and consistent medical photography.  
 
Trial Summary  
 
Each participant shall have at least one suitable ventral torso hypertropic scar of 
sufficient length that it may be easily visualized in two halfs.  At the conclusion of the 
trial all participants shall be provided with a cross over treatment on the non -treated

Efficacy (primary) Endpo int  
 
The Visual analogue Scale (VAS) scar scoring system was defined and validated by 
[CONTACT_136592]. in 2006.  This scale consists of a [ADDRESS_892039] will be used to compare the treated side and 
untreated (control) side of the scar to determine if there is a statistically significant 
improvement in the average difference of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measurements 
(difference determined by V AS measurements pre - and post -treatment). Efficacy will be 
determined by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_892040]  Feedback (patient perception) Endpoint - Patient satisfaction will be

treatment . For the Subject G lobal Aesthetic Improvement Score, ratings of 3 and lower

other impurities from the treatment area.  
b. The technician administering the treatment shall further clean  the treatment  
areas,  if necessary.  
c. The hypertrophic scar to be treated shall be divided into two equal segments 
and the technician shall randomly choose one half to be treated.

 d. The technician shall describe in the CRF, which half of the scar was treated.  
e. Subsequent treatments shall only treat the same half of the scar that was 
initially designated the treatment side.  
f. If the scar is to be locally anesthetized, the entire scar (both halves) are  to be 
anesthesized.  
g. A proprietary glide serum , EstheCeuticals® HA -Cu Serum, shall be applied 
prior to treatment and again as necessary.  The purpose of the serum is to act 
as a glide and no thera peutic effect is known or anticipated. This serum has 
been used in several hundred microneedling treatments without any 
incidence of adverse events.  
h. The depth settings  and clinical endpoint s shall be established by [CONTACT_978].  
i. Each participant shall receive three SkinStylus  treatments  . 
j. Each participant shall receive one treatment using each of the three different 
array configurations. The order in which each is used shall be randomized at

D. Determination of Results  
 
A panel of 3 physicians who are either dermatologists or plastic surgeons (and not 
affiliated with the trial or Esthetic Education LLC ) shall review the baseline and post 
treatment photographs and score each them using the  VAS scar score  on page 7.  A 
successful o utcome on the primary endpoint (efficacy) shall be determined to a 
statistically significant improvement when comparing the sc ore determined for the [ADDRESS_892055] 2017

 A successful outcome on secondary endpoint ( patient feedback)  shall be determined by 
[CONTACT_661358] [ADDRESS_892056] endpoint (safety) shall be determined by [CONTACT_661359] . 
 
E.  Statistical  Analysis for the SkinStylus ® Clinical Study  
 
The sample size for this study consisted of 30 subjects with assessable data. Performance 
will be  evaluated by [CONTACT_941] (VAS)  visual analogue scale scar score as described above from 
SkinStylus®  treated sites and control  sites at approximately [ADDRESS_892057].  
Measurements:  
a) Primary Endpoint:   A statistically significant improvement between the 
measurements taken at baseline and two weeks following th e end of the 
treatment , on the VAS Scar Scale . The scores are determined based on a panel of 
three independent physicians (dermatologist and/or plastic surgeons).  
b) Second Endpoint:   The patient surveys shall be tabulated and reported.  It is 
anticipated the patients shall have a good experience while being treated by [CONTACT_661360].  
c) Third Endpoint:  - The tertiary  endpoint is the relative absence of adverse 
incident s as previously defined .   
 
 
Prior data indicate that the standard deviation of the paired differences in visual analogue 
scale scores is not expected to exceed 1.46.  
Statistical analysis on the scoring will commence using appropriate measure s for 
statist ical significance using the standard cutoff for significance of P<0.[ADDRESS_892058]

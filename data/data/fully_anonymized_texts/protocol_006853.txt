Protocol Number:  TIS2019-[ADDRESS_929190] decades. Initially researched in the context of percutaneous coronary interventions 
(PCI), early reports of successful transradial access (TRA) included coronary angiography in 
1989 (Campeau, 1989) and the first successful TRA coronary angioplasty and stent 
implantation in the years 1992 and 1993, respectively. (Kiemeneji & Laarman, 1993). 
Further studies of TRA for PCI have consistently demonstrated its benefits as compared to 
femoral access, including decreased bleeding, access site complications and post-
procedure recovery time, and increased patient satisfaction and cost effectiveness. (Rao, 
Cohen, Kandzari, Bertrand, & Gilchrist, 2010) . Limitations to the transradial approach have 
been recognized, such as a learning curve which must be overcome by [CONTACT_685545], 
limitations of available equipment suitable for radial use, and relatively rare complications 
such as localized access site hematoma. Radial artery occlusion is reportedly rare and upon 
occurrence is often asymptomatic due to collateral perfusion supplied by [CONTACT_685546]. 
(Fischman, Swinburne, & Patel, 2015). 
The benefits of transradial access are considered by [CONTACT_685547], leading to the steady uptake of TRA for PCI; an estimated 16% of PCI 
procedures in the US were conducted transradially in the year 2012, up from 1.2% in 2007. 
Within the previous decade, additional support for TR-PCI has been generated by [CONTACT_685548], randomized trials, including the RIFLE, RIVAL and MATRIX trials which have 
consistently demonstrated decreased access site bleeding and net adverse events. 
(Fischman, Swinburne, & Patel, 2015). The expanding body of evidence favoring transradial 
access for PCI prompted physicians to branch beyond the coronary space to transradial 
access for visceral and peripheral arterial interventions, (Rao, Cohen, Kandzari, Bertrand, & 
Gilchrist, 2010) and more recently, for interventional radiology procedures, such as 
embolization of hypervascular tumors, including uterine fibroids and liver tumors ( (Yamada, 
et al., 2018)).  
Uterine fibroid embolization, traditionally achieved via femoral access, is considered by [CONTACT_685549] a safe, minimally invasive primary 
treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids. (Keung, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_014], & Caridi, 2018) . The first reported 
series of UFE achieved via radial access dates to 2014, where Resnick, et al. (2014) 
conducted UFE on 29 patients at a single institution with a 100% success rate. No 
immediate major or minor complications were observed in any patients, and radial artery 
patency was evident in all patients at one month follow up. (Resnick, et al., 2014). Recently,

15 Jan 2021                              CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 37 Gjoreski, et al. (2019) directly compared the safety and feasibility of UFE when achieved 
through radial as opposed to femoral access. In this retrospective study, 13 femoral 
procedures and 11 transradial procedures all yielded a 100% success rate with no 
significant difference in access site related and overall adverse events noted between 
cohorts. Procedure and fluoroscopy times were reportedly shorter in the radial group; a 
mean procedure time of 60.3 minutes was associated with the radial group as compared to 
72.4 minutes in the femoral cohort, and mean fluoroscopy time was 21.1 minutes and 25.3 
minutes in the radial and femoral cohorts, respectively. (Gjoreski, Gjoreski, & Nancheva, 
2019). 
The development of transradial access for embolization of hepatic tumors can be traced 
back to a 2003 report by [CONTACT_685550]. (2003) which described transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) in 327 patients, 177 of which were accessed radially and 150 
via femoral access. Therapeutic efficiency was observed in both cohorts, with a lower 
complication rate in the radial cohort (4.6%) compared to the femoral (12.7%). (Shiozawa, et 
al., 2003).  In addition to chemoembolization, radial access has also been utilized for 
radioembolization of hepatic tumors. A study by [CONTACT_685551], et al. published in 2016 
described 30 procedures conducted in 26 patients which supported the safety and 
tolerability of TRA for hepatic artery embolization. In this study, 14 TACE procedures, 14 
Y90 procedures and 2 bland embolization procedures yielded a 100% technical success 
rate with no major AEs reported at one month follow up. (Fischman, et al., 2013) . In a 318 
patient study, a total of 329 planning angiograms and 245 Y90 embolization procedures 
resulted in technical success in 97.7% of cases, superficial bruising observed in 2.3% of 
cases, and a radial artery occlusion rate of 1.6%. (Bishay, et al., 2016) . 
A study by [CONTACT_685552], comparing the feasibility of transradial vs transfemoral 
access for hepatic radioembolization, demonstrated 100% technical success in both radial 
and femoral cohorts, totaling [ADDRESS_929191] and time 
were noted in the radial group; approximately $[ADDRESS_929192] procedure 
stay was observed on a per procedure basis. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a caveat noted in this study 
surrounded the technical challenges associated with radial access which led to longer 
fluoroscopy time and greater radiation doses, the authors recommended radial access as 
the primary choice in selected patients, such as those with low platelet count and/or morbid 
obesity. (Kis, Mills, & Hoffe, 2016) The association between increased radiation exposure 
and fluoroscopy time with radial access was challenged in a later study, in which 124 
intraarterial procedures were performed on 55 liver cancer patients, which demonstrated 
Clinical Investigational Plan
The RAVI Registry 
Protocol Number:  TIS2019-[ADDRESS_929193] agent volume and patient radiation exposure between groups. This randomized, 
prospective study was primarily conducted in order to assess patient access preference for 
intraarterial liver cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; of [ADDRESS_929194] one radial and 
one femoral access procedure, 81% preferred TRA compared to 19% who preferred TFA. 
(Yamada, et al., 2018) 
A recent paper from an Italian University hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175351] a study of 60 pts treated with TACE 
for HCC reported 0% of cross-over rate from trans-femoral access (TFA) to trans-radial 
access (TRA). A positive association between operator experience and time spent for 
fluoroscopy, puncture, procedure and total examination was noted. A negative relationship 
between TRA and contrast volumes and radiation exposure were also reported. A higher 
percentage of pts treated with TFA reported post-procedural complains at the puncture site 
and limitations in performing basic activities. The operator learning curve was estimated to 
be low, with an estimated threshold of 20 procedures. (Iezzi, et al., 2019) 
The largest study involving safety and feasibility of transradial access for non-coronary 
interventions includes both UFE and hepatic artery embolization among other visceral 
interventions. In this single center study, 936 patients undergoing 1,512 consecutive TRA 
procedures were retrospectively analyzed. Of these procedures, UFE accounted for 116, 
and TACE, Y90 mappi[INVESTIGATOR_6926] Y90 infusion accounted for 485, 391 and 293 procedures, 
respectively. Combined analysis indicated a technical success rate of 98.2%. Major 
complications, including one pseudoaneurysm and one seizure, were reported at 0.13%, 
and minor complications, including hematomas, RAO, RAS and arm pain, were observed in 
2.38% of cases. Twenty-seven cases, representing 1.8%, required crossover to 
transfemoral access. The favorability of these results towards radial access led authors to 
pronounce TRA as a promising alternate primary access site in a variety of peripheral 
vascular interventions.  (Posham, et al., 2016)

at [ADDRESS_929216]’s 
participation in the study. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_929217] demographics, eligibility requirements, procedure, specific 
concomitant mediations as well as complications and/or device related adverse events will 
be collected on the eCRFs provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The eCRFs should accurately reflect 
data contained in the subject’s medical records (i.e. source documents). 
 
[ADDRESS_929218] complications will be monitored via the reporting of device related adverse events 
occurring from the time of enrollment (insertion of guidewire into radial artery) through study 
completion (withdrawal for any reason or completion of 365-day follow-up visit). For this 
registry, adverse events collected will be limited to any events possibly, probably or 
definitely related to a Terumo device, as described below in Section 8.2.   
 
Where an adverse event has, by [CONTACT_5942], a prolonged course, the event will be considered 
a single event and not multiple events.  
 
The investigator is not required to actively seek adverse events from a subject once a 
subject has exited the study. If the investigator learns of any device related adverse event at 
Clinical Investigational Plan
The RAVI Registry 
Protocol Number:  TIS2019-[ADDRESS_929219]’s exit from the study, the investigator should promptly report it to the 
Sponsor. 
8.1 Definitions 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an unwanted medical occurrence in a subject. This 
definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the AE and the device 
under investigation. This can include, but is not limited to, a change in the subject’s 
health status from baseline that is related to the disease process, interventional 
procedures, investigational device, and/or side effects to medications.   
An adverse device effect is defined as those adverse events that are caused by, or 
related to, the device. 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that led to a death or led to a 
serious deterioration in the health of a subject that: 
1. Resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, 
2. Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, 
3. Required in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], 
4. Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body 
structure or a body function, or 
5. Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth 
defect.   
 
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_685554]-serious.  (Note:  Seriousness is different from severity; severity is used to describe 
the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_423]).   
 
A serious adverse device effect  is an adverse event that is both serious and device 
related. 
8.2 Anticipated Adverse Events (AEs) 
All expected adverse events are listed in each device’s IFU.  Potential complications 
associated with interventional procedures, access, and device are described per each site’s 
Clinical Investigational Plan
The RAVI Registry 
Protocol Number:  TIS2019-[ADDRESS_929220] be reported on the eCRF. All device related adverse events will 
be followed until resolution or stabilization of symptoms through study completion and/or the 
subject withdraws consent. Resolution means that the subject has returned to a baseline 
state of health. Stabilization means that the investigator does not expect any further 
improvement or worsening of the adverse event.   
 
8.4 Causality Rating
The causal relationship of an adverse event to the device will be rated as follows: 
Possible:   An event that is unlikely caused by [CONTACT_354800]. An alternative explanation - 
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s) - is inconclusive. The relationship in time 
is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. 
Probable:    An event that might be due to the use of the device. An alternative explanation is 
less likely - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is 
suggestive of a direct relationship to the device. 
Definitely:  An event that is attributed to the use of the device. The event cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867] - e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant 
disease(s). 
8.5 Severity of Adverse Events 
The severity of adverse events will be rated as follows: 
Clinical Investigational Plan
The RAVI Registry 
Protocol Number:  TIS2019-[ADDRESS_929221], causes minimal discomfort 
and does not interfere with everyday activities, does not need medical 
treatment or intervention. 
Moderate An adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may or may not be needed.
Severe An adverse `event that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or 
other intervention usually needed.

 9 Risk Assessment 
 
9.1 Risk Management Procedure
Subjects will be monitored for the duration of the study. Risks will be mitigated through 
selection of qualified physicians, appropriate training, and study monitoring ensured by [CONTACT_14504]: 
 Investigators who participate in the study will be experienced and skilled in radial 
access for visceral interventions.  Additionally, investigators, in conjunction with the 
investigational site, will have adequate resources for participation in a registry 
study. 
 Each investigator will ensure oversight and approval of the study by [CONTACT_11577]/EC 
prior to initiation of the study at their site. 
 The investigator and study personnel will be trained on the study protocol.  
 Subjects will be carefully evaluated against the eligibility criteria prior to entering the 
study to ensure that their diagnosis and medical status are appropriate for 
participation. 
Clinical Investigational Plan
The RAVI Registry 
Protocol Number:  TIS2019-[ADDRESS_929223] visits with the investigator or designee to review the 
subjects’ status. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_929224] regular assessments according to the investigator’s standards of care. The data 
collected during the clinical study will provide further understanding of procedural and 
technical success of radial access for HydroPearl procedures.  
 
10 Monitoring
Data will be collected using eCRFs for this study. Sites will enter data directly into the 
eCRFs via a web-based system. Sponsor representatives (study monitors) will schedule 
periodic, on-site visits to review source data and compare to eCRFs. 
 
Study monitors will work in accordance with Sponsor standard operating procedures (SOPs) 
and the Study Monitoring Plan.  
 
At the site, monitors will perform and verify the following: 
 The adequacy and experience of the study center including Sponsor notification of 
any problems relating to facilities, technical equipment or medical staff 
 Written Informed Consent has been obtained from all subjects prior to any study 
related procedures being performed and that data is recorded correctly and 
completely 
 Source Document Verification (SDV):  comparing data in the eCRFs to ensure they 
correspond with applicable source data, and to inform the Sponsor and investigator 
of any discrepancies, errors or omissions 
 Ensure adherence to the protocol and applicable regulations at the site and notify 
the Sponsor promptly of any deviations  
 Evaluate subject compliance and support subject retention efforts at the site

13 Statistical Methods  
13.1 Sample Size Determination
. This observational study is not testing a hypothesis; therefore, no power calculations were 
completed.  The stated sample size will provide a reasonable assimilation of safety of the 
device and will allow detection of rare major complication with a reasonable probability.  
That is, a sample size of 100 evaluable patients would provide greater than 80% probability 
of observing 1 or more major complications that may occur at a population rate of 1.6% or 
more.
13.2 General Considerations
Evaluations will be reported with descriptive statistics including 95% confidence intervals. 
Continuous endpoints will report the mean and standard error, median, min, and maximum 
values. Categorical endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_685555]. Time-to-
event endpoints will be summarized via Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, along with median 
and associated 95% interval. The associated Kaplan-Meier curves will be displayed as 
appropriate.  
 
Sub-group analyses include, but are not limited to:  
 UFE treatment procedure 
 Hypervascular benign and malignant liver treatment procedures 
 AVM procedures 
 PAE treatment procedure

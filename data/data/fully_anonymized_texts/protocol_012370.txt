1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1 Synopsis 
Title: A Phase 2b, Single-Arm, Multicenter Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and 
Safety of UGN-1021 as Primary Chemoablative Therapy in Patients with 
Low Grade (LG) Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC) at 
Intermediate Risk of Recurrence.
Study Description: Trial TC-BC-12 is a prospective Phase 2b single-arm trial to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of 6 weekly instillations of 
UGN-102 in patients with LG NMIBC.
All enrolled patients will undergo treatment with intravesical UGN-
102.
Approximately 60 patients with LG NMIBC who meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the trial.
Following a successful screening period, eligible patients will be 
enrolled in the study.
Eligible patients will receive 6 weekly intravesical instillations of 
UGN-102. The primary endpoint assessment (complete response 
[CR]) will take place 5 weeks  [ADDRESS_951372] instillation 
(approximately 3 months after initiation of study treatment), at 
which time the patients will be evaluated for treatment response. 
Patients who achieve a CR will continue to be monitored monthly 
for safety, and will be assessed at 6, 9, and 12 months (±2 weeks) 
after the first instillation of UGN-102 for evidence of disease 
recurrence. Nonresponders (non-CR) will exit the study and 
continue with standard of care according to their treating physician.
Objectives: Primary Objective: To evaluate the tumor ablative effect of UGN-102 in 
patients with LG NMIBC.
Secondary Objectives:

4 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Study Rationale
Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer
Urothelial cancer (UC) of the bladder is the second most common genitourinary malignancy, 
with almost 80,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and nearly 17,000 
deaths from the disease per year. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 
about 80% of all bladder cancers (Heney, 1992). Patients with NMIBC can be segmented into 
3 staging groups: patients with Ta tumors (70%), patients with T1 tumors (20%), and patients 
with carcinoma in situ (CIS) or Tis tumors (10%). Of these patients, approximately 70% have a 
tumor that is classified as low grade (LG), and approximately 30% have a tumor that is classified 
as high grade (HG). Ta and CIS tumors are limited to the urothelial layer, and T1 is limited to the 
lamina propria.
The standard treatment of NMIBC is transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) (Brausi, 
2002), often followed by [CONTACT_700904] (Hall, 2007). 
TURBT is associated with the typi[INVESTIGATOR_700893]. Recurrence rates following standard of care (SoC) management range 
from 31% to 78% with the risk of progression to muscle invasion approaching 50% in patients 
with HG cancer (Sylvester, 2006). Tumor recurrence following TURBT can be attributed 
primarily to incomplete initial resection and, at least hypothetically, to tumor cell reimplantation 
following surgery (Brausi, 2002; Miladi, 2003, Anastasiadis, 2012). The effectiveness of 
intravesical therapy is limited by [CONTACT_700905], which results in drug dilution and periodic 
bladder emptying, and which limits the agent’s time on target (Audenet, 2013; Barlogie, 1980; 
De Bruijn, 1992; Deb, 2011; Eastham, 1993; Nozue, 1995a; Ozawa, 1988; Perry, 1992; Sadeghi, 
1998; Schmittgen, 1991; Slee, 1986; Walker, 1986; Wang, 2013, O’Donoghue, 2004).
Chemoablation represents an attractive alternative to surgical therapy. It could avoid the 
morbidity and expense of surgery and may offer a more rational therapeutic approach to UC, 
which is generally multifocal and refractory to focal ablative interventions. Preliminary evidence 
documents the ablative capabilities of aqueous Mitomycin C (MMC), which has been applied 
successfully to the primary management of small UCs (Bono, 1996; Bracken, 1980; Brausi, 
1998; Colombo, 2001; Ost, 2015; Hamdy, 1993; Harrison, 1983; Hetherington, 1987; Maffezzini, 
1996; Mishina, 1975; Soloway, 1985.) 
UGN-102
The Sponsor performed a Phase 2 study (Study TAS-4M-CS-002) in 65 evaluable patients with 
LG NMIBC and showed that UGN-102 therapy is associated with a complete response (CR) rate 
of 86% and significant durability of response (77% recurrence free survival at 12 months) in 
those patients achieving an initial CR. Based on this initial experience, the Sponsor proposes to 
conduct a Phase 2b UGN-102 trial in the US to corroborate the data provided by [CONTACT_700906]. 
TC-BC-12 - UGN-102 - IND Clinical Trial Protocol
Document ID: CLP-0002410 Version: 5.0 Effective Date: 15-Apr-2019
Document State: Effective (Controlled) Confidential
Page [ADDRESS_951393] is specifically 
formulated to achieve a liquid state at 4C and to transition to a water-soluble gel at body 
temperature. The advantage of delivering Mitomycin to the urinary bladder using UGN-102 relies 
on preclinical and clinical literature documenting that concentration and dwell time correlate 
directly with the therapeutic efficacy of MMC when used to treat UC (Barlogie, 1980; Slee, 
1986; Walker, 1986; Ozawa, 1988; Perry, 1992; Nozue, 1995b; Sadeghi, 1998).
MMC functions as a bifunctional or trifunctional alkylating agent. It is most sensitive in the late 
G1 and early S phases, but overall is considered cell cycle phase non-specific (Badalament, 
1997). The cell killing induced by [INVESTIGATOR_106286], as well as by [CONTACT_700907][INVESTIGATOR_700894], is 
proportional to the duration of exposure and to concentration (Serreta, 2008; DeBruijn, 1992; 
Sadeghi, 1998; Barlogie, 1980; Nozue, 1995b; Schmittgen, 1991; Ozawa, 1988; Walker, 1986; 
Slee, 1986; Giesbers, 1989). 
UGN-[ADDRESS_951394]
UGN-102 is provided by [CONTACT_700908] a kit containing 2 vials of 40 mg MMC for injection, 
one 60 mL vial of UG-1 (UG-1 sterile hydrogel), 3 × [ADDRESS_951395].
Preclinical studies of UGN-102 performed by [CONTACT_700909]. In a porcine model, all MMC plasma concentrations were found to be substantially 
below 400 ng/mL, which is the drug concentration associated with myelosuppression (Dalton, 
1991). In clinical studies, systemic levels of MMC were low and well within the range 
considered safe. Systemic toxicity following intravesical therapy is uncommon because of the 
limited absorption of MMC. Myelosuppression occurs in <1% of patients (de Bruijn, 1992). 
Investigators have reported that extended dwell times appear safe in humans (de Bruijn, 1992).
For further details of the preclinical and clinical studies conducted with UGN-102, refer to the 
Investigator Brochure for UGN-101 (MitoGel) and UGN-102 (VesiGel).
4.3 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
4.3.1 Known Potential Risks 
Toxicity Associated with Systemic Absorption/Local Irritation
Although literature review did not demonstrate any side effects associated with the systemic 
absorption when MMC was administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], bone marrow toxicity (thrombocytopenia and 
leukopenia) and bladder toxicity are considered possible risks for patients. The complete blood 
count (CBC) and renal and liver function tests will be checked regularly during the treatment 
period. In case of clinically significant abnormalities, the investigator will continue to follow the 
abnormal parameter until resolution, stabilization, or otherwise managed.

Document ID: CLP-0002410 Version: 5.0 Effective Date: 15-Apr-2019

Page [ADDRESS_951396] symptoms (LUTS) may develop. Urine tests, including 
urine culture and urinalysis, will be checked regularly during the trial to exclude urinary 
infection. Any symptoms will be treated by [CONTACT_113522]. 
All of the symptoms described above are all well known in relation to standard MMC 
instillations and are not exclusive to UGN-102. 
Currently, the SoC for NMIBC is TURBT. This surgical procedure has its own potential risks 
such as bladder perforation resulting in MMC leak, bladder scarring, and decreased bladder 
capacity; urinary retention requiring catheterization; and the need for anesthesia. Moreover, 
during TURBT, tumor cells are released into the bladder cavity and may be seeded in denuded 
areas of the bladder where the urothelium is surgically interrupted. This is one of the reasons for 
the high rate of tumor recurrence and the need of immediate post-TURBT chemotherapy (usually 
MMC instillations). The high recurrence rate of NMIBC indicates that the current SoC is far from 
optimal. 
4.3.2 Known Potential Benefits 
The potential advantages of instillation of MMC in gel are as follows:
Sustained release of drug for up to 8 hours (compared with 1.[ADDRESS_951397] 
instillation). Published literature indicates that duration of tumor exposure to 
chemotherapy is critical to its ablative response. Thus, the effectiveness of tumor ablation 
is increased by [CONTACT_113523].
The gel protects MMC from both breaking down in urine and being diluted by [CONTACT_113524], 
which leads to longer stable chemotherapy concentration levels.
These characteristics of UGN-102 (MMC+UG-1) are expected to improve MMC treatment 
efficacy and provide an alternative mode of ablation for NMIBC, which may be simpler and 
potentially better tolerated than current treatment modalities.
4.3.3 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The potential benefits exceed the risks observed so far in the development program. Since the 
risks are similar to those observed with intravesical MMC alone, and the expected benefits are to 
improve MMC’s therapeutic efficacy and to expand its use, the overall risk:benefit ratio at this 
stage supports continued development of UGN-102.

Upon signing of informed consent, patients will undergo a Screening Visit for eligibility 
evaluation.  The screening period is 2 weeks if the patient’s cold cup biopsy to confirm LG tumor 
is historic (taken within 6 weeks of the screening visit) or 4 weeks if the patient’s cold cup biopsy 
to confirm LG tumor is current (taken at the screening visit). 
Starting at the Baseline Visit (Day 1), eligible patients will be treated with UGN-102 once 
weekly for a total of 6 doses; the UGN-102 concentration to be used in this trial will be 1.33 mg 
MMC per 1mL. The volume of UGN-102 to be instilled will be 56 mL (75 mg of MMC).

number, and size of the lesions) and, if there are remaining lesions, by [CONTACT_700910]. CR is defined as having no detectable disease (NDD) and will be assessed 
visually during cystoscopy and also upon urine cytology. In the event that the investigator is not 
sure, and there is suspect tissue, a small biopsy will be taken from the suspect tissue to confirm 
CR in addition to cystoscopy and urine cytology. Patients who achieve a CR will continue to 
have monthly telephone contacts to document any adverse events and changes in concomitant 
medications  and will be assessed at 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_951404] instillation of UGN-102 
for evidence of disease recurrence. The group of patients considered nonresponders (non-CR) 
will discontinue the study and continue with SoC according to their treating physician.
Safety will be determined based on physical examination, laboratory assessments, and a review 
of AEs. All safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, including close review and follow 
up of any unexpected AE related to UGN-102 and qualified per National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) as Grade 3 or 4.

9 STUDY MEDICATION DISCONTINUATION AND PATIENT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL
9.1 Discontinuation of Study Medication
Discontinuation from study medication does not mean discontinuation from the study, and 
remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_4690]. If a 
clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to, changes from baseline) 
after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in patient 
management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an AE.
If a patient discontinues study medication during the treatment period or at any time prior to the 3 
MONTH Visit, the following unscheduled visit activities should be performed:
All 3 MONTH Visit (Visit 7) procedures should be conducted.
If the patient appears to have a CR (refer to Section 10.2.2), the patient has the option to 
continue participating in the follow-up assessments conducted at Months 6, 9, and 12 
(Visits 10, 13, and 16, respectively) to assess for disease recurrence and monthly 
telephone contacts for safety checks.
If patient agrees to complete the follow-up visits within the trial or agrees to continue to 
share information regarding his/her disease status, information collected during the 
follow-up care of the patient should be recorded in the eCRF.
9.2 Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study
Patients in this trial are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time.
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a patient from the study for the following reasons:
Pregnancy
Significant study medication non-compliance
If any clinical AE, laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation occurs 
such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the 
patient
Disease progression that requires discontinuation of the study medication
If the patient meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation
Patient becomes unable to receive study medication for 4 weeks.
Patient is lost to follow-up (see section 9.3)
The reason for patient discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the 
eCRF. Patients who sign the informed consent form but do not receive the study medication may 
be replaced. Patients who sign the informed consent form, receive the study medication, and 
subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.

visit:
The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_113540]/or should continue in the study.
Before a patient is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent 
methods). These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s study file. 
Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn 
from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.

10.1.[ADDRESS_951424] to the investigator’s judgement:
Administer QLQ-NMIBC24 questionnaire if indicated (i.e., early termination)
Concomitant medication review
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and body temperature)
Clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry and hematology)
Urinalysis
AE review
Cystoscopy/urine cytology (if indicated by [CONTACT_700920])
10.2 Efficacy Assessments
10.2.1 Measurements for Evaluation of Response at 3 MONTH Visit
Assessment of response will be based on the following:
Visual observation (cystoscopy)
Biopsy of remaining lesions, if applicable (non-CR or suspected tissue)
Voiding urine cytology
10.2.2 Evaluation of Response
Patient response will be evaluated according to the following criteria: 
CR: A patient will be considered to have had CR if there is NDD. To determine NDD, the 
following conditions should be fulfilled:
1. If visual assessment indicates no remaining tumors and urine cytology is negative, the 
patient has NDD and CR.  In the event that the bladder is free of tumor 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_897], but the cytology is positive, the investigator is required to exclude 
urothelial carcinoma of the upper tract and occult carcinoma of the bladder or urethra. 
If   UTUC is confirmed, the patient will be considered as CR.
2. If any remaining lesions appear, even if they appear necrotic, the physician should 
biopsy the lesion(s). If a biopsy is taken from the necrotic lesion and found to be

Page 30 of 56
negative, the patient should be classified as having CR; if positive for cancer, the 
patient should be classified as non-CR.
Non-CR:
1. If tumors are still visible, all remaining lesions should be biopsied for histopathology 
and viability assessment. If histopathology still indicates cancer, then the patient is 
considered non-CR. Note that biopsy results showing PUNLMP are not considered 
cancer and in such cases the patient would be considered CR.
Recurrence : For patients with CR at the 3 MONTH Visit, recurrence will be assessed at 
Study Visit 10, Visit 13, and Visit 16.
If evidence of disease is identified, patients will be staged according to their local 
Investigator practice . Progression is defined as change in either stage according to the 
Tumor-Node-Metastases (TNM) classification or grade according to the 2004 World 
Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors.
Since the patient is recruited into the trial as a patient with LG NMIBC (based on a small 
biopsy for LG confirmation), it is unlikely that the tumor will progress to HG during the 
6-week study medication period. 
10.2.3 Assessment of Tumor Progression
Diagnosis of bladder cancer at the 3 MONTH Visit with an increase in stage or grade compared 
to baseline will be tracked; however, it likely does not represent true progression for the 
following reason:
The overall risk of progression for patients with LG papi[INVESTIGATOR_700898] 5 to 20% at 1 and 5 years (Sylvester, 2006). A 12-week 
interval, during which the patient is exposed to MMC treatment, is not considered long 
enough for progression to occur in patients with non-invasive UC.
Upstaging/upgrading detected at the 3-MONTH Visit will be recorded, and the overall incidence 
will be compared with that reported in the literature.
10.2.[ADDRESS_951425] follow-up visit (Study Visit 10, Month 6) and continuing at Visit 13 and 16 
(Months 9 and 12), information regarding disease status based on cystoscopy, cytology, and 
biopsy (when applicable) should be recorded. If a patient is defined as having recurrence, 
complete documentation should be obtained. If a patient has a positive urine cytology and/or a 
positive biopsy for cancer, they are considered as having urothelial cell cancer with likely 
recurrence. If urine cytology is positive but the biopsy is negative, the patient should be evaluated 
for the presence of UTUC, either by [CONTACT_700921]. In cases 
where CT Urogram or retrograde pyelogram are contraindicated, MRI may be performed. If the 
patient is positive for UTUC that was not present at baseline and there is no evidence of tumor 
within the bladder, this is considered new disease and the patient remains a CR for their NMIBC.

10.3 Safety and Other Assessments
10.3.1 The safety of the study medication will be assessed by [CONTACT_716]:
Evaluation (frequency, seriousness, severity, and type) of AEs including adverse events of 
special interest (AESIs)
Changes from baseline in laboratory values and incidence of measurements defined as 
potentially clinically significant (PCS)
Clinically meaningful changes in physical examination findings including vital signs
10.3.2 Quality of Life Assessment EORTC QLQ – NMIBC24 
The QLQ- NMIBC24 is a 24-item validated, evidence-driven survey that assesses Health Related 
Quality of Life (HRQOL) for patients with intermediate to high risk NMIBC (Appendix 1). It is 
designed to be administered at baseline and at, 3, [ADDRESS_951427] medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 
312.32 [a]). An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory, physical examination, or vital signs finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product (“Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice” 
CPMP/ICH/135/95). Any patient who reports an AE shall be examined by a doctor as soon as 
possible, making whatever intervention is necessary for the safety and well-being of the patient. 
All anomalies shall be monitored through to the patient’s recovery or clinical stabilization. AEs 
must be recorded in the eCRF using CTCAE to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions. The investigator shall evaluate all AEs in terms of severity and their relationship 
with the product being tested, indicating the test results and the measures to be taken.
10.4.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening AE, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include 
TC-BC-12 - UGN-102 - IND Clinical Trial Protocol
Document ID: CLP-0002410 Version: 5.0 Effective Date: 15-Apr-2019
Document State: Effective (Controlled) Confidential
Page 32 of 56
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.
10.4.3 Classification of an Adverse Event
[IP_ADDRESS] Intensity of Event
The intensity of an AE is to be graded by [CONTACT_700922] 4.03. 
General rules are as follows:
0 No AE (or within normal limits)
1 Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only, 
intervention not indicated
2 Moderate: minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention (e.g., packing, cautery) 
indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL
4 Life-threatening consequences: urgent intervention indicated (SAE)
5 Death related to AE (SAE)
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Medication
All AEs must have their relationship to study medication assessed by [CONTACT_700923]/her clinical judgment. In a 
clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. Investigators will be asked to grade each 
AE as either related or unrelated.
[IP_ADDRESS] Expectedness
The investigator will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. 
An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, intensity, or frequency of the event is not 
consistent with the risk information previously described for the study medication.
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction (UADR) is any noxious and unintended response that is 
related to the administration of an IP that has not been reported as expected in this protocol or the 
Investigator’s Brochure, either from previous clinical studies or the nonclinical studies.
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any UADR that at any dose also 
meets the criteria for SAE.
10.4.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study 
visits and interviews of a study patient presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study 
monitor.
All AEs, including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs, will be 
captured on the appropriate eCRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of intensity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_700924]-BC-12 - UGN-102 - IND Clinical Trial Protocol

with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the 
event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of 
relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution/stabilization.
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient signs the informed consent form 
(ICF) until the first study drug administration will be considered as baseline and recorded as 
medical history. However, if the study patient’s condition deteriorates at any time during the 
study, it will be recorded as an AE. AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 
[ADDRESS_951428] dose of study medication will be considered as treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs).
Changes in the intensity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of 
the event at each level of intensity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].
At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last 
visit. The investigator or designated investigational staff member will record the start date of all 
reportable events. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or 
stabilization and the dates of outcome must be recorded.
10.4.[ADDRESS_951429] person at the site 
he/she should contact [CONTACT_113549]. 
Where required, patients will be examined at the center and will be clinically monitored until 
they recover.
Expedited reporting to the sponsor is required in the following conditions:
1. Any SAE and follow-up SAE report, if required
2. Death of study patient 
3. Pregnancy and outcome of the pregnancy
The investigator must inform the Sponsor about the above by [CONTACT_700925], to be sent by [CONTACT_6968]/fax within [ADDRESS_951430] came 
to his/her knowledge.
10.4.[ADDRESS_951431] include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study medication 
caused the event. Study endpoints that are SAEs (e.g., all-cause mortality) must be reported in 
accordance with the protocol, unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between 
the study medication and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator 
must immediately report the event to the Sponsor.
All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the investigator deems the event to 
be chronic or the patient is stable. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested 
by [CONTACT_116348].

The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of any 
unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case 
later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. In addition, the 
Sponsor must notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of potential 
serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, but in no case later than 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting.
[IP_ADDRESS] SAE Reporting Instructions
The investigator must inform the sponsor within 24 hours of becoming
aware of an SAE with an email to:
[EMAIL_13397] with copi[INVESTIGATOR_24305] [EMAIL_13398]
In addition, initial SAE/Death/Pregnancy must be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form

Report) as an AE, serious or nonserious, which is of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_429447]. Such an event might warrant further investigation 
in order to characterize and understand it.
Events of Special Interest that may require expedited reporting and/or safety evaluation include, 
but are not limited to, the following:
1. Overdose of an IP
2. Suspected abuse/misuse of IP
3. Inadvertent or accidental exposure to IP
4. Medication error involving IP (with or without patient/patient exposure to the Sponsor 
medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])
5. Identified significant safety issue either from an individual case report or review of 
aggregate data

10.4.9 Reporting of Pregnancy 
In the event of a patient becoming pregnant, the investigator shall immediately discontinue study 
treatment and ensure expedited reporting of the event (see Section 10.4.5). The pregnancy will be 
followed to term and the outcome reported.
10.5 Other Safety Assessments
10.5.1 Laboratory Assessments
Samples for hematology and serum chemistry assessments will be taken according to the SoA in 
Section 1.3 and tested at the local laboratory. The amount of blood required for hematology and 
serum chemistry tests per visit is 15 to 20 mL. The assessments to be performed are listed in 
Table 4. Additional tests may be part of a clinical site’s local lab’s standard panel and therefore 
reported along with these specified tests.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other significant laboratory derangements
If at any time the investigator identifies myelosuppression or other significant laboratory 
derangements during the study defined by [CONTACT_113538], treatment may be
postponed for up to 4 weeks until laboratory values improve:
Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/μL (≥1.0×109/L),
Platelets ≥80,000/μL (≥80×109/L)
AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≥5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)
ALP ≥ 2.[ADDRESS_951434]
For patients whose baseline GFR is ~30 mL/min/1.73m2, decreases of up to 15% will be 
allowed
For patients with normal baseline creatinine, increases of up to 2x will be allowed
For all other patients, changes in creatinine should not result in GFR less than 
30mL/min/1.73m2

Not applicable.
11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Statistical Hypotheses
Analyses are descriptive and exploratory in nature and no formal hypotheses will be tested.
11.2 Sample Size Determination
Approximately 66 patients will enter the study, with 60 expected to complete, assuming 10% 
dropout rate. Given the patient population under study, i.e., those at intermediate risk of 
recurrence, a more conservative CR rate than previous studies of UGN-102 in the treatment of 
LG NMIBC has been assumed. The primary objective will be successfully achieved if complete 
responses from 36 out of 60 patients with CR rate of 60% will be observe, which would yield a 
95% confidence interval of (46.5%, 72.4%) based on the exact (Clopper-Pearson) binomial 
distribution.

11.3 Populations for Analyses
11.3.1 Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set (Safety Analysis Set)
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis set will consist of all patients who have been enrolled into the 
trial and who have received any instillation of UGN-102 preparation. This analysis set, which 
will include all data captured in the database for these patients, will serve as the primary set for 
the primary efficacy endpoint analysis and will serve as the analysis set for the secondary safety 
endpoint analyses.
11.3.2 Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set
The Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Analysis Set will consist of all patients who have been 
enrolled into the trial, who have a confirmed diagnosis of LG NMIBC based on the local 
pathology reading, who received at least [ADDRESS_951438] 
undergone the 3 MONTH Visit (since it is the first visit for the outcome evaluation). 
11.3.3 Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will consist of all patients who have been enrolled into the 
trial, who have a confirmed diagnosis of LG NMIBC based on the local pathology reading, who 
received all [ADDRESS_951439] undergone the 
3 MONTH Visit. Patients who are identified as HG by [CONTACT_700926] 3 MONTH 
visit will be excluded from this analysis set. This analysis set, which will include all data 
captured in the database for these patients, will serve as supportive data for the primary efficacy 
endpoint analysis.
11.3.4 Complete Response at Primary Outcome Analysis Set
The Complete Response at 3 MONTH Visit (3 MONTH CR) Analysis Set will consist of all 
patients who achieved CR at the 3 MONTH Visit (Study Visit 7). This analysis set, which will 
include all data captured in the database for these patients, will serve as the primary set for the 
secondary efficacy endpoint analysis.
11.4 Statistical Analyses
A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to database lock. 
The SAP will supersede this statistical analysis section.
11.4.1 General Approach
All measured variables and derived parameters will be listed individually and, if appropriate, 
tabulated using descriptive statistics. For categorical variables, summary tables will be provided 
giving sample size, absolute and relative frequency, and 95% confidence interval (CI) for 
proportions using the exact approach. For continuous variables, summary tables will be provided 
giving sample size, arithmetic mean, standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (if 
appropriate), median, minimum and maximum, percentiles, and 95% CI for means of variables. 
For variables with non-normal distribution, medians and interquartile range (IQR) will be 
calculated, and the appropriate non-parametric tests will be applied.

Page [ADDRESS_951440] for binomial proportions (SAS PROC FREQ with binomial option) will be used to derive 
the exact 95% CI for the true CR rate.
11.4.3 Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint
Sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will include repeat of the primary efficacy analysis 
(Section 11.4.2) using the PP Analysis Set, i.e., including only patients who received all 
6 instillations of UGN-102 preparation and are LG at baseline (patients with HG at 3 MONTH 
Visit will be excluded).
11.4.4 Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
One key secondary endpoint is pre-defined for this trial: the durable complete response (DCR) 
rate at 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_951441] instillation of UGN-102 preparation, defined as the 
percentage of patients who continue to display CR at Study Visits 10, 13, and 16, respectively.
Analysis will use the 3 MONTH CR Analysis Set, implying that the denominator for this analysis 
will be the number of patients who demonstrated CR at the 3 MONTH Visit. Patients who 
withdraw early from the trial between the 3-MONTH Visit and Study Visit 16 for whom 
follow-up data regarding the disease status (i.e., recurrence) is not available will be treated as 
follows:
Patients who discontinue during this time window due to adverse reactions from the study 
medication, lack of efficacy, death, or any other cancer-related reason will be considered 
as treatment failures for the purpose of this analysis.
Patients who withdraw during this time window due to reasons other than those given 
above will be excluded from the analysis.
A test for binomial proportions (SAS PROC FREQ with binomial option) will be used to derive 
the exact 95% CI for the true DCR rate at 6, 9, and 12 months.
11.4.5 Safety Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Adverse events will be recorded from the time a patient has signed the informed consent until 
[ADDRESS_951442] instillation of study medication. AEs reported by [CONTACT_700927] (MedDRA).
The following will be incorporated into the analysis of AEs:
All analyses to be provided will include coded AEs.
AE analyses will include both all AEs and treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), i.e., events 
that started on the day of first administration of study medication or afterwards, or that 
were present before first administration of study medication and increased in intensity

provided.
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Assessments
Analyses of safety laboratory data will be performed for all collected laboratory parameters. 
Quantitative laboratory measurements will be categorized with reference to the normal ranges as 
Low, Normal, or High. Shift analysis of the categorical change from baseline to each scheduled 
visit and to the last observed assessment will also be performed.
A list of parameters and related cut-off values defining the PCS abnormal values will be outlined 
by [CONTACT_700933]. Measurements used in the analysis 
are those taken following first trial instillation. The incidence tables of PCS laboratory values as 
well as the individual patient listing will be provided using the denominator that is the number of 
patients with at least [ADDRESS_951444]-baseline administration of trial medication. Individual patients’ 
listings of PCS measurements will also be presented.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination
Any clinically relevant changes occurring from Screening until the last trial visit will be recorded 
on the Adverse Event Sections of the eCRF and reported with AEs as described above.

Pre-instillation concomitant medications use: Analyses will include coded medications 
that were initiated prior to first instillation, regardless if stopped after the first instillation. 
An incidence table including patient counts (number of patients) and percentages broken 
down by [CONTACT_700935].
Concomitant medications use (post-first instillation): Analyses will include only coded 
medications that were administered following the first instillation, regardless if drug 
initiation date was before or after first instillation. An incidence table including patient 
counts (number of patients) and percentages broken down by [CONTACT_700936].
[IP_ADDRESS] MMC Levels (Pharmacokinetics) Profiling
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile during the [ADDRESS_951445] administration of UGN-102 
will be based on PK sampling at 0 (pre-instillation), 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and [ADDRESS_951446] 6 patients who provide informed consent for PK testing. 
Concentration data as well as PK parameters (e.g., AUC) will be provided using descriptive 
statistics. Plasma samples for evaluation of PK properties of MMC following instillation with 
UGN-[ADDRESS_951447] instillation, which is the estimated 
duration of the dwell-time of UGN-102 Admixture. The PK parameters obtained, specifically the 
Cmax, will be compared to the threshold of MMC plasma concentration (400 ng/mL) known to be 
associated with myelosuppression, as well as to the known PK profile of MMC obtained with 
different routes/methods of administration (e.g., intravesical instillation with WFI).
Additionally, these data, combined with data emerging from other trials may be used in 
population pharmacokinetic model development and analysis. 
11.4.6 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Disposition data from patients who were screened but not treated, patients in the ITT, mITT, PP, 
and 3 MONTH CR Analysis Sets, as well as trial withdrawal data will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.
Demographics and baseline data, as well as disease prognostic factors, medical history, and prior 
medications, will be summarized for the ITT Analysis Set using descriptive statistics. For 
continuous variables, descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, standard error, median, minimum, 
and maximum) will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be 
provided. Categories for missing data will be presented if necessary. Missing categories will be

12 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
12.1 Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
12.1.1 Informed Consent Process
[IP_ADDRESS] Consent/Assent and Other Informational Documents Provided to Patients
Consent forms describing in detail the study medication, study procedures, and risks are given to 
the patient, and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to initiating any 
study procedures and starting medication/administering study medication. The informed consent 
form (ICF) template is submitted with this protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Consent Procedures and Documentation
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Consent forms will be 
IRB-approved, and the patient will be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator/designee will explain the research study to the patient and answer any questions that 
may arise. A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the patient’s comprehension 
of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research 
patients. Patients will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask 
questions prior to signing. The patients should have the opportunity to discuss the study with 
their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The patient will sign 
the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. 
Patients must be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the 
study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to 
the patients for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in 
the source document (including the date), and the form signed, before the patient undergoes any 
study-specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the patients will be protected by 
[CONTACT_26571].
12.1.2 Study Discontinuation and Closure
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient 
reasonable cause. Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or 
termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_700937], 
investigator, Sponsor, and regulatory authorities. If the study is prematurely terminated or 
suspended, the investigator will promptly inform study patients, the IRB, and the Sponsor and 
will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Study patients will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as 
applicable, and be informed of changes to the study visit schedule.

Page [ADDRESS_951450]-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible 
(approximately 2-3 weeks) after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compare 
the data entered into the eCRF with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] (source documents). The nature 
and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data 
required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and investigational staff and are 
accessible for verification by [CONTACT_350975]. If electronic records are maintained at the 
investigational site, the method of verification must be discussed with the investigational staff.
Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for verifying that the 
data recorded in the eCRF are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review 
of eCRFs and source documents will be discussed with the investigational staff. The sponsor 
expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant investigational staff will be available, the 
source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review 
of trial-related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during 
the trial to provide feedback on the trial conduct. Further details of clinical site monitoring will be 
provided in a Study Monitoring Plan (SMP). The SMP will describe in detail who will conduct 
the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will 
be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports.
Independent audits may be conducted by [CONTACT_18485]’s clinical quality 
assurance department or their designee to ensure that monitoring practices are performed 
consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the SMP.

specimen collection, documentation, and completion. An individualized quality management plan 
will be developed to describe a site’s quality management.
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and 
data QC checks that will be run on the database. Any missing data or data anomalies will be 
communicated to the sites for clarification/resolution.
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the 
clinical trial is conducted, data are generated, and biological specimens are collected, documented 
(recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory 
requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices [GLP], GMP). 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial-related sites, source data/documents, 
and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_700938].

[IP_ADDRESS] Data Collection and Management Responsibilities 
This study will use an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system; the designated investigator staff 
will enter the data required by [CONTACT_113561]. The eCRFs are built using fully 
validated, secure, web-enabled software that conforms to [ADDRESS_951453] been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs and 
allow modification or verification of the entered data by [CONTACT_6649].
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of 
the site investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. It is the sponsor’s expectation that data required by 
[CONTACT_700939] [ADDRESS_951454] copi[INVESTIGATOR_113505]. Data recorded in the eCRF 
derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source 
documents.
Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and 
clinical laboratory data will be entered in the eCRF using a [ADDRESS_951455] protection and internal quality checks, 
such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Records Retention 
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of [ADDRESS_951456] elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the study medication. These documents should be 
retained for a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_427]. No records will be 
destroyed without the written consent of the Sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.
12.1.9 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is a departure from the study protocol and/or study related documents. The 
departure may be either on the part of the site or the patient and identified as site or patient 
deviations. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_90478].
All important deviations related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, conduct of the trial, 
patient management or patient assessment should be addressed in study source documents and 
reported to the sponsor. Protocol deviations must be submitted to the local or central IRB 
according to their guidelines. The site PI/study staff is responsible for knowing and adhering to 
their IRB requirements.

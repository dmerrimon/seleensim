Tofacitinib 5 mg immediate release formulation (IR) was approved for twice daily  (BID) 
dosing schedule by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in November [ADDRESS_1226501] 
had an inadequate response or intolerance to methotrexate. In Febru ary 2016, an 11 mg once 
a day  (QD) modified release (MR ) tablet for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis was approved 
in the [LOCATION_002].  It may  be used as monotherapy  or in combination with methotrexate
(MTX) or other conventional sy nthetic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs 
(csDMARDs ). 
Biologic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs s (bDMARDs) have been 
used for man y years to treat RA with vary ing levels of success; however, no study  has 
compared the effectiveness and treatment patterns of tofacitinib to bDMARDs in a real -world
setting.
In stud y A3921215, a randomised controlled direct comparative clinical study conducted in 
Japan , the MR formulation did not meet the non- inferiorit y criteria based on the stringent 
criteria requested b y the Pharmaceutic al and Medical Devices Agency  (PMDA ), the 
Regulatory  Agency in Japan. However, the point estimate of the difference in efficacy  
between the MR and IR formulations, based on the primary  endpoint of Disease Activity  
Score ( DAS )28, was within the pre -specifi ed margin. Nonetheless, the data from this study  
are not sufficient to c onclude statistical similarity
 between the clinical efficacy  of MR and IR 
formulations. While randomised controlled trials (RCT) are considered high in the hierarch y 
of medical evide nce for a conventional treatment compari son, the A3921215 results may not 
be applicable to clinical practice due to many  factors including reduced adherence. Patients 
tend to demonstrate worse adherence when they  know their medication is being monitored. 
For example, i n a metanaly sis of RCTs that used electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_877808], patients had 
lower adherence in studies where they  were blinded to the fact of monitoring than in studies 
where they  were aware of the monitoring .[ADDRESS_1226502] masked the benefit of the MR 11 mg QDformulation relative to 
IR 5 mg BID by [CONTACT_877819] y arms . 
Increasingl y, there is a recognition that 
patients’ use of medicines in regular clinical practice 
or in settings better reflecting the reality  of he althcare delivery can explain differences 
between expected efficacy  based on RCT outcomes and actual effectiveness in real world.1  
Evidence from medication use in the real-world setting can help to extrapolate an d/or 
augment data obtained in randomised controlled trials and establishes a broad pi[INVESTIGATOR_510] a 
medication’s place in every day clinical practice .[ADDRESS_1226503] initiation, tofacitinib MR 11 mg QD is effective in 
managing signs and s ymptoms of RA in real world clinical use; and that it does so to a 
similar degree as tofacitinib I R 5mgBID formulation ([COMPANY_007], data on fil e).  However, 
adherence information is not collected in the register and could not be evaluated.

7. RESEARCH QUESTION AND OBJECTIVES
Primary Objectives:
To compare, through multivariate regression analyses:
•Two proxies of medication effectiveness (a validated criteria-ba sed algorithm and a 
persistence-based measure)3over 12 months of follow-up among RA patients treated 
with tofacitinib MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitinib IR 5 mg twi ce daily.
•12-month proportion of RA patients who are persistent and adhere nt with tofacitinib
MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitinib IR 5 mg twice daily.
Secondary Objectives:
To compare, through multivariate regression analyses:
•A persistence-based measure of effectiveness over 6 months of fol low-up among RA 
patients treated with tofacitinib MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitin ib IR 5 mg twice 
daily.
•A 6-month proportion of RA patients who are persistent and adher ent with tofacitinib
MR 11 mg once daily and tofacitinib IR 5 mg twice daily.

Page 10of 328.2.1. Inclusion Criteria
This study will include individuals with RA who are commercially  insured (commercial 
claims and encounters database) or Medicare -eligible retirees with employ er sponsored 
Medicare Supplemental coverage (Medicare database) who are treated with tofacitinib .
Patients must meet all of the following inclusio n criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the 
study :
1.First pharmacy  claim for tofacitinib isa 30-day supply (index event).
2.Index prescription isfor labelled dosing for tofacitinib MR 11 mg QD or IR 5 mg 
BID between 01 March 2016 and 31 October 2018 (theidentification period) (See 
Annex 2 for operationalization) .Since the specific dose frequency , ie, twice daily  or 
once dail y is not available, forthose initiating a [ADDRESS_1226504] y of tofacitinib MR 11 
mg, a quantity  of 30 pi [INVESTIGATOR_877809] ( ie, 1x11 mg per day ) and for those starting a

Patients from the overall cohort will be further assigned into MR [ADDRESS_1226505] 1year after the index date.
Note: Patients will have a variable length baseline of at lea st a year long. The
baseline period will be censored at January  1,
[ADDRESS_1226506] measures will use data during the entire 
variable length baseline.
4.Presence of The International Classification of Diseases, 9thRevision or 10th
Revision, Clinical Modification (I CD-9 CM or ICD -10 CM) code for RA (in any
position) during the one -yearpre-index period or on the index date .

pre-index period.
3. Patients with more than one advanced therapy prescription fill on the index date will 
be removed from the study , ie, a bDMARD and JAK inhibitor or more than one JAK 
inhibitor or two different tofacitinib formulations (ie, IR and MR) , filled on the index 
date will be removed from the study .
8.3.Cohort Assignment
Patients will be assigned to a tofacitinib study cohort based on the firsttofacitinib claim and 
formulation observed and for which the patient meets the other inclusion/exclusion criteria
While patients may  have multiple eligible treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], only 
the first will be evaluated . 
Patients whose first tofacitinib prescription reflects a [ADDRESS_1226508] 
24 months ([ADDRESS_1226509] index, at minimum) .  Patients will 
have a variable length pre-index baseline period of at least [ADDRESS_1226510] RA diagnosis, the entire variable length baseline period will be utilized. The 
twelve months following the index date willbe used to assess outcomes including adherence, 
persistence, and medication effectiveness.
8.5.Variables
Adherence is defined as percentage of time with medication on hand and will be assessed 
with t he M edication Possession R atio (MPR) and Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) .  Both 
measures have been eval uated in numerous publications for rheumatoid arthritis and other 
conditions andwill be reported in current study for 6 and 12-month follow -up periods.   Both 

Tofacitinib
A3921349 NON -INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL
Version 1, 27 March 2019
Page 12of 32adherence measures willleverage tofacitinib medication day s supply  in the numerator, for 
which PDC adjusts for overlap in prescriptions while MPR does not . Further, the PDC is a 
more conservation measure of adherence as the denominator includes al l pre-defined 
follow -up (360 day s for the 12-month period; 180 day s for the 6-month period ),which may  
include time after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a medication in the calculation, while MPR only  includes time 
between firstandlastprescription (plus last prescription day s supply )in the denominator .  
Patients with an MPR or PDC ≥0.[ADDRESS_1226511] 1/3rdof  patients are not persistent with TNFi therap y, which is 
consistent with proportion of patients with inadequate response in clinical trials.[ADDRESS_1226512] not discontinued 
(gap of 60 day s between 
refills) or switched medications; however, it may  underestimate theproportion who are 
persistent depending on the duration of gap(ie, 60 vs. 90 day s) for patients tha t may  appear to 
discontinue and resume treatment for multiple reasons including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], drug samples
not recorded in claims ,use of stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_5829], etc. Hence sensitivity  analy ses with different gaps 
are often employ ed. 
Two measures of effectiveness will be used in this study : 1) a validated algorithm -based, 
dichotomous measure (over the 12 month follow up period) and 2) a duration of therap y 
based co ntinuous measure of medication persistence (over 6 and 12 month follow up 
periods) . 
Among patients with at least one yearof follow up, medication effectiveness at one y ear after
the index date will be determined using an algorithm
-based prox y measure of effectiveness 
based on the following six criteria.3,[ADDRESS_1226513] good sensitivity , 
specificit y, positive and negative predictive values ranging from 75% to 90% using a gold

8.7. Study Size
The sample size for this study is fixed by [CONTACT_877822]. No formal sample size computation  was performed.  All 
patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included  in the analyses.
8.8. Data Management 
The MarketScan Research Databases comply with both the spi[INVESTIGATOR_877816] d the letter of the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Th e MarketScan Databases
meet the criteria for a limited-use dataset and contain none of t he data elements prohibited by
[CONTACT_410011]-use datasets.
8.9. Data Analysis 
8.9.1. Primary and Secondary Analyses 
Descriptive and multivariate regression analyses will be perform ed to satisfy the primary and 
secondary analyses as described in Table 4.  Details on the desc riptive and multivariate 
methods follow in Section 8.9.[ADDRESS_1226544] Index

feasible.b. The proportions of patients not meeting each of the [ADDRESS_1226546]-index 
measures will be provided, and appropriate tests (eg, t-test, M ann Whitney-U test, chi-square 
test) will be used based on the distribution of the measure. The  analysis that is performed (ie, 
the methods that are used and the patients who are included) wi ll be specific the objective 
being examined.  Descriptive techniques will be implemented for  each objective. 
8.9.3. Multivariate Analysis
To control for possible confounding of the relationship between  the outcomes and 
independent variable of interest multivariable (logistic, gener alized linear, and Cox) 
regression models will be evaluated as described in Table 4 . 
The models will include insurance type, region, age, sex, prior advance therapi[INVESTIGATOR_877817] (None, 1 and 2+) as covariates.  The following va riables will be evaluated for 
inclusion as a covariate and be included if differences between  MR 11 mg QD and IR 5 mg 
BID at baseline with p <0.10: 12-month pre-index use (% and mea ns) of csDMARD, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
corticosteroids and presence of comorbidities including, cardio vascular disease, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, kidney disease, d epression, anxiety, liver 
disease, sleep disorders, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], Quan-Ch arlson comorbidity index and 
CIRAS scores, rheumatologist visit count during 1-year pre-inde x, disease duration, 
pre-index total costs, length of pre-index period, use of advan ced therapy in [ADDRESS_1226547]-index.  
Generalized linear models (GLM) will be fit, using appropriate distributions and links for the 
nature of the data (eg, normally-distributed data with identity  link, binary data and logit link).  
Point estimates, 95 percent confidence intervals, and p-values will be presented for contrasts; 
analysis of variance table will be presented to display the stre ngth of the independent CCI

the baseline can be considered to be prior users of therapy; however, pati ents with no
bDMARD or tofacitinib use in the baseline may have just been off therapy for the [ADDRESS_1226549] and tofacitinib users. Effectiveness (yes/no) wil l be measured using a 
validated algorithm; however, the algorithm was not validated for all medications being
included. Specifically, tofacitinib was approved for treatment of RA after the algorithm was
developed. This study will include consultation with physicians to determine if the algorithm 
is valid for all study medications or if modifications need to be  implemented.CCI

personal data, when study  data are compi[INVESTIGATOR_168024], an y patie nt names will be removed and will be replaced by  a single, specific, 
numerical code .  All other identifiable data transferred to [COMPANY_007] or other authorized parties 
will be identified by  [CONTACT_20007], patient -specific code .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of patients’ personal data consistent 
with the vendor contract and applicable privacy  laws.

Consent
As this study  does not involve data subject to privacy  laws according to applicable l egal 
requirements ,obtaining informed consent from patie nts by  [CONTACT_16099]. 
9.3.Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics C ommittee 
(IEC)
IRB is not required forthis study as it uses commercially available de- identified secondary
data sources and is considered exempt from the requirements for “human subjects research”
in the US.
9.4.Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, as well as 
with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generall y accepted research practices 
described in CT24 -WI-GL02 -RF04 and the International Society forPharmacoeconomics 
and Outcomes Research (I SPOR).
10.MANAGEMENT AND REPOR TING OF ADVERSE EVEN TS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS 
This study  involves data that exist as structured data by  [CONTACT_410013] a 
combination of existing structured data and unstructured data, which will be converted to 
structured form during the implementation of the protocol solely  by a computer using 
automated/algorithmic me thods, such as natural language processing.

Page 25of 32In these data sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or validated, and it is not 
possible to link (ie, identify  a potential association between) a particular product and medical 
event for an y individu al.  Thus, the minimum criteria for reporting an adverse event (AE) (ie, 
identifiable patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met.

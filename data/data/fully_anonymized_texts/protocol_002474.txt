DOT Diary Longitudinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_740410] 4.0, April 5, 2019  
 1.0 Background  
 
In July 2012, the FDA approved pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with daily tenofovir disoproxil 
fumarate co -formulated with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for reduction of sexually acquired HIV 
infection. Nevertheless , a major weakness of this dosing strategy is the difficulty with adherence 
and persistence with daily dosing. Indeed, adherence to daily oral PrEP has been so low in a 
number of studies as to preclude assessment of efficacy in some populations,1,[ADDRESS_1012187] for estimating adherence, between -person variability in pharmacokinetics 
(PK) as well as practical and financial limits on the frequency of blood sampling prevent this 
approach from providing accurate day -to-day information on adherence. To accurately estimate 
biological efficacy in clinical trials, new methods are needed to confirm and track pi[INVESTIGATOR_740412]. Software -based  methods that leverage existing smartphones, do not 
require changes to the medication itself, and can be optimized based on participant behavior will 
facilitate real -time monitoring and feedback at the patient, site, and study levels. Together, these 
will ensure maximal adherence during trial conduct, and enable unbiased estimation of 
biological PrEP efficacy. Finally, an accurate and scalable adherence measurement tool that is 
used successfully in clinical trials has the potential to increase PrEP uptake a nd adherence in 
diverse clinical settings with high -risk populations.  
 
In [ADDRESS_1012188] sex with men (MSM) accounted for 70% of new HIV diagnoses in the 
[LOCATION_002], and MSM are the only US population in which new HIV infections are 
rising.[ADDRESS_1012189] age groups.11 Young MSM (YMSM) accounted  for 
nearly 20% of the estimated HIV diagnoses nationwide and over  80% of new HIV infections 
among youth in 2014. Furthermore,  Black and Latino YMSM accounting for 55% and 33% of 
HIV infections among YMSM, respectively.[ADDRESS_1012190] likely to initiate PrEP, with only 9% of 
PrEP initiations in [ADDRESS_1012191] of PrEP, and 1.7% had ever used PrEP.[ADDRESS_1012192] of 550 
MSM, only 20% were age 25 or under, and PrEP uptake was lower among younger, non -white, 
and less educated persons.14 In multivariate analysis, the only independ ent predictors of 
adherence as measured by [CONTACT_740424] e 
(adjusted odds ratio, aOR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12 -0.64) and enrollment in Miami (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 
0.17-0.60).15 Self-reported adherence, pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], and medication possession ratios did not 
completely explain  the disparities in TFV -DP levels. Similar findings were seen in the ATN 110 
study of YMSM aged 18 -22, where PrEP uptake was only 16%, and PrEP adherence was lower 
among Black YMSM and declined overall during follow -up, particularly with less frequent visi ts.[ADDRESS_1012193] include sizeable numbers of African American, Latino, and 
young MSM, who are at high risk for HIV and may require timely adherence support, triggered 
by [CONTACT_740425].  Additionally, studies of on -demand (or 2-1-1) PrEP, in 
which 2 doses of TDF/FTC PrEP are taken in the [ADDRESS_1012194] demonstrated promise in a randomized study[refs] and 
6 
 
DOT Diary Longitudinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_740410] 4.0, April 5, 2019  
 implementation programs[refs] . High adherence to th is intermittent dosing regimen require s pre-
planning and track ing of sexual activity in relation to pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -taking.  
 
Because of its ability to ensure treatment adherence, directly observed therapy (DOT) has been 
used for decades both to measure and maximize adherence for treatment of tuberculosis 
infection,[ADDRESS_1012195] and logistical complexity of DOT in large clinical trials can be  prohibitive.  AiCure has 
developed an automated system “ Automated DOT ® (aDOT) ” that uses artificial intelligence 
(computer  vision and machine learning) to visually monitor adherence to treatment. Data 
(dosing data and patient reported outcomes) are transmitted to a centralized, cloud -based, 
system for analysis and intervention. On the patient side, the aDOT  application is dow nloaded 
onto a smartphone and works via the front -facing camera, confirming participant identity, the 
medication, and correct ingestion. Visual confirmation of intentional nonadherence (confirmed 
fraudulent behavior) triggers alert to study staff. The plat form has the potential to combine the 
accuracy of in -person DOT with the convenience of real -time centralized data collection and 
monitoring. The AiCure platform has been used in drug development and population health 
settings .24-[ADDRESS_1012196]  (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_740413], R01MH109320 -01), the AiCure aDOT 
smartphone app has been  adapted for use in monitoring and supporting Truvada ® PrEP use 
among YMSM  through formative work (UCSF IRB Study 15 -[ZIP_CODE]) and initially pi[INVESTIGATOR_740414] ( IRB Study 16 -[ZIP_CODE])  among [ADDRESS_1012197] YMSM in 
understanding whether they are receiving protection from PrEP for individual sexual epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], 
and when it is particularly important to take PrEP (e.g. after a sexual epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]). Specifically, t he 
sexual diary allows participants to track sexual encounters, se xual behaviors that occurred in 
each encounter, and rating characteristics of partners. Partner -specific information (e.g. ratings) 
entered by [CONTACT_740426] a secure server ) but is not transmitted to the study team. 
The app provides  a calendar  displaying all days in which PrEP medication was taken, and all 
days in which sexual activity occurred, allowing participants to see coverage of sexual 
encounters with PrEP.  Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from prior PrEP 
trials, the ap p will also indicate the estimated level of protection achieved from PrEP (e.g. low, 
medium, high), and also provide personalized messages on the additional numbers of doses 
needed to maximize protection. Additionally we have been maximizing the acceptabil ity and 
ease of use of the app through an 8-week  DOT Diary Optimization Pi[INVESTIGATOR_727578] (IRB Study  17-
[ZIP_CODE] ) among [ADDRESS_1012198] of the app on PrEP adherence as measured by 
[CONTACT_740427] (tenofovir diphosphate [TFV -DP] and emtricitabine 
triphosphate [FTC -TP] levels in dried blood spots [DBS] ). We will also assess the concordance 
of TFV -DP and FTC -TP in DBS with adherence measured by [CONTACT_740428], and the acceptability 
and ease of use of the app over a  longer ( 24-week)  period. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_740415] a pp in preparation for testing in a larger efficacy trial among YMSM 
at risk for HIV acquisition. We will conduct this pi[INVESTIGATOR_740416], two metropolitan regions heavily impacted by [CONTACT_10840],[ADDRESS_1012199]  of DOT Diary on PrEP adherence as measured by [CONTACT_133764] -DP in

unable to comply with required study procedures after consultation with the Protocol 
Team. Participants also may be withdrawn if the study sponsor, government or 
regulator y authorities, or site IRBs/ECs terminate the study prior to its planned end date.  
Study staff will record the reason(s) for all withdrawals from the study in participants’ 
study records.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1012203]  of DOT diary on PrEP adherence among YMSM, 
and to assess the acceptability and ease of use of the DOT Diary app in this population 
over a 24 week  period. We will enroll up to 100 total participants (approximately 50 per 
city) who have not been on Pr EP in the last 4 months  (PrEP naïve participants are 
preferred) and are willing to initiate PrEP at the enrollment visit. Participants will be 
randomized 2:1 to receive (intervention arm) or not receive (control arm) the DOT Diary  
app at enrollment . Partic ipants will return for follow -up visits at 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks 
for safety assessments, pharmacologic measures of adherence (tenofovir diphosphate 
[TFV -DP] and emtricitabine triphosphate [FTC -TP]), study drug provision , and 
quantitative and qualitative acceptability assessments . 
 
5.2 DOT Diary app  
  
DOT Diary is a smartphone app designed to track participant adherence to oral PrEP 
use and sexual behaviors on a day -by-day basis. DOT Diary is built upon AiCure's 
HIPAA -compliant platform which uses artificial intelligence (computer vision and 
machine lea rning) to visually monitor adherence to treatment. Computer vision and 
neural networks confirm that the correct participant is presenting the correct medication 
and ingesting the medication. Real -time d ata (dosing data and patient reported 
outcomes) are tr ansmitted to a centralized, cloud -based, system for analysis and 
[ADDRESS_1012204]. 
Study personnel may switch on automated notifications (notifications are based on 
adherence thresholds). Stud y personnel receive weekly updates regarding participants. 
In addition to dosing data, the platform will automatically flag behavioral events for 
further review that may be indicative of a participant intentionally not taking the 
medication, or ‘feigning’ adherence. If deceptive behavior is confirmed by [CONTACT_740432], 
study personnel are notified. On the participant side, the aDOT  application is 
downloaded onto a smartphone and works via the front -facing camera. Dosing  data are 
encrypted and  stored, then transmitted to centralized servers ; all protected health 
information  (PHI) is encrypted and withheld from view on the dashboard.  
 
To facilitate participant tracking of sexual encounters, a sexual diary ha s been integrated 
with the AiCure aDOT system to create the DOT Diary app. The sexual diary allows 
participants to track sexual encounters, sexual behaviors that occurred in each 
encounter, and rating  characteristics of partners. Ratings characteristics are subjective 
items such as physical attributes, chemistry, personality, and overall; participants can 
rate each characteristic on a scale of 1 -5 stars. These are features that were  requested 
by [CONTACT_740433]. Partner -specific information (e.g. ratings) entered by 
[CONTACT_740434].  Participants are instruc ted to only use 
nicknames for their partners and to not include any protected health information 
identifiers, such as phone number, date of birth, address, email address, etc. There are 
no fields in the sexual diary to record th is type of identifier.  The app will provide a 
calendar displaying all days in which PrEP medication was taken, and all days in which 
sexual activity occurred, allowing participants to see coverage of sexual encounters with 
PrEP.  Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from  prior PrEP trials, the 
app will also indicate the estimated level of protection achieved from PrEP (e.g. none, 
low, medium high), and dosing needed to maximize protection . Participants will be 
provided information that these are estimates of protective le vels, and that protection 
from PrEP is not 100%.  Additionally, the app will provide summary data on doses taken , 
sex partners, and sexual activity in graphical form to promote participant insights and 
reflection about their pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -taking and sexual behaviors.  
 
Although the data entered into the sexual dia ry is being stored on servers through  
AiCure, partner -specific information is only being stored for participant data back -up 
purposes and will not be accessed or used by [CONTACT_740435]. Infor mation about 
sexual encounters (excluding partner nickname [CONTACT_740456]) will be used for the data 
visualization summaries described in the previous paragraph  as well as for data analysis 
by [CONTACT_3476] . 
 
5.3 Randomization  
Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the intervention (N= 67) or control  (N= 33) 
conditions, using randomly -permuted blocks of randomly selected size 3 and 6, stratified 
by [CONTACT_3725] (San Francisco, Atlanta). The randomization scheme will be generated and 
archived by [CONTACT_740436], and implemented in RedCap.  
 
5.4 Provision of PrEP  
 
Enrolled participants will be provided with PrEP in the form of daily oral FTC/TDF, 
dispensed in 30 -pi[INVESTIGATOR_182586]. Participants will be instructed to take one pi[INVESTIGATOR_740418] 
11 
 
DOT Diary Longitudinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_740410] 4.0, April 5, 2019  
 daily with or without food . The drug will be provided to ensure enough study drug until 
the next visit. A minimum of 2 bottles will be dispensed  at the enrollment visit, and 1-2 
bottles at follow -up visits  to ensure the participant has adequate supply until the next 
study visit , accounting for potential missed visits and rescheduling . If participants 
experience difficulties  in accessing PrEP  for use  after study  participation  due to 
insurance issues or lack of a health care provider willing to prescribe PrEP , PrEP 
medication may be provided to participants for an additional 3 months (3 bottles) to 
ensure continued access to PrEP  in the post -study period .  
 
5.[ADDRESS_1012205] Formulation, Content, and Storage  
 
FTC/TDF is a fixed dose combination tablet containing 200 mg of emtricitabine (FTC) 
and 300 mg of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in each tablet. FTC/TDF study tablets 
must be stored at 25°C, with excursions permitted to 15°C -30°C (59°F -86°F) (see USP 
Controlled Room Temperature). FTC/TDF tablets must be stored in the original 
container while at the site or site pharmacy . Each container is packaged with a child -
resistant screw cap and contains a silica gel to protect the product from humidity.  
 
FTC/TDF 200mg/300mg is available as Truvada®, a medication approved b y the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of HIV -1 infection and for PrEP to 
reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV -1 in adults at high risk. Further information on 
Truvada® is available in the current package insert, which is located a t http://rsc.tech -
res.com/safetyandpharmacovigilance . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1012206] Supply and Accountability  
 
Truvada® is manufactured and provided by [CONTACT_10869], Inc. Truvada® will be 
shipped directly to the site per the Site-Specific Protocol ( SSP). Sites will dispense study 
medication, either directly or through a site pharmacist, as described in their SSP.  
Proced ures for storage and destruction of unused study products are described in the 
SSP.  
 
5.7 Study procedures  
 
An overview of the study visit s and procedures schedule is presented in Table 1. 
Presented below is additional information on visit -specific study procedures.   At all visits, 
locator information will be confirmed, and participants will be provided risk reduction 
counseling, condoms, and  lubricant, and a stipend.  At all visits,  study staff will work with 
participants to establish continued access to PrEP after completion of the 24-week 
study ; PrEP will be provided to participants for the duration of the study . Beginning at the 
enrollment visit, study staff will assist participants with PrEP navigation services, 
including referrals to local PrEP providers/clinics and linkage to PrEP navigators who 
can help evaluate insurance eligibility, facilitate coverage for PrEP medication and 
services,  and assist with Truvada®  medication and co -pay assistance programs , with 
the goal of having participants establish a source for ongoing Truvada medication by [CONTACT_93500] .

algorithm  in SSP . Participants will complete a n online questionnaire via computer -assisted 
self-interview (CASI) that gathers data on baseline demographics, drug use and sexual 
behaviors, knowledge and use of PrEP, and experience usin g technology. Participants will 
also be provided risk reduction counseling, condoms, and lubricant. A study clinician will 
then perform a medical history  and limited physical exam  (this may be done at screening 
and updated at enrollment, based on site pref erence).   Study staff will confirm participant 
eligibility and enroll the participant into the study.  
Participants will then be randomized to receive the DOT Diary intervention immediately at 
enrollment (intervention  arm) or PrEP alone  (control arm) in a 2:1 ratio (see randomization 
procedures in Section 5.3). Participants who are randomized will be considered enrolled in 
the study. Participants in the intervention arm will be provided instructions to download the 
app on to their smartphone. Study st aff will demonstrate how to use the DOT Diary app, 
and participants will complete the tutorial in the app and demonstrate taking their first dose 
of TDF/FTC using the app. Participants will also select a daily dosing time, and the app will 
be programmed to  send the participant a daily text message or app notification at this time 
to take their pi[INVESTIGATOR_740419]. Participants will also set preferences regarding the 
sexual diary, including preferences regarding partner rating items.  Staff will instruct 
participants to not include any personally identifiable information about partners in the 
sexual diary, such as real names or contact [CONTACT_3031]. Staff will emphasize that partner 
nicknames should be used that help the participant identify the partner but ar e not easily 
identifiable to anyone else. For example, “ Bob” or “Leather pants guy.”  
 
All participants will be  dispensed 3 bottle s of TDF/FTC  (90 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) and provided t he PrEP 
Basics handout and adherence counseling regarding importance of daily adherence t o 
PrEP for maximal protection and strategies to integrate pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -taking into one's routine. The 
participant will be provided a stipend for completion of the enrollment visit.    
 
All participants will receive a phone call check -in one week after PrEP initiati on to inquire  
about any side effects or other problems experienced in  taking PrEP  and provide 
additional support, if appropriate . Staff will also ask all immediate intervention arm 
participants about any issues with using the DOT Diary app and provide ass istance as 
needed.  
 
[ADDRESS_1012209] blood tests for creatinine, and RPR, as well as urine an d oral and rectal swabs for 
GC/CT at the week [ADDRESS_1012210] positive for STIs will be offered 
or referred for treatment per local clinic protocol ; local guidelines for STI reporting will be 
followed . They will also complete a CAS I assessing sexual and drug use behavior, use of 
the various components of DOT Diary  and acceptability of the app  (if they used the app in 
the past 12 weeks) .  
 
At week 12, participants will be dispensed 3 bottles of TDF/FTC (90 pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]).  
 
At week 24, up to 24 participants (12 at each site) will complete an exit in -depth interview 
with a member of the DOT Diary team trained in qualitative methods. The purpose of this 
interview is to elicit feedback from the intervention arm on their experiences using the app,  
acceptability and ease of use, any technical difficulties encountered, and how the app 
could be further improved. Participants will also be asked whether they thought data in the 
app accurately represents their pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -taking and sexual behaviors, as well as  willingness to 
use the app in future studies of PrEP.  Participants in both arms will be asked about their 
experiences adhering to PrEP, and what might have been helpful in ongoing adherence. 
Participants will be selected for interviews using purposive sam pling based on level of 
engagement with the app, level of adherence as measured by [CONTACT_9426], and to achieve 
diversity based on sociodemographics (e.g. age, race/ethnicity)  and other characteristics . 
Interviews may also be conducted with control arm particip ants to learn what would have 
helped them in taking PrEP. Qualitative interviews may be conducted in -person or via 
video or phone to facilitate scheduling. All qualitative interviews will be audio -taped; 
portions or whole interviews may be transcribed if they are particularly informative.  
 
As this is the final  clinic  visit, the participant will be thanked for his participation, and a 
notation will be made on  whether he is interested in contact [CONTACT_92449].  If the 
participant has not yet established outside access to PrEP, study staff may dispense an 
additional 3 bottles of TDF/FTC to minimize gaps in PrEP coverage  while they assist the 
participant in s ecuring ongoing access to PrEP.

5.6.6  Microincentives  
Microincentives are increasingly being used to support users for their time and effort in  
using assistive applications in clinical trials and real -world settings.28 Participants in the 
intervention arm will be provided $0.50 each day the AiCure system  is used for dosing. As 
participants in the control condition will not be using the AiCure system, they will be asked 
to track the number of steps they take each day using a fitness app on their smartphone 
and will be provided $ 0.50 each day they send a screenshot from this ap p via text 
message to a secure research portal. Participants may also choose a different activity to 
track each day (e.g. number of hours they slept the night before) and text this information 
to the study team in the same manner. Intervention participants  will be reimbursed every 2 
weeks via an electronic payment system  linked to the DOT Diary app  (based on use of the 
app during that 2 week period)  or receive  a lump -sum payment at their next study visit.  
Control participants will receive a lump -sum payment  at their next study visit.  
 
5.6.7  Toxicity Management  
 
The site investigator has the discretion to hold TDF/FTC  at any time if s /he feels that 
continued medication use would be harmful to the participant or would interfere with 
treatment deemed clinically nece ssary according to the judgment of the investigator. 
Clinical or laboratory abnormalities that require follow -up will be documented and the 
clinical provider will contact [CONTACT_740437] -up an d/or 
repeat laboratory t esting.  All participants reporting an adverse event will be followed 
clinically until the occurrence resolves (returns to baseline grade, defined as grade at 
enrollment) or stabilizes, or until an effective referral to local health care providers is 
accomp lished.  
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_1012212] s at 
Screening are not eligible to participate in this study. Furthermore, at Screening and 
Enrollment, individuals with any signs or symptoms consistent with acute (pre -
seroconversion) HIV infection will not be enrolled. Participants who have any reactive  or 
positive HIV test result after enrollment will stop TDF/FTC PrEP and will be referred 
immediately for HIV primary care and treatment per local clinic guidelines.

5.6.9  Interim contacts and visits  
 
Interim contacts and visits (those between regularly schedu led follow up visits) may be 
performed at participant request or as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_740438]. All interim contacts and visits will be documented in a 
participant management system or participants’ study records and/or applicable Clinical 
Research Forms ( CRFs ).  
 
Some interim visits may occur for administrative reasons. For example, the participant 
may have questions for study staff or wish to provide new contact [CONTACT_3031]. Interim 
visits at which no data are collected are not documented on CRFs. Other interim co ntacts 
and visits may occur in response to Adverse Effects ( AEs) experienced by [CONTACT_103607], or loss of study medication. When interim contacts or visits are completed in 
response to participant reports of AEs, study staff will assess the reported e vent clinically  
and provide or refer the participant to appropriate medical care.  In the event of loss of 
study medication, additional TDF/FTC medication may be dispensed to the participant per 
the discretion of the site investigator, and the protocol te am will be notified of this 
occurrence.  If the participant’s device is no longer working (lost, broken) or the app is not 
supported by [CONTACT_2299]’s device , the study site may supply a provisioned device with 
the app pre-installed for the participant t o use for the remainder of the study.  
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_1012213] 
their safety or staff safety, and/or if participants are unable or unwilling to comply with 
study procedures. Participants also may be withdrawn if the study sponsors, government 
or regulatory authorities (including the OHRP and US FDA), or site IRB  terminate the 
study prior to its planned end date. Study staff will record the reason(s) for all withdrawals 
in participants’ study records. The week 24 visit procedures should be followed when 
possible, in the event that a participant chooses to withdraw  early from the study.  
 
5.6.11  Risks to participation  
 
Phlebotomy  
Venipuncture is sometimes associated with discomfort. Phlebotomy may lead to 
discomfort, dizziness, bruising, swelling, and rarely, an infection at the venipuncture site.  
 
HIV and STI Testing  
Examination and swabbing of the pharynx  and rectum can be associated with discomfort. 
Participants may become embarrassed, worried, or anxious when completing their HIV 
risk assessment and/or receiving HIV counseling. They also may bec ome worried or 
anxious while waiting for their HIV and STI test results. Individuals who learn that they 
have an STI or HIV infection may experience anxiety or depression related to their test 
results. Trained clinic staff will be available to help partici pants deal with these feelings.  
 
Sensitive Questions  
Participants will be asked questions about their sexual behavior that may make them feel 
uneasy. Participants do not have to answer any question that they do not want to and can 
[ADDRESS_1012214] participant privacy and confidentiality, 
it is possible that participants' involvement in the study could become known to others, and 
that social harms may result (e.g., because participants could become known as at "high 
risk" for HIV infection  or be thought to be HIV -positive ). For example, participants could be 
treated unfairly or discriminated against, or could have problems being accepted by [CONTACT_740439]. In addition, we are evaluating a mobile app that captures 
information about the participant’s dosing of PrEP and sexual encounters with partn ers. 
Multiple measures have been taken in the app to protect participant confidentiality, 
including password protection of the app, and blurring and encryption of images prior to 
electronic transmission. However there is the possibility that this informati on could become 
known to others. Study data will be stored using  password protected databases and 
double -locked cabinets will be used to store contact [CONTACT_740440], which will have 
participant identifying information.   
 
HIV Resistance  
It is possible that a participant who is taking PrEP and becomes infected with HIV during 
this study may develop viral resistance mutations to TDF/FTC. Multiple steps will be taken 
to minimize the risk of drug resistance. HIV testing will be performed at Screening and 
Enrollment, and then at every follow -up visit (every 6 weeks). Persons with acute viral 
syndromes that may reflect acute HIV infection will not be eligible for enrollment. If acute 
HIV infection is suspected after enrollment, the participant will undergo eva luation using 
tests described in the SSP Manual. These steps should minimize the risk of drug 
resistance occurrence by [CONTACT_740441][INVESTIGATOR_740420]/FTC. If any participant becomes HIV -infected during the study and develops  TDF or 
FTC resistance, an alternative treatment regimen could be used that is not impacted by 
[CONTACT_740442].  
 
TDF/FTC Side Effects.   
TDF/FTC is a FDA -approved drug licensed for the indication of  PrEP for HIV prevention. 
Risks and side effects related to TDF/FTC include the following:  
• Gastrointestinal intolerance (such as nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting)  
• Flatulence  
• Headache  
• Sleep disturbance  
• Rash  
• Redistribution/accumulation of body fat. This has been observed in HIV-infected patients 
receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. The mechanism and long -term 
consequences of these events are currently unknown. A causal relationship has not 
been established. These effects are not expected in this study involving a bri ef exposure 
to antiretroviral drug.  
 
Rare, but serious side effects include:  
• Lactic acidosis/severe hepatomegaly with steatosis  
• Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi’s syndrome (renal 
tubular injury with severe hypophosphatem ia) 
18 
 
DOT Diary Longitudinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_740410] 4.0, April 5, 2019  
 • Increase in bone metabolism leading to osteopenia or osteomalacia  
• Hypersensitivity reaction  
 
5.6.[ADDRESS_1012215] or future benefits  
 
As part of study participation, participants will be provided up to 9 months  of free TDF/FTC 
PrEP and assistance wi th PrEP navigation to establish ongoing PrEP access. There may 
be benefits for future PrEP trials or PrEP use, if information gained results in an improved 
aDOT app.

received  additional  training  about  maintaining  confidentiality.  
 
The AiCure  smart phone  app makes  a real-time determination  of whether  the participant  
has properly  administered  their medication,  providing  reminders  and encouraging  following  
proper  procedures  to ensure  medication  ingestion  as prescribed.  Study participants  will 
receive  a medication  reminder  at a time within  a predefined  window.  This notification  
reminds  participant s to take their medication  dose  while  using  the AiCure  smartphone  app.  
Participants  will follow  a series  of prescribed  steps  in front of the front-facing  webca m to 
visually  confirm  their ingestion  of the medication.  The application  on the smartphone  will 
make  an automated  determination  of whether  the patient  has properly  taken  their 
medication  at the prescribed  time.  There  is no need  for study  personnel  to revie w the 
administration,  nor would  study  personnel  need  to be available  at the time the participant  
takes  their medication.  The amount  of guidance  that the device  provides  to the participant  
is automatically  reduced  as the participant  becomes  more  proficient  at using  the 
application.   
Study  personnel  will have  access  to real-time data on a browser -based  dashboard.  Study  
personnel  may switch  on automated  notifications  (notifications  are based  on adherence  
thresholds)  and will receive  regular  participant  and site updates  (dosing  and intervention  
summaries , site performance  data,  and week  on week  adherence  rates) . In addition  to 
dosing  data,  the platform  will automatically  flag behavioral  events  for further  review  that 
may be indicative  of a participant  intentiona lly not taking  the medication,  or ‘feigning’  
adherence.  If deceptive  behavior  is confirmed  by [CONTACT_740443],  study  personnel  are 
notified.  Based  on the data,  study  staff will determine  whether  to follow  up with a 
participant  and select  a method  for interven tion. If the intervention  is conducted  via the 
browser -based  dashboard  (by [CONTACT_648],  SMS  text, or request  for in-clinic  visit),  the 
intervention  will be logged . Intervention  will consist  of non-judgmental  contact  [CONTACT_151525],  such  as asking  if they are having  trouble  using  the mobile  app or taking  their 
medication  as directed.  At the end of the study,  all raw data logged  on the AiCure  platform  
will be distributed  to study  personnel  for analysis.  
On the participant  side,  after dosing  is completed,  video  data are encrypted  and 
transmitted  to a secure  centralized  location  for further  analysis.  Once  received  at the 
19 
 
DOT Diary Longitudinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_740410] 4.0, April 5, 2019  
 centralized  location,  the data are then remov ed from the device  (store  and forward).  The 
captured  data and video  are reviewable  through  a roles  and rules  restricted  system  
ensuring  privacy  of the information , allowing  access  to the data by [CONTACT_740444].  Video  data captured  by [CONTACT_740445] .  Individuals  
outside  the clinical  sites will not know  the identity  of the study  participants  and will not 
have  access  to any medical  or health  records  of the patients.  Video  data will be destroyed  
on or before  January  1, 2021. The system  is compliant  with the Health  Insurance  
Portability  and Accountability  Act (HIPAA),  which  protects  the privacy  and security  of 
healthcare  information.  
Phone  numbers  of the participants  may also be collected  and stored  in an encrypted  
manner.  Storing  the phone  numbers  will allow  for direct  communication  with participants , 
including  automated  messaging  from the aDOT  platform  and contact  [CONTACT_740446].   At no time is the phone  number  visible  to study  personnel  
or monitoring  personnel.   Individuals  outside  the clinical  sites will not be provided  with 
participant  names,  nor will they be given  access  to participant  medical  records.  Phone  
numbers  will not be used  by [CONTACT_740447]-study  purpose.  
Partner  nicknames  and ratings  entered  in the sexual  diary  will be stored  secure  servers  for 
back -up purposes  only and will not be used  for any purpose,  including  research.  Clinical  
site staff will not have  access  to partner -specific  information  such  as nickname  [CONTACT_740457].

6.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
6.2.1  Primary Objective s 
The primary objectives of the study are:  
 
1. To assess the effect  of DOT Diary  on PrEP adherence as measured by [CONTACT_133764] -DP in 
DBS among young MSM initiating PrEP   
 
We will use GEE logistic models to estimate the average effect  of assignment to DOT 
Diary  on repeated TFV-DP levels ≥700 fmol/punch, which are consistent with taking 4 -
7 PrEP doses per week.  In exploratory analyses, we will examine whether the 
between -group difference increases over time. We will also use analogous GEE linear 
models to estimate the effects of D2 on log -transformed TFV -DP levels, as well as 
GEE proportional odds models for an ordinal outcome defined as  TFV-DP levels 
20 
 
DOT Diary Longitudinal Pi[INVESTIGATOR_740410] 4.0, April 5, 2019  
 consistent with <2, 2 -3, and 4 -7 doses per week, using cut -points determined by 
[CONTACT_740448] -observed dosing.29   
 
Minimum detectable effects (MD Es).  We used data from the EPIC study to estimate 
the baseline level and intraclass correlation (ICC) of the repeated binary measures of 
DBS TFV -DP levels ≥700 fmol/punch  as 60% and 0. 69 respectively, and retention of 
80% of participants at [ADDRESS_1012218] 80% power 
in 2-sided tests with a type -I error rate of 5% to detect average between -group 
differences in adherence of 23 percentage points.  
 
2. To evaluate the concordance of TFV -DP and FTC -TP in DBS with adherence 
measured by [CONTACT_740449] -based assessments of 
PrEP adherence by [CONTACT_740450] s: 
 
a. We will use a pharmacokinetic (PK) model with parameters estimated in the DOT -
DBS Study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) to calculat e the expected TFV -DP levels when each 
DBS is obtained, based on the aDOT -based pattern of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -taking over the previous 
[ADDRESS_1012219] 
each other, with a Lowess smooth.  As an additional measure of concordance, we 
will estimate the proportion of 90% prediction intervals obtained from the PK model 
that include the measured DBS TFV -DP levels.  
b. We will use aDOT records of  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]-taking over the previous 4 and 8 weeks to 
estimate the average number of PrEP doses per week taken by [CONTACT_20908], 
then estimate concordance of aDOT - and DBS -based indicators for protective 
dosing of 4 -7 doses/week, with 95% confidence intervals .  The DBS indicator will 
be defined by [CONTACT_133764] -DP levels ≥700 fmol/punch.  We will also assess concordance 
of aDOT - and DBS -based measures of <2, 2 -3, and 4 -7 doses per week , using the 
Kappa statistic.  
c. We will estimate concordance between an aDOT -based indica tor for any PrEP use 
over the previous 48 hours with an indicator for detection of FTC -TP in DBS, again 
with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
Margins of sampling error (MSEs) .  The expected sample of 240 DBS (an average of 
3.59 from each of 67 participants, acco unting for cumulative 20% loss to follow -up 
over 24 weeks) will allow us to estimate the concordance of paired binary measures 
within MSEs of 6.3-8.4 percentage points, depending on the sample concordance.  
MSEs for concordance of DOT results with detectio n of FTC -TP will be similar.  
 
3. To assess the acceptability and ease of use of D OT Diary  over a 24 week  period   
 
Acceptability and ease of use will be measured using the System Usability Scale 
(SUS) and Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ -8) adapted for use in the DOT 
Diary Longitudinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].30 Average values of our measures of acceptability and ease of 
use will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
[ADDRESS_1012220] deviations 
(SDs).  
 
6.2.2  Secondary Objectives  
 
The secondary objectives of the protocol are:  
 
1. To assess PrEP coverage of sexual acts (prevention -effectiveness adherence)  as 
measured by [CONTACT_740451], with sexual acts treated as trials, and coverage as success . Confidence 
intervals will be obtained using GEE binomial models, with r obust standard errors will 
be used to account for within -subject correlation as well as over -dispersion of the 
binomial outcome.   
 
MSEs.  We also used EPIC data to estimate the average number of condomless 
receptive sexual acts per participant as ~7 .  Under this assumption, we will be able 
to estimate coverage probabilities within MSEs  of 4 -10 percentage points, 
depending on cover age levels and the ICC of coverage across epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] . 
 
2. To evaluate the daily use of the DOT and diary component s of DOT Diary  through 24 
weeks of follow -up 
 
We will estimate the average use of DOT and the diary, as proportions of days and 
weeks on study, respectively.   
 
MSEs.  Proportions will be estimated within MSEs of 7 -12 percentage points, 
depending on the sample proportions.  
 
 
6.2.3  Qualitative Data analysis  
Recordings of the in -depth interviews (IDIs) will be analyzed  using MAXQDA  software  for 
qualitative analysis. The analysis  team will include members at both San Francisco and 
Atlanta study site, as well as a representative from A iCure.  Interviewers will co mplete a 
debrief report promptly following each interview to capture results relevant to the study 
objectives.  Debrief reports will also include an assessment of whether the interview merits  
additional in -depth analysis.  Debriefing reports have been shown  to be of sufficiently high 
quality to use as a primary source.[ADDRESS_1012221] a causal relationship 
with it. As such, an AE can be an unfavorable or unintended sign (inc luding an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
study product, whether or not considered related to the product.  
As daily oral FTC/TDF for PrEP is a licensed medication, we will focus assessm ent of AEs 
on the known toxicity profile of the medication, including creatinine elevations / decreases in 
creatinine clearance, bone fractures / toxicity, and symptoms associated with a start -up 
syndrome (e.g. diarrhea, nausea, headache, abdominal gas). A  targeted symptom review 
will be performed at each visit using a symptom checklist focused on symptoms associated 
with FTC/TDF. The severity of these symptoms will be graded according to the following 
scale in order to aid clinical management of symptoms.  
 
 
Abnormal creatinine values will be graded according to the following scale:  
 
 

[ADDRESS_1012222] the clinician to report any AEs as -needed. For 
life-threatening events, participants will also be instructed to seek immediate emergency 
care. At the time a laboratory AE requiring retesting or follow -up is identified, participants will 
be called back to the clinic if possible, and will be followed as deemed clinically appropriate. 
All participants reporting any AE assessed as  related to FTC/TDF  administration (see 
Section 7.3) will be followed clinically, until the AE resolves (returns to baseline) or 
stabilizes.   
 
7.3 Assignment of Relationship to FTC/TDF  
Relatedness is an assessment made by a study clinician of whether or not the event is 
related to the TDF/FTC administration. The relationship of all clinically relevant AEs to the 
FTC/TDF will be assessed per the clin ical judgment of the investigator based on the 
package insert.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1012223]. An adverse event is defined as being  unexpected  if the event exceeds the 
nature, se verity or frequency described in the current IRB Application including the protocol, 
consent form and  prescribing information .  
A serious adverse event (SAE) includes any AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
o Result in death  
o Are life -threatening AEs  
o Require inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o Result in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
An unexpected  AE also includes any AE that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Results in subject withdrawal from study participation,  
• Due to an overdose of study medication, or  
• Due to a deviation from the IRB approv ed study protocol  
 
In addition, all SAEs will be reported to the Protocol Team within [ADDRESS_1012224] participant privacy and 
confidentiality, it is  possible that participants' involvement in the study could become known 
to others, and that a negative social impact may result (e.g. participants could be perceived 
as being HIV -infected or at "high risk" for HIV infection). For example, participants cou ld be 
treated unfairly, or could have problems being accepted by [CONTACT_18115]/or 
communities. Negative social impacts from use of the app will also be monitored, such as 
unintended loss of privacy or confidentiality. A formal survey about positive an d negative 
social impacts will be administered at week 12 and 24; however, participants will be able to 
report negative social impacts at all regular visits . In the event that a participant reports a 
negative social impact, every effort will be made by [CONTACT_740452]

 and counseling to the participant as necessary, and/or referral to appropriate resources for 
the safety of the participant. Each site will provide such care and counseling in accordance 
with standardized guidance.  While maintaining  participant confidentiality, the study site may 
engage its Community Advisory Board (CAB) in exploring the social context surrounding 
instances of social impacts, to minimize the potential occurrence of such an impact.

• HIV tes ting  
• Serum creatinine for creatinine clearance  
• HBV testing (HBsAg)  
• Syphilis testing  
• Urine GC/CT testing  
• Oral and r ectal GC/CT testing  
 
US local laboratories must be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments (CLIA -certified).  Rapid HIV testing may be performed under a CLIA -waiver at 
the research clinic site.  
The study site will adhere to standards of Good Clinical Laboratory Practice (GCLP), and 
local standard operating procedures for specimen management incl uding proper collection, 
processing, labeling, transport, and temporary storage of specimens.  
 
8.2 Dried Blood Spots (DBS)  
Dried blood spot (DBS) specimens will be collected at the week 6, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_1012226] with 
contaminated needles, blood, and blood products, appropriate blood and secretion 
precautions will be employed by [CONTACT_43613][INVESTIGATOR_490951], as currently recommended by [CONTACT_740453] P revention  (CDC) . All infectious specimens will be 
transported in accordance with [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal R egulations (42 CFR 72).  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1012227] methods will be tailored accordingly. A participant’s involvement in this study will not 
be divulged without the subject’s written permission, except as necess ary for monitoring by

1 Introduction 
Increased visceral abdominal fat is associated with increased risk of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) 
and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Novel preliminary data gathered by [CONTACT_836439] a reflux independent influence of visceral abdominal fat on esophageal pro- inflammatory and pro -
neoplastic pathways, mediated via visceral fat produced saturated free fatty acids and activat ed 
macrophages. ω3 free fatty acids have been shown to inhibit epi[INVESTIGATOR_836414]2 production by [CONTACT_244399] -2 activity and modulating the macrophage phenotype from proinflammatory to 
anti-inflammatory. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_836415] ω3 free fatty acids to downregulate pro- neoplastic and pro -inflammatory 
pathways in the esophagus. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_836416] a larger adequately powered study assessing the role of  ω3 free fatty acids as chemoprevention agents in 
subjects with BE, who are at substantial risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_836417], a lethal cancer with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_836418].  
 This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
BE and visceral abdominal fat : Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is characterized by [CONTACT_836440] [ 1]. BE is the 
strongest risk factor and precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) a malignancy with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_836419]. In addition to reflux, increased abdominal visceral fat has been identified as an independent risk factor for BE and EAC [2, 3]. Abdominal fat is 
composed of visceral and subcutaneous fat. Visceral fat may predispose to BE by [CONTACT_836441]/or by [CONTACT_836442] [ 4]. We have found that increased 
visceral abdominal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) fat are independently associated with BE, esophageal inflammation and high grade dysplasia (HGD) [ 5]. Visceral fat is metabolically 
active, leading to a systemic inflammatory state and the metabolic syndrome.  We have also identified Metabolic syndrome as  a risk factor for BE, independent of reflux, in a population-
based case control study [6], further supporting a reflux independent pathway by [CONTACT_836443].   
Visceral fat, Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) and Macrophage mediated inflammation:  
Abdominal visceral fat releases proinflammatory cytokines and saturated FFAs which are known to induce a systemic inflammatory insulin resistant state: which is strongly associated with BE [ 7, 8]. FFAs
 
function as ligands modulating inflammatory responses, but with different effects. sFFAs exer t 
proinflammatory, while ω3 FFAs exert anti -
inflammatory effects [ 9-12] . sFFAs activate 
macrophages to a proinflammatory (M1) phenotype [13]. Preliminary data obtained by [CONTACT_836444]’s Esophagus by ω 3 Fatty Acids  
   
  
Page 6 of 28 
Prasad G. Iyer, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  to controls, as well as higher density of activated macrophages (M1 phenotype) and their 
products in BE biopsies compared to controls. M1 macrophage produced proinflammatory 
cytokines (such as TNF α, IL6, IL1 β) are known to be overexpressed in BE and are thought to 
contribute to malignant progression to EAC in BE [ 14-16]. 
 
Anti-inflammatory effects of ω3 FFA:  Increased intake of polyunsaturated FFAs and ω3 FFAs in 
particular, is associated with a 50% lower risk of BE [ 17].  ω3 FFAs have been shown to have 
anti-neoplastic activity in the colon. A major proposed mechanism by [CONTACT_9444] ω3 FFAs exert anti -
inflammatory and antineoplastic effect is by [CONTACT_836445], by 
[CONTACT_836446] -2 (instead of the ω6 FFA : Arachidonic acid), which 
leads to decreased PGE2  production, epi[INVESTIGATOR_836420]/aberrant crypt foci 
number in animal and human trials [ 9] [18-20] . We have shown in prior studies that increased 
levels of COX2 are seen with increasing grades of dysplasia in BE and that inhibition of COX -2 
activity leads to reduced EAC incidence in an animal model of BE, by [CONTACT_836447]2 production [ 21, 22]. ω3FFAs have also been shown to modulate macrophage phenotype from 
proinf lammatory (M1) to anti- inflammatory (M2). GPR120 has been identified as a likely 
ω3FFA receptor, mediating the anti -inflammatory and insulin sensitizing effects of ω3FFAs on 
macrophages and tissue [13]. Our novel central hypothesis is that oral supplementation with ω3 
FFAs in obese BE subjects will lead to downregulation of pro- neoplastic inflammatory pathways 
in BE by [CONTACT_836448] -
inflammatory. We propose to test this hypothesis by [CONTACT_348354], using a 
randomized controlled trial study design:  
Specific Aim 1: To estimate the magnitude and variation of changes in esophageal inflammation 
and injury in BE as measured by [CONTACT_836449]2 and the esophageal inflammation score, 
attributable to ω3 FFA supplementation. 
 
Specific Aim 2: To estimate the magnitude and variation of changes in esophageal macrophage 
infiltration and modulation of esophageal macrophage phenotype attributable to ω3 FFA supplementation.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  To estimate the magnitude and variation in changes in esophageal mucosal 
impedance attributable to  ω3 FFA supplementation. 
 
Specific Aim 4:  To define the baseline esophageal mucosal microbiome  and the potential 
change in the esophageal mucosal microbiome attributable to ω3 FFA supplementation. 
  
Significance and Innovation:  
The prevalence of BE has been estimated to be 1.6 -2.0% in the [LOCATION_002]. The incidence of 
EA has increased exponentially in the Western world in parallel with the prevalence of obesity, now estimated to affect > 30% of the US population. Radiofrequency ablation has emerged as an alternative modality to reduce the risk of progression to EAC in dysplastic BE, but is expensive, with potential endoscopic complications and a fairly high risk of recurrent  IM (30% 
at 2 years) following successful ablation. This study uses a safe compound ( ω3 FFA) based on a 
novel biologically plausible, mechanistic hypothesis and strong supportive preliminary data to

 attenuate and inhibit proinflammatory and pro-neoplastic pathways in subjects with BE who are 
at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_836417], a lethal malignancy with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_836421]. While 
used extensively in preclinical and clinical studies in the colon with encouraging results, there is no data on their ability to inhibit proinflammatory and neoplastic pathways in subjects with BE. If successful, this novel trial will lay the ground work for a larger adequately powered trial to 
demonstrate the use of ω3 FFA as a novel chemoprevention compound  in subjects with BE to 
decrease EAC incidence. While inhibition of proinflammatory pathways in BE is possible with 
NSAIDs (and Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]), their use is associated with adverse effects including cerebrovascular and 
gastrointestinal bleeds even at low doses. ω [ADDRESS_1161216] or alternative to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
in modulating esophageal inflammatio n and injury, particularly in those patients with an 
incomplete response to PPIs. This can provide a novel alternative to PPIs in the management of 
patients with obesity and reflux induced esophageal injury, which is a very prevalent problem in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
Preliminary data: 
1. Increased visceral and GE junction fat area are independently associated with BE, 
esophageal inflammation and HGD [5]. GE junction, visceral and subcutaneous (SQ) fat area 
were assessed in age and gender m atched [ADDRESS_1161217] scans. BE was 
strongly associated with visceral and GE junction fat area independent of BMI. There was no association with SQ fat area, suggesting a non -mechanical influence of visceral fat on BE 
pathogenesis. F urthermore, increased visceral fat area (but not SQ fat area) was also 
independently associated with severe esophageal inflammation and HGD, further suggesting a non- mechanical influence of visceral fat on esophageal inflammation and carcinogenesis.  
 2. Metabolic Syndrome is a risk factor for BE independent of reflux [6
]. We studied the 
association between BE and metabolic syndrome in a population based case control study: 309 subjects from Olmsted County, MN were studied (103 BE  cases, 103 reflux + controls and 
103 reflux - controls). 64% of cases, 49% of 
reflux + controls and 51% of reflux - controls 
had MetS.   MetS was associated with a 2 fold 
increased risk of BE with reflux (+) controls (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1, 3.6, p=0.04) and reflux ( –) 
controls (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1, 3.4 p=0.04) on multivariable regression analysis.  
 3. Centrally obese BE patients have higher serum sFFA levels and lower ω3 FFA levels than age, gender and BMI matched controls . Fasting serum from 10 controls without BE and 20 age 
and gender matched BE cases was analyzed for serum FFA profiles, using mass  spectroscopy. 
Patients with BE had higher saturated FFA and lower ω3 FFA levels than those without BE (figure 1).

Esophageal tissue PGE2 accurately reflects endoscopic and histologic esophageal injury. Tissue esophageal PGE2 levels were measured in bi opsies of 10 subjects with no symptoms of, 
endoscopic or histologic evidence of reflux and 10 subjects with esophagitis or BE. Levels in subjects with esophageal injury (mean 42 pg/mg) were significantly higher than those with no symptoms or signs of esophageal injury (mean 2 pg/mg), p=0.03. (Figure 2).  
 
6. BE patients have denser macrophage infiltration than controls. IHC for CD68 and HAM56 (macrophage markers) was 
performed on esophageal biopsies from 5 BE cases (without endoscopic evidence of esophagitis) and 5 controls.[ 24] Mean counts of CD68 positive cells in 
BE were higher compared to controls (p=0.06) (Figure 3).  7. Sub-characterization of macrophages in BE: Increased M1 like macrophages in BE. IHC using double labeling for CD68 
and CD206 was performed on esophageal biopsies from subjects with BE [ 24]. Cells 
double labeling for CD68 and CD206 are M2 like cells and those labeling for only CD68 are M1 like cells. M2 like macrophages constituted a minority  (30%)  
of all CD68 positive cells, indicating a preponderance of M1 like cells in BE tissue (Figure 4)

 8. M1 Macrop hage markers are more 
prevalent in BE compared to squamous 
tissue.  Esophageal biopsies were obtained 
from patients with and without BE on endoscopy and snap frozen at -80
0 C. 
RNA was extracted from these biopsies using the RNAase easy kit. qPCR was  performed for macrophage (CD68), M1 (MCP -1) and M2 (IL10, arginase) 
markers. Results show increased expression of CD68 RNA in BE tissue compared to that of normal
 squamous 
tissue (p=0.02). MCP1, a M1 macrophage marker was also greater in BE tissue than 
in squamous tissue (p=0.03) (figure 5).  9. Influence of saturated and ω3 FFA on macrophages in vitro. THP -
1 cell line, a human monocyte cell line was differentiated into macrophages using previously described methods [ 25]. 
Macrophages were treated with palmitic acid (PA), a saturated FA or docosahexanoic acid (DHA), a ω3 FFA, or both in combination. RNA was isolated using the RNAase easy kit (Qiagen). qPCR was then performed for macrophage (CD68), M1 (IL1β, MCP -1) and M2 (CD206, arginase)  
markers. Gene expression analysis was performed by [CONTACT_70849] ΔC
t for each target gene 
using β actin as the reference gene. As s een in the results from figure 6a and 6 b, exposure of 
macrophages to PA led to a proinflammatory response while administer ing DHA with PA lead to 
a substantial blunting of the proinflammatory response. Exposure to DHA led to the induction of M2 markers (CD206 and Arginase) in macrophages. 
            
Modulation of Esophageal Inflammation in Barrett’s Esophagus by ω [ADDRESS_1161219] found that exposure of 
macrophages to ω3FAs is able to blunt the  proinflammatory and neoplastic cascade induced by 
[CONTACT_836450] a M2 phenotype. These data help support and justify our hypothesis 
of Specific A ims 1 & 2 and their feasibility . 
2 Study Objectives

and injury in BE as measured by [CONTACT_836449]2 and the esophageal inflammation score,

3 Study Design 
3.1 General Design  
 In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_836422] ω3 free fatty acids to downregulate pro-neoplastic and pro-inflammatory pathways in the esophagus. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_836416] a larger adequately powered study assessing the role of ω3 free fatty acids as chemoprevention agents in subjects with BE, who are at substantial risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_836417], a lethal cancer with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_836418]. Our plan is to complete the study on 80 participants, 40 in each group randomized to omega-3 or placebo. Subjects between 18-85 years of age, with known BE (no dysplasia and low-grade dysplasia) will be identified using an existing GI database for participation in this study. Invitation letters will be mailed to eligible subjects. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be screened and consented. Once consent has been obtained baseline assessment and endoscopy with biopsy/brushings, and endoscopic mucosal impedance measurement will be completed. A single slice CT scan of the abdomen will also be obtained at 
baseline for each subject to quantify visceral and subcutaneous fat area in the abdomen.  Subjects 
will then begin treatment and follow-up for the next [ADDRESS_1161220]. Iyer - 80C freezer

Prasad G. Iyer, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  3.2 Study Endpoints  
The primary analysis objective in  this pi[INVESTIGATOR_836423]2 , the esophageal 
inflammation score, esophageal macrophage infiltration and modulation of esophageal macrophage phenotype attributable to ω3 FFA supplementation. This will be the information needed to design a larger adequately powered study to study the efficacy of w3FFA as a chemoprevention agent in BE.  Aim 1: The primary response outcome is tissue PGE2 levels and the main secondary response 
outcome is the histologic score of 3 or 4 (severe grades of inflammation). Other secondary outcomes  include pre and post supplementation serum and tissue ω3 FFA levels.  
 Aim 2: The primary response outcome is the cytokine expression profile in esophageal biopsies 
as measured by [CONTACT_62865] [IL1β , IL6 (M1 markers) versus IL1, IL10 (M2 markers)]. Secondary 
response outcomes  include change in esophageal macrophage counts and phenotype proportions 
(total, %M1, %M2).   Aim 3: The primary respons e outcome is change in esophageal mucosal impedance  (baseline-
post treatment) which is a physiologic correlate of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_81183], with ω3 FFA 
supplementation. Secondary outcomes include the association of esophageal mucosal impedance with measures of central obesity (waist circumference, waist hip ratio and abdominal visceral fat area on CT)  at baseline and following treatment.  
 Aim 4: The primary response outcome is the change in the esophageal microbiome in BE 
subjects following ω3 FFA supplementation. Secondary outcomes will be the association of the microbiome pattern with measures of central obesity ((waist circumference, waist hip ra tio and 
abdominal visceral fat area on CT).  
  Assays performed at baseline and at 6 months will include:  Aim 1:  Primary outcome: Tissue PGE2 in esophageal biopsies. This will be performed by 
[CONTACT_836451] [ 21] on esophageal biopsies snap frozen at -[ADDRESS_1161221].Buttar’s 
laboratory. 
 
Secondary outcomes: 1. Tissue inflammation score (grade 0- 3). This will be performed on 
esophageal H&E stained sections as previously described [ 5], by [INVESTIGATOR_124].Lewis, an experienced 
gastrointestinal pathologist. 2. Esophageal tissue EPA levels: this will be performed on esophageal biopsies obtained at baseline and at 6 months, in the Metabolomics Core labora tory. 
3. Serum ω3 FFA levels: will be performed using mass spectroscopy/liquid chromatography in the Immunochemistry Core laboratory at baseline and 6 months.   Aim 2:  Primary outcome: 1. Quantification of esophageal macrophage infiltration (and subtypes) 
by [CONTACT_836452]68 (macrophage marker) TNFά and MCP1 (M1 markers) and CD206,IL1, IL10, as M2 markers). This will be performed in collaboration with [CONTACT_836466] (see preliminary data 
and letter of support) using previously described standard methodology [ 29].

Prasad G. Iyer, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  Secondary outcomes : Esophageal macrophage counts (using CD68 and HAM 56 as markers) 
and proportion of M1 and M2 (CD206) using immunofluorescence  will be performed using previously described methods [ 24]. Cells double labeled for CD206 and CD68 will be 
categorized as M2 cells and those staining only with CD68 will be categori zed as M1 cells. Cell 
counts will be performed as previously described.  Aim 3: Esophageal mucosal impedance measurements will be obtained using a esophageal 
mucosal impedance catheter at [ADDRESS_1161222] one measurement will be obtained in the squamous mucosa at 3 cm above the BE segment [30].  Aim 4:  The esophageal microbiome will be characterized from biopsies and brushings from the squamous and columnar epi[INVESTIGATOR_836424].  
 Sequencing : Biopsy samples and brushings will be collected in cryo-vials and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All samples with be stored at - 80 till they are ready for processing.  
Next Generation sequencing:  Bacterial DNA will be enriched in biopsy and brushings using NEBNext microbiome D NA 
enrichment kit if concentrations are low. Amplicons spanning the variable region 4 (V4) of bacterial 16SrRNA will be generated using  a barcoded reverse primer (515F, 806R). Samples 
will sequenced using the MiSeq platform at Mayo Genome Facility to obtain 300bp paired end reads. Based on our previous experience we will sequence at most [ADDRESS_1161223] ~30,[ADDRESS_1161224] common side effects associated 
with their use in human trials include diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, fishy taste and belching. Total incidence of GI disturbances in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials has varied between 1.4 – 4.9%, with a very low rate of study termination [ 27]. The rate of study withdrawal was 3.4% in a phase 
3 study using EPA [ 20]. 
We will specifically assess the prevalence of adverse effects in subjects randomized to drug or placebo.  Adverse effects which have been reported in the literature, may include:  
1. Gastrointestinal adverse effects such as: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. 
2. Altered (fishy) taste in the mouth. The preparation used in this trial using orange oil to mask this effect.  
3. Allergic reactions.  
4. ω3 FFAs have antiplatelet activity, however increased rates of bleeding have not been 
seen in large clinical cardiovascular trials [ 28]. We will specifically assess rates of any 
mucosal or skin bleeds in monthly telephone calls (1,2,3,4,5 months) and at the [ADDRESS_1161225] Selection Enrollment and Withdrawal  
Male and female patients between 18 -85 years of age, with known BE (no dysplasia and low -

Prasad G. Iyer, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
Statistical Analysis  
Up to 90 patie nts with Barrett’s will be identified and randomized to either drug or placebo. The 
primary analysis objective in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_836430] a larger adequately powered study to study the efficacy of w3FFA as a chemoprevention agent in BE. The data will be summarized as mean, standard deviation, as well as median, and interquartile range, overall (baseline) and by [CONTACT_1570] (post -supplementation at 6 months). In addition, 95% confidence intervals for response 
mean (or median) treatment group values and 95% confidence intervals for treatment group differences in means (or medians) will also be calculated. Exploratory descriptive summaries of the response data will also be generated after s tratifying on ASA intake. 
 Aim 1: The primary response outcome is tissue PGE2 levels and the main secondary response outcome is the histologic score of 3 or 4 (severe grades of inflammation). Other secondary outcomes include pre and post supplementation serum and tissue ω3 FFA levels.   Aim 2: The primary response outcome is the Cytokine expression profile in esophageal biopsies 
as measured by [CONTACT_62865] [IL1 β, IL6 (M1 markers) versus IL1, IL10 (M2 markers)]. Secondary 
response outcomes include change in esophageal macrophage counts and phenotype proportions 
(total, %M1, %M2).   Aim 3: The  esophageal mucosal impedance of the squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_836431] (SD) or median (IQR) depending on data normality. The 
data will be summar ized ( baseline and post -supplementation ) by [CONTACT_1570]. Change in 
impedance (Baseline – post supplementation) will be compared using appropriate statistical tests.  
Secondary outcome analysis will include testing the association between esophageal mucosal impedance and measures of central obesity (including waist circumference, waist hip ratio and abdominal visceral fat area on CT scan).  
 Aim 4: We will align the paired end reads using PANDASeq given our small amplicon size (~392bp) which allows for significant overlap in the two reads. Data will be processed using QIIME1.8.0 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) analysis pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]. OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) will be determined at 97% sequence similarity using uclust, taxonomy will be ass igned 
using RDP classifier against the GreenGenes database, and a phylogenetic tree will be built using FastTree. The OTU table will be rarified at a single sequencing depth. We will compare alpha diversity using both phylogenetic (PD whole tree) and non-phylogenetic measures (Shannon, observed species and Chao1) to assess evenness and richness of distribution. We will compare beta diversity using both phylogenetic (UniFrac) and count based metrics (Bray- Curtis).    
 Statistical analysis of differences betw een groups and changes within the microbiome will be 
performed such as using PERMANOVA to compare beta diversity. Differences in individual taxa between groups will be assessed using ANOVA with correction for multiple hypotheses testing using FDR.  A p- value of <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Additional

Risk Monitoring/Risk Reduction: 
The risk of anaphylactic reactions will be reduced by [CONTACT_836458] a history of allergies to fish or shellfish. Participants will be instructed to immediately discontinue the study medication and contact [CONTACT_836459] (i.e., rash, swelling, itching, cramps, wheezing, upset stomach, loose stool, nasal congestion, fainting, dizziness). If the investigators suspect that such symptoms are due to the EPA/DHA, t he 
participant will be excluded from the study and referred to the appropriate health care provider. 
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. 
publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293129], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromis e the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "relate d" if it is possibly related to the research procedures. 
 Adverse Event  
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, 
biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
• persistent or significant birth defect/anomaly

may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.   
 
In case of a serious adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_836460].  All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non-serious adverse events .  
 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow-up period is defined as [ADDRESS_1161241] the study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and log.  The sponsor- investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary foll ow-up and 
reporting required. 
8.3.1  Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB  
All adverse events will be reported to the Mayo Clinic IRB. Serious adverse events are defined as:  
•  Death

Prasad G. Iyer, MD   CONFIDENTIAL  • Reports of serious adverse events that resulted in taking immediate action will be given 
first priority.  
• Reports of serious adverse events for which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_836436] 2nd priority. 
• All other reports will then be prioritized.  
 
The members will review SAE form and supporting materials. If additional information is necessary, the IRB will contact [CONTACT_978] (or study coordinator if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48106]) by [CONTACT_15498]. After review of the information, the IRB will make an initial determination of the seriousness of the event and determine what actions, if any will be required.  FDA regulations do not require non-serious adverse events (those that do not fall into the categories outlined in step 3 above) to be reported to the IRB. If non- serious adverse events are 
reported to the IRB, these reports will be signed by a member of the Subcommittee and returned to the investigator. The IRB w ill not retain a copy of these materials in the IRB office or files.  
 For serious adverse events that the IRB determines to be unrelated to the study drug/device/intervention, the original report and supporting materials will be kept in the IRB file. The I RB will review such reports, and if the IRB agrees with the determination that the event 
was unrelated to study drug/device/intervention, then a copy of the report will be returned to the PI. The IRB office will retain a list of the studies for which unrel ated serious adverse events are 
reported. Serious but unrelated adverse event reports will not be included in the minutes of the meeting.  
 For all serious adverse event reports that are determined by [CONTACT_836461], probably, or possibly related to the study drug/device/intervention, or if it is unknown what the relationship is at the present time, the IRB will review the reports and related materials and include in the minutes of the meeting. The IRB meeting minutes will be referred to the Full Board for final action. For these adverse events which are unexpected and require a change in the 
consent form, the Chair or a Vice-Chair will be the primary reviewer upon referral to the Full Board.  The convened IRB shall take whatever action(s) it deems appropriate. These actions may include but are not limited to: 
• modification of the protocol 
• modification of the consent form document 
• modification to the timetable for continuing review requirements, 
• suspension of new enrollment into the study 
• suspension of the study, or 
• termination of the study. 
Any studies that are suspended or terminated will be promptly reported to NIH that has provided funding for the study and/or to the FDA if the study involves an IND or an IDE.  All other events not requiring suspension or termination shall be reported to the FDA through the normal reporting channel (notification from the investigator to the sponsor to the FDA).

8.3.2  Sponsor -Investigator reporting: Notifying the FDA  
The sponsor-investigator will report to the FDA all unexpe cted, serious suspected adverse 
reactions according to the required IND Safety Reporting timelines, formats and requirements.  Unexpected fatal or life threatening suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between  the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be 
reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor- investigator’s initial receipt of the 
information about the event.  Other unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug/placebo and the adverse event, will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor- investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the 
event.  
 Any clinically important increase in the rate of serious suspected adverse reactions over those listed  in the protocol or product insert will be reported as a serious suspected adverse reaction.  
This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor- investigator’s initial receipt of the information about the ev ent. 
 Findings from other studies in human or animals that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug will be reported.  This will be reported to the FDA on FDA Form 3500A, no later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor- investigators initia l receipt of the information about 
the event.

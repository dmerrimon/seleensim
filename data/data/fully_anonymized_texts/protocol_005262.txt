Study Title:  
A prospective, Phase 3, randomized, multi -center, double -blind study of the efficacy, 
tolerability, and safety of oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid versus ora l ciprofloxacin for 
treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTI) in adult women. 
Study Number:  
IT001 -301 
Study Phase:  Phase 3  
Primary Objective (s):  
To compare the overall response  of oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid versus oral 
ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection  in adult women  at the 
primary time -point .  
Secondary Objective(s):   
a) To compare the overall response (clinical and microbiologic combined response) at other 
relevant time- points . 
b) To compare the microbiologic efficacy across treatment groups.  
c) To compare the clinical efficacy outcomes of oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid 
versus oral ciprofloxacin at other relevant time points  
d) To compare the safety profile of treatment with oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid 
versus oral ciprofloxacin for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection in adult 
women.   
e) To assess the population PK profile of oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid.  
Study Design :  
Sulopenem is an investigational thiopenem antibiotic being developed for treatment of uUTI,  
complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) , and complicated intra -abdominal infections (cIAI). 
Sulopenem etzadroxil is an oral pro- drug of sulopenem. Upon oral absorption, sulopenem 
etzadroxil  is expected to be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_259473], the active  moiety .   
Sulopenem possesses potent activity against species of the Enterobacteriaceae including those 
that encode Extended Spectrum Beta -lactamase ( ESBL ) or AmpC -type β -lactamases that confer 
resistance to third generation cephalosporins. Sulopenem etzadroxil is expected to be the first

in the outpatient setting  as well as intravenous ( IV) to oral switch therapy for early discharge of 
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259474] , complicated infections.  Probenecid, co -administered with the 
oral prodrug, in a bilayer tablet formulation, will reduce renal clearance and incr ease systemic 
exposure of the active moiety, sulopenem  (CP-70,429) .   
This prospective Phase 3 , randomized, multicenter, double -blind, controlled study compares oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid to oral ciprofloxacin for the treatment of patients with u UTI.  
Approximately 1,128 adult women with uUTI will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive 
either a bilayer tablet with  sulopenem etzadroxil 500 mg/probenecid 500 mg twice daily for 5 
days or oral ciprofloxacin 250 mg twice daily for 3 days.  
The prima ry outcome measure for efficacy evaluation will be the  overall  success (combined 
clinical  and microbiologic success) on Day 12 ( ± 1 day) .  
For the primary efficacy evaluation s, these percentages will be compared in two subsets  of the 
microbiologic -modified  intent to treat population (micro-MITT) : 1) where the baseline pathogen 
is determined to be susceptible (ciprofloxacin MIC ≤ 1 mg/L) to the comparator study drug, 
ciprofloxacin  (micro-MITTS population) , and 2) where the baseline pathog en is determined to 
be non- susceptible/resistant  (ciprofloxacin MIC ≥ 2 mg/L; includes strains with intermediate 
susceptibility and resistance to ciprofloxacin) to the comparator study drug, ciprofloxacin 
(micro -MITTR population). The micro-MITT  population will be comprised o f all randomized 
patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had ≥105 CFU/mL  of a baseline 
pathogen (Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus saprophyticus  only) isolated from a urine 
culture specimen taken at baseline, prior to initiation of st udy drug therapy.  
Study Population:  
A total of approximately 1,128 patients are planned . The sample size may be adjusted at the 
blinded interim analys es (one at 33% of planned sample size and the other at 66% of planned or 
original sample size) if the baseline assumptions for overall success rate , evaluability rate and 
susceptibility rate  are not met , which, specifically, are an  overall success rate of  79% , the 
proportion of ITT patients eligible to be included in the m icro-MITT population of  80% , and a 
susceptibility rate of 80% . The sample size may also be adjusted at an unblinded interim analysis 
(66% of randomized patients) based on the conditional power analysis in the micro- MITT R 
population.  
Patients will be randomized using an Interactive W eb Randomization System ( IWRS ) into the 
study, provided they have satisfied all patient selection criteria.

Statistical  Methods:  
Sample Size Considerations:   
The study is designed to determine whether oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid is non- inferior  
to oral ciprofloxacin for the outcome measure of overall success (combined clinical and 
microbiologic success) at Day 12 (± 1 day) in the micro- MITTS population and/or whether oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid is superior to oral ciprofloxacin for over all success at Day 12 
(± 1 day) in the micro- MITTR population. The primary outcome measure of overall success 
(combined clinical and microbiologic success) is defined as r esolution of the symptoms of uUTI 
present at trial entry with  no new symptoms, and the demonstration that the bacterial pathogen 
found at trial entry is reduced to < 103 CFU/mL on urine culture.  
The proposed sample size in the micro- MITT S population is 352 patients per arm (total sample 
size of 704 patients)  based on the method of Farrington and Manning. This assumes a non-
inferiority margin of 10%, a power of 90%, a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a  79% 
treatment success rate. With 99 patients per treatment group in the micro -MITTR population, 
there is 90% power t o show superiority given a 7 5% and 52% overall success rate in the 
sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. Assuming that 80% of 
the randomized patients will meet criteria for inclusion into the micro -MITT population ( 902 
patients) , the sample size for the ITT population is 1,128. 
Two blinded interim analyse s for sample size re -estimation , based on the pooled, blinded overall 
response as defined in the primary endpoint, will be conducted when 33% and 66% of the 
patients (approximately 372 and 745  patients , respectively ) have clinical and microbiologic 
response data available (see  Section 9.7) to assess overall su ccess and evaluability rates . As 
indicated in the draft FDA Guidance “Adaptive Design and Clinical Trials for Drugs and 
Biologics”, no statistical adjustment is required when a blinded analysis is completed of the 
overall event rate.  Thus, the one -sided a lpha level used for the sample size calculation is 0.025. 
The final sample size may be revised  based on the observed overall success rate , the evaluability 
rate (proportion of M ITT patients with a baseline pathogen)  and the proportion of the micro-
MITT population with a susceptible pathogen at the blinded interim analysis, to maintain a 
power of 90%. 
An additional unblinded interim analysis for sample size re -estimation based on conditional 
power will be conducted when 66% of patients have clinical and microbiologic response data 
available to assess overall success rates in the micro -MITTR population ( patients with a 
pathogen non- susceptible  to comparator agent, ciprofloxacin) . The alpha level does not need to 
be adjusted if the hypothesis test is not completed due to futility based on a conditional power of 
<40%.

Confidential  Page 8 of 71 General Statistical Considerations:    
Descriptive statistics, including the numbers and percentages for categorical variables, and the 
numbers, means, standard deviations, medians, minimums, and maximums for continuous 
variables will be provided. All comparisons will be for oral sulopenem etza droxil /probenecid 
versus oral ciprofloxacin . Exploratory analyses may also be performed.  Listings of individual 
patient’s data will be produced.  
A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to the interim analysis.  
Efficacy Ana lyses:    
The study is designed to determine whether oral sulopenem etzadroxi l/probenecid is NI to oral 
ciprofloxacin for the outcome measure of overall success (combined clinical and microbiologic 
success) at Day 12 (± 1 day) in the micro- MITTS population and/or whether oral sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid is superior to oral ciprofloxacin for overall success at Day 12 (± 1 day) in 
the micro -MITTR population.  
A patient will be defined as an overall success  if the following criteria are met: 
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic active against the urinary tract pathogen is given for other reasons, 
then the patient will be considered indeterminate  
• The patient has resolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new 
uUTI symptoms (based on the Patient Symptom Assessment Questionnaire)  
• Urine culture taken on Day 12 (± 1 day) demonstrates <103 CFU/mL of the baseline 
uropathogen  
All other patien ts will be considered as failures  unless data are unavailable to determine if the 
patient is a success  or a failure . In this case, the patient will be considered as having an 
indeterminate response. Patients with an indeterminate response are included in t he denominator 
for determination of the  overall  success rate.  
 
The number and percentage of patients with s uccess, failure  and indeterminate outcomes  will be 
determined in each treatment group in the micro- MITTS population and the micro- MITTR 
population. For each analysis population, the observed difference in the percentage of patients 
with success at Day 12 (± 1 day) (sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid group minus the 
ciprofloxacin group) will be determined and a two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 
observed difference will be computed using the method proposed without stratification by 
[CONTACT_240865].  
The framework for the statistical hypothesis testing of the primary efficacy outcome, overall 
success (combined clinical and microbiological success) at Day 12 (± 1 day), is defined below.  
The primary comparisons for regulatory approval are in two mutually exclusive populations 
defined by  a baseline characteristic: 1) the micro -MITTS population (the subset of the micro -
MITT population in which the baseline pathogen is determined to be susceptible to the 
comparator study drug, ciprofloxacin); and 2) the micro -MITTR population (the subset of  the 
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -301  March 2018 
Confidential  Page 9 of 71 micro -MITT population in which the baseline pathogen is determined to be non-susceptible  
{defined as MIC ≥2 mg/L ; includes pathogens with intermediate susceptibility [2 mg/L] and 
resistance [≥4 mg/L]}  to the comparator study drug, ciprofloxacin).  
• NI test of overall success  in the micro -MITTS population: the NI hypothesis test is a one -
sided hypothesis test performed at the 2.5% level of significance. If the lower limit of the 
95% CI for the difference in success rates in the micro -MITTS population is greater than   -
10% the NI of sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid to the ciprofloxacin group will be 
concluded.   
• Super iority test of overall success in the micro -MITTR population: the superiority 
hypothesis test is based on the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in 
success rates.  If the lower limit of the CI is greater than 0, sulopenem etzadroxil /probene cid 
will be considered superior to ciprofloxacin.  
If either NI is declared for the primary compari son in the micro -MITTS population or if 
superiority is established in the micro -MITTR population, then an NI test of overall success 
followed by a superiority test of overall success (if the null hypothesis is rejected for the NI test) 
in the micro -MITT population will be conducted. Whe n testing in a sequential manner with pre -
planned testing, no adjustment to the alpha level is required.  
 
The number an d percentage of patients with a microbiologic eradication, persistence, or 
persistence with increasing MIC at the Day 12 (±1 day) visit in each treatment group in the 
microbiologic evaluable (ME -Day 12) population will be determined. The observed difference 
in percentage of  patients with a microbiologic  eradication (sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid 
group minus the ciprofloxacin group) will be determined and a 2 -sided unstratified 95% CI for 
the observed difference will be computed using the method of Miettinen and Nurminen.  
 
Safety analyses will be conducted in the Safety population (all patients who received at least one 
dose of study drug)  and will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Safety will be assessed through 
summaries of AEs, laboratory evaluations, and vital signs.

1.1 Indication  
Sulopenem is being studied for the treatment of the following indications:  
 
- Uncomplicated urinary tract infections  
- Complicated urinary tract infections  
- Complicated intra -abdominal infections  
 
1.[ADDRESS_315422] 50  years has resulted in 
the development of microbial resistance to these agents among clinically important bacteria.   
This resistance commonly takes the form of β -lactamase production, expression of por ins in the 
bacterial outer membrane or alterations in penicillin -binding proteins (PBPs).  Such mechanisms 
have reduced the clinical utility of frequently prescribed β -lactams such as amoxicillin, 
amoxicillin plus clavulanate (a β -lactamase inhibitor), and  cephalosporins.  The issue of 
resistance continues to drive the search for new compounds with increased stability and efficacy 
against resistant pathogens.  
The prevalence of infections caused by [CONTACT_89927] -spectrum β -lactamase (ESBL) producing 
Enterobacteriaceae has been increasing worldwide and includes both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104511]. An analysis of data reported from 2011 to 2014 to the National 
Healthcare Safety Network performed by [CONTACT_259484] 2016 
revealed that the proportion of E.  coli resistant to extended -spectrum cephalosporins causing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired infection was 13.4% nationally, with rates as high as 24% reported in some 
Northeastern, Southern and Western states.  The same analysi s also demonstrated that over a 
third of E.  coli isolates in 2014 were resistant to quinolones. Data reported by [CONTACT_259485] (EARS -NET) in Europe demonstrate that the 
prevalence of quinolone resistant E. coli and E.  coli resistant to third -generation cephalosporins 
is > 25% and E.  coli resistant to third generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides and 
quinolones has increased to >10% in some southern and eastern European countries.  
Oral antibiotic treatment options are extremely limited for patients with these multi -drug 
resistant infections, resulting in lengthy hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259475], even for those with uncomplicated infections. The currently available oral anti biotics 
with activity against ESBL producing organisms include nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin, quinolones 
and trimethoprim -sulphamethoxazole. Nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin are only approved for the 
treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the [LOCATION_002], have rising rates of 
resistance and are associated with inferior efficacy  [Munoz -Davila 2014; Schito 2009] . 
Resistance to trimethoprim -sulphamethoxazole is uniformly above 20% in the US. Increasing 
prevalence of resistance to quinolones and the ir propensity to cause collateral damage resulted in 
relegation of quinolones to second- line therapy by [CONTACT_259486]-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -301  March 2018 
Confidential  Page 18 of 71 (IDSA) for uUTI  [Gupta 2011] . Even with these limitations, almost two -thirds of patients with a 
uUTI receive t herapy with a quinolone antibiotic. Efficacy outcomes for patients treated with 
quinolones for uUTI caused by [CONTACT_259487]- susceptible pathogens are not known. The 
currently proposed study will compare the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral sulopen em 
etzadroxil/ probenecid versus oral ciprofloxacin for the treatment of uncomplicated ur inary tract 
infection in women.  
Sulopenem (CP -70,429) is a broad- spectrum thiopenem β -lactam antibiotic which is being 
developed for the treatment of infections caused by [CONTACT_7163] -drug resistant bacteria. Sulopenem 
possesses potent activity against species of the Enterobacteriaceae that encode ESBLs or AmpC -
type β -lactamases that confe r resistance to third generation cephalosporins. The targeted gram -
negative spectrum of sulopenem is balanced by [CONTACT_259488], which is similar to that of imipenem.  
An in  vitro susceptibility study of sulopenem was conducted in April 2016 utilizing 
contemporary clinical bacterial isolates from patients in the [LOCATION_002] and Europe. Minimal 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sulopenem and [ADDRESS_315423] 
1,122 recent (2013- 2015) clinical  isolates following Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 
(CLSI) guidelines.   The study collection included 872 aerobes (811 gram -negative, 61 gram -
positive) and 250 anaerobes.  Isolates were chosen randomly from the IHMA (International 
Health Manage ment Associates, Inc., Schaumburg, IL) repository, which is a global collection of 
single patient clinical isolates.    For this study , the selection of isolates focused on  infection 
source (IAI and UTI) and region (US and Europe) for the inclusive years . Aerobes were tested 
by [CONTACT_104548]. Results from this study 
presented below demonstrate that sulopenem retains potent in vitro activity against common 
pathogens implicated in urinary tract infections and in tra-abdominal infections, including those 
that are caused by [CONTACT_104549] (data on file). Carbapenem resistant 
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were excluded from the analysis shown below, but the MIC 90 of 
Enterobacteriaceae remains at 0.25 µg/mL e ven if CRE are included, given that their overall 
prevalence is low (data on file) .

P. aeruginosa as can occur with imipenem and meropenem.  
Sulopenem (CP -70,429) is available as an intravenous formulation. Intravenous sulopenem was 
previously evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in Japan in approximately 1478 
subjects, at doses up to 1g BID administered intravenously over 3 -14 days in the early 1990s. 
Safety data collected from these trials regarding both adver se events as well as laboratory 
examinations provides support for the safety and tolerability of sulopenem in patients and its 
further development.   
Sulopenem etzadroxil, the oral pro- drug of sulopenem, has minimal in vitro  antibacterial 
activity.  Upon oral absorption, sulopenem etzadroxil  yields the active moiety sulopenem ( CP-
70,429)  in addition to the non- active moieties formate and 2- ethylbutyric acid (2 -EBA).   
Sulopenem etzadroxil  has been studied in single and multiple dose Phase 1 studies, with and 
without co -administration of probenecid. One small Phase 2 study in patients with community 
acquired pneumonia was conducted, in which 35 adult patients were randomized to one of three 
treatment groups to receive either: a single loading dose of intravenous (IV) sulopenem with 
switch to oral sulopenem etzadroxil , 4 dose minimum of IV sulopenem with switch to oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil , or ceftriaxone (IV) for a minimum of 2 doses, with step down to 
amoxicillin/clavulanate. The cure rates in the clinically evaluable subjects in this study at TOC 
were 90%, 88% and 63% in the single IV dose sulopenem, multiple IV dose sulopenem and 
ceftriaxone (IV) groups, respectively. While these efficacy results were not statistically 
significant due to the small numbers enr olled, they provide encouraging support for further 
clinical testing in this indication.  Phase [ADDRESS_315425] of care,

sulopenem will be compared to ciprofloxacin in patients with organis ms susceptible to 
ciprofloxacin, to provide a quantitative estimate of relative activity established by [CONTACT_105]- inferiority 
testing as well as in patients with organisms that are resistant to fluoroquinolones through 
superiority testing. Further analyses exami ning outcomes in the as randomized populations will 
attempt to define the relative activity of these two drugs without the benefit of culture results, the 
utility of which may be dependent on the actual findings in the different sub- populations.

[IP_ADDRESS] Sulopenem etzadroxil  (PF-03709270; oral prodrug)  
Pre-clinical data  
The non- clinical program to assess toxicity of sulopenem etzadroxil  consisted of acute oral and 
repeat -dose toxicity studies, safety pharmacology studies, genetic toxicity assessments, and 
reproductive development toxicity studies in rats and rabbits.  Following oral administration of 
sulopenem etzadroxil  in rats and monke ys, circulating concentrations of sulopenem etzadroxil  
were variable and minimal or below limits of quantitation, whereas significant levels of 
sulopenem and 2- EBA were present in whole blood. Effects observed in rats and monkeys 
from the repeat dose toxicology studies were generally consistent with those expected from the 
active moiety sulopenem. The No -Observed -Adverse --Effect- Level ( NOAEL ) in the rat is 100 
mg/kg with a C max of 1.90 µg/mL and AUC of 7.24 µg•h/mL for sulopenem, and the NOAEL 
in the monkey  is 50 mg/kg with a C max of 4.63 µg/mL and an AUC of 11.1 µg•h/mL for 
sulopenem, respectively. Sulopenem etzadroxil  was negative in mutagenicity and in vivo 
clastogenicity tests but positive for clastogenic activity in human lymphocytes. Sulopenem 
etzadrox il had no effects on male and female rat fertility and early embryonic development and 
was not teratogenic to rats or rabbits. Developmental toxicity was observed in both rats and 
rabbits with the NOAEL being 100 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, at doses w here maternal 
toxicity was also observed. 
Previous human experience   
The sulopenem etzadroxil  studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics, safety and 
tolerabi lity of single oral doses  ranging from [ADDRESS_315426] also been investigated.  
Single doses of sulopenem etzadroxil  of 400 mg, 600 mg, 1000 mg, and 2000 mg produced 
an approximately linear increase in sulopenem mean exposure. The apparent terminal half -life 
of sulopenem was generally dose independent and ranged from 0.76 hours to 1.10 hours.  
Mean time to observed maximum  concentration (T max) was on average 1 hour for all doses. 
Neither sulopenem etzadroxil  nor formic acid has been detected in either plasma or whole 
blood following dosing with sulopenem etzadroxil . In addition, the levels of 2 EBA were 
much lower (~1/20) t han sulopenem concentrations. During the administration of multiple 
doses of  sulopenem etzadroxil  for 10 days due to the short half -life of sulopenem etzadroxil  
there is no accumulation on Day 10 of dosing.  Sulopenem etzadroxil  doses of 2000 mg 
produced a  mean sulopenem C max of 4.7 µ g/mL and a mean AUC last of 13.1 h•µg/mL. 
Sulopenem systemic exposure parameters (C max and AUC last) following sulopenem etzadroxil  
single doses ranging from [ADDRESS_315427] of food (high fat meal) on the PK of sulopenem, given as 
sulopenem etzadroxil  orally. The mean AUC inf and C max increased 69% and 13.5% respectively, 
with a longer mean time above MIC of 1 µg/ mL (1.91 hours).  Mean t 1/2 was similar between 
the fed and fasted states (0.98- 1.14 hr).

of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine and feces (40.8 and 44.3% respectively). Total 
mean recovery of radioactivity ranged from 80.2 to 95%. 
 
Overall sulopenem etzadroxil  was well tolerated  in the P hase [ADDRESS_315428] common

incidence of loose stools/diarrhea was significantly lower in patients dosed with food.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sulopenem (CP -70,429; Intravenous)  
Preclinical data  
In non- clinical evaluations of intravenous administration of sulopenem , the NOAEL in the 
2-week toxicity study in rats was 200 mg/kg with extrapolated AUC (0-tlast) of 50 µ g•h/mL.  The 
NOAEL was based on increases in kidney and liver weights, erythema, and salivation at 
800 mg/kg.  
The NOAELs in the 4- week toxicity studies in rats and monkeys were both 60 mg/kg.  In rats, 
the NOAEL was based on a slight decrease in RBC parameters and increases in liver, kidney, 
and cecum weights  at ≥60 mg/kg.  In monkeys, the NOAEL was based on a decrease in RBC 
parameters and increased bilirubin at 200 mg/kg.  
The NOAELs in the 3- month studies were 120 mg/kg in the rat; AUC (0-tlast) of 29.2 ug•hr/mL 
(AUC (0-tlast) represents 0 -2 h), and 60 mg/kg in the monkey; AUC (0-tlast) of 49.2 ug•hr/mL; 
(AUC (0-tlast) represents 0 -8 h).  The NOAEL in rats was based on adverse effects on body weight 
and food consumption, and slight decreases in RBC parameters at 600 mg/kg.  The NOAEL in 
monkeys was based on a positive Direct Coombs test result, decreases in RBC parameters, 
increased bilirubin, moribundity in 2 animals, bone marrow hyperplasia, and soft stools at 
200 mg/kg.  
No change in heart rate or QTc was observed in a single -dose cardiovascular safety 
pharmac ology study in anesthetized dogs up to 300 mg/kg, yielding an average blood level of 
258 µ g/mL (total). Similarly, no change in heart rate or QTc was observed in the cardiovascular 
study in telemetry -implanted monkeys at 1000 mg/kg, yielding a blood concen tration of 
2270 µ g/mL (total).    
In a safety pharmacology study evaluating the effect on the hERG potassium channel, 
sulopenem  inhibited the hERG current by [CONTACT_3450] 50% at the maximum concentration of 
300 µ M (105 µ g/mL; free).  There were no changes  in action potential duration in the in vitro  
Purkinje fiber assay at concentrations up to 300 µ M (105 µ g/mL; free).   
Previou s human experience  
In healthy adults, intravenous sulopenem  doses up to 1000 mg BID were studied in 3 small 
Phase 1 studies (two in Japan and one in the US) [Foulds 1991] in the early 1990’s; sulopenem  
was well tolerated.  The mean C max and AUC inf were 61.5 µ g/mL and 51.9 µ g•h/mL, 
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -301  March 2018 
Confidential  Page 22 of 71 respectively for a single 1000 mg dose infused over 30 minutes in the Japanese study.  The mean 
Cmax and AUC inf were 69.8 µ g/mL and 54.1 µ g•h/mL, respectively, for a single 1000  mg dose 
infused ov er 10  minutes in the US study.  
Doses of 400 mg, 800 mg, 1600 mg, 2400 mg and 2800 mg of IV su lopenem  were evaluated in a 
single dose ascending study, and doses of 800 mg infused over 3 hours, 1200 mg infused over 1 
hour, 1200 mg infused over 2.5 hours, 1600 mg infused over 1.5 hours for 14 days and 2000 mg 
infused over 1.5 hours for 7 days were evaluated in a multiple dose study in healthy volunteers 
(8 subjects in each dose group). There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) in either 
study. One subject who received 1200 mg IV BID was discontinued on Day 4 from study drug 
therapy due to an adverse event (AE) of mildly increased troponin (0.107 ng/mL [normal limit 
<0.04 ng/mL]); the AE was reported to be resolved on Day 8. The most frequently reported AEs 
were gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting). Severe AEs included nausea and vomit ing, and 
were reported only in the highest dose groups (>2000 mg), indicating that MTD had been 
reached. All AEs in the lower dose groups (<2000 mg) were considered mild to moderate in 
severity. No clinical laboratory abnormalities occurred that were consi dered to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093]. There were no vital signs or ECG changes (including QTc 
interval changes) of clinical concern.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a dose proportional increase in C max and AUC last. The mean 
t ½ remained constant over the dose range. Following a 1 hour intravenous infusion, all doses 
higher than 400 mg produced mean concentrations above 1.0 μg/mL for > 3.3 hours, allowing 
for a twice daily dosing and potentially a single daily dose with a longer infusion duration.  
IV sulopenem  was also investigated in four Phase  2 clinical efficacy studies in Japan in the early 
1990s.  Fourteen hundred and seventy -eight  patients with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259476] 250 or 500 mg BID  dosing regimens of IV sulopenem  for

1.2.[ADDRESS_315429] 50 years has  
resulted in the development of microbial resis tance to these agents among clinically  
important bacteria. This resistance commonly takes the form of ß -lactamase production, 
development of porins  or alterations in penicillin -binding proteins (PBPs). Such mechanisms 
have reduced the clinical  utility of frequently prescribed ß -lactams such as amoxicillin, 
amoxicillin plus clavulanate  (a ß-lactamase inhibitor), and cephalosporins. The issue of 
resistance continues to drive the search for new compounds with increased stability and activity 
against resistant pathogens. Nowhere is the importance of resistance more evident than among 
agents of the ß -lactam  family.  
 
For Escherichia coli , ampi[INVESTIGATOR_104514] ≥50% in high- risk populations, and 
resistance to third generation cephalosporins is now being seen in certain areas. Only through the

Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -301  March 2018 
Confidential  Page 23 of 71 recognition of factors associated with increasing resistance and the  mechanisms responsible can 
strategies be designed for minimizing ß -lactam resistance. Quinolone resistance and resistance to 
trimethoprim -sulphamethoxazole among Escherichia coli  is now >  20% in the [LOCATION_002] 
(CDC summary data).  However, quinolones continue to be the most prescribed category of 
medicines used to treat uUTI in the US.   
 
As antibiotic resistance leads to increased costs of treatment, increased morbidity as well as  
increased mortality, there is an unmet urgent medical need for antimicrobial agents that can  be 
utilized in serious hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104515], especially agents that can be delivered 
orally. 
 
The penems are considered to exhibit advantages to the ß -lactam class as they possess good  
antibacterial activity against pneumococci and gram -negative pathogens commonly  
responsible for a wide range of community and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104516], and are stable to many  
ß-lactamases.  
 
Sulopenem has in vitro activity against many common hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104517], including  
extended spectrum ß -lactamase (ESBL) producing, and/or quinolone non- susceptible  gram -
negative pathogens (except  Pseudomonas spp., and some other non- lactose fermenting G ram 
negat ive rods ), and anaerobes.  
 
The current  study will compare oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid with oral ciprofloxacin for 
the treatment of patients with uUTI.  
 
Rationale for probenecid  
Probenecid is known to increase plasma levels of weak organic acids such as penicillins, 
cephalosporins, and other beta -lactam antibiotics, including penems, by [CONTACT_259489].   Probenecid has been used safely with other beta- lactam antibiotics, 
to either reduce dose or  dosing frequency of beta -lactams when used to treat infectious diseases 
in human beings.  
Probenecid has been shown in an animal dog model to increase the systemic exposure of a 
penem CP -65,207 ( sulopenem  is the S -isomer of CP -65,207) by [CONTACT_2902] 2- fold, suggesting a role 
of active renal tubular secretion in drug elimination. Findings from a previous clinical 
pharmacokinetic study indicate that renal clearance accounts for a significant proportion 
(approximately 50%) of total clearance of sulopenem  in healthy  volunteers suggesting that 
probenecid could increase exposure and thus time over MIC for sulopenem .    
In a previous Phase 1 study (A8811007), the use of [ADDRESS_315430] on the PK of sulopenem .  While the sulop enem AUC was significantly 
higher for the 1000 mg probenecid administration, the %T free >MIC was very similar, as 
anticipated, suggesting that the 500 mg of probenecid may provide sufficient extension of 
circulating sulopenem to achieve the PKPD objectives.  The combination of  oral sulopenem 
etzadrozil 500 mg and probenecid 500 mg was evaluated in a  recently completed  study, IT001 -
101. R esults from this study were consistent with those observed in previous studies.

Rationale for dosing with food  
In a multiple dose (A8811003) study, at higher doses of oral sulopenem etzadroxil , there was a 
higher rate of gastrointestinal symptoms especially diarrhea in a fasted state.  It has therefore 
been postulated that if the fraction of sulopenem etzadroxil  absorbed and bioavailability of 
sulopenem  (CP-70,429, the active moiety) can be increased, the gastrointestinal toleration and 
pharmacokinetics of the compound can be improved.  
In Study A8811008 there was an increase in relative bioavailability of sulopenem  when oral 
sulopenem etzadroxil  was administered in the fed state (~82% increase in mean AUC).   In Study 
IT001 -101, oral s ulopenem etzadroxil  was evaluated in a fasted and fed state at a dose of 500 mg 
BID. Results from this study indicate that food significantly increases bioavailability of 
sulopenem  and consequently results in decreased rates of diarrhea.  Therefore, dosing of oral 
sulopenem  etzadroxil with food is encouraged, but not required.  
1.2.3 Dose Rationale  
Sulopenem etzadroxil  
 
Doses of oral sulopenem etzadroxil  were chosen by [CONTACT_31577]/PD modeling using a combination of ( 1) 
modeling (Naïve Pool analysis) of the sulopenem effect on net change in colony forming units 
(CFU) over 24 hours of clinically relevant organisms in an immunocompetent mouse thigh 
infection model , (2) defining targets of percent time above the MIC (T>MIC) for sulopenem 
from this mouse model, and ( 3) population PK modeling using nonlinear mixed effects models , 
generated from  clinical data in  multiple oral sulopenem etzadroxil  Phase 1 studies in healthy 
volunteers.  
 
Monte Carlo simulations were perfo rmed using the human population PK parameters for 
sulopenem etzadroxil  and mean pharmacodynamic parameters from murine thigh infection 
model to determine % target achievement (TA) for the selected doses. A %TA of ≥90% was 
deemed desirable for selecting par ticular doses. The 500 mg dose of oral sulopenem etzadroxil  
co-administered with 500 mg of probenecid administered twice daily meets the criteria of 
%T>MIC for achieving 1 -log kill in bacteria.

The maximum total daily dose of probenecid will b e 1000 mg (500 mg BID) which is within the 
recommended dosage of [ADDRESS_315432] labels (USPI [INVESTIGATOR_2808]).

This is a randomized double -blind study comparing oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid with 
oral ciprofloxacin in the treatment of uUTI.  Approximately 1,128 patients will be randomized to 
receive either oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid twice daily for 5 days or oral ciprofloxacin 
twice daily for 3 days in a 1:[ADDRESS_315438] the IWRS  to obtain the 
study treatment assignment and dispense thera py accordingly. The IWRS will associate that 
patient with the next available treatment on the randomization schedule.  The IWRS will then 
give the investigative site information which corresponds to study medication that has been 
previously shipped to the site and is in the site’s inventory ready to be dispensed. A patient is 
considered randomized when the site personnel  receives the treatment assignment associated 
with the patient entered into the IWRS.

policy, and any special instructions provided by [CONTACT_104536].  Destruction must be 
adequately documented.  
 
5.4 Concomitant Medication(s), Adjunctive Therapy , and Non- drug 
Therapy  
5.4.1 Concomitant Medications  
Any medication taken by [CONTACT_259491] , other than study drug, is considered 
concomitant medication.  All concomitant medications from Baseline (Day  1) through the Final 
Visit must be recorded in the patient's source record and on the C ase R eport F orms (CRF) . 
At each visit, the investigator /site designee  will obtain information on any therapeutic 
interventions (e.g., drug and non- drug therapy, surgery, etc .) provided.  The use of any other 
investigational drug is prohibited and patients may not participate in any other  studies involving 
marketed products concomitantly while in this study.   
The use of other (non- antibacterial) medications should be limited to those essential for the care 
of the patient.  All medications required by [CONTACT_259492], and any 
drugs that may be required for emergency treatments , must be recorded on the CRF .  Of note, 
the use of medications to alleviate UTI symptoms (such as analgesics  [e.g., non- steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], paracetamol  etc.], phenazop yridine or cranberry products) is 
prohibited until the Day 12 (± 1 day ) visit.  
The bioavailability of ciprofloxacin is significantly reduced when co- administered with 
magnesium or aluminum containing antacids. As a result , co-administration of these antacids 
with study drug is not permitted.  
Dosing with food does not affect the overall absorption of ciprofloxacin.

7.1 Safety  
7.1.1 Physical Examination  
A targeted physical examination will be performed at Baseline (including general appearance, 
examination of heart, lungs, abdomen, and extremities) . A targeted physical exam may be 
conducted at any visit to address patient’s symptoms if needed. 
7.1.2 Vital Signs ( Temperature,  Blood Pressure, Pulse  Rate , Respi[INVESTIGATOR_259477])  
Vital signs are performed at Baseline, Day 5 ( ± 1 day) , Day 1 2 (± 1 day ), or premature

7.2 Efficacy  
7.2.1 Overall Response  
Overall  Response is assessed using the definitions listed below:  
 
A patient will be defined as a success  if the following criteria are met (programmatically, based 
on the data on the eCRF) : 
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic  active against the urinary tract pathogen is given for other  reasons, 
then the patient will be considered indeterminate  
• The patient has resolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new uUTI 
symptoms  (based on the Patient Symptom Assessment Questionnaire)  
• Urine culture taken on Day 12 ( ± 1 day) d emonstrates < 103 CFU /mL of the baseline 
uropathogen  (ie, microbiologic response of success [ eradication ]) 
All other patients will be considered as failures  unless data are unavailable to determine if 
the patient is a success or a failure . In this case, the patient will be considered as having an 
indeterminate response. Patients with an indeterminate response are included in the 
denominator for determination of the response rate.  
 
7.2.2 Microbiologic  
Microbiologic Response is assessed using the definitions  listed below:  
Microbiological 
response  Definition  
Success  The urine culture obtained at the Day 3 visit, Day 5 (± 1 day)  
visit, Day 12 (± 1 day ) or Day 28 (± 2 days ) visit demonstrate s 
<103 CFU/mL of the baseline uropathogen; also referred to as 
eradication.

Persistence  A uropathogen present at baseline  grew at ≥ 103 CFU/mL at the 
time-point of analysis, i.e. Day 3, Day 5 (± 1 day) , Day 12 (± 1 
day) or Day 28 (± 2 days ). 
Persistence with 
increasing MIC  A urine culture taken after at least 2 full days of treatment grew 
≥103 CFU/mL of the baseline  uropathogen and displayed ≥4- fold 
higher MIC to study drug received at Day 3, Day 5 (± 1 day) , 
Day 12 (± 1 day ) or Day 28 (± 2 days ), respectively.  
Indeterminate  Patient was lost to follow -up or an a ssessment was not 
undertaken such that no urine culture was obtained (or culture 
results could not be interpreted for any reason) at either the Day 
3, Day 5 (± 1 day) , Day 12 (± 1 day ) or Day 28 (± 2 days ) visit . 
 
7.2.3 Patient -Determined Clinical Response  
A patient will be defined as a clinical success if the following criteria are met (programmatically, 
based on the data on the eCRF) : 
• The patient is alive  
• The patient has received no rescue therapy for uUTI  
- If an antibiotic  active against the urinary tract pathogen is given for other reasons, 
then the patient will be considered indeterminate  
• The patient has resolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry and no new uUTI 
symptoms (based on the Patient Symptom Assess ment Questionnaire)  
 
All other patients will be considered as failures  unless data are unavailable to determine if the 
patient is a success  or a failure . In this case, the patient will be considered as having an 
indeterminate response. Patients with an ind eterminate response are included in the denominator 
for determination of the response rate.  
7.2.4 Investigator  Assessment of Clinical Response  
Investigators will use the definitions below to document clinical response at Day 5 ( ± 1 day) , 
Day 1 2 (± 1 day), Day 28  (± 2 days) , or premature discontinuation:

Death related to uUTI prior to Day 5, Day 1 2, or Day 28 , respectively  
Persistence or progression of any pre-therapy uUTI signs and symptoms or 
use of additional antibiotics for the current infection  
Patient p reviously  met criteria for failure  and received rescue antibiotics   
Indeterminate  Data not available for evaluation of efficacy for any reason, including  but not

determination of clinical response could not be made at either the Day 5, Day 
12 or Day 28 visit  
Death prior to Day 5, Day 1 2, or Day 28, respectively, where u UTI was clearly 
noncontributory  
 
7.2.5 Patient Symptom Assessment Questionnaire (PSAQ)  
Patients will score their UTI symptoms and record them on a Patient Symptom Assessment 
Questionnaire ( Appendix 4) . 
[ADDRESS_315447](s) will be reported as described in the following sections.  
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate informa tion both to determine the 
outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious AE  
(SAE) requiring immediate notification to Iterum Therapeutics designated pharmacovigilance 
provider .  For all AEs, sufficient inform ation should be obtained by [CONTACT_104570].  The investigator is required to assess causality.  All AEs will be 
followed -up by [CONTACT_104571] a level 
acceptable to the investigator, and Iterum concurs with that assessment.  
8.2 Reporting Period 
Adverse events will be collected from the time that the patient provides informed consent 
through the Day  28 (± 2 days) ( Final Visit) .  
For SAEs, the reporting period to Iterum Therapeutics  begins from the time that the patient 
provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, i.e., 
prior to undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, 
through the F inal Visit.   Any SAE occurring any time after the reporting period must be 
promptly reported if a causal relationship to investigational product is suspected.  
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -[ADDRESS_315448] or medical device , unless the event is captured in the study endpoint, as defined below ; 
the event need not  necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage.   
An event would be considered as adequately captured in the study endpoint if it is accurately and 
fully represented by a protocol -defined reason for clinical failure (other than mortality) or 
relapse.  Such an event should not be reported as an adverse event unless it is a serious adverse 
event as defined in this protocol.   
Events represented by [CONTACT_259494] , which would not be considered AEs, include  all of 
the following:  
• Symptoms of uUTI have not resolved from Baseline to such an extent that new antibiotics 
are needed for the infection under study 
• Development of new uUTI symptoms not present at Baseline  
• Follow up urine cultures do not reveal eradication of causative uropat hogen  
 
Except for circumstances as defined above, e xamples of AEs include but are not limited to:   
• Abnormal test findings (see  Section  8.4); 
• Clini cally significant symptoms and signs;  
• Changes in physical examination findings;  
• Hypersensitivity  to study drugs ; 
• Progression/worsening of underlying disease  (not UTI).  
 
Additionally, they may include the signs or symptoms resulting from:  
• Drug overdose;  
• Drug withdrawal;  
• Drug abuse;  
• Drug misuse;  
• Drug interactions;  
• Drug dependency;  
• Exposure during Pregnancy . 
 
8.[ADDRESS_315449] finding (e.g., an abnormal liver function test result) should be 
reported as an AE only if the follow ing conditions apply :  
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -301  March 2018 
Confidential  Page 41 of 71 • Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms  and/or signs, constituting a clinical 
syndrome (e.g., abnormal liver function test results, jaundice, and hepatic tenderness 
suggesting a diagnosis of hepatitis) , and/or  
• Test result requires  medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or withdrawal from the study, significant 
additional concomitant drug tre atment, or other therapy. 
 
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not define 
the abnormal objective test finding as  an AE.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be 
an error does not require reporting as an AE.  Additional dia gnostic testing and /or 
medical/surgical interventions that occur as a result of an adverse event due to an abnormal lab 
test finding should be noted in the CRF.  
8.5 Serious Adverse Events ( SAE) 
An SAE or serious adverse drug reaction is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is assessed as being a medically important event based on medical and scientific judgment.  
Such medically important events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsion s that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.6 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_259478].  Admission also includes transfer within the hosp ital to an acute/intensive care unit (e.g., 
from the psychiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, neurological 
floor to a tuberculosis unit).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:  
• Rehabilitation facilities; 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594] (e.g., caregiver relief);  
• Skilled nursing facilities;  
• Nursing homes;  
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -301  March 2018 
Confidential  Page 42 of 71 • Routine emergency room evaluation ; 
• Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures).  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE is 
not in itself an SAE.  Examples include:  
• Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a 
new AE or with a wors ening of the preexisting condition (e.g., for work- up of persistent pre -
treatment lab oratory  abnormality);  
• Social admission (e.g., patient has no place to sleep);  
• Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam);  
• Protocol -specified admission during a study (e.g., for a procedure required by [CONTACT_17143]);  
• Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_4596] (e.g., for elective cosmetic 
surgery).  Pre -planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the baseline 
docum entation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;  
• Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. 
 
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be 
reported as an AE.  However , the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting 
appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 
8.7 Severity Assessment  
The investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the 
maximum intensity of the AE.  For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as 
follows:  
• MILD:  Does not interfere with the patient's usual function.  
• MODERATE :  Interferes to some extent with the patient's usual function.  
• SEVERE :  Interferes significantly with the patient's usual function.   
 
Note the distinction between the severity and the serio usness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily a serious event.  For example, a headache may be severe (interferes 
significantly with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for ser ious adverse events, listed above.  
 
8.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-
serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, and 
report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting requirements if 
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -301  March 2018 
Confidential  Page 43 of 71 applicable.  An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a 
reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not investigational product caused the event, then the 
event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined 
by [CONTACT_1034] (see Section  8.12 on Reporting Requirements ).  If the investigator's causality 
assessment is "unknown but not related to investigational product", this should be clearly 
documented on study records.  Specifically, the investigator will choose whether the AE is 
unrelated, unlikely related, possibly related or probably related to the investigational product.  
In addition, if the investigator determines an SAE is associated with study procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and r eport such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, 
if applicable. 
The Investigator will assess causal ity of the event in relation to study drugs  based on the 
following defined criteria:  
• UNRELATED: No relationship between the event  and medicinal product  
• UNLIKELY:  Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake that makes a 
relationship im probable (but not impossible); Disease or other drugs provide plausible 
explanations  
• POSSIBLY : Event or laboratory test abnormalit y, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake; Could also be explained by [CONTACT_19699]; Information on drug withdrawal 
may be lacking or unclear  
• PROBABLY : Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intak e; Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs; Response to withdrawal clinically 
reasonable; Rechallenge not required  
 
8.9 Exposure during Pregnancy  
For investigational products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (also 
referred to  as exposure in -utero [EIU]) occurs if: 
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been directly 
exposed to (e.g., environmental exposure) the investigational product, or the female 
becomes, or is found to be, pregnant a fter discontinuing and/or being directly exposed to the 
investigational product (maternal exposure);  
2. A male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environmental exposure, to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of his partner’s conception and/or is 
exposed during his partner’s pregnancy (paternal exposure).  
 
If any study patient or study patient’s partner becomes  or is found to be pregnant during the 
study patient’s treatment with the investigational product,  no further study drugs  should be given 
and the investigator must submit this information to Iterum Therapeutics  on a Pregnancy Form.   
 
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -[ADDRESS_315450] be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hour s of 
awareness of the pregnancy.  The information sub mitted should include the anticipated date of 
delivery (see below for information related to induced termination of pregnancy).  
 
Follow -up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Pregnancy  reports with 
an unknown outcome.  The investiga tor will follow the pregnancy until completion or until 
pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then notify Iterum  of the outcome.  The 
investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial Pregnancy  Form.  The 
reason(s) for a n induced abortion should be specified.  A  Pregnancy report is not created when 
an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable.  Rather, an 
SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy.  
If the outcome of the p regnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an 
aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs.  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth 
(i.e., no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal infant is required before a 
Pregnancy  Form can be completed).  The “normalit y” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by 
[CONTACT_4692], unless pre -abortion test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classified as SAEs follows:  
• “Spontaneous abortion” includ es miscarriage and missed abortion.  
• All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_315451] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the investigator  assesses 
as possibly related to the exposure during pregnancy to the investigational medication should 
be reported.  
 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy may be requested by [CONTACT_1275].  Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis 
(e.g., follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delays).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator must obtain permission from the patient’s partner in order to conduct 
any follow -up or collect any information.  
8.10 Discontinuation  from S tudy Drug Due to AEs (See also Patient 
Withdrawal , Section 6.5) 
Discontinuation from study drug due to an AE should be distinguished from discontinuation due 
to insufficient response, according to the definition of AE noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate AE CRF page.   
When a patient discontinues study drug due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance 
with the reporting requirements defi ned below.  
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -[ADDRESS_315452] possibly related to study drug, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.  
8.12.1 SAE Reporting Requirements  
If an SAE or exposure during pregnancy occurs, Iterum Therapeutics  (Iterum ’s PV Service 
provider ) is to be notified within [ADDRESS_315453] 
be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event  information.  This timeframe 
also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow -up reporting of Pregnancy cases.   
In the rare instance that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately (e.g., if an outpatient study patient init ially seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within 24 hour s after learning of it and document the time of 
his/her first awareness of the AE.  
For all SAEs and  pregnancies , the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide inf ormation to 
Iterum in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_104573] -up 
information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be more detailed than that captured 
on the SAE form .  In general, this information may include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], 
laboratory test and X -ray results .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as 
concomitant medications and illnesses mus t be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Iterum 
Therapeutics .  The information should be reported on an SAE/ Pregnancy form and sent to the 
Iterum PV Service Provider.  
8.12.2 Non-SAE Reporting Requirements  
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  Please note that while all AEs are 
reported on the AE page of the CRF, there is an additional form used for collection of SAE 
information, as described in Section  8.12.1, which is not the same as the AE CRF.  Whe n the 
same data are collected, the two forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, 
the same AE te rm should be used on both forms.  A dverse events  should be reported using 
concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE 
information.   The information on the AE CRF and the SAE form must be the same and will be 
reconci led at defined periods throughout the study to ensure that they do.

9 DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS  
9.1 Sample Size Determination  
The study is designed to determine whether oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid is NI to oral 
ciprofloxacin for the outcome measure of overall success (combined clinical and microbiologic 
success) at Day 12 (± 1 day) in the micro- MITTS population and/or whether oral sulopenem 
etzadroxil/probenecid is superior to oral ciprofloxacin for overall success at Day 12 (± 1 day) in 
the micro -MITTR population. The outcome measure of overall success ( combined clinical  and 
microbiologic success) , is defined as r esolution of the symptoms of uUTI present at trial entry 
(and no new symptoms), and the demonstration that the bacterial pathogen found at trial entry is 
reduced to < 103 CFU/mL on urine culture (microbiological success [ eradication ]). 
The pr oposed sample size  in the micro -MITT S population is 352 patients per arm  (total of 704 
patients)  based on the method of Farrington and Manning. This assumes a non- inferiority margin 
of 10%, a power of 90%, a one -sided alpha level of 0.025 and a 79%  treatment success rate.  
With 99 patie nts per treatment group in the micro -MITTR population, there is 90% power to 
show superiority given a 75% and 52% overall success rate in the sulopenem 
etzadroxil/probenecid and ciprofloxacin groups, respectively. Assuming th at 80% of the 
randomized patients will meet criteria for inclusion into the micro- MITT population (902 
patients),  the sample size for the ITT population is 1,128. 
The expected treatment success rate  is estimated from 2 large randomized controlled trials of 
quinolones in a similar patient population. In those studies, the estimated success rate for the 
proposed primary efficacy outcome measure of combined clinical and microbiologic success 
around Day 7 in the m icro-MITT population was 88%. This was further corroborated by 
[CONTACT_259495] a review of the summary basis of approval documents for ciprofloxacin XR and 
levofloxacin for the indication of uUTI , where the estimated number of patients with combined 
clinical and micro biologic cure rates in the microbiologically evaluable populations were noted 
to be between 88.4% and 92%. The overall success rate in uUTI studies that utilized complete 
resolution of uUTI symptoms to define clinical success was 80%. However, these studie s 
defined microbiologic eradication as a follow up culture that yielded <104 CFU/mL of the 
baseline pathogen. The overall point estimate could be reduced by [CONTACT_2902] 1% point if the 
definition of microbiologic eradication requires a follow up culture that yie lds <103 CFU/mL 
of the baseline pathogen, thus bringing the expected overall success rate in the subset of micro-
MITTS population to 79%. 
 
There are no recent studies in patients with uUTI caused by [CONTACT_259496].  With 99 patients per treatment 
group in the  micro -MITTR population, there is  90% power to show superiority given a 75% 
and 52% overall success rate in the sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid and ciprofloxacin groups,

The primary populations  for this study  are: the micro-MITTS  population, defined as all 
randomized patients with a positive baseline  urine culture defined as ≥105 CFU/mL of a 
uropathogen  (and no more than 2 species of microorganisms ), with a pathogen  susceptible 
(ciprofloxacin MIC ≤1 mg/L) to the comparator study drug, ciprofloxacin;  and the micro -
MITTR population defined as all randomized patients with a positive baseline urine culture 
defined as ≥105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen ( and no more th an 2 species of microorganisms ), 
with a pathogen non- susceptible  (ciprofloxacin MIC ≥2 mg/L; includes strains with 
intermediate susceptibility and resistance to ciprofloxacin) to the comparator study drug, 
ciprofloxacin .  
 
A review of the literature showed that only approximately 60% of symptomatic uUTI patients 
will have ≥105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen. Thus, in order to optimize the enrollment of patients 
with ≥105 CFU/mL of a uropathogen , the inclusion criteria were designed to require a urine 
dipstick anal ysis to be positive for nitrite in addition to having evidence of pyuria , as this has 
been shown to increase the sensitivity and specificity of enrolling patients  with  ≥105 CFU/mL 
of a uropathogen to 84% and 98% respectively [Semeniuk 1999] .   
 
Two blinded interim analyse s for sample size re -estimation  and one unblinded interim analysis 
for sample size re -estimation are planned (See Section 9.7).

variables will be provided. All comparisons will be for the sulopenem etzad roxil /probenecid 
treatment group and the ciprofloxacin treatment group. Exploratory analyses may also be 
performed. Listings of individual patient’s data will be produced. A comprehensive SAP will be 
finalized prior to the first interim analysis.  
 
9.4 Patient Characteristics  
Enrollment, protocol deviations, discontinuations from the study drug and withdrawal from the 
study will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Demographics (age, race, sex), medical and 
surgi cal history , baseline assessment of the symptoms of uUTI , microbiological assessment of 
the urine , and study drug administration will also be summarized.  Differences between 
treatment groups will be analyzed using the chi -square or Fisher’s exact test for dichotomous 
variables and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum tes t for ordinal variables and continuous variables.   
 
9.5 Efficacy Analysis  
For all efficacy analyses, patient data will be analyzed in the treatment group to which the 
patient was randomized.  Unless otherwise stated, for the ITT analyses,  patients who were 
randomized to the wrong geographic region strata will be analyzed in the stratum to which they 
were randomized.  
9.5.1 Analysis of Primary Outcome Measure  
The primary efficacy outcome is overall success (combined clinical and microbiologic success) 
at Day 12 ( ± 1 day) in the micro -MITTS and micro -MITTR populations .  
Patients will be programmatically categorized as a success, failure , or indeterminate based on 
data in the eCRF and from the microbiology lab.  Patients with missing data or who are lost to 
follow -up are defined as indet erminate for the primary analyse s and are included in the 
denominator for the calculation of the success rate. The number and percentage of patients with 
success, failure  and indeterminate  response  will be determined in each treatment g roup in the 
micro -MITTS and micro -MITTR populations .  
The primary comparisons for regulatory approval are in two mutually exclusive populations 
defined by a baseline characteristic:  
1) the micro -MITTS population (the subset of the micro -MITT population in which the baseline 
pathogen is determined to be susceptible to the comparator study drug, ciprofloxacin).  For this 
population, a NI test of the overall success rate will be conducted.  The null and alternative 
hypotheses are the following:  
∆−≤−2 1 0: pp H  and ∆−>−2 1: pp HA ,

Confidential  Page 50 of 71 where p 1 is the primary efficacy outcome rate in the sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid group, p 2 
is the primary efficacy outcome rate in the ciprofloxacin group, and Δ is the non- inferiority 
margin of 10 %. 
The NI hypothesis test is a [ADDRESS_315455] performed at the 2.5% level of significance.  
This is based on the lower limit of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the observed difference in the overall 
success rate (sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid group minus ci profloxacin group).  The primary 
analysis is based on the CI computed using the method proposed without stratification by 
[CONTACT_240865], which corresponds to the p- value approach of the Farrington -Manning 
test.  If the lower limit of the 95% CI fo r difference in success rates in the micro -MITTS 
population is greater than - 10%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the NI of sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid to ciprofloxacin will be concluded.  
 2) the micro -MITTR population (the subset of the micro- MITT population in which the baseline 
pathogen is determined to be non- susceptible  to the comparator study drug, ciprofloxacin ). For 
this population, a superiority test will be conducted.  The null and alternative hypotheses are as 
follows:  
2 1 0: p pH= and 2 1: p p HA≠ 
A 2-sided 95%  for the o bserved treatment difference in success rates will be determined using 
the method without stratification of Miettinen and Nurminen.  If the lower bound of the 95% CI 
is greater than 0%, the null hy pothesis will be rejected and superiority of sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid to ciprofloxacin will be concluded.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Hypothesis Testing of the Primary Outcome Measure 
Additional hypothesis testing of the primary efficacy outcome will be conducted following the 
framework detailed below.  
1) To control for inflation of the  overall type I error rate, the hierarchical testing procedure 
of Westfall and Krishen (Westfall 2001) w ill be used to continue testing hypotheses of 
the primary efficacy outcome.  If NI or superiority is declared fo r the primary 
comparisons, the secondary comparisons will be statistically tested in the order presented 
below.  Testing will proceed to the next comparison, only in the case where the null 
hypothesis in the previous comparison was rejected. When testing in a sequential manner 
with pre -planned testing, no adjustment to the alpha level is required. NI test of overall 
success, ∆−≤−2 1 01: pp H  and ∆−>−2 1 1: pp HA , in the micro -MITT population. The 
number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group with an overall response of 
success, failure , and indeterminate will be provided for the micro- MITT population. A 2-
sided 95% CI for th e observed treatment difference in success rates will be determined. If 
the lower bound of the 95% CI is greater than - 10%, the null hypothesis will be rejected 
and the NI of sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid to ciprofloxacin in the micro -MITT 
population wil l be concluded.

greater than 0%, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the superiority of sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid to ciprofloxacin in the micro -MITT population will be concluded. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Outcome 
The primary efficacy outcome will also be assessed within each geo graphic region stratum by 
[CONTACT_1570]. For each geographic region stratum, a 2- sided 95% CI for the observed 
difference in the overall success rates in the micro -MITTS and the micro -MITTR populations  
will be calculated.  
 
Sensitivity analyses of the pri mary outcome will also be conducted in the micro- MITTS and 
micro -MITTR populations. An adjusted analysis (95% CI will be adjusted for the geographic 
region using the stratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen) will be provided for the 
difference in the ov erall success rate between the two treatment  groups . Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel weights will be used for the stratum weights in the calculation of the CI. An analysis 
will consider all patients who have missing data for the primary outcome (ie, an indetermina te 
response) as successes .  A 2- sided 95% unstratified CI will be computed for the difference in the 
success rates between the treatment groups.  A sensitivity analysis applying multiple imputation 
methods for missing data will also be conducted.  
 
A sub- group analysis of the primary efficacy outcome in those patients with and without 
hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <2.5 g/dL) at baseline will be conducted. Additional sub-
group analyses, such as the effect of food, may be conducted as exploratory analys es. 
 
9.5.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Outcome Measure 
The number and percentage of patients with a microbiologic response of success ( eradication ) or 
failure ( persistence or  persistence with increasing MIC ), at the Day 1 2 (± 1 day) visit will be 
determined in each treatment group in the ME -Day 12  population. The observed difference in 
percentage of patients with microbiologic success ( eradication ) (sulopenem 
etzadroxil /probenecid group minus the ciprofloxacin group) will be det ermined and  a 2-sided 
95% CI for the observed difference will be computed using the unstratified method of Miettinen 
and Nurminen.  
 
9.5.3 Analysis of Additional Efficacy Outcome Measures 
The number and percentage of subjects in each treatment group with an overa ll response of 
success, failure and indeterminate at Day 3, Day 5, and Day 28 will be presented for the micro-
MITT, micro -MITTS, and micro- MITTR populations. The number and percentage of subjects in 
each treatment group with an overall response of success and failure  at Day 3, Day 5, Day 12

9.6 Safety Analyses 
Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs, clinical laboratory tests,  and vital signs.  All 
safety analyses will be based on the Safety population.  Patients who receive the wrong regimen 
of study drug for their entire course of treatment will be analyzed in the group based on the 
regimen received.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

Confidential  Page 53 of 71 newly appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study 
drug.  The  incidence of TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT)  for each treatm ent group, by [CONTACT_2946], PT and severity and by [CONTACT_2946], PT and relationship 
to treatment.  Tables of TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, withdrawal from the study 
or an SAE will be provided.  AEs occurring prior to the first dose of study drug (AEs are 
recorded from the time of informed consent) will be provided in a listing.  
Descriptive statistics summarizing central laboratory data (hematology and chemistry) will be 
presented for all study visits.  The change from baseline to each post -baseline visit and to the 
overall worst post -baseline value will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Laboratory 
values will be classified as potential ly clinically  significant  and the number and percentage of 
patients with a PCS lab value will be summarized by [CONTACT_3232].  Descriptive 
statistics of the vital signs will be presented by [CONTACT_67486], as well as the 
change from baseline at each study visit.   
9.7 Interim Analysis  
To ensure that the point estimate of overall success ( combined cl inical and microbiologic 
success)  used in the estimation of sample size is valid for th is study, two interim analys es for 
sample size re- estimation will be performed when response data at Day 12 ( ± 1 day) are 
available for approximately 33% and 66% of the patients ( approximately 372 and 745 patients  
respectively ).  The FDA Guidance “Non- inferiority Clinical Trials” [ FDA Guidance 2010] 
notes that such a sample size re -estimation if based on the blinded overall response rates is not 
only acceptable but is advisable.  The interim analysis will involve a sample size re -estimation 
to either confirm the initial sample size estimate is adequate or increase the sample size 
(number of randomized patients) to ensure the study has adequate power for determining 
whether  oral sulopenem etzadroxil /probenecid is NI to oral ciprofloxacin for the primary 
outcome measure  in the micro -MITTS population . The sample size will not be decreased.   In 
addition, the sample size may be increased based on a lower than expected evaluabili ty rate  (i.e. 
percentage of the ITT population in the micro- MITT population) or lower than expected 
percentage of subjects with a susceptible pathogen. The sample size re- estimation will be based 
on the blinded overall (not by [CONTACT_1570]) outcome and evaluability rates.  
The blinded interim analyses will proceed as follows:  
1. Determine the percentage of patients with a baseline pathogen (micro -MITT 
population)  
2. Determine the percentage of patients with a susceptible (to comparator study drug, 
ciprofloxacin ) pathogen (micro- MITTS population) and a non- susceptible  (to 
ciprofloxacin) pathogen (micro -MITTR population)  
3. Determine the overall success rate aggregated across treatment groups in the micro -
MITTS population  
4. Determine if there is sufficient power (80 -90%) in the micro -MITTS to show NI with 
the planned sample size based on the observed aggregated (across treatment groups) 
overall success rate  
PF-03709270  Iterum Therapeutics US Limited.  
Clinical Trial Protocol: IT001 -[ADDRESS_315457] 
sufficient power, up to a maximum numbe r of subjects.  
In addition, the micro- MITT rate (i .e. evaluability rate) and proportion of subjects with a 
susceptible pathogen (micro -MITTS evaluability rate) will be used to determine the total 
number of subjects needed . 
In order to determine whether the  sample size is sufficient to determine if sulopenem  
etzadroxil/probenecid is superior to ciprofloxacin in the patients whose baseline pathogen is 
non-susceptible  to ciprofloxacin, a conditional power analysis for the superiority hypothesis in 
the micro -MITTR population will be conducted when 66% of patients have been enrolled. A 
conditional power analysis using the approach of Lan and Wittes [Lan 1988] will be conducted 
to determine if the sample size needs to be adjusted.  The sample size adjustme nt would be 
conducted as described by [CONTACT_91558] [Mehta 2011] .  If the conditional power is <40%, 
the superiority hypothesis in the micro- MITTR population will not be tested at the end of the 
study.  If the conditional power is 40% -<80%, the sample s ize for micro -MITTR population 
will be calculated based on the observed overall success rates in each treatment group and 
increased to a maximum number.  If the conditional power is ≥80%, no change to the sample 
size will be made.  The final sample size in  the ITT population will be adjusted to take into 
account the proportion of subjects in the micro- MITT population and the micro- MITTR 
population.  No adjustment to the overall alpha level is needed if given a conditional power 
<40%, the superiority hypothe sis is not conducted at the end of the study. 
The sample size re -estimations will be conducted by [CONTACT_10981], unblinded statistician. A 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be provided the results of the interim analysis by [CONTACT_6188], unblinded s tatistician and make a recommendation regarding changes to the 
sample size.  A detailed DMC charter will be developed which outlines the analyses to be 
completed, statistical rules, the potential changes to the sample size, and the recommendations 
that can  be made to the Sponsor.   
 
9.8 Handling of Missing Data  
Details of the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP.  For the primary and 
secondary efficacy analyses, if any data field needed to determine overall response (primary) 
and microbiological  response (secondary) is missing at the Day 12 (primary) and Day 28 
(secondary) visit, the patient will be considered an indeterminate response. By [CONTACT_108], 
patients with an indeterminate response are included in the denominator in the m -MITT 
population and thus, are analyzed in the same manner as failures in the primary and secondary 
analyses . Additional sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be detailed in the SAP. 
Imputation may be performed to understand the impact of any imbalance in in determinate 
outcomes between treatment regimens. By [CONTACT_108], patients with missing data are excluded 
from the CE  and ME populations .

11.1 Case Report Forms / Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an 
electronic data record or both, de pending on the data collection method used in this study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed original 
CRFs are the sole property of Iterum  and should not be made available in any form to third 
parties, except for authorized representatives of Iterum  or appropriate regulatory authorities, 
without written permission from Iterum . 
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, authenticity, and timely collection 
and reporting of all clinical, safety, laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data 
collection forms.  The CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_259502] d on the CRFs are true.  Any corrections to entries made in the 
CRFs and source documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary) and should not 
obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the physic ian's patient chart.  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_315460] Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Iterum , the investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the ident ity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link 
records, e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_104526], SAE forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and 
adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone

regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (e.g., retirement, relocation), Iterum  should be prospectively notified.  The study 
records must be transferred to a designee acceptable t o Iterum , such as another investigator, 
another institution, or to Iterum .  The investigator must obtain Iterum 's written permission before 
disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
[ADDRESS_315461] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., recruitment 
advertisements, if applic able, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the IRB/IEC should 
be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/IEC approvals should be forwarded to 
Iterum . 
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In that 
event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Iterum  in writing immediately after the 
implementation.

Method of Collectio n of Urine Specimens:  
To obtain a clean catch sample of urine from a female patient, a thorough cleansing of the 
periurethral area is essential before specimen collection. Wa sh the area with a disinfectant  and 
make all efforts to avoid any contact [CONTACT_259505].  
All patients should void the first part of the specimen into the toilet, then collect the remainder of 
the specimen in a sterile container. Urine samples for routine culture must be tr ansported in the 
urine transport tubes provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
If feasible, urine specimens  should be collected [ADDRESS_315474] void.  
Culture and Susceptibility testing  
 
All gram -negative pathogens will be tested locally for antimicrobial suscepti bility, as 
appropriate.  
 
The local laboratory should retain all isolates until the end of the study, if possible, or until 
confirmation of a viable organism is received from the central laboratory. Back -up cultures will 
be requested when the central labor atory does not receive a viable culture or recovers an 
organism different from the one recorded by [CONTACT_12082].  
 
Gram -staining of urine   
One slide for Gram -stain is to be prepared from each unspun specimen obtained from the urine. 
The slide is to be stained and read by [CONTACT_259506].  
Organisms considered as pathogens  
 
For the purpose of this study protocol, t he following organisms will always be considered a 
pathogen when isolated from an acceptable urine culture specimen:  
 
• Monomicrobial or polymicrobial infections caused by:  
 
• Enterobacteriaceae  
• Enterococci  
• Pseudomonas aeruginosa  
• S. saprophyticus  
 
The micro -MITT population for this study will only include patients with UTIs caused by 
[CONTACT_259507]/or S. saprophyticus . 
 
• Even if the organism was isolated from an acceptable urine culture specimen, the 
following are never a pathogen:

• Lactobacillus spp.  
• Viridans Streptococci  
• Group B Streptococci  
• Gardnerella vaginalis  
• Neisseria gonorrhoeae  
• Yeasts  
 
All isolates not defined above will be assessed on a case- by-case basis via manual review by [CONTACT_156384]. If needed, patient clinical  and microbiological information (e.g., Gram stain) will be 
used to assist in determining if the isolate is a pathogen.  
 
Based on the results of in vitro testing, animal studies, PK/PD modeling,  surveillance programs 
and clinical trial data, a provisional breakpoint for susceptibility of sulopenem to 
Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococci and methicillin -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus  is ≤ 0.5 
µg/mL. Tentative d isc diffusion interpretive criteria ar e available for sulopenem. A detailed 
description of the relevant microbiology data is available in the investigator brochure.

Appendix 3  Method for Determination of Creatinine Clearance 
Creatinine clearance should be determined by [CONTACT_104588] -Gault b ased on serum 
creatinine concentrations obtained at Baseline, using ideal body weight instead of actual weight.  
For females:  
GFR = [(140 -age) * (Ideal body wt in kg) * 0.85] / (72 * Cr) , for serum Cr reported as 
mg/dl  
GFR = [(140 -age) * (Ideal body wt in k g) * 1.0455] / ( Cr), for serum Cr reported as 
micromol/L 
 
Ideal body weight is calculated as:  
For females:  
If H > 152.5 cm  
Ideal body weight (kg) = 45.4 + [(H -152.4) * 0.89] 
If H < 152.5 cm  
Ideal body weight  (kg) = 45.4 –  [(152.4 – H)* 0.89]

3. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
 
3.1 General Considerations  
The statistical methods for analysis of clinical data are described in detail in the protocol for the 
primary study. Relevant clinical data, including baseline and demographic data and data on 
clinical outcomes will be excerpted from the primary database for use in the PK/PD analyses.  
 
3.2 Sample Size Considerations  
For this class of drugs, the pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic (PK -PD) index which best 
describes efficacy is the time of free concentration of sulopenem above MIC (T free>MIC). 
Therefore, the sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling strategy chosen for this study are the times 
which are most informative of the T free>MIC. The opt imal times at which the three samples 
should be drawn, in hours after the administration  of the first dose of oral medication, are as 
follows: 2 (1 -3), 4 (2 -6), and 6 (4- 8).

patients  from this study are targeted to  provide  a significant contribution  to these PKPD 
analyses . 
 
4 PLASMA SAMPLE HANDLING AND ANALYSIS  
 
Detailed instructions for the collection, processing, storage and shipment of samples will be 
provided in the study Laboratory Manual.  
 
4.1 Sample Collection and P rocessing  
• Blood samples for PK analysis of sulopenem  levels will be collected via direct 
venipuncture using 4 mL Gray top Sodium Fluoride (2.5 mg/mL)/Potassium Oxalate 
(2 mg/mL) tubes (BD part#368587).  
• Immediately after the sample is drawn, the tube must be mixed gently by [CONTACT_8536] 8 
to 10 times and placed on ice.  
• The samples will be centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 minutes at 4ºC within 60 minutes of 
collection to achieve a clear plasma layer over the red cells.  
• The plasma will be immediately separated into  two 0.5 ml aliquots, transferred into 1.8 
mL NUNC Cryovials and stored at approximately - 70ºC within 60 minutes of 
collection.  
• The time of the sampling as well as the time when the dose was administered prior to 
the sampling will be noted in the CRF.

protocol number, and the subjects and samples included in the shipment. Documentation 
noting the conditions of the samples upon arrival at the central lab and the bioanalytical 
laboratory will be forwarded to the Sponsor/and or Representative.  
 
4.3 Bioanalytical Sample Analyses  
The sulopenem plasma concentrations will be measured in plasma samples collected from 
patients in the sulopenem treatment group using a validated bioanalytical method and

5 PHARMACOKINETIC AND STATISTICAL DATA ANALYSES  
Pharmacokinetic and statistical analyses will be performed for sulopenem plasma data.  
 
Data from subjects with missing concentration value s (missed blood draws, lost samples, 
samples unable to be quantitated) may be used if pharmacokinetic parameters can be 
estimated using the remaining data points.

STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Protocol number: 1042 -SE-2001  Drug:  ganaxolone  
Title of the study:  A double -blind randomized, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy to treat 
subjects with status epi[INVESTIGATOR_408692] (total and for each treatment arm):  
A total number of approximately 340 subjects will be screened to allow for up to approximately 
272 subjects to receive study drug.  
Open -label pharmacokinetic group:  This open -label pharmacokinetic group will enroll up to 
approximately  [ADDRESS_515488] 12 years of age to confirm that the dose selected will 
achieve an approximate targeted p lasma concentration of ganaxolone in the status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (SE) 
population who are on concomitant medications , and to obtain a preliminary assessment of safety, 
efficacy and feasibility of ganaxolone administration . Enrolled subjects will receive ganaxolo ne IV 
solution as adjunctive therapy to their standard of care.  Subjects who early terminate for reasons 
other than lack of efficacy or adverse events related to ganaxolone (e.g ., pump failure and other 
operational issues) may be replaced.  
Double -blind gro up: This double -blind, placebo -controlled group  will screen a sufficient number of 
subjects to randomize [ADDRESS_515489] 12 years of age with SE.  Randomized subjects 
will receive ganaxolone IV solution or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_515490] of 
care.  
Investigator(s): Multicenter study  
Site(s) and Region:  
Multicenter study to be conducted globally  at approximately 150 sites  
Study period (planned): June 2018 to May 2020  Clinical phase:  2 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
 To establish that intravenous ganaxolone given concomitantly with 2nd line IV AED therapy is 
safe and effective in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_408693] 2nd line IV AED 
therapy  that has been administered at an appropriate dose and duratio n to show efficacy  and 
prevents escalation of treatment  requiring an IV anesthetic  drug ( a 3rd line treatment) for 
seizure suppression  
 Secondary:  
 To assess other secondary efficacy endpoints such as mortality  and seizure cessation in SE 
subjects  
 To assess the pharmacokinetics of adjunctive IV ganaxolone in SE subjects  
 To assess the need for IV anesthetic  drugs for treatment of current SE event in SE subjects

Protocol 1042-SE-200 1 Version 5.0 
Rationale: 
Status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (SE) is defined as a prolonged self-susta ining seizure or recmTen t seizure s witho ut 
recove [ADDRESS_515491] Epi[INVESTIGATOR_408694] a conditi on resultin g either from the failme of mechani sms respon sible for seizme 
tennin ation or from the initiation of mechani sms, w hich lead to abno1ma lly, prolonged seizures 
(5 minute s for tonic-clonic SE and 10 minu tes for focal SE with impaired consciousn ess) and which 
can have long- te1m consequen ces (after 30 minu tes for tonic-clonic SE and >60 minu tes for focal SE 
with impaired consciousness), including neuronal death and/or injmy, and alteration of nem onal 
networks, depe ndin g on the type and dmation of seizme s.1 SE is a ne urologica l emergency that 
requir es aggres sive treatme nt to stop the seizme s and prevent pe1manent nem ological damage. 3 
Mo1iality due to SE can range from 3% to 40% depen ding on etiology, age, SE type, and SE 
duration. 5 SE can be recognized clini cally or using electroe ncephalograms (EEG s) by [CONTACT_408773] .[ADDRESS_515492] s with 
refracto1y status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (RSE) and super refra cto1y status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (SRSE) will die of their 
cond ition; one-third recove r but with chronic neurolog ic or other deficits, and one third have been 
genera lly described as retmnin g to baseline. The prognosis worsens the longer subjects are kept in a 
medica lly-indu ced coma. The primaiy goal of SE treatment is to gain control of the seizme s rapi[INVESTIGATOR_408695], and treatme nt typi[INVESTIGATOR_408696] .2 In general, the treatme nt of SE is 
ve1y aggressive and paiiic ulai·ly mgent for convulsive status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (CSE). 
The cunen t therapie s for SE have inherent risks, which must be balanced against the benefit of rapid 
seizme control. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_408697]·e the agents of choice for first line treatme nt of SE but their use 
can cause respi[INVESTIGATOR_141876]1y depressio n and hypote nsion, requiring the use of suppo1iive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].2 
Unfortunately , appro ximately 35-45% of patient s are refracto1y to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] s. Seco nd line 
therapy involve s admini stration of an IV AED such as fosphenytoin, valpro ic acid, or levetiracetain 
for convulsive tonic-clonic status with the goal of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_408698] s who did not respond to first 
line treatme nt. 2 When a patient with SE fails to respond to a benzodiazep ine and the initial 2nd line 
[AED] therapy they ai· e classified as having RSE. RSE develops in 31-44 % of patient s with SE, with 
a mo1iality of 16-39%.17.19 Additio nal t herap eutic agents ai·e required immediately ; typi[INVESTIGATOR_408699], 
anesthetics via continuous infusion.2 CmTe ntly, the recollllllended anesthetic diugs inclu de 
midazola m, propofo l, thiopental, and pentobarbital. Anesthetic s are assoc iated with risks , especially 
if adini nistered for a long time - p ropofol infusion syndi· ome and hypote nsion are two recognized 
adverse events associated with anesthetics for SE treatment. In addition, the need for assis ted 
ventilatio n and the management of h ypote nsion and cardiopulmonaiy depre ssion have their own 
risks.2 
Few therapi[INVESTIGATOR_161489]·e approved for the treatme nt of SE and the mgent need for more efficaciou s 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_142505] s. Only two-thirds of patients in SE respond to first-line treatme nt.[ADDRESS_515493] from the site of action of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_408700].  γ -aminobutyric 
acid (GA BA) is recognized as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex, and a 
disturbance in GABA -mediated functions results in the occurrence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_122174].[ADDRESS_515494] pre -clinical models of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -resistant SE.  
Ganaxolone for this study is a proprietary IV formulation solubilized by [CONTACT_408774]® (betadex 
sulfobutyl ether sodium). The study targets plasma concentrations of ganaxolone  that mimic 
concentrations associated with anticonvulsant effects in preclinical anim al models of SE and that are 
expected to demonstrate anticonvulsant properties in humans .  
The maximum level of Captisol® will not exceed 50 grams  per day as  agreed upon with the FDA.  
Study drug , Dose, and Mode of Administration:  
Once consent has been obtained, t he study drug, ganaxolone IV solution for the open -label group and 
ganaxolone  IV solution  or placebo for the double -blind group, will be added to standard of care . The 
study drug will be added  from the time that the first 2nd line IV AED , admini stered at an appropriate 
dose and duration to show efficacy , has failed and the second 2nd line IV AED is medically indicated .  
To reduce variability in the population being assessed, the concurrent 2nd line IV AED therapy will 
be limited to fosphenytoin/p henytoin,  valproic acid, levetiracetam, lacosamide , or briva racetam . 
Taking any of these drugs alone or in combination is acceptable. Administering fosphenytoin and/or 
phenytoin will be counted as one ( 1) AED.  
Ganaxolone IV  solution for  administration will be provided to the site as individual 125 mL vials 
containing 100 mL of 1 mg/mL of ganaxolone for the open -label group . Details of packaging, dose 
and administration of the ganaxolone IV solution and placebo for the double -blind group  will be 
included in a future protocol amendment.  
Study drug should be administered , preferably , through a dedicated (peripheral or central) IV line.  
The infusion parameters result in daily doses of ganaxolone of ≤  830 mg/day and Captisol of 
≤ 50 g/day  as agreed upon with the FDA . Based on PK modeling, it is predicted that maximum 
concentrations of ganaxolone should remain within 1,000 ng/mL during infusion , but some 
variability is expected due to, for example, differences in subjects’ weight . Note , at any time the 
infusion rate of the ongoing administration may be decreased for safety reasons . 
Study drug will be administered as a 3 -minute bolus, with a continuous infusion at the rate between  
20-80 mg/hour  for [ADDRESS_515495] be confirmed 
immediately prior to the study drug bolus. Once study drug administration is started it should  be 
delivered for 2  days (48 hours) which includes a 12-hour taper.  
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515496] 40  kg: 
 A 30-mg bolus dose (over ~3 m inute s) will be administered with a continuous infusion of 
80 mg/hour  for 2 hours followed by a continuous infusion rate of 40 mg/hour  for 10 hours, and 
then 20 mg/hour  for the remaining 12 hours  of Day 1 .  
 On Day 2 (24 -36 hours) the continuous infusion rate of 20  mg/hour will continue until the start of 
the study drug taper  at [ADDRESS_515497]  study drug initiation . If needed, to manage seizure relapse or 
another medical reason, the infusion rate can be increased from 20 mg/hour up to a maximum 
rate of  45 mg/hour at any time  during hours 24 -36 of Day 2.  
 To taper the study drug , the infusion rate at the [ADDRESS_515498] study drug initiation timepoint will 
be reduced by 33 .3% every [ADDRESS_515499] taper will be 
33.3% from the current infusion rate, the second taper will be 33 .3% from th e first tapered 
infusion rate, and the final taper will be 33 .3% from the previous taper ed infusion rate. If , per the 
investigator ’s judgment, the study drug  taper needs to start at an earlier timepoint during the 
treatment period, the infusion rate at the start of the first taper will be decreased by 33 .3% every 4 
hours as described.   
 At the time the study drug infusion is discontinued the subject will progress to the in -patient 
follow -up day assessments/procedures .  
Subjects weighing < 40  kg will be dosed on a per -kilogram basis : 
 A 0.43-mg/kg bolus dose (over ~3 minute s) will be administered with a continuous infusion at a 
dose of 1.14 mg/kg/hour for 2 hours followed by a continuous infusion dose of 0.57 mg/kg/hour 
for 10 hours , and 0. 29 mg/kg/h our for the remaining 12 hours of Day 1 . 
 On Day 2 (24 -36 hours) the continuous infusion dose of 0. 29 mg/kg/ hour will continue until the 
start of the study drug taper at [ADDRESS_515500]  study drug initiation . If needed, to manage seizure 
relapse or for another medical reason, the infusion dose can be increased from 0.29 mg/kg/hour 
up to a maximum of  0.64 mg/kg/hour at any time during hou rs 24-36 of Day 2.  
 To taper the study drug, the infusion rate at the [ADDRESS_515501] study drug initiation timepoint will 
be reduced by 33 .3% every [ADDRESS_515502] taper will be 
33.3% from the current infusion rate, the second taper will be 33 .3% from th e first tapered 
infusion rate, and the final taper will be 33 .3% from the previous taper ed infusion rate. If, per the 
investigator ’s judgment, the  study drug  taper needs to start at an earlier timepoint in the treatment 
period, the infusion rate at the start of the first taper will be decreased by 33 .3% every 4 hours as 
described.   
 At the time the study drug infusion is discontinued the subject will progress to the in -patient 
follow -up day assessments/procedures .

Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
 Medical personnel must be  present at all times during at least the first [ADDRESS_515503] by [CONTACT_408775].  
 IV AED introduction:  
o For the first 1 0-hours of study drug administration , the decision to initiate new IV AEDs 
should be based on safety or efficacy and confirmed by [CONTACT_408776]. Initiation of any new AEDs prophylactically (so called 
“transition /bridging ”) is not recommended , unless medically indicated.  
o In the event of safety or efficacy presentation, i.e. seizure relapse, that would prompt the 
investigator to make a treatment intervention, introduction of a new IV AED is 
recommend ed over immedia te progression to a 3rd line agent, however all treatment 
decisions are at the investigator’s discretion.  
o After the first 1 0-hours investigators are encouraged to initiate “transition/bridgin g” 
AEDs in anticipation of the study drug taper  at [ADDRESS_515504]  study drug initiation on Day 
2.  
Study Drug Tapering:  
 The scenarios  for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_408701] a taper  include : 
o For s ubjects who receive study drug for less than 2 hours  and/or  
o Study drug infusion is discontinued or interrupted , and the decision is made to not restart 
the infusion and/or  
o If at any time during study drug administration  the subject progresses to an IV anesthetic 
drug (a 3rd line and/or 4th line treatment ) for seizure suppression  or 
o It is no longer safe to continue drug administration per  the investigator’s  medical 
judgment.  
 During the open -label group, based on the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data from the 
ongoing study, the infusion parameters in subsequent subjects may be adjusted to maximize the 
safety and efficacy of study subjects. If the infusion parameters are amended, the new infusion 
parameters will not exceed the daily limit of 50 g/day Captisol ( < 830 mg/day ganaxolone) as 
agreed upon with the FDA.  The revised infusion parameters will be communicated to Clinical 
Sites in a Protocol Administrative Change Memo and kept in the study and site files .   
 Note, the infusion rate cannot be rounded -up for a ny subject regardless of weight; ≥ 40 kg or < 40 
kg. 
 For study drug dosing instructions reference the Pharmacy Manual.  
Dose Adjustment s and Interruption s: 
As a general rule, d ose (infusion rate) decreases and interruptions of the continuous infusion are 
discouraged at any time during study drug treatment. However, if there is an urgent medical need 
(e.g., severe hypotension, acidosis, severe sedation) or a subject’s standard of care requires they 
undergo a procedure for which the infusion rate would need to  be decreased or interrupted (e.g ., an 
 
Confidential Page 20 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
MRI scan) it should be kept as short as possible but no longer than 6 hours . If > [ADDRESS_515505] approve the re -start of the infusion.  
Note:  
 After the dose (infusion rate) decrease or infusion interruption, it will be per the investigator’s 
judgment and assessment of risk/benefit if the subject should continue in the study or early 
discontinue.  
 In cases when severe sedation is seen and early d rug discontinuation is being considered, the 
Marinus Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_408777], if feasible.   
 If the decision is made for the subject to continue in the study, the infusion should be re -
started at the rate matching t he rate at the corresponding nominal time, counted from the start 
of the study drug infusion on Day 1. A study drug bolus or “catch -up” dose to deliver the 
study drug that was missed during the interruption should not be administered.  
 Dose (infusion rate)  increases above those specified in the protocol (or based on a future 
Protocol Administrative  Change Memo) are not allowed at any time during infusion.  This is 
to ensure daily Captisol and ganaxolone limits are kept ≤  50 g/day and ≤  830 mg/day, 
respective ly.  
Methodology:  
This is a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
efficacy of adjunctive ganaxolone IV solution in subjects with SE. This study will start with a small 
open -label group to confirm that the dose selected will achieve  a potentially therapeutic exposure  
(bolus plus continuous infusion)  to stop SE . The dose selected for Day 2 is design ed to provide a 
stable plasma concentration  to maintain status cessation . If needed, doses in the open -label group 
portion of the study may be adjusted based on the dosing and pharmacokinetic /safety  profile from the 
subject’s enrolled .  
As previously described, the s tudy drug will be added to the standard of care from the time that the 
first 2nd line I V AED , administered at an appropriate dose and duration to show efficacy , has failed 
and the second 2nd line IV AED is medically indicated during the treatment of SE. Study drug  must 
be administered with the 2nd line IV AED treatment and should be initiate d as close to the initiation 
of the second 2nd line IV AED as possible.   
Potential subjects are anticipated to be identified in the emergency department and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35905]-
patient  or intensive care units.  
Upon identification, subjects will be administered consent/assent and then screened for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to receiving study drug as adjunctive therapy via continuous IV 
infusion, followed by a 12-hour study drug taper. A s soon as  the study drug administration  is 
completed  (with or without taper) , subjects will have a 24 -hour in -patient follow -up day and then 
follow -up visits/ contact s at weeks 2, 3, and 4. For subjects who have the 12-hour study drug taper, 
the in-patient  follow -up day starts as soon as the 12-hour study drug  taper is complete . If the infusion 
rate becomes too low to sustain the infusion line , it can be discontinued at that point  and the subject 
will progress in to the in -patient follow -up day. For subjects where there is no study drug taper  the in-
patient follow -up day starts as soon as the study drug administration is discontinued . These subjects  
will continue with the week 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_515506] will be followed for approximat ely 4 weeks after the initiation of study drug . 
Screening  
Procedures specific to this protocol will not be performed until written informed consent /assent  from 
the subject/parent/guardian/legally authorized representative (LAR) has been appropriately obtained 
per the investigator’s hospit al policy. As many  of the subjects will not be able to provide 
consent/assent, the parent/guardian/LAR will provide conse nt on behalf of the subject to participate 
in the study. As soon as the subject is able, per the investigator’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s guidelines, consent/assent 
will be administered to them for continued participation. Consent/assent for subjects who are known 
to be a t risk for SE may be obtained  prior to a n SE event.  
Treatment and Follow -up 
Study Drug Dosing   
Up to  approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled into the open -label group  with ganaxolone  and up 
to approximately  242 subjects will be randomized into the doub le-blind group. Subjects in the 
double -blind group  will be randomized (1:1) to receive either ganaxolone  IV solution or placebo with 
concurrent standard of care treatment. Study drug will be given as a bolus plus continuous infusion.  
After study drug initiation, the standard duration of treatment is [ADDRESS_515507] of care for SE and medical or surgical interventions 
deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093] . In addition to the medically indicated treatment, s afety and 
tolerability will be monitored by [CONTACT_408778]:  
1. Physical examinations  should be completed at : 
a. Pre-dose (s creening ) or, if not available, withi n 2 hours of study drug ini tiation , and at 
36-hours (+/- 1-hour) , 
b. Time of study drug discontinuation, either at the end of the study drug taper or if the 
study drug is stopped without a taper and  
c. 24-hours (+/ - 1-hour) after study drug discontinuation .  
d. If possible , for subjects who early terminate, collect at the time early termination is 
being considered and as close as possible to the end of the study drug administration .  
e. Any time, if medically indicated, per investigator’s judgment.  
2. Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] S everity Score (STESS)  should be collected pre-dose (screening).

Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS), and the Full Outline of UnResponsiveness 
(FOUR) Score  scales shoul d be collected  at: 
a. Pre-dose (screening) , 60-minutes  (+/- 15-min) , 2- (+/- 15-min) , 10-, 24-, and 36 -hours  
(+/- 1 hour) after study drug initiation,  
b. Time of study drug discontinuation , either at the end of the study drug taper or if the 
study drug administration is stopped without a taper  and 
c. 24-hours (+/- 1-hour) after study drug discontinuation . 
d. If possible, for subjects who early terminate from the study, collect at the time early 
termination is being considered and as close as possible to the en d of the study drug 
administration .

Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
e. Any time, if medically indicated, per investigator’s judgment . 
Weight and height should be collected pre -dose (screening) for calculation of the BMI inclusion 
criterion, if feasible.  If not collected pre -dose (screening ), collect prior to the end of the in -
patient follow -up day.  
4. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)  should be performed at : 
a. The time consent/assent is administered to the subject for continued participation and 
then on the in-patient  follow -up day.  
If the MMSE is not able to be assessed due to the subject ’s state , this should be recorded.  
5. Electrocardiogram (ECG) , the subject should have an ECG at : 
a. Pre-dose (screening) , 2- (+/- 30-min) and 36 -hours  (+/- 1-hour)  after study drug 
initiation,  
b. Time of study dru g discontinuation; either at the end of  the study drug taper or if the 
study drug administration is stopped without a taper and    
c. 24-hours  (+/- 1-hour)  after study drug discontinuation . 
d. If possible , for subjects who early terminate from the study, collect at the time early 
discontinuation is being considered and as close as possible to the end of the study 
drug administration .  
e. Any time , if medically indicated, per investigator’s judgment . 
6. Clinical laboratory measures , hematology, serum chemistry (including  creatinine, blood urea 
nitrogen, and estimated glomerular fil tration rate calculation), and c oncomitant AED levels 
(fosphenytoin/phenytoin,  valproic acid, levetiracetam, lacosamide , or briva racetam , if 
available ), and Urinalysis  (including urine protein, albumin and microscopic),  should be 
collected at : 
a. Pre-dose (s creening ), if available , or within 2 hours of study drug  initiation, at 24 - and 
36-hours (+/- 1-hour) after study drug initiation,  
b. Time of study drug discontinuation , either at the end of  the study drug taper o r if the 
study drug administration is stopped with out a taper and  
c. 24-hours (+/- 1-hour) after study drug discontinuation.   
d. One of the weekly follow -up visits  (week 2, 3 , or 4)  for subjects in -house and if 
possible, for subjects who h ave been discharged . 
e. If possible, f or subjects who early terminate from the study,  collect at the time early 
termination is being considered and as close as possible to the end of the study drug 
administration .  
     Variable collections based on subject response:  
f. After the initial SE cessation, AED levels should be collected at time of  first instance 
of seizure activity or SE relapse.  
     Between study drug initiation and the in -patient follow -up day, where possible, collect a 
     sample:  
i. If the decision is made to intubate the subject  
ii. At the time of a serious adverse event (related or not related)  
g. Any time, if medically indicated, per investigator’s judgment.  
7. Drugs of abuse  (urine or serum) , including alcohol testing  and Pregnancy test (urine or  
serum)  for women who are of childbearing potential, should be collect ed pre-dose 
(screening).  If not possible to collect pre -dose, collect as soon as possible after start of study 
drug infusion.  Enrollment is not contingent upon results.  However, if a subject has a positive  
test result , it will be at the investigator ’s discretion to weigh the risks verses benefits for the 
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515508] ’s continued participation.  If the investigator decides to discontinue the study drug, 
refer to the study drug taper directions in the Study drug , Dose, and Mode of Administration 
section.  
8. EEG  is required for confirmation of non-convulsive status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] ( NCSE ) diagnosis. 
Ideally, c ontinuous EEG monitoring should  start before study drug  initiation and continu e 
through the in-patient  follow -up day. If continuous EEG is not possible or needed to diagnose 
(for convulsive SE) it should be instituted at the earliest possible time after study drug 
initiation (if a pre -dose EEG was not performed  for the diagnosis of co nvulsive SE ).   
Several study sites may be offered the use of a rapid EEG device to assist with pre-screening 
of subjects with NCSE. It will be at the investigator’s discretion if they feel the device will 
benefit their site. More details can be found in Section 7.2.2 . 
9. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic  analysis  (venous or arterial) of ganaxolone will be  
collected at the following times:  
Required collections:  
a. After the start of the study drug infusion: [ADDRESS_515509] response:  
d. After the initial SE cessation, collect a sample at the first instance of seizure activity 
or SE relapse and the subject does not progress to an IV anesthetic drug (a 3rd line 
treatment, e.g. midazolam, propofol, thiopental, pentobarbital, or ketamine)  
Between study drug initiation and the in-patient follow -up day, where possible, collect a 
sample:  
i. If the decision is made to intubate the subject  
ii. At the time of introduction of a new IV AED for safety/efficacy (not for AEDs 
given prophylactically for “ transition /bridging ”) 
iii. At the time of any serious adverse event (related or no t related)  
If study dru g is administered via central access, the PK sample must not be collected from 
any central access ports. If study drug is administered via venous access, the PK sample must 
be collected via the contra -lateral arm of the study drug arm. The location of stud y drug 
access and location of PK sample collection should be documented in the subject’s source. If 
the PK sample cannot be collected due to poor venous access and the study drug infusion site 
is the only viable option, the specimen should not be collected  and the reason for non -
collection documented in the subject’s source.   
10. Blood sampling for neurosteroid levels  (venous or arterial) will be collected pre -dose 
(screening ) and at 24-hours (+/- 1-hour) of study drug initiation.  If study drug is discontinued 
during this 24  hours, the second sample should be collected prior to study drug 
discontinuation , if possible.   
The same collection rules as noted for pharmacokinetic sample  collection  apply for the 
neurosteroid sample collection.  
11. Blood gas  including FiO 2, PaO 2, and arterial pH, if collecte d per the investigator’s discretion  
for subject ’s care, from the time of SE diagnosis through the of the in-patient follow -up day  
and recorded in the eCRF.  If samples are not collected, a sample is not required .  
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515510]  from study drug initiation through the 
end of the in -patient follow -up day , a blood gas sample should be c ollected. The sample 
should be collected immediately prior to or as close as possi ble to the time of intubation .  
During the study, it is expected that the total blood volume drawn from subjects for all safety, 
pharmacokinetic, and neurosteroid sampling at pediatric -only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408702] 62 to 
88 mL of blood and at all other h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_408703] 192.6  to 278.3 mL of blood, 
regardless of sex.   
12. Cerebral Spi[INVESTIGATOR_408704]:  If a subject has a lumbar puncture for the collection 
of cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) per investigator’s discretion as part of their care and there is 
adequate volume, a sample will be aliquoted  for future analysis of ganaxolone. If multiple 
lumbar punctures are performed, a sample from each puncture is requested.  However, if not 
collected or not enough CSF is available to provide a sample for the study, a sample is not 
required.  
13. Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Improvement (CGI -S and CGI -I, respectively ) 
CGI-S is collected  at: 
a. Pre-dose (screening ) and 36 -hours (+/- 1-hour)  after study drug initiatio n,

administration .  
f. Any time, if medically indicated, per investigator’s judgment.  
14. Modified Rankin Scale (MRS)  should be collected  at:  
a. Time of study drug discontinuation , either at the end of the study drug taper or if the 
study drug administration is stopped without a taper and

Assessment questions :  
1. Is the subject in SE currently ?  
2. Was the subject in SE since the previous assessment?   
(Note: N/A for the 15 -minute timepoint)  
3. Is the subject having seizures currently?  
4. Did the subject have seizures since the previous assessment?   
(Note: N/A for the 15-minute timepoint)

(Note: “New ” refers to any AED that has not already been used to treat the current 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_408706] ) 
6. If a new AED was initiated, was it to treat the current seizure/SE epi[INVESTIGATOR_408707] (e. g., for transition/bridging), or other reason ?  
(Note: “Prophylactic ” refers to any elective/transitional/bridging AED therapy that 
is not indicated to treat seizure/EEG abnormal activity at this time or since the last 
asses sment ) 
Record any new AEDS on the concomitant eCRF page . 
16. Intubation Question  will be collected for subject s who are intubated either prior to study drug

Study Follow -up and Discontinuation:  
Subjects  who discontinue  study drug without a taper , e.g., takes study drug for less than 2 hours or 
progresses to an IV anesthetic drug (a 3 rd line treatment) for  seizure suppression or discontinues the 
study medication due to safety reasons will continue in the study  and still have the in-patient  follow -
up and the week 2, 3, and 4 follow -up visits /contacts . 
  
Subjects  who early terminate from the study , e.g., due to consent withdrawn , should have the early 
termination  procedures completed  when early terminat ion is being considered  and as close as 
possible to the end of the study drug administration . 
All subjects , except th ose who are early terminated from the study , will have the in-patient  follow -up 
day and the follow -up visit s/contact s at Weeks 2, 3, and 4. If the  subject remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408708].  Even if a subject has been discharged, efforts will be made to have the subject return so 
at least  one of the visits will be conducted in -person . These visits will be conducted weekly, starting 
approximately 7 ± 3 days after the in-patient  follow -up day. 
During these visits/calls, the site will follow -up on all serious adverse events (SAEs) and non -serious 
adverse events (A Es), AE resolution that occurs, and concomitant medications. In total, each subject 
will be followed for approximately 4 weeks.

subjects who early terminate from the study, collect at the time early termination  is being considered and as close as possible to the end of the study drug administration.  After 
the initial SE cessation, AED levels should be collected at time of first instance of seizure activity or SE relapse. Between study drug initiation an d the in -patient follow -up day, 
where possible, c ollect AED levels if the decision is made to intubat e the subject and for any serious adverse event ( related or not related) . Collect clinical labs , AEDs  and 
urinalysis  any time, if medically indicated, per investigator’s judgment.  
i. Drugs of abuse  (urine or serum) , including alcohol testing , and pregnancy test (urine or serum) for w omen who are of childbearing potential, should be collected pre -dose 
(screening). If not possible to collect pre -dose, collect as soon as possible after start of study drug infusion. Enrollment is not contingent upon results. However, if a subject has 
a positive test result, it will be at the investigator’s discretion to weigh the risks verses benefits for the subject’s cont inued participation. If the investigator decides to discontinue 
the study drug, refer to the study drug taper directions in the Study drug, Dose and Mode of Administration section.  
j. EEG is required for confirmation of NCSE diagnosis. Continuous EEG recording i deally should start before study drug initiation and continue through the in-patient follow -
up day. If continuous EEG is not possible or needed to diagnose (for convulsive SE) it should be instituted at the earliest poss ible time after study drug initiatio n (if a pre -dose 
EEG was not performed for the diagnosis of convulsive SE).  
k. Subjects will receive a 30 mg bolus (over ~ 3 minute s) with a continuous infusion  at a rate of 20-80 mg/hour for approximately 36 hours followed by 12-hour taper.   
l. Blood sample collection for pharmacokinetic analysis (venous or arterial) will occur at 60-minutes then at [ADDRESS_515531] ; collect at the time of introduction 
of a new IV AED for safety/efficacy (not for  AEDs given prophylactically for “transition/bridging”), and at the time of any serious adverse event (related or not related) . PK 
samples cannot be collected from the study drug infusion line. The  location of study drug access and location of PK sample co llection should be documented in th e subject’s 
source.

ence within the spectrum of epi[INVESTIGATOR_408711] 
5 minutes in duration without full recovery of consciousness or 10 minutes of continuous seizure 
activity on EEG, or intermittent paroxysmal activity for more than 50% of an hour.1-4 
 
If SE is not treated immediately, prolonged seizure activity can result in permanent neuronal 
damage and contribute to the high morbidity and mortality associated with SE.2,4,5  Paroxysmal 
hypersynchronous electrical discharges occur when there is too 
much excitation or too little 
inhibition in the area of the brain where the abnormal discharge starts.6  Gamma-aminobutyric 
acid (GABA) is recognized as the principal inhibitory neurotransm
itter in the cerebral cortex, 
and a disturbance in GABA-mediated functions results in the occurrence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_122174].6  
SE is often caused by [CONTACT_094]-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], but it can also be caused by [CONTACT_408786].2  In 
subjects with chronic epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], low blood concentrati
ons of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs) can lead 
to SE.[ADDRESS_515537]
ug withdrawal.1,2  
 
A growing body of evidence from research and clinical observation supports the concept that SE 
becomes more difficult to control as its duration increases, and prolonged SE and refractoriness 
to treatment are associated with poor prognosis.1  Resistance to treatment has been partially 
attributed to the internalization of postsynaptic GABA A receptors and externalization of 
glutamate receptors.5  It has also been postulated that res
istance may occur because of a 
mechanistic shift from inadequate GABAergic inhibit
ory receptor–mediated transmission to 
excessive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid exci
tatory receptor–mediated transmission.7  Because 
prolonged epi[INVESTIGATOR_408712] a reduction of GABA A-mediated synaptic inhibition, 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_408713] A neurotransmission become 
less effective the longer SE continues.   
 
SE can be classified int
o three subtypes: generalized convulsive SE (GCSE), non-convulsive SE 
(NCSE), and refractory SE (RSE).2,4  GCSE is characterized by [CONTACT_408787]-clonic movements of the extr
emities and mental status impairment, and may result in 
focal neurologic deficits lasting hours to days following an epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].4  NCSE is define
d as seizure 
activity seen on electroencephalog
raphy ( EEG ) without clinical symptoms; however, acutely ill 
subjects may present with impaired 
mental status following an NCSE epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].[ADDRESS_515538] SE tr
eatment regimen of a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] a 
secondary AED.4   
 
SE is a neurologi
c emergency that requires aggressive treatment to stop the seizures and prevent 
permanent neuronal damage.8  Mortality due to SE can range from 3% to 40% depending on 
etiology, age, status type, and status duration.[ADDRESS_515539] shown that seizures cause 
neuronal death via excitotoxic mechanisms as a result of excessive neuronal firing.1  
Furthermore, GCSE is associated with many complications, including cardiac arrhythmias, 
rhabdomyolysis, pulmonary edema, electrolyte and glucose imbalance, and temperature 
disturbances.10

Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
 
The prognosis worsens and the mortality increases for subjects whose SE develops into RSE or 
super-refractory SE (SRSE).[ADDRESS_515540] of subj
ects with RSE and SRSE will die 
of their condition; one-third recover but with chronic neur
ologic or other deficits, and one-third 
have been generally described as returning to baseline.12,13  The longer subjects are kept in a 
long-term medically-induced com
a to stop the seizures, the worse the prognosis.14  
 
As SE is a medical emergency, the primary goal of treatment is to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_408714].  Treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_408696]: emergent initial therapy (first-line), 
urgent control therapy (second-line), and refractory therapy (third-line).[ADDRESS_515541]- of-care treatment for early and established SE (ESE) is parenteral 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].7  A recent large-scale clinical study found that about 25% and 36% of subjects 
with SE did not respond to intramuscular (IM) midazolam and intravenous
 (IV) lorazepam, 
respectively.[ADDRESS_515542] treatment, and evidence 
shows prolonged seizures can result in permanent
 neuronal damage and contribute to the high 
morbidity and mortality associated with SE.6  Additionally, more than 20% of patients admitted 
for SE require intubation after benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_408715]-line drug29, solely for the 
sake of airway protection.  
 
RSE is commonly defined as SE resistant to treatment with one first-line AED (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) 
and one second-line AED (phenytoin, phenobarbital, or valproate acid).16,[ADDRESS_515543]-line agents such as pentobarbital, midazolam, propofol, and phenobarbital
 usually results in 
iatrogenic coma, which necessitates protection of the airways by [CONTACT_408788].  
 
As the goal of RSE treatment is to abolish all clinical and electrographic epi[INVESTIGATOR_41726], 
continuous EEG monitoring is essential for this patient population. Without continuous EEG 
monitoring, the response to IV treatment could be difficult to interpret, because subclinical 
electrographic seizure activity ca
n be detected in up to 48% of subjects after control of 
convulsive SE.[ADDRESS_515544] Back ground and Clinical Information 
Ganaxolone is the 3β-methylated synthetic analogue of the neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, 
but it is designed not to activate nuclear (classical) progesterone receptors.  Ganaxolone differs 
from other GABA agents by [CONTACT_408789]-synaptic GABA A receptors 
and at binding sites distinct from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]. W
hereas benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_408716], ganaxolone does not because it selectively binds to GABA A receptors 
containing the α and δ subunits. By [CONTACT_408790], ganaxolone provides 
an al
ternative mechanism in the treatment of seizures and co
uld serve as effective therapy in the 
management of SE.  
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515545] commonly used AEDs are associated with significant 
toxicities.  Ganaxolone is an attractive potent
ial therapy because of its current investigational 
safety profile, which is derived from a relatively large clinical database (> 1,500 subjects 
exposed) that contains both pedia tric 
and adult populations. In clinical trials to date, it has shown 
anticonvulsant activity in subjects with seizure disorde
rs.  Marinus is investigating the approach 
of dosing ganaxolone to a level required to successfully control SE in thi
s patient population.   
 
Neuroactive steroids, which are positive allosteric modulators of both synaptic and extra-
synaptic GABA A receptor s,[ADDRESS_515546] inhibitory properties to calm the overexcit ed brain (some 
have been used as anesthetics23) and might be effective in treating benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-resistant SE. 
 
As of [ADDRESS_515547] received treatment with 
ganaxolone in ongoing and completed company-sponsored clinical tria
ls ranging in duration 
from 1 day to more than 2 years, using doses from 50 to 2,000 mg/day.[ADDRESS_515548] 
been randomized in on-going phase 3 pediatric g
enetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_127988]. 
In 20 completed Phase 1 studies, 319 healthy subjects received ganaxol
one doses of 50 to 
2,000 mg/day for periods of up to 2 weeks.  
In the 20 completed Phase 2 /[ADDRESS_515549]-traumatic 
stress disorder.  
The overall frequency of treatm
ent-emergent adverse events 
(TEAE) in company-sponsored 
placebo-controlled studies was 61.7% (613/993 subjects) in subjects who received GNX 
and 51.8% (330/637 subjects) in subjects who received placebo.  Th e most frequently reported 
TEAEs in GNX-treated subjects were somnolence, diz
ziness, fatigue, and headache. All of these 
events, except for headache, occurred more frequently in GNX-treated subjects than placebo 
subjects. CNS -related evets appeare
d to be dose related, with the majority of these events 
occurring at doses ≥ 500 mg and were anticipated based on the mechanism of
 action of 
ganaxolone.  
The majority of TEAEs were anticipated based o
n the mechanism of action of GNX and were 
non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment.   
In the ganaxolone development program over
all, no clinically significant trends in 
electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, vital signs, or physical or neurologic examinations have been 
noted, and no mean changes from baseline in clinical laboratory results have been identified.  
Overall, there have been only a few clinically significant individual changes from baseline in 
clinical laboratory measurements in clinical trials of ganaxolone.  In the completed placebo-
controlled Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, 0.3% of subjects treated with ganaxolone and 0.5% of 
 
Confidential Page 39 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
subjects treated with placebo exhibited elevated liver function tests during the study (aspartate 
transaminase or alanine transaminase > 3 times the upper limit of normal [ULN]).  There have 
been no cases of Hy’s law considere
d to be related to ganaxolone in the ganaxolone development 
program. In controlled clinical trials of ganaxolone, 1.1% of subjects receiving placebo and 1.7% 
of subjects receiving ganaxolone reported an AE of rash
 suggesting there is no obvious 
imbalance between drug and placebo in terms of frequency of this AE. However, in placebo-
controlled studies rash led to discontinuation 
in GNX—treated subjects in 6 cases (0.6%) 
compared to no cases (0%) in placebo
-treated subjects. Most rashes improved either while the 
drug was continued or following discontinuation. Two subjects participating in the Phase [ADDRESS_515550] been completed. Preclinical toxicity studies showed 
IV ganaxolone to be generally safe and adverse events
 to be consistent with expected dose-
related sedation. In rats continuously dosed with IV ganaxolone for 14 days, no ganaxolone-
related changes were noted in clinical patho
logy parameters or histopathology examination. 
There was no evidence of local irritation when ganaxolone was given IV or perivenously in 
preclinical studies. Furthermore, IV ganaxolone did not
 cause hemolysis and was compatible 
with human plasma.  
The safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of IV ganaxolone were investigated in 36 
healthy volunteers in stu
dy 1042-0405, in which ganaxolone was administered as a bolus dosing 
(Stage 1) or as a bolus dose followed by a continuous i
nfusion (Stage 2). Ten of the 36 subjects 
enrolled were women.  
 Stage 1 enrolled and dosed subjects in four cohorts (A to D):  6 subjects in Cohort A 
(10 mg ganaxolone IV bolus in 3 subjects and 30 
mg ganaxolone bolus in 3 subjects over 
5 minutes), 8 subjects in Cohort B (20 mg ganaxolone bolus over 2 minutes), 8 subjects 
in Cohort C (30 mg ganaxolone bolus over 1 hour), and 8 subjec
ts in Cohort D (10 mg 
ganaxolone bolus over 1 hour).  Cohorts B, C, and D included 2 pla
cebo subjects in each 
cohort.  
 Stage 2 of the study dosed a total of 6 subjects with a 6 mg bol us followed by a 4-hour 
infusion at 20 mg/hour.  
A total of [ADDRESS_515551] results, vital signs, or ECG parameters occurred in 
any cohort.  
Pharmacokinetic data from study 1042-0405 showed that a bolus infusion of 30 mg ganaxolone 
over 5 minutes led to transient peak concentration levels (C max) above 1,000 ng/mL with no 
safety concerns.  Infusion of 30 mg/hour for 1 hour and 20 mg/hour for 4 hours led to 
 
Confidential Page 40 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
concentrations of 258 and 215 ng/mL, respectively, again without any safety concerns.  This is 
consistent with findings from previous studies with the oral formulation of ganaxolone, in which 
Cmax levels of up to 200 to 300 ng/mL were commonly observed and were not associated with 
major safety findings or toxicity (apart from seda
tion-related effects).   
It is not known if ganaxolone is excreted in breast mil
k.  After cessation of the infusion, plasma 
ganaxolone levels are expected to drop rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], but it 
is possible that low, subtherapeutic levels 
persist for several days as ganaxolone is slowly released from tissues.  Ther

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
2.1 Rationale for the Study 
Status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (SE) is defined as a pr
olonged 
self-sustaining seizure or recurrent seizures 
without recovery of consciousness between seizures.[ADDRESS_515553] 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_408717] a condition resulting eit
her from the failure of mechanisms 
responsible for seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms, which lead to 
abnormally, prolonged seizures (5 minutes for tonic-clonic SE and 10 minutes for focal SE with 
impaired consciousness) and which can have long-term consequences (after 30 minutes for tonic-
clonic SE and > 60 minutes for focal SE with impaired consciousness), including neuronal death 
and/or injury, and alteration of neuronal networks, depending on the type and dura
tion of 
seizures.1  SE is a neurological emergency that requires aggressive treatment to stop the seizures 
and prevent permanent neurological damage.3  Mor
tality due to SE can range from 3% to 40% 
depending on etiology, age, SE type, and SE duration.5  SE can be r
ecognized clinically or using 
electroencephalograms (EEGs) by [CONTACT_408791].[ADDRESS_515554] of subjects with refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] 
(RSE) and super refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] (S
RSE) will die of their condition; one-third 
recover but with chronic neurologic or other deficits, and one third have been generally 
described as returning to baseline.  The prognosis worsens the longer subjects are kept in a 
medically-induced coma. The primary goal of SE treatment is to gain control of the seizures 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_408718], and treatment typi[INVESTIGATOR_408719].2 In general, the 
 
Confidential Page 41 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
treatment of SE is very aggressive and particularly urgent for convulsive status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397] 
(CSE).  
The current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_408720], which must be balanced against the benefit of 
rapid seizure control.  Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_408721], requiring the use of supportive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].2  Unfortunately, approximately 35-45% of patients are refractory to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].[ADDRESS_515555] line treatment.2 When a patient with SE fails to respond to a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_408722] 2nd line therapy they are classified as having RSE. RSE develops in 31-44% of 
patients with SE, with a mortality of 16-39%.29 Additiona
l therapeutic agents are required 
immediately; typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], anesthetics via continuous infusion.2 Currently, the recommended 
anesthetic drugs include midazolam, propofol, thi
opental, and pentobarbital. Anesthetics are 
associated with risks, especially if administered for a long time – propofol infusion syndrome 
and hypotension are two recognized adverse events associated with anest
hetics for SE treatment. 
In addition, the need for assisted ventilation and the management of hypotension and 
cardiopulmonary depression have their own risks.[ADDRESS_515556] from the site of action of benzodiazepin
e receptor agonists and barbiturates.  Γ-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) is recognized as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the 
cerebral cortex, and a disturbance in GABA-mediated functions results in the occurrence of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_122174].[ADDRESS_515557] pre-clinical models of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-resistant SE.  
Ganaxolone for this study is a proprietary IV formulation solubilized by [CONTACT_408774]® (betadex 
sulfobutyl ether sodium). The study targets plasma concentrations of 
ganaxolone that mimic 
concentrations associated with anticonvulsant effects in preclinical an
imal models of SE and that 
are expected to demonstrate anticonvulsant properties in humans. On December 21, 2016 (Serial 
No. 0014), Marinus submitted a Request for FDA Feedback on the dra
ft Phase 2 Study 1042- SE-
2001 protocol and provided specific questions.  One question was rel
ated to the proposed 
maximum daily dosing limit of C
aptisol exposure in this study of approximately 35 
grams/day.  On February 13, 2017, the FDA responded and indicated that the proposed 
maximum daily dos
ing limit of Captisol 35 grams/day,  is acceptable in adults and pediatric 
patients > 12 years of age.

Protocol 1042-SE-200 1 Version 5.0 
On Nove mber 15, 2018 (Serial No. 0034) , Marinus subm itted a Request for FDA Feedback with 
data from the cmTently emolled su bjects to request an increase in the daily Captisol limit from 35 
g/day to 50 g/day . On D ecember 13, 2018, the FDA provided their agreement citing, "B alanci ng 
the potential benefi t of ganaxolone against the p otential risk of a high Captisol exposme , we can 
allow you to exceed yow-cunent Captiso l limit of 35 g/day but not to exceed 50 g/day in Study 
1042 -SE-2001." Therefo re, the maximum level of Captisol® in this study will not exceed 
50 g/day . 
The FDA indicated that if Marinus wanted to further increase the total daily dose of Capt isol 
beyo nd 50 g/day, a new request for FDA feedback would need to be submitted based on a 
summ a1 y of the clinical expe rience from a su fficient numb er of subjects in Study 1042-SE-200 1 
who achieved Captisol expos mes betwee n 35 and 50 g/day . The FDA would review this data and

Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
The dose selected for Day 2  is designed to provide a stable plasma concentration to maintain 
status cessation. If needed, doses in the open-label group may be adjusted based on the dosing 
and pharmacokinetic/safety profile from the subject’s enrolled.  
A total number of approximately 340 subjects wil
l be screened to allow for up to approximately 
272 subjects to receive study drug in the open-label and the double-blind groups. Subjects who 
early terminate for reasons other than lack of ef
ficacy or adverse events related to ganaxolone 
(e.g., pump failure and other operational issues) may be replaced. In the double-blind group, 
randomized subjects will receive gan
axolone IV solution or placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_515560] be administered 
with 2nd line IV AED as close to the dose initiation of
 the second 2nd line IV AED as possible.  
Potential subjects are anticipated to 
be identified in the emergency department and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35905]-
patient or intensive care units.
 
Upon identification, subjects will be administered consent/assent and 
then screened for 
inclusion/exclusion criteria prior to receiving study drug as adjunctive therapy via continuous IV 
infusion, followed by a 12-hour study drug taper. As soon as the study drug administration is 
completed (with or without taper), 
subjects will have a 24-hour in-patient follow-up day and then 
follow-up visits/contacts at weeks 2, 3, and 4. For subjects who have the 12-hour study drug 
taper, the in-patient follow-up day st
arts as soon as the 12-hour study drug taper is complete. If 
the infusion rate becomes too low to sustain the infusion line, it can be discontinued at that point 
and the subject will progress into the in-patient follow-up day. For subjects where there is no 
study drug taper the in-patient follow-up day starts as soon as the study drug administration is 
discontinued. These subjects will continue with the week 2, 3, and [ADDRESS_515561] one of these visits will be conducted in-
person.

continued participation.  
Acceptable methods of contraception are: 
 Intrauterine device plus condoms 
 Double-barrier methods (e.g., condoms and diaphragm with spermicidal gel or 
foam) 
 Hormonal contraceptives (oral, patch, injectable, or vaginal ring), stabilized for at 
least 30 days prior to t

becomes sexually active during the study, they should use one of the other 
acceptable methods noted above in addition to the hormonal contraceptive until it 
has been stabilized for [ADDRESS_515574] dose of study drug. Medically 
acceptable contraceptives include surgical sterilization (such as a vasectomy) and a condom used 
with a spermicidal gel or foam. Contra
ceptive measures such as Plan BTM, sold for emergency 
use after unprotected se

future medical care by [CONTACT_59734][INVESTIGATOR_307]. The investigator or sponsor may withdraw 
the subject at any time (e.g., in the interest of subject safety). The investigator is encouraged to 
discuss withdrawal of a subject from study drug
 with the Medical Monitor when possible unless 
due to progression to an IV anesthetic dr

Study drug discontinuation 
Subjects who discontinue study drug without a taper, e.g., takes study drug for less than 2 hours 
or progresses to an IV anesthetic (a 3rd line treatment) for seizure suppression or discontinues the 
study medication due to safety reasons will continue in the 
study and still have the in-patient 
follow-up day and the week 2, 3 and 4 follow-up visits/contacts. 
Study withdrawal 
Subjects who early terminate from the study, e.g. due to consent withdrawn, any outstanding 
screening procedures and the evaluations listed for the Early Termination Visit in Table [ADDRESS_515576] Withdrawal Criteria 
All subjects reserve the right to withdraw from the clinical study at any time, as stated in the 
informed consent form.  The investigator may also discontinue subjects from the clinical study 
for any of the following reasons: 
1. The subjec t has persistent ventilatory depression that results in a SpO2 < 90% or ETCO2 > 
50 mmHg (measured using nasal cannula monitor) despi[INVESTIGATOR_408725].  Standard airway maneuvers to treat sedation-induced upper 
airway obstruction (jaw thrust, chin lift, or supraglottic dev
ice such as a laryngeal mask 
airway) or hypoventilation (ventilation assisted with a mask or supraglottic device) would be 
instituted at the discretion of the physician monitoring the patient in order to maintain SpO2 
> 90% and ETCO2 < [ADDRESS_515577] would be dis
continued 
2. ECG evidence of QT prolongation (QTcF > 500 msec, or an increase of QTcF > 60 msec 
above baseline to a value > [ADDRESS_515578] 5 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_408726]) 
3. Kidney function impairment such tha
t eGFR ≤ 45 mL/ min and subject is not starting dialysis  
4. Any other adverse event or safety issue (e.g., sev
ere persis tent hypotension/hypertension or 
tachycardia/bradycardia) that suggests it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue to 
receive study drug  
5. Rash that is clinically significant and considered to be related to the study drug (e.g., 
morbilliform, urticarial, papular) 
6. Subject experiences
 an SAE considered to be related to the study drug 
Decisions to discontinue the study will be made at each partic

6.2.[ADDRESS_515589] an ~3-minute bolus dose with a 
continuous infusion at the rate of 20-80 
mg/hour, and a 12-hour study drug taper (see Table 2 
and 3 for details). Once study drug administr
ation is started it should be delivered for 2 days (48 
hours) which includes a 12-hour taper.  
Study drug should be
 administered, ideally, throu
gh a dedicated (peripheral or central) IV line. 
These infusion parameters result in daily doses of ganaxol
one of ≤ 830 mg/day and Captisol of ≤ 
50 g/day as agreed upon with the FDA. Based on PK modeling, it is predicted that m
aximum 
concentrations of ganaxolone should remain within 1,000 ng/mL during infusion, but s
ome 
variability is expected due to, for example, differences in subjects’ weight. Note, at any time, the 
infusion rate of the ongoing administration may be decreased for safety reasons, see Dose 
Adjustm
ents and Interruptions section below for more information. 
Note, pharmacokinetic data from study 1042-
0405 in healthy volunteers showed that a bolus 
infusion of 30 mg ganaxolone over 5 minutes led to transient peak conc
entration levels (C max) 
above 1,000 ng/mL (maximal observed C max was 1,850 ng/mL) with no safety concerns. Infusion 
of 30 mg/hour for 1 hour and 20 mg/hour for 4 hours led to concentration
s of 258 and 215 
ng/mL, respectively, again without any safety concerns (see Secti
on 1.[ADDRESS_515590] Background and 
Clinical Information). 
During the open-label group, based on the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data from the 
ongoing study, the infusion parameters in subsequent subjects may be adjusted to maximize the 
safety and efficacy of study subjects. If the infusion parameters are amended, the new infusion 
parameters will not exceed the daily limit
 of 50 g/day Captisol (< 830 mg/day ganaxolone) as 
agreed upon with the FDA. The revised infusion parameters will be communicated to Clinical 
Sites in a Protocol Administrative Change Memo and kept in the study and site files.    
Potential subjects must have failed one 2nd line IV AED therapy, administered at an appropriate 
dose and duration to show efficacy. Ganaxolone IV solution  
(open-label group) or ganaxolone 
IV solution or placebo (double-blind group) will be administered in combination with standard 
of care at the time that the first 2nd line IV AED 
has failed and the second 2nd line AED is 
medically indicated during the treatment of SE
. Study drug must be
 administered with 2nd line IV 
AED treatment and should be initiated as close 
to the dose initiation of the second 2nd line IV 
AED as possible.

Medical Oversight:  
Medical personnel must be present at all times during at least the first [ADDRESS_515603] by [CONTACT_408798]. 
New AED Introduction: 
 For the first 10-hours of study drug administration the decision to initiate new IV AEDs 
should be based on safety or efficacy and confirmed by [CONTACT_408776]. Initiation of any new AEDs prophylactically (so called 
“transition/bridging”) is not recommended, unless medically indicated.  
 In the event of safety or efficacy presentation, i.e. seizure relapse that would prompt the 
investigator to make a treatment intervention, introduction of a new IV AED
 is recommend ed 
over immediate progression to a 3rd line agent, however all treatment decisions are at the 
investigator’s discretion. 
 After the first 10-
hours investigators are encouraged to initiate prophylactic AEDs in 
anticipation of the study drug taper at 
[ADDRESS_515604] study drug initiation on Day 2.  
Scenarios for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_408729] a taper include: 
 For subjects who receive study drug for less than 2 hours and/or  
 Study drug infusion is discontinued or interrupted, and the decision is made to not restart the 
infusion and/or 
 If at any time during s
tudy drug administration the subject progresses to an IV anesthetic 
drug (a 3rd line and/or 4th line treatment)
 for seizure suppression or 
 It is no longer safe to continue drug adm
inistration per the investigator’s medical judgment. 
Dose Optimization: 
During the open-label group, based on the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic data from the 
ongoing study, the infusion parameters in subsequent subjects may be adjusted to maximize the 
safety and efficacy of study subjects. If the infusion parameters are amended, the new infusion 
parameters will not exceed the daily limit of 50 g/day Captisol (< 830 mg/day ganaxolone) as 
agreed upon with the FDA.  The revised infusion parameters will be communicated to Clinical 
Sites in a Protocol Administrative Change Memo and kept in the study and site files.  
For study drug dosing instructions reference the Pharmacy Manual. 
 
Dose Adjustments and Interruptions: 
Dose (infusion rate) decreases and interruptions of the continuous infusion are discouraged at 
any time during study drug treatment. However, if there is an urgent medical need (e.g., severe 
hypotension, acidosis, severe sedation) or a subject’s standard of care requires they undergo a 
 
Confidential Page 58 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
procedure for which the infusion would need to be decreased or interrupted (e.g., an MRI scan) it 
should be kept as short as possible but no longer than 6 hours. If > [ADDRESS_515605] approve the re-start of the infusion.  
Note :  
 After the dose (infusion rate) decrease or infusion interruption, it will be per the 
investigator’s judgment and assessment of risk/be
nefit if the subject should continue in 
the study or early discontinue.  
 In cases when severe sedation is seen and early drug discontinuation is being considered, 
the Marinus Medical Monitor should be contac
ted prior to infusion termination, if 
feasible.  
 If the decision is made for the subject to continue in the study, the infusion should be re-
started at the rate matching t
he rate at the corresponding nominal time, counted from the 
beginning of the study drug infusion on Day 1. A study drug bolus or “catch-up” dose to 
deliver the study drug that was missed during the interruption should not be administered.  
 Dose (infusion rate) increases above those specified in the protocol (or based on a future 
Protocol Administrative Change Memo) ar
e not allowed at any time during infusion. This 
is to ensure daily Captisol and ganaxolone limits are kept ≤ 50 g/day and  
≤ 830 mg/day, respectively.

6.3.2 Packaging 
Ganaxolone IV solution for administration will
 be provided to the site as individual vials or 
bottles containing 1 mg/mL (open-label group) or 1 m
g/mL or  placebo (double-blind group) . 
Changes to sponsor-supplied packaging prior to dosing may not occur wi
thout full agreement in 
advance by [CONTACT_456]. 

 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515608] be documented. Study drugs are distributed by [CONTACT_408800] a nominated member of the study team. The 1 mg/mL ganaxolone IV solution 
vials should be stored at room temperature 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F) until use. Excursions up 
to 30°C (86°F) that are experienced in pharmaci
es, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and warehouses, and during 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_116275].  Details on how to store th
e study drug can be found in the Pharmacy 
Manual. Prior to administration inspect the study drug fo r particulate matter, cloudiness, and 
discoloration. If any of these is present, do not use and notify the sponsor. 
Study drug must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions . Temperature 
monitoring of the study drug is required at the storage location to ensure that the study drug is 
m
aintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring 
that the temperature is monitored t
hroughout the duration of the study and that records are 
maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_28920]-house system, by a 
mechanical recording device such as a calibr
ated chart recorder, or by [CONTACT_3177], such that 
both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded 
and retrieved as required. Such a device (i.e., certified min/max thermometer) would require 
manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor
 must be notified immediately upon discovery 
of any excursion from the established range
. Temperature excursions will require site 
investigation as to cause and remediation
. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of 
excursions on the study drug and will provide support
ive documentation as necessary. Under no 
circumstances should the product be dispe
nsed to subjects until the impact has been determined 
and the product is deemed appropriate for use by [CONTACT_456]. 
The sponsor should be notified immediately if there are any changes to the storage area of the 
study drug that could affect the integrity of the product(s), such as fumigation of a storage room. 
6.4 Drug Accountability 
Investigators will be provided sufficient a
mounts of the study drug to carry out this protocol for 
the agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the 
study drug, documenting shipment content and condition. Accurate records of all study drug 
dispensed, used, returned, and/or destroyed must be maintained as detailed further in this section. 
The investigator has the overall responsibility for administering/dispensing study drug. Where 
permissible, tasks may be delegated to a qualified designee (e.g., a pharmacist) who is 
adequately trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. 
This delegation must be documented in the applicable study delegation of authority form. 
The investigator or their designee (as documented by [CONTACT_1710]) will place the study drug administration orders and confirm that the 
study drug is only dispensed to subjects included in this study following the procedures set out in 
the study protocol. Each subject will be given only the study drug carrying their treatment 
assignment. All administered,  and/or dispensed medication will be documented in the eCRF s 
and/or other study drug record.   
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515609]-administered study drug is  either to be s
ent to a nominated contractor on behalf of the 
sponsor for destruction or are to be destroyed b
y the site. Study drug being returned to the 
sponsor’s designated contractor must be counte
d and verified by [CONTACT_408801] (or designated CRO). For unused supplies for which the original supplied tamper-
evident feature is verified as intact, the tamper-evident featu
re must not be broken and the 
labeled amount is to be documented in lieu of counting. Shipment return forms, when used, must 
be signed prior to shipment from the site. Returned study
 drug must be packed in a tamper-
evident manner to ensure product integrity. Contact [CONTACT_408802]. Shipment of all returned study
 drug must comply with local, state, 
and national laws. 
With the written agreement of the sp
onsor, unused stock and subject-administered study drug 
may be destroyed at the site or a local facility
. In this case, destruction records identifying what 
was destroyed, when, and how must be obtained with copi[INVESTIGATOR_408731]. 
Destruction of study drug must be in accordance wit
h local, state, and national laws. 
Based on entries in the site’s  drug accountability forms, it must be possible to reconcile study 
drug delivered with those used and returned. All study drug must be accounted for and all 
discrepancies investigated and documented to the sponsor’s sat
isfaction. 
6.[ADDRESS_515610] be assessed at the container/packaging l
evel for unused study drug that is contained within 
the original tamper-evident sealed container (

7.1.1 Screening Period  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening 
Potential subjects are anti
cipated to be identified in emergency departments and/or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_35905] -
patient units. Upon identification, subjects will
 be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria prior 
to receiving ganaxolone IV solution as adjunc
tive therapy.  
Procedures specific to this protocol and not otherwise consid
ered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent from the subject/parent/guardian/LAR has been 
appropriately obtained. Consent for subjects who are at risk for SE may b e obtained prior to an 
SE event, this is also referred 
to as pre-
consenting. Additional details on consent can be found in 
Section 10.3.1. 
A screen failure is a subject who has given inform
ed consent and failed to m
eet the inclusion 
criteria and/or met at least one of the exclusion criteria and has not been ad
ministered the study 
drug. Subjects cannot be rescreened once they have been designated as a screen failu
re per 
incidence of SE. Subjects who fail the screening but ar
e not treated with ganaxolone IV solution 
may be rescreened if they face a new SE event.  
7.1.2 Treatment Period  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Drug Initiati
on Through In-
patient Follow- up Day (Day 1 to Day 3) 
Eligible SE 
subjects receiving standard of care (potential subjects must have failed one 2nd line 
IV AED, administered at an appropriate dose 
and duration to show efficacy, will be given 
adjunctive ganaxolone IV solution. Ganaxolone 
IV solution will be given as an IV bolus with a 
continuous infusion at a rate of 20-80 mg/hou r including a 12-hour study drug taper. The 
pre
sence of SE must be confirmed immediately prior to the study drug bolus. Subjects will 
receive the ganaxolone IV solution as des
cribed in Section 6.

the study to an IV anesthetic drug (a 3rd line treatment and/or 4th line treatment e.g., 
immunosuppressants, magnesium) for seizure 
suppression they will be discontinu
ed from the 
study drug without study drug taper. Any outstanding screening assessments should be 
complet
ed, and Table 1 lists the assessments/procedures that should be collected when the 
decision to stop study drug administration is made and as close as possible to the end of the study 
drug adm
inistration. These subjects will progress to the in-patient follow-up day and the week 2, 
3, and [ADDRESS_515612]/parent/guardian/LAR, as appropriate, will receive a follow-up 
contact [CONTACT_408803] 7 ± 3, 14 ± 3, and 21 ± [ADDRESS_515613] will be followed to closure (see Section 8.1).  Table [ADDRESS_515614] who discontinues or
 early terminates from the study (e.g., due to consent withdrawn) 
should have the early termination procedures completed when early termination is 
being 
considered and as close as possible to the end of the study drug administration. A list of early 
termination assessments can be found in Table 1.  
7.1.4 Additional Care of Subjects After
 the Study 
No aftercare is planned for this study. Subjects should return to their physician’s 
care.

will be maintained in the investigator’s and sponsor’s file
s. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EEG  
EEG  is required for confirmation of NCSE diagnosis. Ideally, continuous EEG monitoring 
should start before study drug initiation to get a baseline assessm
ent and continue through the in-
patient follow-up day. If continuous EEG is not poss
ible or needed to diagnose (for convulsive 
SE) it should be instituted at the earliest possible time after study
 drug initiation (if a pre-dose 
EEG was not performed for the diagnosis of convulsive SE).   
Several study sites may be offered the use of a portable EEG device 
to assist with pre-screening 
of subjects with NCSE. All devices utilized in the study will have received FDA 510(k) 
clearance. It will be at the investigator’s discretion if they feel the device will benefit their site 
and if any institutional approvals are needed to utilize the device.  A copy of the device user 
manual and system specifications will be on file at any site utilizing the device.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Status Epi[INVESTIGATOR_408687] (STESS)  
STESS is a prognostic score relying on four outcome predictors (age, history of seizures, seizure 
type and extent of consciousness impairment).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (PGCS) 
The GCS is a neurological scale which aims to give a reliable and objective way of recording the 
state of a person's consciousness for initial as well as subsequent assessment s. The PGCS is the 
equivalent of the GCS and is used to assess the mental state of child patients.  For specific 
collection time points reference Table 1.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Global Impre
ssion of Severity and Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I, 
respectively) 
The CGI-S and CGI-I a

documented in the subject’s source documents
 and in the medical history eCRF. Conversely, 
abnormalities identified at this first PE that are thought to develop after study drug initiation 
should be recorded as AEs on the AE eCRF page, as deemed by [CONTACT_408804]. 
Changes after the first PE will be recorded as AEs on the AE
 eCRF page, as deemed by [CONTACT_1275]. 
Neurologic examinations should be performed at  the time consent/assent is administered to the 
subject for continued participation and then on the in-pa
tient follow-up day using the Mini 
Mental State Examination (MMSE) as stated in Table 1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse
 Event Collection 
Subjects and their parent/guar
dian/LAR will be qu
estioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs 
have occurred (e.g., “Have you had any health problems since your last visi
t?”). Adverse events 
are collected from the time of fir
st dose of study drug through the last follow-up visit/contact.  
Refer to Section 8, Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Ass
essment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs 
Vital signs include blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] r
ate, oxygen saturation, and temperature. 
Ideally, noninvasive automated monitori
ng of vitals should be started at screening and continue 
until the in-patient follow-up day is complet
ed. If not continuously monitored, vitals should be 
assessed as stated in  Table 1 including collection for subjects who stop study drug without a 
taper or early terminate the study. 
Noninvasi
ve blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate will be measured by [CONTACT_408805] a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 
minutes. Ideally, the same arm 
should be used for all measurements.  
Any deviations from the screening vital signs that are dee

values, indicating if the values are clinically significant or not clinically significant. Abnormal 
clinical laboratory values that are
 unexpected or not explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical condition 
may, at the discretion of the investigator
 or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until 
confirmed, explained, or resolved. 
For drugs of abuse, including alcohol testing, enrollment is not contingent upon results. 
However, if a subject tests positive, it w
ill be at the investigator’s discretion to weigh the risks 
verses benefits for the subject’s continued participation. If the investigator decides to discontinue

All blood g as samples, including FiO 2, PaO 2, and Arterial pH, if collected per the investigator’s 
discretion for subject’s care, from the time of SE diagnosis through the in-patient follow-up day, 
should be recorded in the eCRF. If no sam
ples are collected, a sample will not be required.  
In addition, a blood gas sample should be collect
ed when the decision is made to intubate the 
subject.  The sample should be collected imme
diately prior to or as close as possible to the time 
of intubation.     
Pregnancy Test  
As described in Table [ADDRESS_515618] as soon as possible after study drug initiation. It is 
at the sites’ discretion whether to perform
 a urine or serum pregnancy test. Enrollment is not 
contingent upon results. However, if a subject has a positive test result, it will be at the 
investigators discretion to weigh the risks verses benefits
 for the subjects continued participation.  
If the investigator decides to discontinue the study drug, please refer to Section 4.5.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Electrocardiogra phy 
ECG should be col
lected after the subjec
t has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_21683] 5 minutes. 
If abnormal results are observed, the investigator will assess c

The FOUR Score is a clinical grading scale in the assessment of patients with impaired level of 
consciousness.  The FOUR Score is a 17-point scale (with potential scores ranging from 0-16).  
Decreasing FOUR Score is associated with worsening levels of consciousness.  The FOUR Score 
assesses four domains of neurological function: eye responses, motor responses, brain stem 
reflexes, and breathing pattern.  The FOUR Score should be collected at  the timepoints noted in 
Table 1. 
7.2.4 Others  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Pharmacology Blood Sample Collection and Handling Procedures 
Blood sam
ples will be collected at the times specified in Table 1. The sponsor’s expectation is 
that the investigator wi
ll ensure that every effort is made to collect all pharmacokinetic blood 
samples at the precise protocol scheduled time. Pharmacokinetic blood collection must not 
deviate from the nominal collection time set forth in the protocol by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_515619] study drug initiation or by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_515620] study drug initiation. Samples drawn outside these parameters will be 
considered a protocol deviation.  
Venous blood samples (2 mL) will be drawn from indwelling catheters or by [CONTACT_408807] K2EDTA Vacutainer® tubes (lavender top
), capped, mixed by [CONTACT_8536] (×10), and chilled 
immediately on crushed ice. If using indwelling catheters, 
they should be kept patent with 
isotonic saline and the saline should be withdrawn (1 mL) and discarded before the blood sample 
is taken. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_408738], if 
used, must be documented as a concomitant medication. If venous blood sample collection is not 
possible an arterial sample may be collected. The type of sample will be recorded in the source 
documents and eCRF.   
If study drug is administered via central access, th
e PK sample cannot be collected from any 
central access ports.  If study drug is administered via venous access, the PK sample must be 
collected via the contra-lateral arm of the study drug arm. The location of study drug access and 
location of PK sample collection should be documented in the subject’s source.  If the PK 
sample cannot be collected due to poor venous access and the study drug infusion site is the only 
viable option, the specimen should not be collected and the reason for non-collection 
documented in the subject’s source.   
Details regarding sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment to the bioanalytical 
vendor are described in the Biospecimen Manual. The f
reezer temperature where these samples 
are stored must be controlled, monitored, and recorded during the storage period until the 
samples are shipped on dry ice to Quest Pharm
aceutical Services for analysis. The study monitor 
must be notified of any temperature excursions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Shipment of Plasma Pharmacokinetic Samples 
Unless agreed upon by [CONTACT_456], within approximately 1 week after subjects complete the in-
patient follow-up day, the site will ship the primary plasma samples to QPS. Upon notification of 
receipt of the primary sample
s by [CONTACT_408808], the backup samples will be shipped to the bioanalytical 
laboratory. Refer to the Biospecimen Manual for details regarding specimen shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plasma Drug Assay Methodology 
Plasma concentrations will be measured using the most current validated liquid chromatography 
with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method. Other metabolites may be monitored or 
quantitated as appropriate. Raw data will be stored in the archive of the designated bioanalytical 
laboratory.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Cerebral Spi[INVESTIGATOR_17106] (CSF) 
If a subject has a lumbar puncture for the collection of CSF per investigator’s discretion as part 
of their
 care and there is adequate volume, a sample will be aliquoted for future analysis of 
ganaxolone.  If multiple lumbar punctures are performed, a sample from each puncture is 
requested.  If not collected or not enough CSF is collected to provide a sample for the study, a 
sample will not be required.   
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515621] be 
notified of any temperature excursions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neurosteroid Blood Sa
mple Collection and Handling Procedures 
Blood samples will be collected at the times specified in Table 1. Venous blood samples (2.5–6.0 
mL) will be drawn into  K2EDTA Vacutainer® tubes (lavender 
top), capped, mixed by [CONTACT_8536] 
(×10), and chilled immediately on crushed ice. 
If using indwelling catheters, they should be kept 
patent with isotonic saline and the saline should be withdrawn (1 mL) and discarded before the 
blood sample is taken. Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_408739], if used, must be documented as a concomitant medication.  
If study drug is administered via central access, the neurosteroid sample cannot be collected from 
any central access ports.  If study drug is administered via venous access, the neurosteroid 
sample must be collected via the contra-lateral arm of the study drug arm. The location of study 
drug access and location of neurosteroid sample collection should be documented in the subject’s 
source.  If the neurosteroid sample cannot be collected due to poor venous access and the study 
drug infusion site is the only viable option, the specimen should not be collected and the reason 
for non-collection documented in the subject’s source.   
If venous blood sample collection is not possible an arterial sample may be collected. The type 
of sample will be recorded in the source docum
ents and eCRF. 
Details regarding sample processing, storage, and shipm
ent to the bioanalytical 
storage/laboratory vendor are describ
ed in the Biospecimen Manual. The freezer temperature 
where the samples are stored must
 be controlled, monitored, and recorded during the storage 
period until the samples are shipped on dry ice 
to the bioanalysis storage/laboratory vendor. The 
study monitor must be notified of any temperature excursions.  
Specific col
lection times can be found in Table 1.

During this study, it is expected that some sites (e.g., children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) will collect smaller 
volumes of blood from subjects per their local laboratory standards.  The ranges in Table [ADDRESS_515626] t
he possible range for adult and child verses a child-only hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The tot
al blood 
volume coul
d be as low as approximately 62 mL for pediatric-only verses 192.6 mL for other 
hospit als and up to approxim
ately 88 mL for pediatric-only and 278.3 mL for other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s.  
As noted in Table 1, sev
eral of the collection poin
ts are considered optional; however, to provide 
the most conservative estimate of the blood volume drawn, these option collections have been 
included in Table 4 and Table 5.  
Note: The am
ount of blood to be drawn for each assessment is an estimate.  The amount of blood 
to be drawn may vary according to the instructions provided by [CONTACT_408809]. When m
ore than one blood assessment is to be done at a single 
timepoint/period, if they require the same type of tube, the assessments may be combined. 
  
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_515627]; it does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tem
porally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product28.  
As this study allows for pre-consenting of subj
ects, all AEs will be collected from the time of 
first dose of study drug until the defined follow-up per
iod stated in Section 7.1.3.  Where 
possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of symptoms shoul
d be recorded. If a diagnosis has not 
been made, then each symptom should be listed individually.  All AEs should be recorded on the 
appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source docum
ents.  In addition to untoward AEs, 
unexpected benefits outside the study drug indication should also be 
recorded on the AE eCRF 
page. 
All AEs must be followed for the durations described below. For AEs followed to c
losure, this 
indicates that an outcome is reached, stabiliz
ation is achieved (the investigator does not expect 
any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained.  When 
appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so 
that resolution of event(s) can be 
documented. 
For subjects who: 
a. Have [ADDRESS_515628] follow-up visit/contact.  
b. Stop study drug administration without a study drug taper but continue with the follow-
up visits, all adverse events will be collec
ted through the in-patient follow-up day. During 
the weekly follow-up visits, only ongoing AEs and new AEs assessed by 
[CONTACT_408810]. All SAEs r
egardless of relationship to study 
drug will be recorded from the time of 1st dose through the last follow-up visit/contact. 
Additionally, AEs of UTI, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquir
ed/ventilator-associated pneumonia, MI, sepsis 
from any source, critical illness myopathy/neuropathy and significant hypotension 
requiring vasopressor support will be recorded as AEs regardl
ess of relatedness. 
c. Early terminate from the study, prior to discontinuation as much information as is 
available should be recorded on any on-going AEs/SAEs and AEs/SAEs that may hav e 
led to the early termination. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_515629] be recorded as 
new AEs on the appropriate eCRF page. 
The medical assessment of severity is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]: 
Mild:            A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily 
living. 
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention.  The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort, but poses no significant 
or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. 
Severe:  A type of AE that interrupts usual acti
vities of daily living, that significantly 
affects clinical status, or that may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
8.1.2 Relationship Categorization 
A physician/investigator must make t
he assessment of relationship between the study drug and 
each AE.  The investigator should decide whether, in their me dical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event m
ay have been caused by [CONTACT_5257].  If there is no valid 
reason for suggesting a relationship,
 the AE should be classified as “not related.” Otherwise, if 
there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause-and-
effect relationship between the study 
drug and the occurrence of the AE, the AE should be 
considered “related.” The causali
ty assessment must be documented in the source document. 
The following additional guidance may be helpful: 
Term  Relationship definition  
Related  The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of 
the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or 
suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_423] ’s medical condition, othe r therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or 
accident.  
  
Not related  The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1604] , such as the 
subject ’s underlying medical condition, concomitant therapy, or 
accident , and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists 
between the investigational product and the event.  
  
8.1.[ADDRESS_515630] be recorded during the course of the study in the eCRF.  Outcomes are 
as follows: 
 Fatal

Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
 Not recovered/not resolved  
 Recovered/resolved 
 Recovered/resolved with sequela
e  
 Recovering/resolving 
 Unknown
 
8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease Under Study 
Sym
ptoms o
f the diseas
e under study should not be classified as AEs as long as they are within 
the normal day- to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the 
efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worse
ning of the symptoms 
should be recorded as an AE. Specifically, SE signs and symptoms that were pres ent at study 
entry and that varied in intensity over the duration of study treatment are not considered AEs 
unless in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_408741]. However, if 
all seizure activity resolved and the 
subject returned to baseline status, but SE recurred, the event 
would then be recorded as an SAE.  
8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations 
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory, v
ital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE 
if the change is clinically significant or if, during treatment with the study drug, a shift of a 
parameter is observed from a normal
 value to an abnormal value, or there is a further worsening 
of an already abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the 
reference range, the duration until return to the reference ran
ge (either while continuing 
treatment or after the end of treatment with the s
tudy drug), and the range of variation of the 
respective parameter within its reference range must be taken into consideration. 
For subjects who complete the study and don’t progress to an IV anesthetic drug (a 3rd line 
treatment) for seizure suppression, if, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal 
clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG values that were not
 present in the pretreatment findings 
observed closest to the start of study drug initiation
, further investigations should be performed 
until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation 
(e.g., concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. 
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria a
nd the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinically 
significant and therefore represents an AE.

specified in the emergency contact [CONTACT_59747].  If a 
subject has a positive test result, it will be at
 the investigator’s discretion to weigh the risks 
verses benefits for the su

Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and 
condition of the infant.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information 
within 30 calendar days after the initial notification and approximate
ly 30 calendar days after 
delivery.  
Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality 
are considered SAEs and must be reported as outlined in Section 8.2 of the protocol using the 
Marinus SAE Fax Cover Letter.  Non-serious AEs are to b
e reported as per clinical electronic 
Case Report Form guidelines.  Note : An elective abortion is not considered an SAE
. 
In addition t

8.1.7 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as
 defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
per the SAE reporting procedure whether or not it results in an AE/SAE as described in 
Section 8.2.  Note: The 24-hour reporting requirement for S
AEs does not apply to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these 
result in an SAE.  
The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than one category. 
 Abuse: Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of a study drug for a nonmedical purpose 
(e.g., to alter one’s state 
of consciousness or get high) in a manner
 that may be 
detrimental to the individual and/or society. 

 Misuse: Intentional use of a study drug other than as directed or indicated at any dose.  
(Note: This includes a situation 
in which the study drug is not 
used as directed at the dose 
prescribed by [CONTACT_760].) 
 Overdose: Intentional o
r unintentional intake of a dose of a study drug exceeding a 
prespecified total daily dose of the product.  
 Medication 
err
or: An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administering, and/or use of 
a study drug.  For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined 
below. 
Cases of subjects missing doses of the study
 drug are not considered reportable as medication 
errors.

which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators.
 However, the 
Investigator’ s Brochure has not been updated with the details 
of the 1 mg/mL ganaxolone IV 
solution. The formulation details have been added to Section 6
 and will be added to the 
Investigator’ s Brochure at the annual update.

 Medical Monitor within 24-hours of the first 
awareness of the event.  Note: The 24-hour reporting requirement for SAEs
 does not apply to 
reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication err
ors (see Section 8.1.7 ) unless they result in 
an SAE.  
The investigator m

8.2.[ADDRESS_515634] medical occurrence (whether
 considered to be related to study drug or 
not) that at any dose: 
 Results in death 
 Is li
fe-threatening. Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the subject was at
 risk of death at the ti
me of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused dea
th if it were more severe. 
 Requir es in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], which are the result of elective or pr
eviously scheduled surgery for 
preexisting conditions that have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be 
classified as SAEs.  For example, an admiss
ion for a previously scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, a complication 
resulting from a

 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event.  Note: Importan
t medical events that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_408743], 
based on appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the 
patient and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent on
e of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronc
hospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_515636]
s, all SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) 
are collected from the time of first dose of study drug until the defined follow-up period stated in 
Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_515637] be reported to the Marinus Safety Departm
ent and the CRO/Marinus 
Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_515638] awareness of the event.  
In addition, any SAE considered “related” to the study drug and discovered by [CONTACT_408812] [ADDRESS_515639]’s death (i.e., th
e SAE was noted as the primary cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome, with the da
te of death recorded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of d
eath that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, witho
ut a resolution date recorded. 
For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another study drug action was previously taken (e.g., the drug was interrupted, reduced, or 
withdrawn), the action taken with the study drug should be r
ecorded as “dose not changed” or 
“not applicable” (if the subject never received the study drug). The study drug action of 
“withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a result of the subject’s death
.

Reporting 
The sponsor or its delegate is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities in the 
[LOCATION_002] of related, unexpected SAEs. 
In a

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 Data Collection 
The investigator’
s author
ized site personnel must enter the information required by [CONTACT_103365]. A study monitor will visit each site in accordan
ce with the monitoring plan and 
review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered 
in the eCRF will be addressed by [CONTACT_1746].  
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting
. Once a subject is enrolled, the site should initiate data entry 
within 5 business days of study drug initiation
 with the goal of having all data entered within 4- 
weeks of study drug initiation. 
9.2 Clinical Data Manageme
nt 
Data are to be entered
 into a clinical database as specified in the CRO Data Management Plan 
and the eCRF Completion Guidelines. Quality control and data validation procedures are applied 
to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. 
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the c
linical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner. 
9.3 Statistical Analysis Process 
The study will be analyzed by [CONTACT_10196].  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the efficacy and safety data, as well as describe the 
approaches to be taken for 
summarizing other study information, such as subject disposition, demographics, and baseline 
characteristics, study drug exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The SAP will also 
incl
ude a description of how missing, unused, and spurious data will be addressed. 
 
Confidential Page 80 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
To preserve the integrity of the statistical analysis and study conclusions, the SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock and the sponsor being unblinded to treatment assignments. 
All statistical analyses will b
e performed using SAS® (SAS Institute, Cary, NC [ZIP_CODE]).  
R (R  Foundation for Statistical Computi
ng) may be used for the predictive probability 
calculations used in the interim analyses. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_515641]. An O’Brien
-Fleming error spending function will be 
used with two predefined interim analyses. The two interim analyses will occur after 
approximately [ADDRESS_515642] a minimum of 
their critical fields cleaned.  
Using a total one-sided 
Type I error of 2.5%, critical values for the two interim and one final 
analysis are noted in Table 6.

In the double-blind group a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be assembled to review the 
safety and efficacy data at various intervals of the study.  Only the unblinded DMC will be privy 
to these interim analyses and may recommend the trial stop for early success or safety findings. 
Likewise, at each interim analysis, Bayesi
an predictive probabilities for success at the maximum 
(N=242) sample size will be calculated.  If the predictive probability of success is < 5%, then the 
DMC may recommend the trial stops for futility.  These are non-binding futility analyses, e.g., 
the Type I error = 2.5% even without these futility analyses.  The Bayesian pre
dictive 
probabilities will use non-informative Beta (1/2, 1/2) priors for both unknown response rates and 
be conducted using the methodology described in Savil
le et al., 2014 (Clinical Trials).

9.7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the 
number of subjects who did not require an IV 
anesthetic drug (a 3rd line treatment) for
 SE treatment within the first 24 hours after study drug 
initiation. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be

analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_2329] a logistic model that includes treatm
ent group as a factor 
along with factors controlling for age, GCS, and history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  One-sided tests will be 
performed and compared to the critical values shown in Section
 9.4, thus ensuring overall 
1-sided Type I error  0.025.

Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording, Access, and Retention of Source Data and Study Documents 
Original source data to be reviewed during this study will include, but are not limited to, the 
subject’s medical file and original clinical laboratory reports.  
All key data must be recorded in the subject’s medical records. 
The investigator must permit authorized representatives of the sponsor; the respective national, 
local, or foreign regulatory authorities; the IRB/EC; and auditors to inspect facilities and to have 
direct access to original source records relevant to this study, regardless of media. 
The CRA/study monitor (and auditors, IRB/EC, or regulatory inspectors) may check the eCRF 
entries against the source documents. The consent form includes a statement by [CONTACT_408820] w th
e monitor/auditor from the sponsor o r its representatives, national or 
local regulatory authorities, or the IRB/EC to have access to source data (e.g., subject’s medical 
file, appointment books, original laboratory reports, X-rays, etc.).  
These records must be made available within reasonable times for inspection and duplication, if 
required, by a properly authorized representative of any regulatory agency (e.g., the US Food and 
Drug Administration [FDA], European Medicines Agency [EMA], [LOCATION_006] Medicines and 
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) or an auditor. 
Essential documents must be maintained according to ICH GCP requirements and may not be 
destroyed without written permission from the sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Audit/Inspection 
To ensure compliance with relevant regulations, data generated by [CONTACT_38922], for example, the US FDA (as well as other US 
national and local regulatory authorities), the EMA, the [LOCATION_006] Medicines and Healthcare Products 
Regulatory Agency, other regulatory authorities, the sponsor or its representatives, and the 
IRB/EC for each site. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Financial Disclosure 
The investigator is required to disclose any financial arrangement during the study and for 1 year 
after, whereby [CONTACT_408821], or other payments the investigator received from the sponsor. The 
following information is collected: any significant payments from the sponsor or subsidiaries, 
such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment, or retainer for 
ongoing consultation or honoraria; any proprietary interest in study drug ; and any significant 
equity interest in the sponsor or subsidiaries as defined in 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations 54 2(b) (1998). 
10.3 Ethical Considerations 
10.3.1  Informed Consent 
It is the responsi
bility of the investigator to obtain written informed consent and assent, where 
applicable,  from all study subjects prior to any study-related procedures, including screening 
 
Confidential Page 88 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
assessments. As the disease under consideration is a life-threatening condition for which subjects 
presenting may not be capable of providing consent or assent for themselves, a 
parent/guardian/LAR will be requir
ed to sign upon identification of the subject for study 
participation. Consent /assent will be administered per the institutions IRB/EC policy and may 
vary across sites, i.e. some sites may be able to consent/assent over the phone or other 
communication methods. At the first opportunity, consent and assent should be obtained from 
the subject directly. Alternatively, co
nsent and assent for subjects who are at risk for SE may be 
obtained prior to an SE event through a pre
-consenting process. The period of time the pre-
consent/assent is valid will b
e determined by [CONTACT_281269][INVESTIGATOR_408746]/EC.  However, reconsenting 
will be needed should the consent/assent be updated at any point during the study. 
All consent and assent documentation must be in accordance with applicable regulations and 
GCP .  Each subject, subject’s parent,
 guardian, or the LAR, as applicable, is requested to sign 
and date the subject ’s informed consent form or a
 certified translation, if applicable, after the 
subject parent, guardian, or LAR has received and read (or been read) the written subject 
information and received an explanation of what the study inv
olves, including but not limited to 
the objectives, potential benefits and risk, inconveniences, and the subject’s rights and 
responsibilities. A copy of the informed consent and assent documentation (i.e,  a complete set of 
subject information sheets and fully execut
ed signature [CONTACT_1787]) must be given to the subject, 
subject’s parent, guardian, or the LA
R, as applicable. This document may require translation into 
the local language. Signed consent forms must remain in each subject’s study file and must be 
available for verification at any time. 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1682] a copy of the consent form and assent that 
was reviewed by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and received their 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval. A copy of the 
IRB/EC’s written favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]/approval of these documents 
must be provided to the 
sponsor prior to the start of the study unless it is agreed to and documented (abiding by 
[CONTACT_1761]) prio
r to study start that another party (i.e., sponsor 
or coordinating principal investigator) is responsible for this action. Additionally, if the IRB/EC 
requires modification of the sample subject information and consent document provided by [CONTACT_103], the documentation supporting this requirement must be provided to the sponsor. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_515650] or Ethics Committee 
For sites outside the EU, it is the responsibility of the investigator to submit this protocol, the 
informed consent document (approved by [CONTACT_38924]), relevant supporting 
information,  and all types of subject recruitment information to the IRB/EC for review, and all 
must be approved prior to site initiation. 
Responsibility for coordinating with IRBs/ECs is defined in the investigator agreement. 
Prior to implementing changes in the study, the sponsor and the IRB/EC must approve any 
revisions of all informed consent documents and amendments to the protocol unless there is a 
subject safety issue. 
Study drug supplies will not be released until the sponsor or designee has received written 
IRB/EC approval of and copi[INVESTIGATOR_10158]. 
 
Confidential Page 89 of 100 IND 129433   Marinus Pharmaceuticals , Inc. 
Protocol 1042 -SE-2001    Version 5.0  
For sites outside the EU, the investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_1683]/EC apprised of the 
progress of the study and of any changes made to the protocol, but in any case, at least once a 
year.  This can be done by [CONTACT_408822], or for multicenter 
studies, it can be done by [CONTACT_408823], according to national 
provisions. The investigator must also keep the local
 IRB/EC informed of any SAEs and 
significant AEs. 
10.[ADDRESS_515651] (HIPAA) of 1996.  
A site that is not a covered entity as defined by [CONTACT_408824]/sponsor. 
The confidentiality of recor
ds that may be able to identify 
subjects will be protected in 
accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines. 
After subjects, parent, guardian, or the LAR have consented to take part in the study, the sponsor 
and/or its representatives review the medical records and data collected during the study. These 
records and data may, in addition, be reviewed by [CONTACT_408825], including the following: independent 
auditors who validate the data on behalf of the sponsor
; third parties with whom the sponsor may 
develop, register, or market ganaxolone; national or local regulatory authorities; and the IRB/EC 
that gave approval for the study to proceed. The s
ponsor and/or its representatives accessing the 
records and data will take all 
reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable laws, 
regulations, and guidelines to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities. 
Subjects are each assigned a unique identifying number; however, their initials and date of birth 
may also be collected and used to assist the sponsor in verifying the accuracy of the data (e.g., to 
confirm
 that laboratory results have been assigned to the correct subject).  
The results of studies containing subjects’ unique identifying numbers, relevant medical records, 
and possibly initials and dates of birth will
 be recorded. They may be transferred to, and used in, 
other countries that may not afford t
he same level of protection that applies within the countries 
where this study is conducted. The purposes of any such transfer would include to support 
regulatory submissions, to conduct new data analyses to publish or present the study results, and 
to answer questions asked by [CONTACT_1775]. 
10.5 Study Results/Publication Policy 
Marinus will endeavor to publish the results of a
ll qualifying, applicable, and covered studies 
according to external guidelines in a timely manner regardless of whether the outcomes are 
perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, Marinus adheres to external guidelines 
(e.g., Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee, which may 
be done for large, multicenter Phase 
[ADDRESS_515652] undergo appropriate technical and 
intellectual property review, with Marinus agreement to publish prior to release of information.  
The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’
s proprietary information existing either at the 
commencement of the study or generated during the study. To the extent permitted by [CONTACT_38927], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_59702] (or share with other authors) the 
copyright on his/her publications. To the extent that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10159], 
joint, or  shared rights, the principal investigator
 [INVESTIGATOR_10160] a perpetual, irrevocable, 
royalty-free license to make and di
stribute copi[INVESTIGATOR_10161]. 
The term “publication” refers to any public disclosure, including original research articles, 
review articles, oral presentations, abstr
acts and posters at medical congresses, journal 
supplements, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opi[INVESTIGATOR_10162], book chapters, electronic 
postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, 
electronic, oral, or other form. 
Subject to the terms of the par ag
raph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the 
study results, and any background information provided by [CONTACT_59766].  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication 
that incorporates the sponsor’s 
confidential information shall be submitted for publ
ication without the sponsor’s prior written 
agreement to publish and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least [ADDRESS_515653] publication of the study results shall be made 
by [CONTACT_10208]’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication 
of the compi[INVESTIGATOR_38865].  If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to 
a journal for publication by [CONTACT_10209] 18-month period after conclusion, 
abandonment, or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be 
no multicenter study publication of the study results, an investigator may individually publish the 
study results from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, 
however, acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the singl
e-site data being presented. 
Unless otherwise required by [CONTACT_10210], or the forum in which 
it is made, authorship will comply with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
current standards. Participation as an investigator does not confer any rights to authorship of 
publications.

In the Primary Objective, P rima1y Endpoin t, and Secondary Endpoint , Synop sis, Sections 2.2.1, 9.7.1, and 
removed the wording "additional IV AEDs", "Additional 2nd line 9.7.2 
therapy ", and "subsequent AEDs" to simplify the study and target the 
key next medication (IV anesthetics) that physician s would see benefit in 
a.voiding. 
To provide consistency across sites, specified that the study dtug should Synop sis, Sections 3.[ADDRESS_515655] taken dtug for

and the second option, immediately stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_408765] 2 hour s or who 
are progre ssing to an IV anesthetic dtug (a 3rd line treatment ) for seizure 
suppression. In this second scenario no taper is needed as the subject 
will be recei ving increasing doses of an anesthetic agent. 
Provided additional guidance that any subject who progre sses to an IV Synop sis, Sections 4.5, 5.2.2 , 6.2.3 , 
anesthetic dtug (a. 3rd line treatment) fo r seizure suppression should and 7.1.[ADDRESS_515656] the study dtug stopped and be discontinued from the 
study. As possible, any outstanding screening procedure s and early 
tennina.tion proc edures should be completed . No additional procedure s 
will be conduc ted other than following up on any ongoing AE/SAE s and 
the associated concomitan t medications related to these AEISAE s. 
Added clarifica tion that if the paitial seizure burden improvement is Synop sis, Sections 6.2.3 and 7.2.2 
betv.• een 33-50% the investigator can contac t the Medica l Moni tor to 
discuss if study dtug treatm ent beyond the initial [ADDRESS_515657] discontinue s the study on the saine day that an Synop sis and Section 7.1.3 
assessment has already been collec ted, that the assessment doesn 't need 
to be repea ted for the early te1mina tion procedure s unless there is a. 
change since the previous assessment collection.

Confirmed that the Medical Monitor does not need to be contac ted if a Section 4.5.[ADDRESS_515660] is being discontinued because they are progre ssing to an IV 
anesthetic dmg (a 3rd line treatment) for seizure suppression . 
As the study allows for pre-consenting of subject s the wording was Sections 6.2.2, [IP_ADDRESS], 8.1, 8. 1.6, 
updated to reflect that subject number s will be assigned prior to dosing and 8.2.4 
instead of as they consent to take part in the study and that adverse 
events, seriou s adverse ev ents and pregnancy will be collec ted from the 
time of study dmg initiation and not from the site of consent signature. 
Clarified that during the study dtug taper if the infusion rate become s too Section 6.2.3 
low to sustain the infusion line that it can be discontinued at that point. 
Investigator ' s Brochure entty was updated to reflect the cun-ent version Reference s

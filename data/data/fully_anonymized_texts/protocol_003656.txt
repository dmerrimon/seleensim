DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH  
10: Description of Res earch  
Benzo[ a]pyrene (BaP) is the most intensely studied polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), 
environmental pollutants formed naturally from forest fires, volcanoes, etc. Anthropogenic sources 
include coal, tobacco smoke, creosotes, coal tar- based pavement sealants, petroleum products 
including diesel and gasoline, wood and mixtures from production of coke, aluminum and graphite, among others
1.  BaP is a class 1, known human carcinogen (Internal Agency for Research on Cancer )2 
currently 8th on the ATSD R3 (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, a division of the 
Center s for Disease Control  and Prevention ) list of agents of concern at high -priority pollutant sites. 
BaP is strongly associated with lung cancer (number one cause of cancer mortalit y).  Previously,  EPA 
IRIS estimate d the oral exposure slope factor for lifetime cancer risk at 7.3 mg/ (kg-day) (Linear 
Extrapolation Model, no threshold)  but recently adjusted this risk factor to (1 mg/kg -day)4,5.  This 
risk assessment is based on high dose rodent studies . Few studies have been done examining PAHs 
in human plasma and none following administration of defined doses.  
Our h ypothesis is that  plasma levels of [14C]-BaP and metabolites will exhibit a dose -response 
consistent with predictions based on a previously developed Physiologically -Based Pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK) model for BaP6. This hypothesis will be tested by  [CONTACT_84798]-dosing individuals with [14C]-BaP at 
levels of 25, 50, 100 and 250 ng  (2.7-27 nCi) . To date, our accelerator mass spectrometry ( AMS ) 
studies with PAHs have employed a single dose7,8. Pharmacokinetic parameters for [14C]-BaP and 
metabolites will be assessed by [CONTACT_558324] -AMS in plasma and urine  collected over [ADDRESS_733183] National 
Laboratory  (PNNL)
6. The results from this study will be disseminated in peer- review ed 
toxicology/environmental health journals, at scientific meetings and provided to the U.S. EPA for incorporation into their risk asse ssment models. The experimental procedure employs accelerator 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 4 of 22  mass spectrometry (AMS) for analysis.  AMS (103-109 more sensitive for 14C than scintillation 
counting) is increasingly used to determine pharmacokinetics of drugs under development.  A dose 
given to human volunteers of no more than 1/100 the expected therapeutic dose or less than 100 
µg of [14C]-labeled drug (usually 100 -200 nCi) is referred to as “microdosing” (Phase 0 studies or 
eIND studies).  This approach has been validated for exploratory clinical development by [CONTACT_558325] ( CREAM  Trial) and the EU Microdosing 
AMS Partnership Programme (EUMAPP). This early use of human subjects in drug development is consistent with the goals of the FDA Critical Path Initiative and AMS in exploratory IND applications has been addressed by [CONTACT_8415]
9.  AMS has been used in toxicology and carcinogenesis studies. AMS 
sensitivity allows the study of pharmacokinetics and DNA binding of environmental contaminants known to be animal carcinogens and suspected of being human carcinogens including the cooked 
meat mutagens PhIP and MeIQx, the mycotoxin and human hepatocarcinogen AFB
1, in addition to 
BaP10.   It is noteworthy that our group has successfully completed AMS studies with AFB 1 and the 
PAH, dibenzo[ def,p ]chrysene ( DBC)7,8,11.   IARC estimates that a non -smoker, not exposed 
occupationally, will receive a daily dose of 270 -700 ng of BaP ; about 95% through the diet2.  The 
European Union maximum limit for BaP in fish is 2,000 ng/Kg f.w. and the FDA Limit of Concern (LOC) is 35,000 n g/Kg.  The dose of 25 ng would be the equivalent of eating 12.5 or 0.7 g of fish at 
the EU, and FDA limits, respectively. The World Health Organization has set an estimated safe daily  
lifetime (70 years for a 70 Kg individual, cancer endpoint) exposure to BaP of [ADDRESS_733184] to the internal dose of [14C] of 2.7 -27 nCi, this represents 0.3 -3% the dose given in a 
common diagnostic procedure (14C-urea test for Helicobacter )13 and 4 and 5 orders of magnitude 
lower than a recently published paper dosing people with 300 µCi of epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874]14.  Therefore, from 
the standpoint of both chemical and radioisotope dose to the volunteers, this protocol represents de minimus  risk and that was the finding of the FDA (IND 117175) in a “study may proceed” 
determination for our current study  (IRB protocol 5644)  which uses a dose of 46 ng (5 nCi).  
 
11. Back g
round Justification  
 
An estimated 95% of daily BaP exposure ( 270-700 ng, non -occupational; non -tobacco) is dietary1. 
Especially high in charcoal- broiled or smoked meats and cheeses, almost all foods contain 
appreciable amounts.  Exposure to PAHs, including BaP, is associated with cancer of the lung, skin, 
stomach, ovary and testis  in addition to  non-cancer chronic disease  such as asthma, cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes2.  The fetus and infant are especially susceptible to PAH exposure. Even though 
PAHs are ubiquitous environmental pollutants of potential concern to human health, there is little 
or no information on the  pharmacokinetics of PAHs in humans.  With the utilization of AMS located 
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL), interfaced with  Ultra -High Pressure Liquid 
Chromatography ( UHPLC), it is possible to measure [14C]-isotopi[INVESTIGATOR_897] -labeled BaP and meta bolites 
over time in human plasma and urine following administration of micro -doses.   
The oral exposure slope factor for cancer risk (70 years, 70 Kg adult) for BaP using a linear, non -
threshold model (EPA -IRIS)5,15 was ,until recently,  7.3 mg/kg -day-1 when EPA issued a new report on 
BaP and lowered the cancer risk slop factor to 1 mg/(kg -day).5  This risk assessment is based on high 
dose (1 -100 mg/kg -day) exposures in rodents - 5-[ADDRESS_733185] some populations.  Studies, including 
our own, with PAH mixtures indicate the linear extrapolated dose may under- estimate actual human 
risk using the Relative Potency Factor ( RPF) approach4,15. The RPF approac h assumes linear 
pharmacokinetics for PAHs and their metabolites with dose but this has never been assessed in 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 5 of 22  humans. For comparison , our  preliminary results  show  the plasma levels, as determined by [CONTACT_558326] (highest concentration obtained) after dosing individuals with 46 ng [14C]-BaP, were ~ 8 fM  
(femto(10—15 moles/L)) , or 107 lower than an in vitro  study (50 nM ) showing no adverse impact on 
hepatocytes.    The sensitivity of AMS allow s for  micro -dosing with [14C]-BaP in humans with de 
minimus  risk to determine [14C]-BaP and individual metabolites in the low fM range (2 -20 
femtograms/mL plasma).  Our premise is - the best model for humans is humans. Utilizing PBPK 
models, we can provide a much more accurate estimate of BaP levels in human tissues following 
exposure at environmental levels as well as individual metabolites representing reduced or enhanced risk.    
 
12. Multi -center Study  – N/A 
LLNL will only receive coded, de -identified samples for analysis.  Pacific Northwest National Labs will 
only receive coded, de -identified data for analysis.  
 13. External Research or Recruitment Site(s)  - N/
 A 
 14. Subject Population  
• Subject  characteristics: Male and female  subjects, 21-65 years of age  
• Subject ethnicity and race – Subject race and ethnicity are expected to reflect the local 
population demographics. No attempt will be made to exclude or enrich for any ethnic or racial 
group. Our study is small, so we will recruit from the local population with English language skills 
sufficient to comprehend study consent documents and the potential risk and benefits involved in study participation. We will not be preparing documents in an alternative language, so it is possib le that the ethnicity and race of our study subjects may be somewhat different from the 
distribution in the local community.  
• Total target enrollment number: Up to [ADDRESS_733186] a high percentage of screen failure . If a large number 
of study enrollees qualify to participate in the study, we will stop enrolling subjects prior to reaching our maximum  enrollment figure.  
• Description of any vulnerable population(s): We will not involve vulnerable p opulations including 
children (20 years of age or younger ), pregnant women, prisoners, non -English speakers, non -
literate subjects, and adults lacking capacity to consent.  
• Inclusion  and exclusion  criteria:  
Inclusion criteria for
  women : 
o Age 21 -65 (inclusive)  
o Must  be post -menopausal or have had surgical sterilization to eliminate any possibility for 
fetal exposure  
o Willing to defer blood donation for one month  before , throughout, and one month after 
completion of  study activities  
o Willing to avoid consuming cruciferous vegetables, I3C or DIM supplements,  smoked or 
cured meat or cheeses , or charcoal- grilled meats for 2 weeks prior to and during each study

Inclusion criteria for m en: 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 6 of 22  o Age 21 -65 (inclusive)  
o Willing to defer blood donation for one month before, throughout, and one month after 
completion of study activities  
o Willing to avoid consuming cruciferous vegetables, I3C or DIM supplements,  smoked or 
cured meat or cheeses , or charcoal- grilled meats for 2 weeks prior to and during each study 
cycle   (gas grilled foods acceptable)  
Exclusion criteria  for b oth men and women : 
o Smoker  (tobacco or other substances)  or use of smokeless tobacco in past [ADDRESS_733187] gut motility  or nutrient absorption (e.g. 
cholestyramine, sucralfate,  orlistat,  pro- or anti- motility agents ) 
o History of gastrointestinal surgery ( e.g. bariatric surgery, cholecystectomy) or 
gastrointestinal disorder (Crohn’s disease, celiac disease,  IBS, or colitis)  
o Current or history of  kidney or liver disease  
o Prior high -dose 14C expos ure from medical tests. ( micro -dose 14C  exposure not exclusionary)  
o Occupational PAH exposure ( e.g. roofers, asphalt pavers, fire -fighters, etc.)  
• Description of any vulnerable population(s): We will not involve vulnerable populations including children 20 years of age or younger, pregnant women, prisoners, non- English speakers, non -
literate subjects, and adults lacking capacity to consent.  
No attem pt will be made to exclude or enrich for any ethnic or racial group; however, 
participants who cannot clearly understand the risks and benefits of the research as 
communicated to them in verbal and written English will be excluded. We do not have the resou rces to translate documents into other languages or to provide translators over the course 
of the study, so the demographics represented in the study subjects may be different from the distribution found in the local community.  
• Recruitment: We will recruit  subjects through postings in OSU Today,  Craigslist, local regional and 
local media, and flyer advertisements placed on the OSU campus and throughout the Corvallis area (See attached recruitment documents). We also anticipate recruiting from the LIFE regis try 
maintained by [CONTACT_558327] (CHAR) at OSU. Except students and 
employees directly supervised by [CONTACT_153532], w e will allow OSU students or employees to 
participate in the study. With the exception of contact[CONTACT_558328] L IFE registry, only 
subjects requesting information about the study will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], and no subjects will be prospectively contact[CONTACT_558329].   In situations that potential subjects respond to  an abbreviated version of the full text recruitment 
posting (e.g. OSU Today’s [ADDRESS_733188] limit for postings), the coordinator can provide the full text of 
the recruiting flier via phone or email if more information is requested. Prior to study enrollment, the coordinator may also respond to general inquiries about study logistics (location, number of 
visits, study activities, the basic study schedule and type of specimen collected).  
15. Consent Process  
Waiver of documentation- We seek a waiver of documentation  of written informed consent for the 
telephone screening to be able to collect information over the telephone prior to an in -person visit. 
This is necessary so that we can screen subjects for entrance criteria by [CONTACT_756], thus saving the subject the inconvenience of making an unnecessary visit to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) if 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page [ADDRESS_733189] use of their time by  [CONTACT_558330].   
The Telephone Screening Script  describes the process of obtaining verbal consent by [CONTACT_558331] “Are you interested in learning more about the study?” at the onset of the phone 
screening and providing a check box for “yes” or “no”. If the potential sub ject agrees, the “yes” box 
is checked and the interview continues. If the box “no” is checked, the interview is terminated and 
any information gathered is shredded immediately.  The Telephone Screening Script  also contains 
study information to be provided to subjects before screening information is collected. A paper copy  
for subjects who meet minimum entrance criteria is filed in the subject’s research record to document the telephone screening verbal consent  along with their signed consent form obtained at  
the screening visit.  
Written consent  – The nurse coordinator will verbally review the informed consent document at the 
screening visit prior to any study activities taking place. We will offer subjects an opportunity to voice any questions or concerns, to  take time to consult others (family members, health care 
providers), or do any other research that would help them understand the study activities before they sign the consent form. We will give a copy of the signed document to the subject with study team  contact [CONTACT_3031].  
 Discussions regarding consent with potential subjects and acquisition of consent will take place in a private location with measures taken to ensure privacy (closed doors, periods of time between appointments with other subjects).   This consent process will be followed for all subjects, including those who have previously participated in Protocol 5644.  Those subjects  who choose to participate in both  studies will be 
counted towards enrollment in both Protocol 5644 and this study (Protocol 8233).

 17. Eligibility Screening  
We will initially screen interested subjects by [CONTACT_558333]. (See Telephone Screening Script.) Request for waiver of documentation of written informed con sent for the telephone screening 
interview is described in the Consent Process section.  
Subjects who qualify by [CONTACT_558334] a screening visit , which includes 
an in -depth informed consent discussion, brief health assessment and physical exam. (See Health 
Assessment Form) No screening visit activities will take place before the consent process.  
18. Methods and Procedures   
All study activities will take place in the Clinical Research Center in the Linus Pauling Science C enter, 
room 407.  
Screening visit ( 60 mi nutes)  
The nurse coordinator will review the informed consent document including study activities, schedule 
and diet restrictions, answer questions, and provide further information as requested. After written consent is obtained, the nurse coordinator will collec t demographic information, health history, 
height, weight, blood pressure and heart rate (see Health Assessment Form and  Demographic Form).  
Female subjects will be asked to provide a spot urine sample for a pregnancy test. The study physician will perform a physical exam. Fasting is not required for this visit.  
Evaluation of eligibility  
The study physician will review Health Assessment information to assess eligibility to continue with the study. Subjec ts who qualify for this study will be notified of their eligibility and invited to 
participate.  
Diet Restrictions  
Subjects will be asked to avoid consuming cruciferous vegetables, I3C or DIM supplements,  smoked 
or cured meat or cheeses , or charcoal- grille d meats for [ADDRESS_733191] up to two dietary lapses with subsequent washout extension before they will be automatically removed from study participation due to lack of compliance.   
Study cycle s (4
  total - 25, 50, 100 and 250 ng) : 
Subjects will be asked to complete a 3 -day food diary covering the 3 days prior to each study cycle.  
Administration of this diary in our current study  (IRB protocol 5644)  showed that, on average, 
volunteers decreased their dietary BaP exposure by 35 -54 ng/day16. During the study volunteers are 
required to keep a  similar  food diary. The results will be used to estimate dietary intake of PAHs using 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page [ADDRESS_733192] data from the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA, 
http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/poly -aromatic -hydrocarbons.pdf , accessed 11 -7-20 16).  
Subjects  will fast overnight (no food or drink besides water) before  Day 1 of each cycle.   Subjects will 
be asked to provide a spot urine sample for baseline analysis and then to empty their bladders 
completely.  Female subjects’ urine will also be used for a urine  pregnancy test  and test results must 
be negative to proceed with study activities. The results of these pregnancy tests will not be 
revealed to the subject in compliance with the Oregon Health Authority, Laboratory Compliance 
Section. Female subje cts’ pregnancy status will be confirmed via urine test at the start of each of the 
4 cycles.  
The IV catheter will be placed in  an appropriate vein in the forearm or antecubital region  by [CONTACT_558335]. Subjects  will swallow a capsule containing the [14C]-BaP with 100 mL water. Prior 
to every micro -dosing with [14C]-BaP, a time zero blood sample of 20 mL  will be collected with 10 mL 
analyzed for background plasma levels of BaP (and 62 additional PAHs) with GC -MS/ MS17 and the 
remaining 10 mL analyzed for [14C]-BaP and metabolites as with subsequent time points.  
Blood will be sampled at 0, 0.25 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 24,  and 48 hours (1 1 draws total, 8-9 of 
which come from the catheter). The catheter will remain in place for blood draws through hour 4.  
After the [ADDRESS_733193] and remain on -site until after the 8 hour blood draw.  The subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_558336].  The 8 (possibly), 24,  and 48 hour blood draws will be done with 
straight stick phlebotomy. No more than three (3) skin punctures will be made in an attempt to 
draw blood at each visit. The first blood draw of each cycle will be 20 mLs and then subsequent 
blood draws will be 10 mL for a total amount of 120 mLs (8 tablespoons) per cycle.  
Subjects will be instructed to collect all  urine during the  entire [ADDRESS_733194]  from a menu  from Ava’s Café 
or other local cafe , after which subjects  may resume normal eating and drinking. Packaged s nacks or 
juice  will be provided prior to the standardized breakfast if the study team determines it is 
necessary.   
This process will be foll owed fo r each dose ( 25, 50, 100 and 250 ng [
14C]-BaP) for a total of [ADDRESS_733195] three  week s’ washout period between cycles. Previous multiple 
micro -dosing of the same individual has shown that after 3 weeks there is no detectable  [14C] in 
plasma or urine, validating the choice of 3 weeks as adequate for a “washout period”7,8. Extending 
the washout period will not adversely impact the data collected from the subjects  but will minimize 
the subject’s exposure to PAHs.  
Subjects will be asked to def er blood donation for one month before, throughout, and for one 
month after completion of the study. At any point during the study, subjects  will be referred to their 
physician  if the study physician or nurse consider this advisable.    
Processing of samples:  
Blood samples will be centrifuged to obtain plasma and periperal blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The [
14C]-BaP and metabolites will be extracted directly from plasma by [CONTACT_558337]/liquid extraction with 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 10 of 22  ethyl acetate.  The urine will be pooled over the time periods pre -capsule (baseline), 0 – 12, 12- 24 , 
and 24 -48 hours.   After volumetric quantitation of each po ol of urine, 12 mL will be collected, 4 mL 
will be adjusted to pH 5 and half treated with β- glucuronidas e/sulfatase prior to extraction with 
ethyl acetate. The plasma and urine extracts will be blown down under argon, sealed in amber vials 
and shipped to L LNL where they will be injected onto an Ultra- High Pressure Liquid Chromatograph 
(UHPLC) interfaced via a “moving wire” into the AMS18. We will be able to determine femto(10-
15)g/mL levels of BaP and BaP metabolites (by [CONTACT_3252] -elution with unlabeled standards available from 
the OSU Superfund Research Center PAH repository).  The time-course of blood and urine levels of 
parent BaP and metabolites will be used to construct a pharmacokinetic model6.  In addition, DNA 
isolated from PBMCs at 0 hr and 48 hr will be c ounted directly on the AMS to check for levels  of 
covalent DNA binding.   
19. Compensation 
Subjects  will receive $125  for each completed cycle. Subjects  who discontinue the study early will be 
paid an amount pro -rated to the percentage of total blood samples completed. The amount will be 
determined by [CONTACT_558338] $[ADDRESS_733196] to subjec ts for being in the study. A parking space outside of LPSC is reserved 
for study subjects during their visits.  
21. Drugs or Biologics  
a) Name:   [7-14C]-benzo[ a]pyrene (BaP), specific activity 27 µCi/µmol 
b) Approval status:   not approved for therapeutic use  
c) Chemical formula:   C20H12 
d) Dosage strength(s):   25, 50, 100 and 250 ng 
e) Rationale for choosing the drug or substance dose:  The U.S. EPA is considering a model of risk 
assessment for PAH mixtures that utilizes the Relative Potency Factor (RPF) approach, derived from animal studies
4.  BaP is the reference compound and has an RPF of 1.  The accuracy of the 
RPF approach is based on the assumption that the interaction between all PAHs is additive (same Mechanism of Action or MOA) and that high -dose animal data can model human 
exposure a t environmentally relevant levels (orders of magnitude lower than the animal 
studies).  Until now, it has not been possible to test these caveats in humans.  The 
administration of four microdoses of [
14C]-BaP will allow us to better determine PAH risk 
asse ssment and pharmacokinetics at environmentally rele vant levels of exposure in humans . 
f) Method/route of administration:   Ben zo[a]pyrene is not a drug and will be referred to as the 
“test article” product. Capsules intended for human use will be prepared in t he Linus Pauling 
Science Center room 383, in a clean hood dedicated to radiolabeled chemicals. The test article product will be prepared as a capsule containing the test article product and lactose as an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. A work area in the fume hood will be ster ilized with bleach and alcohol and all work 
surfaces will be covered with fresh, plastic backed laboratory bench paper. All pi[INVESTIGATOR_558317], checked for accuracy, and dedicated to this project. Solaray empty vegetarian capsules, size 0, composed of vegetable cellulose, will be opened and held in a microtube rack. The empty capsules will be filled with pharmaceutical grade lactose monohydrate  NF (Spectrum Chemical 
Mfg. #61- 1730890 ). The dosing solution will be applied to the lactose with a Hamilton syringe 
(2.7, 5.4, 10.8, or 27  nCi in 25 μL ethanol), allowed to evaporate briefly, then sealed with capsule 
caps. All capsules are manufactured within 7 days of  ingestion and stored at -20
oC in an airtight 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 11 of 22  container with desiccant packets prior to ingestion. An excess of 3 capsules minimum are 
prepared to verify the consistency of the dose. These quality control capsules are vortexed in 5 mL of pH 7 water for 5 minutes, at which point they are dissolved. Fifteen mL of scintillation cocktail is then added prior to scintillation counting. If radioactive content shows variation 
greater than 10 percent from the expected dose or from each other, the batch will be rejec ted 
and a new preparation will be made.
 Prior to being filled, empty Solaray® capsules are  stored in 
an airtight bag in a gasket sealed plastic box, in a cabinet in a lab that does not utilize 
scintillation detectable radioactivity or human tissues. This box contains all microdosing supplies in a separate area than traditional laboratory supplies. After dosing capsules are prepared, they are stored in a new glass scintillation vial containing silica desiccant packets with a PTFE lined airtight cap. The vial  is stored in a sealable plastic bag in a - 20o C freezer until use, which must 
be within five ( 7) days of preparation. Each ziplock bag will have the appropriate label applied  
(see sample label) . The batch size will be up to five (5) capsules so that up to  two (2) volunteers 
enrolled per week plus three (3) capsules for quality control. Several batches will be prepared 
over the course of the study due to rate of volunteer recruitment, the time interval between 
dose cycles and different dose cohorts. Capsule s that are rejected for human use or those that 
have expi[INVESTIGATOR_558318].  
         
g) Mechanism of action:   BaP
  is not a therapeutic , so the mechanism of action described involves the 
current understanding of BaP carcinogenesis.  The most well accepted mechanism for BaP carcinogenesis involves metabolic activation
19.  Bioactivation to the ultimate carcinogen is 
initiated by [CONTACT_558339] n at the 7,8 -position.  The epoxide is hydrolyzed by [CONTACT_558340] a second epoxygenation produces the ultimate mutagenic and 
carcinogenic metabolite, the BaP -7,8-dihydrodiol -9,10 -epoxide.   The (+)- anti-BaP-7,8-
dihydrodiol -9,[ADDRESS_733197] mutagenic and carcinogenic form of BaP.  The 
metabolite is formed by [CONTACT_558341] P450 enzymes ( CYPs) enzymes , 
primarily in the liver (also to some degree in lung and GI) .  The epoxide is chemically unstable 
and has been shown to react with the N2 position in guanine in DNA which can lead to 
mutations in genome sequence.

m)  Documentation or certification of quality or purity:    The stock manufacturer provided 
documentation of radiochemical purity (99.2%) and a specific activity of 27 nCi/nmol. We  will 
check the purity by [CONTACT_558342] (U.V. detector) and the radioactivity by [CONTACT_63689] -line 
radioisotope detector.  The specific activity will be confirmed by [CONTACT_558343] [14C]BaP onto 
HPLC and quantifying the mass by U.V. using a standard curve of unlabeled BaP standard (NCI, 
Chemical Carcinogen Repository). The radioactivity in the BaP HPLC peak will be determined by [INVESTIGATOR_2394]-line radioisotope detector.  Both the chemical purity (U.V. peak co -eluting with unlabeled 
standard BaP) and the % of the  total 
14C within the BaP peak must be 95% or greater.  If the 
purity falls below 95%, the stock will be re- purified  to the 95% standard  before administration to 
study subjects .  We do not expect a problem maintaining radiochemical purity as [14C]-BaP is 
known to be stable under the storage conditions described below.

The mouse study of Culp et al., 1998 ( see above Table) utilized the lowest  lifetime  dietary 
exposure of 5 mg/kg (a dose 100,000 times greater than the dose in our microdose studies) 
which did not produce a significant increase in tumor incidence.  This is similar to the rat study of Brune et al., 1981 ( see above Table) in which a dose of 6 mg/kg did not result in an increase in 
tumors when animals were exposed and monitored over  their lifetime.

Storage  and handling:   
The lab where the capsules are prepared (LPSC 383) is not a radiopharmacy.  Be cause these 
capsules are created solely for the purposes of this study and are not to be considered a theraputic drug, they are not made to GMP standards  but will be prepared with the highest 
quality, consistency and precision possible.  Room 383 is a locke d, secure laboratory, and no 
other activities occur in this space  besides those related to BaP handling and capsule preparation. Siddens and Williams are  the only persons with keys to access this space.   
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 14 of 22  The [14C]-BaP is shipped as a concentrated solution  (0.10 mCi/ml; specific activity = 2 7 nCi 
14C/nmol BaP = 0.103 nCi/ng)  in toluene.  This toluene stock is stored in sealed containers as 
received from the supplier at -80 °C in a secure carcinogen laboratory  in LPSC 383.  In order to 
ensure radiochemical purity (greater than or equal to 9 5% for the purified concentrated 
stock) and to prepare a diluted sample suitable for human consumption, the compound is 
collected as a single peak from an HPLC run.  The identity of the compound is confirmed by [CONTACT_3252]-elution with a non -radioactive standard.   
A working stock solution will be prepared from the 0.10 mCi/ mL solution  at the highest 
concentration used in the dosing capsules, (250  ng BaP/25  µl =10  ng/µl; 27 nCi 
14C/25  µl=1 .08 
nCi/µl) using 95 % food grade ethanol . For example to make 10 ml of a stock at this 
concentration,  108 µl of the original stock will be aliquoted into a clean vessel. Toluene is 
then carefully evaporated off and the 14C-BaP aliquot resolubilized into 10 ml food grade 
ethanol. The radioactivity will be checked with a liquid scintillation counter and adjusted to the target concentration. This can then be aliquoted into clean, amber 2 ml vials and stored 
under argon at - 80°C.  All other dosing stocks will be made diluting this highest concentration 
with additional food grade ethanol to achieve all four doses (see table below). These working 
stock s are stored  under argon at - 80⁰C when not in use.  Each stock is checked for ≥ 95 % 
radioisotope purity on a quarterly schedule throughout the study. Stocks will be checked on 
UPLC using UV detection for BaP and radioisotope detection for 
14C.

monohydrate ( Spectrum Chemical Mfg Group).  The 25 µL  aliquot of dosing solution of the 
chosen concentration (25, 50, 100 or 250 ng [14C]-BaP) will be applied to the lac tose in each of 
the 5 capsules using a calibrated pi[INVESTIGATOR_558320] a sterile filter tip. The ethanol will be allowed to evaporate, then the capsules will be sealed with capsule caps.  
Immediately after capsule preparation, 3 of the 5 capsules will be dissolved in 5 ml water and 20 
ml scintillant and  counted on a liquid scintillation counter. Results wil be emailed directly to Dan Harlan, the director of OSU Radiation Safety (RSO). Once  RSO has determined that the three 
evaluated capsules are within 10% variance and 10% error, the results are emailed to Siddens. Siddens will then contact [CONTACT_558346]. If the capsules are not given RSO approval, the participant is rescheduled and a new set of capsule will be prepared.  Two capsules will be stored in sealed vials in the dark  in a zipper -lock plastic bag with 
silica desiccant  at -20°C until subject consumption. One capsule per cycle will be given to 
subjects . The remaining capsule will be for back -up in case of any problems or  disposed in 
radioactive dry waste if not needed. Any capsules  not used within 1 week  will be discarded. 
Dispensing:  Capsules will be transported to the Clinical Research Center (407 LPSC) in sealed 
glass vials within a zipper-lock polypropylene bag for secondary containment.  The bag will be 
labled as described above  and stored within a plastic box for transportation to the clinic.

• Explain whether the use of the test article involve a route of administration or dosage level, use in a subject population, or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability 
of the risks) associated with its use:  
The great majority of exposure (>95%) of the larger molecular weight PAHs, such as BaP, is 
through the diet in a variety of foods including breads and cereals, grains, vegetables and smoke -
cured or barbequed meats
2.  Dietary intakes of total PAHs in the U.S. have been estimated at 160 -
1600 ng/day with BaP alone at 270-700 ng/day.  A 2005 report from the FAO/WHO Joi nt Expert 
Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants listed a mean BaP daily dietary intake of 2 70 ng 
(70 Kg individual) with 700 ng as a high -level intake1.  The European Union maximum limit for BaP 
in smoked meats is 5,000 ng/Kg fresh weight.  The dose of 250 ng would be the equivalent of 
approximately 45 g of smoked meat at the EU allowable limit.  Compi[INVESTIGATOR_558322], a 
Virtually Safe (Lifetime) Dose (VSD) of 42- 350 ng/person/day  has been established as the best 
estimate for a lifetime ex posure to BaP producing no more than 1 cancer per million people1-4.  
Therefore, based on the chemical mass involved in microdosing (significantly lower than 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 16 of 22  background exposure and levels determined to be VSD), this study poses de minimus  risk to 
subjects. 
 
22. Food.    S ubjects will be provided breakfast on the first morning of each cycle.  Up to $10 worth of 
food and/or beverage will be purchased at Ava’s Café  in LPSC  or another local café.  
23. Medical Devi ces- N/A.  
24. Radiation-  Radiation Safety approval form included.  
It should be noted that in our study,  a cumulative total of 45.9 nCi for the 4 dose cycles of [14C]-BaP 
is equivalent to about [ADDRESS_733201] for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori13 and a recent study utilized 
a dose to human volunteers of 300,000 nCi of [14C]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874] (a polyphenol from green tea)14.   
The chemical form of 14C (BaP) to be used in the present study can not be broken down to CO 2, as in 
the urea breath test, and thus could not be incorporated into metabolic pathways in the body.  In 
animal studies, PAHs are eliminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (hours to days) from the body and this has been confirmed by [CONTACT_558349][def,p] chrysene  (Figure 1).

25. Biological Samples  
• A Biological Materials Form is included.  
• Biological samples as described above in the Methods and Procedures section will be obtained from living subjects , prospectively, for this research.  
• The total amount of blood colle cted from each subject is 480 mL (4 x 120 mL /cycle).  The 
maximum amount of  blood collect ed in an 8 week period is 240 mL. 
• Samples will be identified by a code that will be protected as described in the Anonymity and Confidentiality section below. A portion of the de -identified coded study samples will be 
forwarded to LLNL for analysis  with no personal identifying information contained within the 
shipment , so there is no risk of loss of confidentiality with the mailing of samples to LLNL nor the 
analysis of samples at LLNL . The remaining coded samples will be stored in LPSC 389 at OSU

samples will be retained for potential future research projects relating to the study objectives. 
The consent form includes a section for subjects  to give  permission to use their samples in 
future projects without being contact[CONTACT_558350].  
• Samples sent to LLNL will be processed at OSU before shipment and are no longer considered biohazardous materials after processing.  The radioactivity level in collect ed blood and urine are 
well below what is considered a background level when we conduct routine laboratory swipe surveys (below the limit of detection by [CONTACT_558351]) and thus, these samples are not considered radioactive material. OSU pe rsonnel processing the samples are not exposed to 
above background levels of radioisotopes and /or carcinogen. This material does not pose a biohazard, carcinogen hazard, or radioactivity health risk to postal carriers or LLNL employees.  
• No medical records  will be accessed. 
• Only urine pregnancy tests will be conducted with female subjects at the screening visit and before each cycle.  No results will be shared with subjects.  
• Although one of the study aims is to determine if there is genetic variability betw een subjects 
that could account for variability in study outcomes, this is not “genetic testing” in the usual sense as only a few genes will be assessed for allelic variants and results will not be disclosed to subjects  (as there is no established relationship between any of the allelic variants and disease). 
Coded samples will be stored in LPSC 389 at OSU indefinitely  unless not allowed by [CONTACT_1766] (see 
Anonyminity or Confidentiality section) . Coded samples will be retained for potential future 
research pr ojects relating to the study objectives.  
• DNA will be st ored and not shared.  Subjec ts will not be contact[CONTACT_558352].  The subject  can indicate on the consent form whether or not 
he/she agree to have a small number of genes (maximum 7) known to be involved in 
metabolism and excretion of BaP analyzed.  The results will not be shared as there is no established disease risk; no family relationships will be tested or disclosed.  For disclosure of clinically relevant information see bullet above.  
• Plasma extracts and urine samples will not be returned from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories but will be discarded by [CONTACT_558353].   
26. Anonymity or Confidentiality  
• We will handle all research records as confidentially  as possible and retain for three years post -
study termination. We will protect all computer records by [CONTACT_558354] a locked cabinet in a locked room accessible only to the stud y team.  
 
• Only the nurse c oordinator  will have access to the document linking identifiers to subject code 
numbers. Personal information collected during telephone screening, the consent documents, 
and compensation acknowledgement form will be the only documents containing subject name 
[CONTACT_558369]. We will collect direct identifiers (name, mailing address, email and phone number) for the purpose of contact[CONTACT_558355]. We 
will store this information separately  from coded data. Health assessment, subject  demographic 
documents and other research information obtained during the duration of the study will als o 
be identified only by [CONTACT_558356] a location separate from any materials that may 
identify the sub jects.  
 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 18 of 22  • At the completion of the data analysis of the study, we will keep only coded sample data. At this 
time, we will shred and destroy any information linking individual identifiers to subject codes.  
 
• We will not provide materials containing ID codes and personal identifiers to anyone outside the 
research team. Also, we will not use individual identities in reports or publications resulting from 
this study. This study does not involve medical, educational or other personal records.  
 
• We will report name s of subjects enrolled from the CHAR Life Registry back to CHAR at the 
completion of the recruitment phase or earlier if requested.  
 
• Data will be reported in publications in aggregate or coded such that subject s will not be 
indentifiable.  
 
• Any information stored electronically will be on a computer system with a fully patched 
operating system and applications, and current antivirus software with current virus definitions 
and a plan for routine back -ups is in place.   
 
• We will protect email c orrespondence by [CONTACT_558357], is 
removed or withdraws from the study, or has been found to not qualify.  
 
• We will only identify biological samples collected during the study by [CONTACT_105] -identifying code. We 
will process in -house  or to LLNL for analyses with no personal information of the subjects 
provided.  
 
• We will immediately destroy notes taken during telephone screening conversations with excluded subjects. We will keep records from subjects who are excluded from the study after being enrolled confidential and stored securely as described above.  
 
• Coded blood and urine samples will be sent to LLNL for analysis of study endpoints. Any sample remaining after analysis will be destroyed at LLNL. Coded data will be sent to PNNL for analysis. Coded samples not sent to LLNL will be stored in LPSC 389 at OSU indefinitel y unless subjects do 
not give permission to store samples and data for future studies . 
 
• If a subject  does not give permission to use of their data and sa mples for use in future studies, 
their samples will be discarded according to OSU Biosafety policies and their data will be excluded from data sets used for future studies.  
 
• This research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Ins titutes of Health.  
This Certificate has been deemed issued.  
 
27. Risks  
Potential risks of participation in this study are as follows:  
BaP:  The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that BaP is a Class [ADDRESS_733202] BaP  exposure is through diet (9.5 -43.5 ng/day inhalation; 1 ng/day water; 
 
David E. Williams, PhD Page 19 of 22  160-1,600 ng/day diet)1-5.  The dietary restrictions  during this study are intended  to offset the total 
425 ng BaP  consumed in 4 study cycles . This is equivalent to less than or equal t o 4.2 ng/day  over 
the 101  day (minimum) study period .We estimate that following our dietary restrictions will reduce 
subject daily dietary exposure to BaP by 35 -54 ng/day . Therefore, subjects are  not exposed to an 
increased risk of cancer. 
 
Radiation: The total radiation dose of 45.9 nCi for the 4 dose cycles of [14C]-benzo[a]pyrene is 
equivalent to  about  170 minutes  of natural background radiation. The risk from the ultra-low dose s 
in this study is negligible.  
Blood Sampling: Risks of blood sampling include pain, bruising, and in rare instances, infection.  
Some individuals can become lightheaded or  nauseated. A qualified research nurse or certified 
phlebotomist will perform blood daws  and carry out all necessar y precautions to reduce the risk of  
injury to subject s. 
Blood Loss :  While the risk of negative impact due to blood loss is negligible, subjects will be asked to 
refrain from blood donation one month  before the study until one month  after completion of the 
final cycle.  
Food allergens :  Foods and beverages provided during this study may contain allergens.  Ingredient 
lists and packaged foods with clearly labeled allergen information will be provided to subjects upon 
request. Subjects will be asked to notify  the study nurse of any food allergies before ordering 
breakfast.  
Confidentiality/anonymity:  Los s of confidentiality or anonymity is a potential risk. See 
Confidentiality and Anonymity  section.  
Reporting of adverse events:  Adverse events will be reported  to the IRB and the FDA  in accordance 
with each entity’s policy.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:   The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan document outlines risks and 
measures to minimize risk as listed above, reporting frequency and report content that will be 
provided to NIEHS, FDA and the OSU IRB.  We do not have an independent Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board because this is a single -center study.  
28. Bene fits 
This study is not designed to be of benefit to individual subjects . Potential benefits to society include 
essential information to aid regulatory agencies with respect to how environmental PAHs, such as BaP, at environmentally relevant levels of expos ure are taken up by [CONTACT_941] G.I. (96% of carcinogenic 
PAH exposure in humans is dietary), metabolized and excreted from the body.  That information can be used in modeling risk assessment rather than high -dose animal studies.  This will provide a 
mechanism for  improvement of public health  
29. Assessment of Risk:Benefit ratio  
The potential benefits in the form of knowledge gained for determination of exposure risk factors and promotion of human health outweigh the potential identifiable minimal risks.

1. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS FORM? 
This form contains information you will need to help you decide whether to be in this research study or not.  Please read the form carefully and ask the study team membe r(s) questions 
about anything that is not clear.  
 2. WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
The purpose of this research study is  to better understand how our bodies absorb and 
eliminate a common pollutant  called benzo[ a]pyrene or BaP.   BaP is one compound  in the 
family of molecules  called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which  come from burning 
material like cigarettes and coal. PAHs can cause health problems such as cancer and asthma. The most common source of PAHs for non -smokers is through foods.   
The resul ts of this study may help scientists understand how our bodies handle low levels of 
PAHs and may also help regulatory agencies better understand environmental pollution.  
3. WHY AM I BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
You are being invited to take part in this study because you are a healthy non -smoking adult 
aged 21-65. If you are female , you must be post -menopausal or surgically sterile . 
 4. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?   
This research study involves a screening visit and four s tudy cycles.  We will ask you to take a 
different dose of BaP during each cycle  (25 ng, 50 ng, 100 ng, and 250 ng) .  All the visits will take 
place in the Clinical Research Center (CRC) - Room 407 in the Linus Pauling Science Center at 
OSU.  
Screening visit (60 minutes)  
We will review the study activities, schedule and diet restrictions, and answer any of your questions  before obtaining your written consent.  We will collect demographic information, 
health history, height, weight, blood pressure and heart rat e.  If you are female, you will be asked 
to provide a spot urine sample for a pregnancy test. The study physician will perform a physical 
exam and review your health history. Fasting is not required for this visit.  
Four study cycles ( 48 hours,  4 visits per  cycle):  
For each study cycle, we will ask you to participate in these study activities:   
Food Diary:  We will ask you to record all food and beverages that you consume during the 3 -
days before each study cycle.  
Diet restrictions : We will ask you to follow these restrictions  for 2 weeks befo re and through 
the end of each cycle (16 days):  
1. Avoid eating any smoked or cured meats and cheeses  
2. Avoid eating any charcoal grilled meats (gas -grilled meat is ok)  
3. Avoid eating cruciferous vegetables and condiments (see l ist) 
4. Avoid taking any supplements that contain  indole -3-carbinol (I3C) or 3,3’ -
diindolylmethane (DIM)  
Overnight Fast:   We will ask you to not eat or drink anything besides water for at least [ADDRESS_733208] any food allergies  or dietary  restrictions.  
Study visits:  
Visit 1 - (0-4-hour time points, 4.5 hours):  On the first morning  of each cycle, we will ask you to 
provide a urine sample and to empty your bladder.  If you are female, we will also do a urine pregnancy test at the start of each of the [ADDRESS_733209] an IV catheter in a vein in your inner elbow.   
We will draw a baseline blood sample and then provide a BaP capsule for you to swallow with water (time 0 hours).  The study nurse w ill draw a blood sample at 0.[ADDRESS_733210] it removed after 4 hours.  You will need to remain near the CRC if you 
choose to keep the IV catheter until the 8 -hour time point. 
Visit 2 – (8 hour time point, 15 minutes):  If you chose to have the IV catheter removed after [ADDRESS_733211] the building . We will ask you to return to the CRC at the 8 -hour time point 
for a straight needle stick blood draw.  
Visit 3 – (24-hour time point, 15 minutes):  We will ask you to return to the CRC at the 24 -hour 
time point for a straight needle stick blood draw.  
Visit 4 – (48-hour time point, 15 minutes):  We will ask you to return to the CR C at the [ADDRESS_733212] a total of 120 mL ( 8 Tbsp.)  of blood in each cycle.  
Urine collection: We will ask you to collect all of your urine for [ADDRESS_733213] you will need to store any samples is 24 hours between Visits 3 and 4.  
Washout period:   We will wait at least 3 weeks between study cycles to allow your body to 
completely eliminate each BaP dose.   
Storage and future use of data or samples:  We may store your blood and urine for possible 
future studies.  A portion of your blood and urine samples will be sent for immediate analysis. We may store the blood and urine samples kept at OSU indefinitely.  Because it is not possible for us to  know what studies may be a part of our future work, we ask that you give permission 
now for us to use your sample without being contact[CONTACT_558361].  Future use of your samples will be limited to studies about health effects of pollution. We  will not pay you for 
the use of your sample or any products, patents, or licenses that result from these samples.  If you agree now to future use of your s amples, but later decide  that you would like to have them 
removed from research tests  before the end  of the study , please contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. David E. Williams, 
Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, Oregon State University, 473 Linus Pauling Science Center, Corvallis, OR [ZIP_CODE], 541 -737-3277. We will be destroying all identifying 
information at the  end of the study. Once the identifying information is destroyed, we will not 
be able to remove your information from the larger dataset.

 During this study some of your blood will be used to look at a small select number (1 -7) of 
genes. A gene is the code (DNA) present in each cell in your body and controls the behavior of 
that cel l. The genes we will look at are known to control the way BaP is handled in the body. 
This will help us understand if the genes under study increase or decrease the uptake, metabolism or excretion of BaP .

5. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS OF THIS STUDY?  
BaP: The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined that BaP is a Class 
1 kno wn human carcinogen. The amount of BaP you will take in this study is extremely small. It 
is less than you may  eat already every day in your diet, especially in cooked meat. For example, 
one grilled  hamburger could contain as much or more PAHs than the amount you will take in 
this study.  The diet restrictions are designed to help reduce additional exposure  to BaP and 
other PAHs during the study cycles, and your cancer risk is not increased by [CONTACT_232642].  
Radiation : In order to track the Ba P in your blood and urine samples, it contains a carbon -14 
label.  Carbon -14 emits very low levels of radiation.  The total amount of  radiation that you will 
receive in the 4 cycles is equivalent to 170  minutes of natural background  radiation . At this 
level , the risks associated with radiation exposure are negligible and no higher than your 
everyday exposure.  
Blood Sampling:  The risks of having blood drawn from your arm include some pain when the 
needle goes in and a small risk of bruising , inflammation or infection at that site.  Please alert 
the study nurse if you notice any symptoms during or after each study cycle.  
Some people get lightheaded, nauseous, or faint.  You are less likely to have these problems if you drink 1- 2 glasses of water before your s tudy visits .   
The American Red Cross recommends that you do not donate more than 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731] (32 tablespoons) of blood within a [ADDRESS_733214] one month after completing the final study cycle.  
Food allerge ns:  We will provide breakfast on the first day of each cycle and will provide clearly 
labeled packaged foods or ingredient lists if requested.  Please notify the study nurse if you have any food allergies or diet restrictions.  
Confidentiality and Privacy : There is a risk that we could accidentally disclose information that 
identifies you.  
 6. WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM  INJURED?  
Oregon State University has no program to pay for research -related injuries.  If you think that

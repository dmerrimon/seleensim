Study Protocol:  
Objectives:  
This research project aims to develop and test a Studen t Stress Management (SSM) mobile 
program, a suite of apps based within the framework of an evide nce-based treatment for 
depression and anxiety that will be integrated within a student hea lth system. Th is program will 
improve engagement with mental health services by [CONTACT_417340] g as an access point to mental health 
treatment options,  and providing an opportunity for self-guided treatment . The SSM program 
will feature components known to be effective both for engagement (symptom assessment and 
promotion of care accessibility) and treatment (thought rest ructuring, relaxation exercises, and 
behavioral activation). Within the suite, students will be prom pted to complete symptom 
assessments on a weekly basis, and t hose with elevated symptom scores will be provided with 
feedback and recommendations for on -campus services. All users will be able to access and u se 
interactive treatment apps. The program will be developed with the University of Illinois at 
Chicago (UIC)  and Northern Illinois University (NIU) counseling ce nters, and will be made 
available to all UIC and NIU students. These studies wil l establish a research program that will 
expand the reach of services and ease the burden of untreated depression and anxie ty for 
college students.  
 
Phase 1 Aim: Develop the SSM program by [CONTACT_794596]  a mobile smartphone intervention and 
develop an optimized multi -component implementation strategy using a user -centered 
design process. We will start from a suite of apps developed for a general population and, 
based on needs reported by [CONTACT_794597], they will be 
optimized for the college student population alongside de velopment of an implementation plan 
and evaluation metrics. Laboratory- based usability testing and an 8 -week field trial will be 
included as part of the iterative design process to ens ure that SSM works optimally both in 
individual interactions, as well as cumulatively over time.  
 
Phase 2 Aim: Conduct a trial of the SSM program with in two university communities. The 
overall aim of this study is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_794580], e valuation metrics, implementation 
strategies, data collection and assessment procedures for  a larger implementation trial. 
Counseling center utilization will be meas ured for one academic year to obtain a baseline for 
both sites. One site will be randomly selected and the SSM pro gram will be implemented, while 
the other site will continue to collect baseline data. Afte r one academic semester, the 
additional implementat ion strategies will be incorporated for an enhanced impleme ntation 
plan, and both study sites will receive the enhanced implementatio n plan for one semester. 
During the implementation phases, counseling center util ization and SSM program use, will be 
tracked. 
    Hypothesis 1: Introduction of the SSM program will impact utilizat ion of counseling 
center resources, and the use of an enhanced implement ation plan will increase program 
penetration (e.g., app downloads) and strengthen its impact on util ization. W e will explore 
multiple metrics to assess program impact on utilization, an d hypothesize the number of 
appointments for crisis and follow -up will 1) be reduced during implementation relative to pre -
implementation and 2) will be reduced in enhanced implemen tation relative to initial 
implementation.  We will also explore the impact of implementation on  seasonal variations in 
counseling center utilization, level of depressive sy mptoms (as measured by [CONTACT_127659] -9) at 
intake, and any other evaluation metrics identified during Phase 1. 
    Hypothesis 2: Sustained use of the SSM program will result in reduction s in depression 
and anxiety among individual users, and these reductions  will be mediated by [CONTACT_794598], knowledge of mental health ca re services, and cognitive and behavioral 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110].  
 
Background:  
College student mental health problems.  With rising rates of students demonstrating clinical ly 
significant symptoms of depression and anxiety, there has been a broadly recognized college  
student mental health crisis in recent years. As studen ts face increased stress and academic 
pressures, 85% of college students report feeling overwhelmed by [CONTACT_794599]. 
In a national survey of college students, 20% screene d positive for m oderate-severe depressive 
symptoms, and 20% screened positive for moderate -severe anxiety symptoms. However, many 
students have low mental health literacy as they do no t recognize a need for treatment, 
believing that these depression and anxiety symptoms a re typi[INVESTIGATOR_794581]. As nearly 70% 
of Americans enroll in college following high school (and  even more in subsequent years), this is 
an important point for intervention. At this life phase,  untreated mental illness can have life -
long impacts, includi ng increased risk of substance use, academic failure, and impaire d 
relationships. Untreated depression is the number one cause of suicide, which is the second 
leading cause of death for this age group.  
Insufficient access to mental health resources for college students.  While many students do not 
recognize a need for treatment, students who do recogni ze a need often endorse difficulties 
accessing care, perceive care available as inconvenient, an d are skeptical about the efficacy of 
care. Campus counselin g centers are well -positioned to provide mental health care. For many 
students, particularly those from low -income backgrounds without access to a parent’s 
insurance plan, these centers are the main option for a ffordable care. However, many 
counseling cent ers across the country are under -resourced, have difficulty reaching students in 
need of treatment, and while there are seasonal variations i n capacity, are at full capacity 
during much of the year. Students are increasingly being seen in cr isis, rather th an when 
symptoms are moderate. Over the last [ADDRESS_1096159] 
increased by 28%.  There is a clear, immediate need to develo p accessible methods for 
delivering effective mental health care to college studen ts. 
Need for alternative methods of care delivery  Developi[INVESTIGATOR_794582] – saving many individuals from 
the detrimental impact of untreated mental illness includi ng social, emotional, and financial 
costs. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), in cluding smartphone apps, offer the 
possibility to expand treatment options and to reduce ba rriers to services. Internet-based CBT 
has demonstrated efficacy for treating a wide range of mental health concerns, and self -guided 
treatments are known to be effective for treating common men tal health problems such as 
depression. Early work suggests th at programs delivered via mobile phone are comparably 
efficacious while circumventing some barriers to computer -based treatments. As smartphones 
are often carried throughout the day, apps  provide access in the real -world conditions of 
individuals with ment al health concerns. Thus making apps an accessible method for delivering 
mental health care to students, which could keep studen ts with lower levels of distress well -
managed and not in need of counseling center appointments . 
Potential in Mental Health Apps  Commercially available mental health apps have been r api[INVESTIGATOR_794583], and demand for them is high. In  the U.S., 85% of 18 -29 years olds 
own a smartphone, and more than 75% of Americans are in terested in free mobile apps aimed 
at mental h ealth management and treatment. While interest exists, few exi sting apps have 
been subject to empi[INVESTIGATOR_196916], fewer have demonstrated c linical efficacy, and those that 
demonstrated efficacy are typi[INVESTIGATOR_794584]. Appropria te mental 
health apps are challenging for individuals to locate, leading us ers to face significant barriers to 
find something trustworthy and useful. Empi[INVESTIGATOR_794585] -based programs are needed to 
fully realize the promise and potential for their use in clinical care.  
Mental Health Technologies for College Students.  College students are ideal candidates for 
mental health technologies. Research on mental health help -seeking in young adults has 
identified a preference for self -reliance and low mental hea lth literacy, resulting in a failure to 
recognize symptoms as signs of treatable mental healt h conditions, as the most important 
barriers to seeking care. These barriers are a toxic co mbination but are prime targets in which 
BITs can facilitate mental heal thcare. By [CONTACT_1541] a program that includes self -guided 
treatment, we can appeal to a preference for self -reliance and facilitate program engagement 
to promote mental health literacy and provide further ref errals when students need services. A 
recent RCT of a web-based suicide risk screening program for college students found that the 
provision of personalized feedback, with the option of online counse ling based on motivational 
interviewing, had a significant impact on students’ readine ss to consider mental health 
treatment, and these students were more likely to link up with mental health services. 
However, there were relatively low levels of engagem ent with the site, and authors noted the 
site’s subpar user interface likely contributed to low utilization by [CONTACT_305387].  
BITs for college students need to be strategically d esigned to promote use. College students 
today are digital natives confident about their ability to  access and navigate digital interfaces, 
and, counter to older adults, tend to view usabilit y issues as the fault of the program or 
website. There are challenges in engaging these users to continue to interact with new 
technologies. Young adults are seen to exhibit distinct preferences in interface design relative 
to both teenagers and older adults, and they are quick to dismiss tools that do not meet their 
expectations. In the general population, 1 of 5 apps dow nloaded are only used once. The risks 
of BIT rejection/non -use are greater among young adults, and can likely be prevente d with 
appropria te design. User centered design processes and usabili ty testing, widely used methods 
from the field of Human -Computer Interaction (HCI), are vitally important to d evelop usable, 
useful programs. Once developed, it can be a challenge to get t hese programs into the hands of 
people who could benefit from them. Thus, implementation plans must be carefully developed 
and iterated upon as necessary. Implementation scientists have outlined 73 discrete 
implementation strategies; however, use of a single strat egy is rare and a multicomponent 
implementation plans are typi[INVESTIGATOR_794586] a system. 
Identification of implementation strategies likely t o be successful in a setting is key to program 
success.    
 
To evaluate the needs and p references of college students seeking digital mental health 
resources, I conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_794587] -based cognitive -behavioral therapy (iCBT) 
program with 15 college students and collected user feedback. T he iCBT program was rated 
usable and u seful, with an average of 12 logins over the 6 -week trial period (range: 2 –35 
logins), and nearly three -quarters of participants indicated that they would recommend it to a 
friend. From baseline to end of treatment, students reported an increase in use of cognitive-
behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262],  t(10)=3.40, p=.007, and a trend was observed for decreased levels 
of stress, t(11)=2.12, p=.058. However, many students reported that making time to  be in front 
of a computer was a barrier to program use. A majority reported interest in app -based 
programs, noting a greater likelihood of frequently utilizin g program content and tools if easily 
accessible on their phones. Based on these data, the pr oposed project will use smartphone 
apps to deliver program content and t ools. 
 
Apps used in this study are drawn from IntelliCare and wi ll be optimized based on feedback 
from participants in Phase 1. IntelliCare is a suite of clinical apps, developed at CBITs, that 
feature different methods of managing mental health. To fit wi th standard app use patterns, 
the apps are lightweight and designed to be used in shor t bursts of time. In conjunction with 
ongoing trials, the IntelliCare apps were made freely  available. In the first 18 months of public 
availability, 8,293 individuals do wnloaded one or more of the apps, for a total of 19,85 2 
downloads.  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:  
 
Participants include both students, counselors, and administrative staff members of the 
University of Illinois at Chicago and Northern Illin ois Universit y. Students, to be included in all 
phases of the study, will be  18 years of age or older, English -speaking, familiar with 
smartphones, and living in the university communities (e .g. not studying abroad). Counselors 
and administrative staff members will be current employees at the University of Illinois at 
Chicago Counseling Center or at Northern Illinois Univ ersity’s Counseling & Consultation 
Services. Potential participants for Phase 1 will be excluded for visual, hearing, voice, or motor 
impairment that w ould prevent completion of the study procedures or use o f mobile phone; 
diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, dissociative disorder, or other diagnosis for which 
participation in this trial is inappropriate, or severe suic idality (has ideation, plan, and intent). 
For Phase 1, Stage s III and IV, student participants will have  clinically elevated symptoms 
(defined by [INVESTIGATOR_103835] > 10 on the PHQ -9 or GAD-7). For Phase 1, Stage V, half of the participants 
will have elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety  as measured by [INVESTIGATOR_103835] > [ADDRESS_1096160] own a smartphone device compatible w ith the mobile app  (an 
Android-operating or iOS -operating smartphone with a system that operates Androi d 7 or 
higher or iOS 11 or higher) . During Phase 2, we will also conduct feedback interviews w ith 
students who have not used the program. Because Black ma le students have been the 
demographic group who appear least likely to engage with the program, we are recruiting Black 
male students age d 18-[ADDRESS_1096161] not used the program to provide feedb ack on what 
they are looking for in technology -based mental health and wellness resources. Therefore, 
students to be included will be those who self -identify as Black/African American  men, between 
the ages of 18 and 35, English-speaking, familiar with smartphones, and enrolled at University 
of Illinois at Chicago and Northern Illinois University .  
 
 The follow ing populations will be excluded from the study:  
a.Adults unable to consent  
b. Individuals who are not yet adults (minors): infants,  children, teenagers  
c.  Pregnant women (where the activities of the research  may affect the 
pregnancy or the fetus.)  
d. Prisoners or other detained individuals.  
 
Study-Wide Recruitment Methods:  
Participants will be recruited in-person, online, via e-mail, and via hard copy study 
advertisements at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northern Illinois University 
(NIU) campuses  after receiving approval from administrators . After receiving permission from 
administrators, d igital signage teaser advertisements (i.e. brief study ad vertisements to be 
displayed on televisions across campus) will be used to comple ment the other advertising 
methods. Online recruitment will be published t o both public spaces and existing private groups 
with the permission of the private group administrators  (including Facebook, Instagram and 
Reddit).  Participants will be directed to a  website with study information and from there they 
will be able to acce ss the study screening form and  digital consent form. Subjects agree to 
participate by [CONTACT_62262] a “yes” box and typi[INVESTIGATOR_403800]. The y are instructed to print out 
the consent form for their records. Participants are enr olled remotely to avoid excluding  
participants with access barriers who are among those who wo uld be likely end users.  The 
digital consent form will describe the mobile app program, show  participants how to add a PIN 
to their phone, and inform participants that data entered i nto the phon e will be de -identified to 
the research team, those it cannot replace the need for c ontacting a mental health provider in 
the case of an emergency. These recruitment procedures  are similar to those that have been 
approved by [CONTACT_794600].  
For Phase [ADDRESS_1096162] information,  and a link prompting students to complete an online consent and 
eligibility screening measure via REDCap. For those who d o not respond to the recruitment 
email, a “nudge” email will be sent to remind  participants  [ADDRESS_1096163] information. Participants will  agree to 
participate by [CONTACT_62262] a “yes” box and typi[INVESTIGATOR_403800].  Once consent is received, another 
email will be sent to schedule interviews with students and  share Zoom mee ting information. 
Reminder emails will be sent [ADDRESS_1096164] been approved by [CONTACT_794601].  
 
Procedures Involved:  
Monthly data on engagement with counseling center services will be c ollected from the 
counseling center’s Titanium Electronic Medical Record (EMR)  to serve as a predeployment 
“baseline” for Phase 2. For the primary outcome of counseling center resou rce utilization, we 
will compare the predeployment phase (the 2 semesters pr ior to program implementation) to 
the implementation phases. During the prede ployment phase, weekly data will be collected 
from existing service records at the counseling centers at UIC and NIU on new counseling 
appointments, follow -up appointment,  group therapy appointments and crisis appointments. 
The data will be reported in agg regate and will not include individual personal identifiers. The  
SSM program will first be implemented in one study site ( UIC or NIU – chosen via random 
selection) using the initial implementation plan (e.g. advertisements, identification of early 
adopters, identification of student leaders to serve as cham pi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]) designed in Phase 1. Data 
from individual interviews will be gathered from the first study site will inform an enhanced 
implementation plan. During this third semester, predeploym ent data will also  be collected at 
Site #2. Then, the enhanced implementation plan, updated b ased on the semester 3 
deployment at Site #1, will be deployed at both study sites and data will be collected for an 
additional semester. When the implementation begins on e ach camp us, the program will be 
made freely available to download, and counseling center i ntake paperwork will be modified to 
ask students if they used the SSM program which allows fo r tracking of counseling center 
referrals while maintaining patient confidentiali ty. This design allows us to examine: a 
predeployment phase for both sites, an initial phase of implementa tion for Site #1, and an 
enhanced implementation phase for Site #1 and for Site #2. A  strength of this implementation 
design is that is allows for lea rning within itself by [CONTACT_794602]. This process of l earning and adapting is key for 
effective and sustainable implementation. Staggering the st art times of implementation allows 
for within-site targeted comparisons of effect of introducing the S SM program on utilization of 
the counseling center in each site, and for an explora tion of between -site differences in the 
impact of the enhanced implementation plan.  
 
The study utilizes an interru pted time -series design, which offers a number of benefits over 
large-N designs and has been shown to be an acceptable app roach for examining treatment 
efficacy as well as a useful design for rigorous implemen tation research when few sites are 
involved. Th ere are both scientific and pragmatic benefits to introdu cing a program into a 
system with this design approach. Since these time -series measurements are recorded on a 
weekly basis, one can observe how change unfolds acros s time, examine seasonal effects t o 
better evaluate change in these centers that are often at capa city, and investigate the 
trajectory of change. Because all members of the campu s community are granted access to the 
program, this design meets the needs of community stakeholders . 
 
To examin e outcomes for Hypothesis 2 (sustained use of the SSM pro gram will result in 
reductions in depression and anxiety among individual users, and will be mediated by [CONTACT_794603], knowledge of mental health car e services, and cognitive a nd 
behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]), we will examine longitudinal data from individual users regarding 
depression and anxiety symptoms, mental health literacy, knowl edge and beliefs about mental 
health care services, barriers to mental health care, and c ognitive and behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_794588].  
SSM Program : The program will prompt users to complete repeated  symptom assessments and 
provide psychoeducation regarding current symptoms whil e encouraging students in need to 
utilize available campus services. Upon download, the Student H ub app will prompt users to 
complete the PHQ -8 and GAD-7 and will provide feedback on symptoms. Based on symptom 
scores, users will receive  automated feedback  about depression/anxiety , availability of mental 
health and wellness services on campus , and information  and interactive digital tools to 
support continued stress management and wellness. Users will be prompted with ability to use 
interactive self -help tools within the app suite. Interactive, clinical apps ( designed for daily use) 
are included to facilitate engagement with mood monitori ng, and to appeal to a preference for 
self-reliance.  
 
Risks of the intervention : The primary risk of the intervention is participants being di stracted by 
[CONTACT_794604]. 
Participants occasionally try to use mobile apps whi le driving motor vehicles, and therefore will 
be instructed never to use the mobile phone while driving. Partic ipants will be made aware of 
the physical, financial, and legal risks associated wi th using the phone while driving. If the 
research team becomes aware of a participant engaging i n this behavior,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_794589].  
 
Protection for risks of worsening mental or emotiona l state and or self -harm thoughts/events: 
Some participants may show a worsening of depressive sympto ms, suicidality or problems 
during the study period. Consistent with past research on internet -based mental health 
screening and intervention for college students, partic ipants will receive automated messages 
information on available resources (e.g. local emergen cy services, the Crisis Text Line, National 
Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and on- campus crisis counseling).  These are risks inherent in the 
population and would occur whether or not they were enrolled in t he study. We do not believe 
that the risk of these depressive, suicidal, or other adverse outcomes are increas ed as a 
function of being enrolled in this study or receiving the mobile a pplication. All potential risks 
associated with participation in this study will be dis closed in consent documents.  
 
Withdrawal of Participants:  
Patients can be taken off the study treatment and/or  study at any time at their own request, or 
they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the  investigator for safety, behavioral or 
administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation  will be documented and may include:  
Patient voluntarily withdraws from treatment (follow -up permitted);  
Patient withdraws consent (termination of treatment and follow-up); 
Patient is unable to comply with protocol requiremen ts. 
 
Risks to Participants:  
The proposed study poses minimal risks. All potential ri sks associated with participation in this 
study will be disclosed in consent documents. Any potent ial risks that might exist fall into four 
categories: (a) risks associated with the intervention;  (b) risks associated with research 
assessments, consisting of questions about depression,  anxiety, and personal functioning, and 
other mental and emotional problems; (c) risks associated with potential loss of confidentia lity; 
and (d) risks of worsening mental or emotional state.  We address each in turn below.  
Risks of the intervention:  Mobile phone based mental health intervention programs have not 
been shown to caus e any harm.  
Risks associated with research assessments : Research assessments include questions about 
depression and other mental and emotional problems. Participants  will give voluntary 
responses to interview questions; they are told that t hey can decline to answer any questions 
that they choose. The instruments and methodologies are we ll tested and are not known to 
cause problems or distress on the part of the partici pants. All research interview -based 
assessments are audio -recorded, for the purpose of rev iew to ensure quality assurance ratings 
of assessment performance, including ensuring that pa tients are comfortable with the 
interview procedures. Audiotapes will be maintained on a secure server with no  identifying 
information in the labels for the durati on of the funded study, unless other arrangements are 
made. On occasion patients may request that audio files be deleted before the end of the 
study, in which case we will comply.  
Risks associated with potential loss of confidential ity. There is a slight r isk of loss of 
confidentiality.  While transmissions are protected using a Transpor t Security Layer and 
communication occurs within a secure messaging platform , there is some possibility that others 
may see the participant’s open webpage or smartphone.  Measures to protect security in these 
instances are described below. Confidentiality may be bro ken by [CONTACT_299565]’s safety if there is an imminent threat to self or ot hers. There is also the remote 
possibility that research records w ill be subpoenaed by a court of law. All of these potentia l 
losses of confidentiality will be disclosed in the consent d ocuments.  
Risks of worsening mental or emotional state and or sel f-harm thoughts/events:  Some 
participants may show a worsening of depressive or anxious sym ptoms, suicidality or problems 
during the study period. The development of suicidal ideation during t he study remains the 
most serious risk. However, these are risks inherent in the popula tion and would occur whether 
or not they were enrolled in the study. It is not belie ved that the risk of these depressive, 
anxious, suicidal, or other adverse outcomes are increase d as a function of being enrolled in 
this study.  
All potential risks associa ted with participation in this study will be disclosed in  consent 
documents.  
Antidepressant medications are permissible within this tr ial.  Treatment alternatives outside of 
the primary care setting include treatment from an outpatie nt psychiatrist or psyc hologist, 
electroconvulsive therapy, or inpatient treatment. The benef its of these alternatives are that 
they are evidence -based, more intensive and specialized.  
 
Potential Benefits to Participants:  
The potential benefits of participation are that some p articipants may receive support for their 
depression and anxiety. The potential to future patients is that t he study may provide 
fundamentally new and more effective low -intensity treatment approaches that would be more 
widely available.  
 
Vulnerable Populat ions: n/a 
 
Setting: 
The PI, [CONTACT_794618], has an office within the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies 
(CBITs) within the Northwestern University Department of Preventive Med icine and has access 
to secure data storage through the Feinberg School of Med icine.  The majority of research 
activities will take place online or on site at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Counseling 
Center and at Northern Illinois University (NIU) Counseling & Consultation Services.  
The UIC Counseling Center has more than 25 rooms for indi vidual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], three group 
therapy rooms, two or more smaller rooms for self -directed programming (e.g. biofeedback), 
and three furnished conference/multi -purpose rooms for workshops, staff meetings and 
gatherings that can each accommoda te upwards of [ADDRESS_1096165] access to larger conference spaces in their building and e lsewhere on campus.  NIU 
Counseling & Consultation Services operates in a spac e with 19 individual therapy rooms, a 
relaxation room (capacit y 2-3 people, two group therapy rooms (capacity 10 -12 people), and a 
conference room that can accommodate 20 people.  
 
Resources Available:  
The PI, Emily Lattie, is a licensed clinical psychol ogist and research assistant professor within 
the Department of Preventive Medicine. [CONTACT_794618] has training and exp ertise in mobile and 
web-based interventions, and more recently, has begun working on metho ds to leverage 
technologies to expand mental health care accessibi lity for university students. [CONTACT_794618] has 
built strong relationships with the directors of the UIC and  NIU counseling centers. The mobile 
app programmer who is scheduled to work on this project has several years of experience 
building mobile mental health apps, and has collaborated with resea rchers from the Center for 
Behavioral Intervention Technologies for the past [ADDRESS_1096166] acc ess to a pri nter and scanner 
(available software includes SPSS/SAS, MS Office, Adob e, etc.). Both have access to research 
databases, administrative support, hardware, and software assis tance available directly within 
the Department. The Department has a secure server with data security features ensuring 
confidentiality of participant data. All laptops are encrypted and the network has firewall 
protection. In addition, Northwestern University’s information technology program supports 
researchers with the software, hardw are, and data storage and retrieval facilities to conduct 
large-scale projects.  
 
Prior Approvals:  
Approval will be obtained by [CONTACT_794605] s at Chicago and Northern Illinois University 
prior to commencing research activities.  
 
Confidentiality : 
Data for all participants will be kept strictly confidential , except as mandated by [CONTACT_2371]. All 
research files are kept on secure, password protected No rthwestern University departmental 
and medical school servers. All electronic data will be s tored on secu re servers behind firewalls 
meeting all security requirements of the medical school . Any paper documentation is kept in 
locked file cabinets or a locked file room. Participants will be assigned a numerical code for 
identification in the files. Names and ot her identifiers will be kept in separate password 
protected files. Audio data will be stored on secure servers and will only be available for coding 
by [CONTACT_464]. Online assessments will be conducted on REDCap . This platform uses up to date 
security meas ures that are consistent with those used by [CONTACT_794606]. All data collected via the interventio ns (e.g. mobile application) and 
assessments are transmitted using Transport Layer Se curity (TLS) encryption to prevent 
eavesdroppi[INVESTIGATOR_794590]. In addition, 
all data stored within the intervention is de -identified with a unique key. We will instruct 
patients on how to add a PIN to their phone to prevent unwanted a ccess. We will clearly inform 
the patients of the risk of data insecurity. All data prese ntation will be of aggregate -level data; 
participants are never individually named.  
 
 
Statistical Ana lysis Plan:  
 
 
We used a mixed -methods approach to analyzing the impact of the IntelliCar e for College 
Students program, in that we analyzed quantitative data on ap p usage and counseling center 
utilization alongside qu alitative data generated through interviews with student s and staff. 
Demographic data were examined primarily in the form of  descriptive statistics, and chi -square 
tests and a student’s t -test were used to examine potential demographic differenc es between 
the participants who consented to the study that did (n=117) and did not (n=65) download and 
register their participant ID to the IntelliCare for Colle ge Students app.  A pp usage data were 
examined in the form of descriptive statistics.  
 
Due to missing data throughout the trial, multiple imputation methods and separate 
generalized linear mixed models to account for repeated measures from each participant o ver 
time, were used to examine symptoms of depression and anxi ety at baseline, week 1, week 2, 
week 4, week 6 and week 8, and anxi ety literacy, depression literacy, and cognitive and 
behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_794591], month 1 and month 2.  
 
To examine symptom assessments longitudinally, we fit t he available weekly symptom 
assessment data into a structure of baseline, week 1, wee k 2, week 4, week 6 and week 8 
timepoints. Only 2 individuals had complete data. A total  of 48 participants only completed  the 
symptom assessment  at one time period, 16 (17) completed  2 of the 6 assessments  (16 for 
GAD, 17 for PHQ), 3 (2)  completed [ADDRESS_1096167], c ounseling center utilization data were examined using 
Simulation Modeling Analysis (SMA) for Time -Series data to determine if there were changes in 
utilization between the pre -implementation and implementation phases. Because we were 
unable to enact an enhanced implementation strategy during the se cond semester of program 
implementation, we examined implementation as a single phase . SMA evaluates the statistical 
significance of between -phase changes in data streams and also accounts for the presence of 
autocorrelation (the non -independence of data poin ts in time -series data streams). A phase 
effect size (Pearson’s R) is produced for each phase -comparison that is then compared to a 
distribution of data streams, using bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], resulting in an empi[INVESTIGATOR_794592] . 
 
Interviews were transcribed and coded using a themati c analysis approach .     The interview 
transcripts were first reviewed for thematic content . In creating the codebook, coders met to 
review their initial codes to reach initial consensus a nd identified the primary themes that were 
used to create a codebook. Then, a second round of review took place as the coders re viewed 
the codebook, ref ined codes as needed, and completed a final round of co ding. The coders met 
regularly throughout the analytic process to discuss th ese codes  with the study principal 
investigator , check codes between coders, come to consensus, and ensure  validity.

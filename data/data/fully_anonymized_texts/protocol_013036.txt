ABSTRACT  
AALL15P1 , a COG group -wide pi[INVESTIGATOR_782574] 1 year  of age with newly diagnosed B 
lymphoblastic leukemia (also termed B -precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia) or acute leukemia  of 
ambiguous lineage , will assess whether  it is feasible to ad d azacitidine ( VIDAZA ) to the Interfant -[ADDRESS_1076225] chemotherapy backbone . Though th e rate of remission for infants with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (ALL)  with KMT2A  gene  (previously referred to as the MLL  gene)  rearrangement ( KMT2A -R) is 
high, the event -free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) for infants with KMT2A -R ALL remain poor.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_782575]2A -R, including DNA hypermethylation, may contribute to early 
chemotherapy resistance and relapse. DNA demethylati ng agents ha ve been shown to reverse the 
methylation signature [CONTACT_782702]2A -R. 
Azacitidine is a DNA demethylati ng agent that has been used safely in combination with chemotherapy in 
pediatric patients 0-[ADDRESS_1076226] -Induction chemotherapy. 
Infants with KMT2A  germline (non -rearranged) leukemia will not receive azacitidine  and will be removed 
from protocol therapy following remission assessment at the completion of Induction . 
 
The post -Induction ch emotherapy backbone for infants with KMT2A -R is based upon the Interfant -[ADDRESS_1076227] the efficacy of azacitidine in preventing relapse among infants with 
KMT2A -R ALL.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Approximately 75 -80% of infant ALL cases contain KMT2A  (previously “ MLL ”)-R. These 
are driver mutations and there are very few , if any, other somatic mutations that accompany 
KMT2A -R in infant ALL. Survival for infants diagnosed with KMT2A -R ALL remains po or 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_782577]/without stem cell transplantation. The two largest 
completed infant ALL trials to date are COG  P9407 and Interfant -99, and results in these 
two studies were quite similar for KMT2A -R patients: P9407 5 -year event -free survival 
(EFS) 36% vs. Interfant 4 -year EFS 37%.1,2 The results of AALL0631, which incorporated 
FLT3 inhibition with lestaurtinib  into therapy for infants with ALL, demonstrate similar 
EFS to prior trials for infants with KMT2A -R ALL and no significant improvement with 
lestaurtinib [3 -year EFS 37% (n=54) with chemotherapy alone vs. 3 -year EFS 37% (n=67) 
for chemotherapy with lestaur tinib; p=0.90] (P. Brown, SIOP Abstract , 2016).  Relapse 
frequently occurs early , and often during  therapy , for infants with KMT2A -R ALL, and 
second  remission is very difficult to achieve. Thus, novel treatments are necessary to 
improve the rates of sustain ed first  remission and overall survival  (OS) . MLL fusion 
proteins contribute to transformation by [CONTACT_72628][INVESTIGATOR_782578]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_640230], including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi), have 
shown preclinical e fficacy against KMT2A -R ALL blasts. This study will test the 
tolerability and biologic activity of the addition of the DNMTi azacitidine to chemotherapy 
in infants with KMT2A -R ALL in preparation for a randomized international trial of 
chemotherapy +/ - this agent. One dose level will be evaluated using a design that allows 
safe and efficient monitoring of the combination.  
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_1076231] as the chemotherapy backbone, 
based upo n comparable outcomes (see above) of COG  P9407 and the predecessor 
Interfant -99 regimen, and the lower cumulative chemotherapy exposure of the 
Interfant backbone compared with prior COG regimens. Complete remission (CR) 
rate was 94% and 4 -year EFS was 47% for all patients enrolled on Interfant -99.2 
The toxicities reported were similar to previous protocols, with toxic death rate of 
5.2% in remission.[ADDRESS_1076232] 
risk arm of Interfant -99, with the addition of BFM Protocol IB therapy 
(cyclophosphamide, mercaptopurine, cytarabine, IT methotrexate/prednisone and 
IT cytarabine/predni sone) as the first post -Induction block. Interfant -[ADDRESS_1076233] arm is 3% 
overall. Infections are the most common serious adverse event with suspected 
relationship to treatment, and occur most frequently during the  MARMA phase. 
Interfant -06 is an active study and outcomes data for the randomized treatment are 
not yet available for review.  
 
Induction therapy for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_782579] -
based AALL0631 induction (cohort 2), but with a change to pegaspargase. Though 
infectious complications and toxic mortality have been problematic in trials of 
infants with ALL, the modification of AALL0631 to Interfant -based induction in 
cohort 2 led to reduced toxicity.3,4 Cohort 1 of AALL0631 had received P9407 -

(2500 IU/m2) from native L -asparaginase. Interfant -[ADDRESS_1076234] -Induction phases. 
Therefore, one dose of pegaspargase will be substituted for the six doses of native 
L-asparaginase . During Induction, t he dose of pegaspargase will be reduced by 
20% from the standard dose to 2000 units per m2 body surface area (BSA) for 
infants ages [ADDRESS_1076235] driving leukemogenesis and is 
a potential targ et for testing in infant ALL models.7,9,10 Kostadinov et al ., reported the

demonstrated preclinical efficacy in the treatment of KMT2A -R ALL cells. Bhatla et al., 
described reversal of the gene methylation signature [CONTACT_782703] B -ALL p atient samples and KMT2A -R cell lines.12 Stumpel 
et al ., further demonstrated that infant ALL  cells with KMT2A -R are susceptible to 
demethylating agents.5 In a study of the methylation patterns of infant ALL, Shaefer et al.  
identified significantly more promoter  hypermethylation in KMT2A -R patient -derived 
cells, compared with KMT2A -wild type infant ALL cells.7 Genes with promoter 
hypermethylation correlated with down -regulated or silenced expression. Treatment with 
decitabine preferentially led to cytotoxicity of KMT2A -R cell lines, compared with 
KMT2A -wild type cell lines, supporting the role for demethylating agents in inducing 
cytotoxicity and chemosensitivity in the trea tment of infant KMT2A -R ALL.  
 
2.3 Adult Studies  
Azacitidine is indicated for the treatment of all types of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_782580] 75 mg/m2/day IV or 
subcutaneous daily for 7 days, rep eated in cycles every 28 days. Common adverse reactions 
include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, gastrointestinal toxicity, and infusion 
site reactions with sub cutaneous administration [VIDAZA  ® package inse rt]. Azacitidine 
has moderate emetogeni c potential. In adult patients, azacitidine has been administered in 
combination with chemotherapy to treat acute myeloid leuke mia (AML) and prostate 
cancer. The results have been mixed with regards to efficacy , and the dose limiting 
toxicities of azacitid ine in combination with chemotherapy have been related to 
myelosuppression. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_782581] 
7 + 3 cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy for adult patients with AML, the 
combination was feasible.13 The doses given were 37.5 mg/m2/day and 75 mg/m2/day IV 
for 5 days. There were no dose limiting toxicities, but there were fatal adverse events in 
this older population during Induction treatment. In a randomized study of chemotherapy 
with or without azacitidine for older patients with AML by [CONTACT_782655] -Tidow et al. , azacitidine 
was dosed at 75 mg/m2/day IV for 5 days prior to each course of chemotherapy and every 
4 weeks du ring M aintenance therapy.14 The median age of patients in the study was 70 
years and the study authors concluded that azacitidine added toxicity, but did not provide 
benefit for unselected older patients. Singal et al . conducted a Phase 1/2 study of 
azacitidine prior to docetaxel and prednisone in men with met astatic castration -resistant 
prostate cancer, and the treatment combination demonstrated biologic activity without dose 
limiting toxicity.15 The recommended Phase II dose was 75 mg/m2/day IV for 5 days, 
followed by [CONTACT_782656]. Objective response was noted in 3 of 10 
evaluable patients.  
 
2.4 Pediatric Studies  
2.4.1 Azacitidine: Cytotoxic Drug  
Azacitidine has been studied in high doses as a cytotoxic drug for acute leukemia 
since the 1970s. Karon et al., published the use of azacitidine in 37  children with 
acute leukemia in 1973.16 The maximum tolera ted dose  (MTD ) was estimated to 
be 150  mg/m2 to 200  mg/m2 IV when given for 5  days every 14  days. The major 
dose limiting toxicities were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In 1981 Look et al., 
treated relapsed AML in pediatric patients with 200  mg/m2/day of azacitidine for 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 16 
Version date: 9/25/19 
2 days following etoposide on Days  1-3.17 The doses were repeated after 1 -2 days 
and until the marrow became hypoplastic. Of 22  patients treated with this schedule, 
18 developed marrow hypoplasia and 10 entered CR. The major toxicity of the 
combination was prolonged pancytopenia. Azacitidine (300  mg/m2/day) IV for 
2 days, in combination with etoposide, was incorporated into a 5 -drug regimen for 
newly diagnos ed AML and reported by [CONTACT_782657] ., in 1988.18 Sixty -
eight  children were trea ted on the study, the CR rate was 85% after Induction, but 
the failure free survival rate showed no  improvement over prior trials. The 
toxicities reported included fungal infections, febrile neutropenia, 
myelosuppression, and one patient with cardiomyopath y. These  toxicities  were not 
specific to the addition of azacitidine. In 1996, Steuber et al., reported the results 
of a randomized study of a 3-drug combination of azacitidine (250  mg/m2/day), 
etoposide, and amsacrine compared with the control group, etop oside and 
amsacrine alone.19 The CR rate for refractory AML was significantly higher (18% 
vs 53%, p=0.03) with the addition of azacitidine.[ADDRESS_1076237] 
AML Induction therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
2.4.2 Azacitidine: DNA Methyltransferase I nhibitor  
More recently, azacitidine  and decitabine have been administered in lower doses 
as DNA methyltransferase inhibitors rather than as cytotoxic agents. Demonstrated 
efficacy in adults with myelodysplastic syndrome has led to FDA approval of both 
drugs as single agents. A number of stu dies have further explored the use of 
azacitidine and decitabine as “epi[INVESTIGATOR_468191]” agents in combination with 
chemotherapy for resistant cancers.15,20-[ADDRESS_1076238] 5 days of Hyper -
CVAD therapy for children and adults (median age 33 years, range 4 -67 years) 
with relapsed or refractory ALL, and the results were encouraging.[ADDRESS_1076239] 
common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were hepatic dysfunction and hyperglycemia, 
an MTD was not reached, and the response rate to the combination was 56%. Thus, 
younger patients with ALL may tolerate the combinatio n reasonably well at doses 
required for demethylation.  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_782582] a demethylating agent has been introduced into 
two pediatric trials of relapsed or refractory leukemia. The Therapeutic Advances 
in Childhood Leukemia & Lymphoma (TACL)  consortium tested azacitidine as a 
priming agent prior to fludarabine and cytarabine in relapsed or refractory AML 
and ALL pediatric patients, ages  1-21 years.26 Azacitidine 75  mg/m2/day was 
given subcutaneously on Days  1-5, prior to the chemotherapy on Days  6-10. The 
rationale for this protocol was that low dose azacitidine as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_782583], overcome drug resistance, and 
improve the cytotoxic effect of the chemotherapy medications. Fifteen  patients 
were enrolle d and none experienced DLT. Non -hematologic toxicities ≥  Grade  [ADDRESS_1076240] elevation, 
oral hemorrhage, and hypokalemia. Evidence of demethylation was seen in every 
patient by G -LINE analysis. Th e treatment was well tolerated in this population.

Version date: 9/25/19 
The TACL consortium is also testing a combination of epi[INVESTIGATOR_278211] 
(decitabine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat) and intensive re -
Induction chemotherapy in children, ages  1-[ADDRESS_1076241]  5 enrolled patients, despi[INVESTIGATOR_6698] -fungal prophylaxis.27 After an 
amendment to reduce the decitabine dose and  duration and to require empi[INVESTIGATOR_782584] -
azole fungal treatment, the infectious toxicity improved, but remains a significant 
concern. Thus, AALL15P1 incorporates extensive supportive care 
recommendations for infants receiving azacitidine and chemotherapy (see 
Appendix IV ). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1076242] day immediately  following each azacitidine course.  
 
The dosing of azacitidine will be weight -based, with a BSA:weight conversion factor of 
30:1. The effect of the 30:1 conversion of BSA:weight dosing is to reduce doses to 
approximately 5 0% of BSA -based doses for newborns, up to approximately 75% of BSA -
based doses for 1 -year-olds. Considering that the safe and biologically active BSA -based 
dose of azacitidine is 75  mg/m2 in older children, the starting dose (DL1) for this stu dy will 
be 2. 5 mg/kg ( Table 1 ). If DL1 is deemed too toxic, then the azacitidine dose will be 
reduced by 30% to DL0, 1. 8 mg/kg, for all infants with remaining azacitidine doses and 
for all subsequently enrolled infants.  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_782585]. Rather, DL1 (and DL0 if necessary) will be evaluated for

2.6.1 Extension in the length of Induction therapy recovery time.  
Prior to A mendment #1 patients were required to meet criteria to begin EPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_782587]  #1 by [CONTACT_2006]  50 of Induction. Induction chemotherapy on AALL15P1 begins 
with a week of prednisone on Days  1-7 and lasts for 5 weeks. The end -Induction 
bone marrow is requested on Day  35 and patients may begin EPI [INVESTIGATOR_782587] #[ADDRESS_1076245] -Amendment #1A, which 
utilized the same chemotherapy with the exc eption that AALL0631 included 
Erwinia asparaginase instead of pegaspargase , resulted in mean and median 
length s of 47 and 46 days, respectively. Induction length was >  50 days for 33 
infants (28%) and was ≥  55 days for 17 infants (15%). The longest recover y time 
was 59  days, for 2 infants  (Unpublished results) . Therefore, Amendment #1  
extend s the allowable time for Induction recovery to Day 64, to avoid unnecessary 
removal of infants from protocol therapy. Subjects who do not meet recovery 
criteria by [CONTACT_2006] 6 4 will be removed from protocol and will not receive azacitidine.  
 
 
2.7 Pharmacodynamic Assessment of DNA Methylation  
A secondary endpoint of this trial is to determine if there is biologic activity of azacitidine 
at a tolerable dose level in infants with KMT2 A-R ALL. The starting dose level is reduced 
from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_782588] -based dosing of azacitidine and the metabolism of azacitidine 
may be altered in infants, so this trial will assess for evidence of demethylat ion at each 
dose level tested. Global methyl ation assessment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMCs) will be performed using a commercial ELISA LINE -1 kit which measures 5 -
methylcytosine (5mC) content. Samples of peripheral blood will be collected on Day [ADDRESS_1076246] 
will be performed to determine if there is significant demethylation in the study population 
for each tested do se level. See Sections 14.1  and Appendix VI  for additional details.  
 
2.8 Molecular Profiling of Diagnostic, Remission and Refractory/ Relapse Leukemic Cells 
(Banking for Future R esearch)  
Submission of  bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_782589], peripheral blood, and leukapheresis material 
for molecular profiling is optional. S amples from consenting patients will be collected from 
all time points where a bone marrow evaluation is clinically indicated (at diagnosis , at the 
end of Induction, Consolidation and Interim Maintenance, and at the time of relapse ). 
Submitted samples will be banked for the purpose of pe rforming retrospective studies to 
refine risk stratification, identify new targets for therapy, identify biomarkers to predict 
response, and to link host polymorphisms with various disease characteristics and 
toxicities . Refer to Section 14.3  for details related to sample processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
 
2.9 Minimal Residual D isease (MRD)

2.10 Pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of azacitidine  
Parti cipation in the PK of azacitidine study is optional for sites  and patients . Please review 
the details outlined in Appendi x VIII . Peripheral blood samples (1  mL) will be collected 
from an in -dwelling cathet er or by [CONTACT_452378] [ADDRESS_1076248]  course of 
azacitidine. Azacitidine is unstable in blood, and therefore all blood samples will be 
processed and plasma harvested immediately per the instructions provided in a study 
laboratory manual. A validated high -performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometric method (LC -MS/MS) will be used for azacitidine plasma concentration 
analysis by [CONTACT_782658]. Sample collection kits and supplies will be 
provided by [CONTACT_456] o r sponsor -designated vendor. Sample collection, processing, 
storage, and shipment instructions will be provided to study sites in a separate laboratory 
manual.  
 
2.11 Feasibility of CAR T -cell production for infants with ALL  
This trial includes a correlative study testing the feasibility of T -cell collection for the 
purposes of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell production from the peripheral blood 
in infants with ALL. For those patients who consent, p eripheral blood samples will be 
collected p rior to therapy initiation, at the end of Induction, and at the end of Consolidation 
therapy . Lymphocyte subsets will be quantified, and functional studies will be performed 
to assess the ability of the lymphocytes to expand in response to artificial antig en 
presenting cell stimulation ex vivo. The ability to expand in response to this stimulus is a 
critical determinant of the feasibility of adoptive immunothe rapy, specifically for CART -
19. See Section 14.5  and Appendix VII  for details.  
 
2.12 Pharmacodynamics of Pegaspargase  
Asparaginase activity levels are recommended on the 7th day following the administration 
of pegaspargase during Induction, Interim Maintenance, and Delayed Intensification par t 
1. For patients who consent, r esults will be collected from local institution s and correlated 
with outcome. Asparaginase activity levels are optional, are not reimbursed by [CONTACT_1758], 
and will not be used to d etermine treatment allocation. Local investig ators may choose to 
substitute Erwinia  asparaginase for pegaspargase based on the activity level results, per 
each institution’s standard practice. Patients who develop clinical hypersensitivity to 
pegaspargase should be given Erwinia  asparaginase (see Section 5.8 )

3.4 Definitions  
INITIAL WBC : The first WBC at the treating COG institution, or the WBC prior to 
intravenous fluids, whichever occurred first. If prior therapy (i.e. steroids) has been 
administered and a CBC is available that was obtained within 72 hrs pri or to steroid 
therapy, then this pre -steroid WBC should be used.  
 
INITIAL PLATELET COUNT : The first platelet count at the treating COG institution, or 
the count before transfusion of platelets if transfused prior to arrival.  
 
INITIAL HEMOGLOBIN : The first hemoglobin at the treating COG institution, or the 
hemoglobin prior to intravenous fluid or red cell transfusions, whichever occurred first.

CNS 3a:  < 10/L RBCs; ≥ 5/µL WBCs and cytospin  positive for blasts;  
CNS 3b:  ≥ 10/µL RBCs, ≥ 5/µL WBCs and positive by [CONTACT_83972]/Bleyer algorithm   
(see below);  
CNS 3c:  Clinical signs of CNS leukemia (such as facial nerve palsy, brain/eye 
involvement or hypothalamic syndrome).  
 
METHOD OF EVALUATING INIT IAL TRAUMATIC LUMBAR PUNCTURES : 
If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is 
traumatic and the CSF contains  5 WBC/L and blasts, the following Steinherz/Bleyer 
algorithm should be used to distinguished between CNS2  and CNS3 disease:  
 
CSF WBC  > 2X   Blood WBC  
CSF RBC             Blood RBC  
 
A patient with CSF WBC  5/L blasts, whose CSF WBC/RBC ≥ 2X greater than the blood 
WBC/RBC ratio, has CNS disease at diagnosis.  
 
Example:  CSF WBC = 60/ L; CSF RBC = 1500/ L; blood WBC = [ZIP_CODE]/ L; blood RBC 
= 3.0 X 106/L: 
 
60  = 0.04  and is >  2X   [ZIP_CODE]   = 0.015  
1500                       3.0 X 106 
 
TESTICULAR LE[LOCATION_006]EMIA AT DIAGNOSIS :  
Unilateral or bilateral testiculomegaly. Biopsy is required if clinical findings are equivocal or 
suggestive of hydrocele or a non -leukemic mass.  
 
BONE MARROW STATUS : 
M1: < 5% lymphoblasts  
M2: 5% - 25% lymphoblasts  
M3: > 25% lymphoblasts.  
 
REMISSION  
M1 marrow with complete resolution of extramedullary leukemia. Must have absence  of 
blast s on cytospin preparation and no clinical signs of CNS leukemia.  
 
BONE MARROW MRD STATUS (Day 35): 
Positive:  ≥ 0.01% detectable leukemia cells 
Negative:  < 0.01% detectable leukemia cells  
 
REFRACTORY DISEASE:  
Failure to achieve remission by [CONTACT_782659].  
 
RELAPSE : 
Any recurrence of disease , whether in marrow or extramedullary  site(s), at any point after 
achieving remission . Relapse should be histopathologically confirmed.  
 
1) ISOLATED BONE MARROW RELAPSE:  
Patients with an M3 marrow at any point after achieving remission  without involvement

of the CNS and/or testicles . 
 
2) COMBINED RELAPSE : 
M2 or M3 marrow at any point after achieving remission with concomitant  CNS and/or 
testicular and/or other extramedullary site relapse.  
 
3) CNS RELAPSE : 
Positive cytomorphology and WBC ≥ 5/ µL OR clinical signs of CNS leukemia such as 
facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement, or hypothalamic syndrome. If any CSF 
evaluation shows positive cytomorphology and WBC <  5/µL, a second CSF evaluation is 
required within 2 -4 weeks. While identification of a leukemic clone in CSF by [CONTACT_8315] (TdT, CD19, CD10, etc) or FISH for diagnostic karyotypic abnormality may 
be useful, definitive evidence of CNS involvement (i.e. WBC ≥  5/µL OR clinical signs of 
CNS leukemia) is required for the diagnosis of a CNS relapse.  
 
4) TESTICULAR RELAPSE : 
Must be documented  by [CONTACT_320494], if not associated with a marrow relapse.  
 
5) ISOLATED EXTRAMEDULLARY RELAPSE  
Must be documented by [CONTACT_26745], if not associated with a marrow relapse.  
 
DISEASE EVALUATION DURING FOLLOW -UP: 
A disease evaluation is a procedure ordered with the intent to measure or assess the disease 
status of a patient. The most common evaluations are a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_6706]/or biopsy 
and a lumbar puncture (LP). If a CBC has findings that raise suspi[INVESTIGATOR_306796], a bone

4.0 TREATMENT PROGRAM  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standar ds of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues  are acceptable (except 
where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
4.1 Overview of Treatment Plan 
Any infant < 1 year  of age  on the day of diagnosis  with ALL or acute ambiguous lineage 
leukemia  (ALUL)  that is predominantly B lymphoblastic , which inclu des mixed phenotype 
acute leukemia (MPAL),  is potentially  eligible for enrollment on AALL15P1 . Patients will 
be treated with a common 5 -week Induction course, as detailed in Section 4.2 . After 
Induction, o nly subjects with KMT2A -rearrangement ( KMT2A -R) are eligible to continue 
on protocol therapy  at which point they  will receive  azacitidine designated “EPI ” prior to 
chemotherapy during [ADDRESS_1076259]-Induction  therapy . 
 
Phases of Therapy:   
Post-Induction therapy includes 4 cycles of Azacitidine epi[INVESTIGATOR_278211], Consolidation, 
1 Interim Maintenance phase with high dose methotrexate  and high dose cytarabine , 2 
Delayed Intensification phases  (as based on 1 OCTADAD phase from the Interfant 
backbone)  and Maintenance . 
 
Chemotherapy Dosing : 
Chemotherapy dosing for infants on AAL L15P1 is based on age and BSA. Induction 
chemotherapy is simi lar to the amended AALL0631 Induction (cohort 2), with the 
exception of a  change to pegaspargase dosing . Post-Induction chemotherapy dosing is 
based upon the Interfant -[ADDRESS_1076260] -Induction, infants ≥ 12 months of age 
receive the full doses of chemotherapy, infants ≥ 6 months  and < 12 months of age receive 
3/4 of the full doses, and infants <6 months of age receive 2/3 of the full doses. The 
AALL15P1 age -based dose -reductions are the same as the age -based  dose reductions of 
Interfant -06. The appropriate BSA -based doses for each age group are listed on the therapy 
delivery maps.  
 
4.1.1 Concomitant Therapy Restrictions

[IP_ADDRESS]  Cytochrome P450 Interactions with Antileukemic Drugs  
Since concurrent use of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants (e.g., 
phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) with antileukemic 
therapy has recently been  associated with inferior EFS, every effort 
should be made to avoid these agents, as well as rifampin, which also 
induces many drug metabolizing enzymes.28 Neither gabapentin nor 
levetiracetam induce hepatic drug metabolizing enzymes and if 
clinically indicated  may be suitable alternative anticonvulsant s. Azole

antifungals (listed in the table below) and the macrolide group of 
antibiotics (listed in the table below) may have potent inhibitory effects 
on drug -metabolizing enzymes. Patients receiving some antileuk emic 
drugs (e.g., vincristine, anthracyclines, etoposide) may experience 
excess toxicity when these agents are given concomitantly; alternate 
antifungal and antibacterial therapy should be used whe never  possible

5.0 DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITIES  
5.1 Azacitidine  
5.1.1 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
The DLT evaluation period consists of the first 3 courses of azacitidine in 
combination with chemotherapy ( EPI #1 through Delayed Intensification P art 1) 
and until the patient meets counts requirements to begin the fourth course of 
azacitidine therapy ( EPI #4). 
 
A DLT is defined as any of the following that occurs during the DLT evaluation 
period:  
 
• Any Grade  5 toxicity.  
 
• Any Grade  3 or 4 toxicity that occurs during the 5  days of azacitidine AND 
results  in: 
o The omission of [ADDRESS_1076285]  day of chemotherapy for ≥  72 hours.  
 
• Any Grade  3 or 4 toxicity that occurs during the 5  days of azacitidine and/or a 
chemotherapy course AND results in : 
 
o The delay of Consolidation Day 29 chemotherapy for ≥  4 weeks from the 
expected start date.  
o The delay  of the start of the subsequent course of therapy for ≥  4 weeks 
from the expected start date  (with the expected start date of EPI #2 as 2 
weeks following administration of Consolidation Day 29 chemotherapy) , 
OR 
o The removal of the patient from the planned protocol therapy.  
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1076286] dose -limiting 
toxicity (see definition of DLT as defined  above).  
 
Patients with any Grade [ADDRESS_1076287] doses of azacitidine withheld.  
 
Missed doses of azacitidine will not be made up. If doses of azacitidine are 
withheld then azacitidine and/or Day 6 chemotherapy may not resume until the 
toxic ity has resolved to ≤ Grade 2.  
 
If the toxicity that caused the delay or cessation is NOT a DLT (as defined in 
Section 5.1.1 ), then azacitidine therapy may resume with out a dose reduction with 
the next schedu led dose.  
 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 80 
Version date: 9/25/19 
If the patient experiences a single DLT, then azacitidine will resume with a 30% 
dose reduction when the patient meets count parameters and for all remaining 
azacitidine doses in all remaining courses. If the patient experiences a second DLT 
of any type, the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
Notify the Study Chair at the time azacitidine doses are withheld , or when a 
DLT occurs that may result in a dose reduction . 
 
5.1.[ADDRESS_1076288] 48 hours 
duration and occurs on days when the patient is receiving scheduled doses of 
azacitidine ( Days 1 -5 of any course) will have azacitidine doses omitted until the 
toxicity ha s resolved to ≤  Grade  2. Specific exceptions will include febrile 
neutropenia, infection, constitutional symptoms, mucositis, and diaper area skin 
ulceration.  
 
Patients with any Grade [ADDRESS_1076289] doses of azacitidine withheld.  
 
Missed doses will not be made up. If doses of azacitidine are withheld, then 
azacitidine and/or Day chemotherapy may not resum e until the toxicity has 
resolved to ≤  Grade  2. 
 
If the toxicity that caused the delay or cessation is NOT a DLT (as defined in 
Section 5.1.1 ), then azacitidine therapy may resume with out a dose reduction wit h 
the next scheduled dose.  
 
If the patient experiences a single DLT, then azacitidine  will resume with a 30% 
dose reduction when the patient meets count parameters and for all remaining 
azacitidine doses in all remaining courses. If the patient experiences a second DLT 
of any type, the patient will be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
Notify  the Study Chair at the time azacitidine doses are withheld , or when a 
DLT occurs that may result in a dose reduction . 
 
5.2 Cyclophosphamide  
Hematuria : Omit in the presence of macroscopic hematuria. If there is a history of previous 
significant hematuria, hydr ate before cyclophosphamide until specific gravity is < 1.010 
and hydrate at 125  mL/m2/hr for 24 hours after dose. Monitor for adequate urine output as 
per institution guidelines. Give IV mesna at a total dose that is 60% of the 
cyclophosphamide dose divid ed to 3 doses (e.g., if the cyclophosphamide dose is 
1000  mg/m2, the total mesna dose is 600 mg/m2 or 200 mg/m2/dose). Give the first mesna 
dose 15 minutes before or at the same time as the cyclophosphamide dose and repeat 4 and 
8 hours after the start of cyclophosphamide. This total daily dose of mesna can also be 
administered as IV continuous infusion . The continuous infusion should be started 15 -30 
minutes before or at the same time as cyclophosphamide and finished no sooner than 
8 hours after the end of  cyclophosphamide infusion.

Page 81 
Version date: 9/25/19 
Renal Dysfunction : If creatinine clearance or radioisotope GFR is < 10 mL/min/1.73 m2, 
reduce dose of cyclophosphamide by 50%. Prior to dose adjustment of cyclophosphamide, the 
creatinine clearance should be repeated with good hydration.  
 
5.3 Cytarabine (ARAC)  
Consolidation:  
Patients should have ANC ≥ 300/μL and platelets ≥ 30,000/μL to start each 4 -day 
cytarabine block beginning on Days 10, 17, and 24. Once a 4 -day block has started, do not 
interrupt for uncomplicated myelosup pression.  
 
Delayed Intensification Part 1:  
Vincristine, daunorubicin, and the start of each 4 -day cytarabine block on Days 9, 16, and 
23 should be delayed and thioguanine interrupted if the ANC falls to <300/μL or platelets 
< 30,000/μL. If a 4 -day cytarabi ne block has been started, then cytarabine and thioguanine 
should not be interrupted.  
 
Delayed Intensification Part 2:  
The start of the 4 -day cytarabine block on Day 9 should be delayed and thioguanine 
interrupted if the ANC falls to <300/μL  or platelets < 30,000/μL. If a 4 -day cytarabine 
block has been started, then cytarabine and thioguanine should not be interrupted.  
 
Cytarabine  Syndrome : Do not withhold cytarabine  for fever if it is likely to have been 
caused by [CONTACT_782663] . Obtain blo od cultures if a central line is present. For rash or 
conjunctivitis, withhold for Grade 3 -4 toxicity until resolved. Make up missed doses and 
consider concurrent treatment with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone, and/or with 
dexamethasone ophthalmic drops fo r conjunctivitis.  
 
Adequate renal function (defined as creatinine within normal range) is required for the 
administration of high dose cytarabine . Creatinine Clearance should be measured for 
patients with elevated creatinine or suspected renal insufficienc y. For CrCl < 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2, hold pending recovery and omit if recovery requires > 3 weeks.  
 
 
5.4 Daunorubicin (Anthracycline)  
Cardiac Toxicity : Discontinue for clinical or echocardiographic evidence of 
cardiomyopathy (SF < 27% or EF < 50%) or Grade 3 -4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction 
(LVSD) per CTCAE version 4.0.  
 
Delayed Intensification Part 1:  
Vincristine, daunorubicin, and the start of each 4 -day cytarabine block on Days 9, 16, and 
23 should be delayed and thioguanine interrupted if the ANC falls  to <300/μL or platelets 
< 30,000/μL.  
 
Note : use the following updated term to report decreases in the EF or SF: cardiac 
disorders -others  
 
Myelosuppression (beyond Induction) : If patient has severe infection or  severe mucositis 
(Grade 3 -4) and an ANC < 500/µL delay anthracycline during phases other than Induction. 
During Induction, continue with anthracycline administration. Subsequent doses should be 
given at full dose.

resolved.  
Do not mak e up missed doses.  
 
Extravasation:  
In the event of an extravasation, discontinue the IV administration of the drug and institute 
appropriate measures to prevent further extravasation and damage according to 
institutional guidelines. Also see:  
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/disc/Nursing/extravasationreference.p
df for COG extravasation management reference . 
 
5.5 Intrathecal Methotrexate  
Do not withhold dose given on Day 1 of Induction.  
 
Systemic toxicity : The dosage for IT methotrexate will not be reduced for systemic toxicity 
(myelosuppression, mucositis, etc.). Instead, leucovorin may be used at a dose of 5 
mg/m2/dose every 12  hours x 2 doses, beginning 48 hours after the IT therapy has been 
delivered . This may reduce the risk of worsening already existent myelosuppression (ANC 
< 500/µL) or mucositis. Do not administer leucovorin sole ly to prevent myelosuppression . 
 
Dose modifications following an epi[INVESTIGATOR_431859] : 
Neurotoxicity has extremely protean manifestations, ranging from transient events, 
seizures or epi[INVESTIGATOR_521405], to severe necrotizing encephalopathies.32-[ADDRESS_1076291] 
outcome.34-39 It is clear however, that CNS prophylaxis is a mandatory compo nent of 
curative therapy for children with ALL. Effective prophylaxis generally takes 2 forms; 
cranial, or less commonly, craniospi[INVESTIGATOR_25332], with a limited number of doses of IT 
therapy or prolonged IT therapy with either IT MTX or triple IT therapy ( MTX, cytarabine  
and hydrocortisone). Certain protocols, for example BFM 2000,40include fewer dose s of 
IT MTX, with an acceptably low frequency of CNS relapse, but the backbone of the BFM 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_782603]’s Oncology Group. The 
exclusive use of IT cytarabine  has not been studied or described in the contex t of ALL 
therapy nor can one demonstrate the safety of omitting multiple doses of IT therapy without 
concomitant use of cranial irradiation or high dose methotrexate.  
 
The following guidelines are offered for consideration following an acute event, but it must 
be recognized that there are little data to support these approaches or any others. Thus the 
treating physician must evaluate the patient and, with the family, make the best possible 
decision with respect to the relative risk and benefit of continued therapy.  
 
Following an acute neurotoxic event, a history and physical exam should guide the 
differential diagnosis. A neurology consult may be of value and should be considered. 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 83

side effects of chemotherapy. Appropriate laboratory studies may include, but are not 
limited to, blood cultures, a CBC, electrolytes, including glucose, calcium, magnesium and 
phosphorus, renal and liver function studies and/or an examination of the CSF. Imaging 
studies may include a CT scan and/or an MRI. The CT is commonly no rmal, in the absence 
of stroke, but if calcifications are present, this finding may be indicative of a more severe 
mineralizing leukoencephalopathy.41 MRI abnormalities may be pronounced, but  transient. 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy may be present on MR with extensive diffusion 
abnormalities, but these do not appear to correlate with subsequent demyelination or 
gliosis.42-44 Additional studies, including MR angiography and/or venogram should be 
considered, if clinically indicated (e.g., focal deficits).  
 
Many acute events, seizures or epi[INVESTIGATOR_431860], are temporally related to 
the administration of intrathecal therapy, commonly 9 to 11  days after the IT 
administration.45 For patients who return to their “pre -event” status , without residual 
deficits of physical or neurologic exam, there are few data to support or guide therapeutic 
nterventions. It is reasonable to hold the next dose of IT therapy, or, substitute IT cytarabine  
for 1 dose of IT MTX, or triple IT therapy. It i s also reasonable to include leucovorin rescue 
at a dose of 5 mg/m2 q [ADDRESS_1076293] therapy should be considered, following 
1 modified or omitted IT dose. In the face of mult iply recurrent events, or evidence of 
progressive encephalopathy, another evaluation is warranted and the treating physician 
may consider a more prolonged or definitive change in therapy. These decisions are 
extremely difficult and may hinge on an individu al’s view of the importance of quality of 
life versus an increase in the risk of relapse. Since the greatest impact of CNS prophylaxis 
occurs early in therapy, the timing of these events may also influence clinical decisions. 
Cranial radiation has been sug gested as an alternative to continued IT therapy though much 
of the literature on long -term neurocognitive dysfunction supports a more deleterious effect 
from CRT than IT therapy.46-49 Dramatic deviations from protocol recommended therapy 
might result in the child being taken off protocol therapy.  
 
The use of dextromethorphan (DM) has been suggested as a neuroprotectant, capable of 
preventing NMDA mediated neurotoxicity without prohibitive toxicity. Low dose therapy 
has been recommended, in part, based on data suggesting that DM is concentrated in brain 
relative to serum. However, the litera ture on the use of DM supports a tight dose response 
relationship, with the likelihood of sparing an initially unaffected area, following ischemic 
damage, linked to dose, in both clinical trials and animal models of CNS ischemia.50-[ADDRESS_1076294] raised 
concerns about the potential deleterious effects of long -term NMDA receptor blockade on 
memory because hippocampal long -term potentiation is dependent on the activation of the 
NMDA receptor. Thus in the absence of a clinical trial there are few data to support the 
addition of DM.  
 
Hydrocephalus, microcephaly or known abnormality of CSF flow precluding intrathecal 
chemotherapy via lumbar puncture :

therapy delivered by [INVESTIGATOR_82021]. Intraventricular chemotherapy should be given according to the 
same schedule, but at 50% of the corresponding age -based doses  that would be given by 
[INVESTIGATOR_82021]. NOTE: Obstruction to CSF flow may be a contraindica tion to intrathecal and/or 
intraventricular therapy.  
 
Viral, bacterial, or fungal meningitis : Omit until resolved.  
 
5.6 High Dose Methotrexate (HD  MTX) and Leucovorin Rescue  
[Please note that HD methotrexate  refers to IV methotrexate  5g/m2 given over 24 hrs] 
Review of methotrexate dosing on BFM -based protocols indicated that excessive 
methotrexate toxicity has not been encountered in patients larger than 2 m2 who receive 
more than 10 grams of methotrexate. The investigator should base the methotrexate on the 
patient's meter -squared dosing and not cap at 10  grams of methotrexate.  
 
5.6.1 HD Methotrexate  Infusion Guidelines  
See Append ix III  for a flowchart of the H igh Dose methotrexate  / leucovorin  
guidelines.  
 
Hold trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole  on the days of HD  methotrexate  infusion and 
for at least [ADDRESS_1076296] that drug withheld 
on the day HD methotrexate  is adm inistered and for the following 24 hours due to 
the risk of delayed methotrexate  excretion, renal dysfunction and resultant toxicity.  
 
Recommended Prehydration with D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L at 
125 mL/m2/hour until urine specific gravity is ≤  1.010 and pH is ≥ 7.0 and ≤  8.0. 
Ringers Lactate may be used as the initial fluid if a bicarbonate containing solution 
is unavailable. Adjust fluid volume and sodium bicarbonate to maintain urine 
specific gravity and pH at above parameters. A n acetate or  bicarbo nate bolus ( 0.5-
1 mEq/ kg over 15 min) may be given to raise the urine pH relatively quickly, a 
normal saline bolus may also be helpful in facilitating hydration. Recommend 
hydration for a minimum of 54 hours after the methotrexate bolus is started for 
patients who meet expected c learance parameters. In patients with delayed 
methotrexate clearance, continue hydration and leucovorin as instructed 
(Appendix  III) until the plasma methotrexate concentration is below 0.1 µM.  
 
Hour 0 : methotrexate  10 % of the total dose to be administered IV infused  over 
30 minutes. This is followed, immediately, by  [CONTACT_41757] 90% of the  
methotrexate  dose given by [CONTACT_22694] 23.5  hours. Be certain that 
the HD  methotrexate  infusion is completed in the 24 hour period. Unintentional 
prolongation to as long as 26 hours though not encouraged is acceptable.

Hours 24, (36), 42 and 48 : Draw methotrexate  level and serum creatinine; NOTE: 
36 hour level is only drawn if needed (see below)  
 
 For methotrexate  levels that exceed these expected values modify the rescue 
regimen as noted below and increase hydration to 200 mL/m2/hr, monitor urine 
pH to assure a value ≥ 7.0 and monitor urine output to determine if volume is ≥ 
80% of the fluid intake, measured every  4 hours. If serum creatinine rises 
significantly, at any time point, assure appropriate urine pH and urine volume as 
above and draw a 42 hour level. If urine output fails to continue at 80% of the fluid 
intake, consider furosemide. Regardless of urine out put, also consider glucarpi[INVESTIGATOR_74715]  
(carboxypeptidase G 2) (see below). For patients with delayed clearance during a 
previous course, begin the following course with the increased hydration 
(200 mL/m2/hr). If subsequent course is not associated with delayed cle arance, 
attempt to use standard hydration.  
 
If the 24 hour level is < 150 M draw the next level at hour 42 and refer to table 
below.  
 
If the 24 hour level is ≥ 150 M and/or creatinine > 125% baseline , repeat level 
if methotrexate  contamination is possibl e. If the value is “real” refer to the changes

Liver Dysfunction : Samples for the determination of ALT value must be drawn 
within 72 hours, PRIOR to a course of intravenous methotrexate . Blood samples

Hold IV methotrexate  for direct hyperbilirubinemia of > 2.0 mg/dL.  
 
Mucositis : For Grade 3 -4 mucositis, withhold IV methotrexate  until resolved. 
Increase leucovorin rescue following the next course from 3 to 5 doses on a q6 hr 
schedule. If subsequent course is not associated with Grade 3 -4 mucositis, attempt to 
decrease th e leucovorin. If mucositis recurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_782605], decrease 
the dose of methotrexate  by 25%, increase hydration to 200 mL/m2/hr and continue 
increased leucovorin as above. Should subsequent courses be well tolerated, use a 
stepwise approach  to resuming a standard approach to drug delivery. Consider 
culturing lesions for herpes simplex if mucositis persists or recurs.  
 
Myelosuppression:  All chemotherapy should be held for ANC < 750/µL and 
platelets < 75  000/µL.

5.7 PO Methotrexate (MTX) and 6-Mercaptopurine (MP)  
Consolidation  
If possible, mercaptopurine  therapy should not be interrupted. If a cytarabine  block has to be 
postponed or interrupted, then mercaptopurine  should  also be interrupted. Omitted 
mercaptopurine  doses should be made up unti l the planned cumulative total dose 1680  mg/m2 
(60 mg/m2 x 28 doses) for infants ≥ 12 months, 1260  mg/m2 (45 mg/m2 x 28 doses) for infants 
6 to < 1 2months, 1120  mg/m2 (40 mg/m2 x 28 doses) for infants < 6 months.  
 
Interim Maintenance:  
If Day 8 HD methotrexate  is delayed due to toxicity, then interrupt mercaptopurine . 
Resume mercaptopurine  when Day 8 HD methotrexate  is given and complete the planned 
14 days of mercaptopurine . 
 
Maintenance :  
If neutrophil count falls below 500/ L or if platelet count falls below 50  000/L during 
Maintenance, mercaptopurine  and methotrexate  will be held until recovery above these levels. 
For the first drop in ANC or platelets, resume chemotherapy (both mercaptopurine  and 
methotrexate ) at the same dose the  patient was taking prior to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_782606]. If neutrophil count falls below 500/ L or if platelet count falls below 
50 000/L for a second (or greater) time, discontinue doses of mercaptopurine  and 
methotrexate  until ANC is ≥  750/µL and p latelets are ≥ 75  000/µL. Restart both 
mercaptopurine  and methotrexate  at 50% of the dose prescribed at the time the medication 
was stopped. Then continue to increase to 75% and then 100% of the dose prescribed prior to 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782607] 2 -4 week intervals provided ANC remains ≥ 750/µL and platelets 
remain ≥ 75  000/µL. May increase both mercaptopurine  and methotrexate  simultaneously. 
Consider discontinuing TMP/SMX as per COG Supportive care Guidelines in Appendix IV . 
If neutrophil count falls below 500/ L or if platelet count falls below 50  000/L on > 2 
occasions during Maintenance, perform thiopurine pharmacology testing as described below. 
Should therapy be withheld for myelosuppression or elevated tran saminase, do not “make up” 
that week. Resume therapy at the correct point, chronologically.  
 
Dose escalation during Maintenance:   
This protocol includes a planned dose escalation of mercaptopurine  from 50 mg/m2/day in 
Maintenance Cycle 1 to 75 mg/m2/day in Maintenance Cycle 2. Proceed with the dose 
escalation in Cycle 2 if ANC ≥ 500/µL and platelets ≥ 50  000/µL.  
 
Beginning in Maintenance Cycle 2, for ANC ≥ 1500/L on 3 CBC(s) done over 6 weeks or 2 
successive monthly CBC(s) alternately increase doses  of methotrexate  or mercaptopurine  by 
25%. As a general rule, do not increase doses more often than every 4 weeks. If both 
methotrexate  and mercaptopurine  are increased once without a fall in ANC, consider 
noncompliance as a possibility. Noncompliance can be assessed by [CONTACT_19201] a sample for 
RBC thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Consider observing the administration of an oral dose 
of methotrexate  and checking plasma methotrexate  concentration 2 -4 hours later. This will 
document whether or not poor absorptio n contributes to lack of response and may facilitate 
discussions about noncompliance.  
 
Mucositis Grade 3 -4: 
Methotrexate  should be reduced to 50% if Grade 3 toxicity develops; withhold in the presence 
of Grade 4 toxicity until there is a resolution, then r esume at 50% of original dose with gradual 
dose escalation. If mucositis persists or recurs, consider culturing for herpes simplex.

Version date: 9/25/19 
Liver Dysfunction : 
For increase in hepatic transaminases (SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST) to greater than 5x ULN 
consistent with Grad e 3 toxicity, obtain total bilirubin. Monitor SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST 
and total bilirubin every [ADDRESS_1076309].  
 
Continue full dose therapy  unless either of the fol lowing occurs:  
1) Direct bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL  
 
2) SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST > 20x ULN (consistent with Grade 4 toxicity) on [ADDRESS_1076310], if bilirubin is normal. If liver 
dysfunction persists, consider a trial period with methotrexate  but without mercaptopurine , 
especially if red cell mercaptopurine  methylated derivatives are  elevated. Also consider liver 
biopsy.  
 
Exclude infectious hepatitis (A, B, C) for persistent (> 1 month) elevations in SGPT/ALT or 
SGOT/AST above 5x ULN.  
 
Pharmacology Testing (TPMT and NUDT15) and Dosage Adjustmen ts: 
mercaptopurine  and 6 -TG are methylated directly by [CONTACT_431919] (TPMT) 
to an inactive metabolite. TPMT activity varies tremendously among patients, because of a 
common inherited genetic defect in TPMT. One in 300 patients is completely deficient 
(homozygous defective) and 10% of the population are moderately deficient in TPMT 
activity because they have inherited one variant (non -functional) TPMT allele (i.e., 
heterozygotes). 57-60 Patients with low TPMT form higher concentrations of the 6 -thioguanine 
nucleotides (6 -TGN) and are more susceptible to acute thiopurine toxicity (primarily 
myelosuppression, involving neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia).  Patien ts with 
the complete deficiency of TPMT tolerate less than 10% of protocol doses of 
mercaptopurine  (10 to 30 mg/m2/day 3 days per week). About 35% of heterozygotes 
require a lower dose of mercaptopurine  to avoid dose -limiting myelosuppression. 61 
 
Recently, germline variants in the gene encoding the nucleoside diph osphate –linked 
moiety X -type motif 15 (NUDT15 ) were reported in approximately 4% of Hispanic/Native 
American and nearly 10% of East Asian children with ALL; these polymorphisms are 
strongly associated with 6 -mercaptopurine  intolerance.62 There are now CLIA certified 
tests for TPMT genotype and phenotype, NUDT15  polymorphism , and for measurement 
of thiopurine metabolites (6 -methyl mercaptopurine [6 -MMP] and 6 -TGN) measurements. 
Only 3 SNPs constitute well over 90% of the inactivating mutations in the gene, based on 
studies in numerous racial and ethnic groups worldwide . 57,63-[ADDRESS_1076311] for TPMT 
or with thiopurine metabolite concentrations in erythrocytes, the relia bility of the tests will 
be even greater. Moreover, metabolite levels can provide an index of patient compliance 
with thiopurine therapy.  
 
Recommendations for Thiopurine Monitoring and Dosage Adjustments:  
When myelosuppression has led to significant delays in therapy (> 2 weeks) or is 
disproportionate to the therapy, thiopurine testing should be performed:  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 89 
Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076312] 1 mutant allele is 
identified. If not, and myelosuppression continues, send samples for TPMT activity 
and/or metabolites since TPMT genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_431864] 5% -10% of mu tants.  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_782608].  
 
Suggested Dose Adjustments in Subjects With Unacceptable Myelosuppression : 
-  If the subject is homozygous deficient  for TPMT  or NUDT15 , the thiopurine dose 
should be reduced to  10-20 mg/m2/day [ADDRESS_1076313] is heterozygous 
for TPMT  and has experienced significant myelosuppression, the thiopurine dose 
should be reduced by 30% -50%. It is not yet clear how the dose of thio purine should 
be adjusted for patients who are heterozygous for NUDT15 but such patients should 
be monitored c arefully while on thiopurines. If a patient is has two polymorphisms in 
NUDT15 (ie heterozygous for both the R139C and the R139H), they should be treated 
as if they are homozygous deficient. Gradual dose escalations should be attempted as 
outlined below.  
 
- Do not increase the dose in response to a high ANC for [ADDRESS_1076314] is homozygous wild -type (high activity) for TPMT  or NUDT15 , then 
discontinue TMP/SMX and use pentamidine or dapsone. For modifications of the oral 
mercaptopurine  and methotrexate  see the beginning of this section (5. 7). 
 
5.8 Pegaspargase [Asparaginase (Peg -Asparaginase) or Erwinia ] 
Allergy  
Local Allergic Reactions (i nflammation at injection site, swelling ): Note these 
recommendations only apply when the asparaginase product is administered 
intramuscularly. Continue asparaginase administration in the presence of Grade 1 allergy 
as defined by [CONTACT_3989] v4.0 (transient flush ing or rash; drug fever < 38ºC).  
 
Systemic Allergic Reactions : In the event of Grade 1 reactions, characterized by [CONTACT_782664] < 38ºC , without the need for treatment with antihistamines 
or steroids, the dose of asparaginase be ing administered intravenously may be continued 
with close observation.  
 
Discontinuation is recommended for Grade 2 or higher allergic reactions as defined by 
[CONTACT_3989] v4.0, which require medical intervention.  
 
Note : Premedication with antihistamines to decrease the risk of overt allergy symptoms is 
strongly discouraged since anti -histamine use may mask the appearance of systemic 
allergy. Systemic allergy is frequently associated with the presence of asparaginase 
neutralizing antibodies, which render asparaginase therapy ineffective. In the event of 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 90 
Version date: 9/25/19 
severe systemic or recurrent local allergic reaction, Erwinia  chrysanthemi asparaginase 
(Erwinaze®), which is FDA -approved for this indication, should be substituted.  
 
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM): TDM of asparaginase activity is available as a CLIA 
approved assay from AIBioTech®. Centers may elect to discontinue pegaspargase and 
switch to Erwinia  asparaginase based upon laboratory evidence of silent i nactivation of 
asparaginase activity in the absence of clinical symptoms of hypersensitivity at their 
discretion.  
 
Anaphylaxis   
Discontinue pegaspargase if the patient develops Grade 3 anaphylaxis as defined by 
[CONTACT_3989] v4.0 (symptomatic bronchospasm, with or  without urticaria, parenteral 
intervention indicated; allergy -related edema/angioedema; hypotension). If this occurs, 
Erwinia asparaginase should be substituted.  
 
Erwinia  asparaginase has a shorter half -life and is associated with a shorter duration of 
asparagine depletion than native E. coli  asparaginase, with “head -to-head” comparisons of 
Erwinia  and E. coli  asparaginase, using the same dose and schedule for both preparations, 
demonstrating a superior outcome, favoring E. coli  asparaginase.67,[ADDRESS_1076315] randomized trial comparing weekly native to bi -weekly 
pegaspargase wasn’t powered to detect a difference in outcome.[ADDRESS_1076316] 
adopted pegaspargase as the preparation of choice, based on the results of CCG 1962.70 
COG AALL07P2 showed that Erwinia  asparaginase was well tolerated and achieved nadir 
serum asparaginase activity at both 48 and 72 hours after dosing that was similar to that 
achieved with pegaspargase. Based on these and other data, the FDA initially appr oved 
Erwinia  asparaginase for use following allergy to pegaspargase, with a dose of Erwinia 
25,000 International Units /m2 x 6 doses IM on a Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule 
substituted for a single dose of pegaspargase.  In December 2014, the FDA expanded its 
approval to include intravenous as well as intramuscular administration.  
 
The dose modification guidelines for ALL trials recommend the substitution for 
replacement of Erwinia asparaginase for either native or pegaspargase utilizing the 
following sched ule. For each dose of 2500 International Units /m2 of pegaspargase, replace 
with Erwinia  25,000 International Units /m2/dose IM or IV Monday/Wednesday/Friday x6 
doses. AALL15P1 includes age based doses of pegaspargase, including doses lower than 
2500 Interna tional Units /m2. For infants on this protocol, replace pegaspargase with 6 
doses of Erwinia  asparaginase M/W/F at a ratio of 1:10 International Units  (e.g. the 
replacement dose for 2,000 International Units /m2 of pegaspargase is 20,000 International 
Units /m2/dose of Erwinia ). If a patient develops a Grade [ADDRESS_1076317] a dose of intravenous pegaspargase that wa s discontinued during the infusion 
due to an allergic reaction, the following recommendations may be used to guide patient 
care.  
 
In the event that a pegaspargase infusion is discontinued for an allergic reaction, regardless 
of amount received, substituti on with Erwinia asparaginase should begin approximately 48 
hours after pegaspargase has been discontinued and preferably to coincide with the 
recommended Monday/Wednesday/Friday administration schedule detailed above in 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 91 
Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076318] suit the needs of each 
individual patient, additional modifications to these recomme ndations may be made at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  
 
Coagulopathy : If symptomatic, hold asparaginase until symptoms resolve, then resume with 
the next scheduled dose. Consider factor replacement (FFP, cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_047], factor VIIa). Do 
not wit hhold dose for abnormal laboratory findings without clinical symptoms.  
 
Hyperbilirubinemia : asparaginase may need to be withheld in patients with an elevated direct 
bilirubin, since asparaginase has been associated with hepatic toxicity. No specific guidelines 
are available.  
 
Hyperglycemia : Do not modify dose. Treat hyperglycemia as medically indicated.  
 
Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] : Do not modify dose  
 
Ketoacidosis : Hold asparaginase until blood glucose can be regulated with insulin.  
 
Pancreatitis : Discon tinue asparaginase in the presence of Grade 3 or 4 pancreatitis. In the 
case of asymptomatic Grade 2 pancreatitis (enzyme elevation or radiologic findings only), 
asparaginase should be held until symptoms and signs subside, and amylase/lipase levels 
return  to normal and then resumed. Grade 3 or 4 pancreatitis is a contraindication to 
additional asparaginase administration.  
 
Thrombosis : Withhold asparaginase until resolved, and treat with appropriate antithrombotic 
therapy, as indicated. Upon resolution of s ymptoms consider resuming asparaginase, while 
continuing LMWH or antithrombotic therapy. Do not withhold dose for abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical correlate. For significant thrombosis, which is not catheter -related, 
consider evaluation for in herited predisposition to thrombosis.  
 
CNS Events (bleed, thrombosis or infarction): Hold asparaginase. Treat with FFP, factors or 
anticoagulation as appropriate. Consider resuming at full dose when all symptoms have 
resolved (and evidence of recanalizatio n in case of thrombosis by [CONTACT_4654]/MRI). Consider 
evaluation for inherited predisposition to thrombosis.  
 
5.9 Steroids (Dexamethasone and Prednisone)  
Hypertension : Dose should not be reduced. Sodium restriction and anti -hypertensives 
should be employed in an effort  to control hypertension. Avoid calcium channel blockers 
due to their potential prohemorrhagic effect.  
 
Hyperglycemia : Dose should not be reduced for hyperglycemia. Rather, insulin therapy 
should be employed to control the blood glucose level.  
 
Pancreatiti s: Do not modify dose for asymptomatic elevations of amylase and/or lipase. 
Discontinue steroids, except for stress doses, in the presence of hemorrhagic pancreatitis or 
severe pancreatitis.

Page 92 
Version date: 9/25/19 
Osteonecrosis (ON) : Do not modify corticosteroid therapy for osteonecrosis (also referred to 
as avascular necrosis) during Induct ion or Delayed Intensification.  
 
Varicella : Steroids should be held during active infection except during Induction. Do not hold 
during incubation period following exposure.  
 
Inability to use oral doses : 
For dexamethasone, substitute the IV preparation mg for mg. For prednisone, substitute IV 
methylprednisolone at 80% of the oral prednisone dose. Note that if substituting oral 
prednisolone for prednisone, the doses are the same ; prednisone is converted in the liver to 
prednisolone.  
 
Severe infection : Do not hold or discontinue steroids during Induction without serious 
consideration, as this is a critical period in the treatment of ALL. Later in therapy, one may 
consider holding steroid until patient achieves cardiovascular stability, except for “stress 
doses.”  
 
Severe psychosis : Dexamethasone dose may be reduced by 50% for severe psychosis. If 
symptoms persist, consider switching to an equivalent dose of prednisone.  
 
5.10 PO-6-Thiogua nine (TG)  
Delayed Intensification Part 1:  
Vincristine, daunorubicin, and the start of each 4 -day cytarabine block on Days 9, 16, 
and 23 should be delayed and thioguanine interrupted if the ANC falls to <300/μL or 
platelets <  30,000/μL. If a 4 -day cytarabin e block has been started, then cytarabine and 
thioguanine should not be interrupted.  
 
Delayed Intensification Part 2:  
The start of the 4 -day cytarabine block on Day 9 should be delayed and thioguanine 
interrupted if the ANC falls to <300/μL or platelets <  30,000/μL. If a 4 -day cytarabine 
block has been started, then cytarabine and thioguanine should not be interrupted.  
 
For severe and/or unexpected myelosuppression, evaluate for TPMT activity as described 
in Section  5.7. 
 
5.11 VinCRIS tine 
PLEASE USE “BALIS” SCALE FOR GRADING NEUROPATHY (See text box 
below)  
 
Severe neuropathic pain (Grade 3 or greater) :  
Hold dose(s). When symptoms subside, resume at 50% previous calculated  dose 
(maximum dose: 1 mg) , then escalate to full dose as tolerated. NOTE: neuropathic pain 
can be not only severe but difficult to treat. However, because vincristine is an important 
component of curative therapy and the majority of neuropathies are ultimately reversible, 
vincristine therapy may be given at full dose at investigator discretion. Severe peripheral 
neuropathies, with or without a positive family history might suggest the need for a 
molecular diagnostic evaluation to rule out Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT), Type 1A 
or Hereditary neuro pathy with liability to pressure palsies. Drugs such as gabapentin may 
be of value.

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
6.1 AZACITIDINE – INJECTION  
(VIDAZA ®, 5-azacitidine)  NSC# 102816, IND# 133688  
         (09/09/19) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Azacitidine  (4-amino -1-β-D-ribofuranosyl -s-triazin -2(1H) -one) is an analog of the 
naturally occurring pyrimidine nucleoside, cytidine. It differs from cytidine in having 
nitrogen in the 5 -position of the heterocyclic ring.  This substitution renders the ring 
chemicall y unstable and leads to rapid decomposition of the compound in neutral or 
alkaline solution. Therefore, for SC or IV administration, the drug is supplied as a 
lyophilized powder to be reconstituted immediately prior to use.  
 
Azacitidine was developed based  on its strong in vitro and in vivo antileukemic activity at 
cytotoxic concentrations, and its differentiation -inducing potential at lower concentrations 
in hematopoietic and non -hematopoietic cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of azacitidine may 
be due to inhibition of protein synthesis and activation of DNA damage pathways, through 
incorporation into ribonucleic acid (RNA) and DNA, respectively. The ability of 
azacitidine to cause differentiation is attributed to its activity as a hypomethylating agent. 
Similar to cancer cells, the disturbed maturation of morphologically dysplastic 
hematopoietic cells in MDS is thought to reflect a block in their differentiation, resulting 
in accumulation of these precursors in the bone marrow in spi[INVESTIGATOR_782610]. This block in maturation (differentiation), with proliferation of preleukemic 
myeloblasts, provides a rationale for clinical trials of DNA methylation inhibitors (e .g., 
azacitidine) in the treatment of MDS.  
 
Pharmacokinetic studies using 14C-radiolabeled azacitidine to evaluate drug disposition 
demonstrated that azacitidine undergoes rapid and complete absorption following SC 
administration, with SC bioavailability greater than 70% and maximum concentration 
(Cmax) achieved 0.5 to 2 hours after do sing. The volume of distribution of azacitidine is 
76 ± 26 L following IV administration. Its protein binding in human serum is low (< 10% 
bound). Azacitidine and/or its metabolites are cleared by [CONTACT_8212]. The plasma 
elimination half -life (t 1/2) is 3.4 to 6.2 hours and amount of radioactivity recovered in urine 
(50% to 98% of administered dose) were similar after IV and SC dosing.  
 
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that spontaneous hydrolysis of azacitidine 
is the major pathway in differ ent species, regardless of the route of administration. 
Azacitidine is not metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 isozymes (CYPs) and it will not 
produce clinically relevant PK drug -drug interactions due to CYP enzyme inhibition or 
induction when coadministered wi th CYP substrates, inducers, or inhibitors. Azacitidine is 
not a substrate for P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and is unlikely to produce any clinically relevant 
interactions as a P -gp substrate or an inhibitor.

Note : Azacitidine in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any adver se event 
currently known to be caused by [CONTACT_6767], or the combination may result in events never previously 
associated.  
Formulation and Stability:  
Azacitidine is supplied as a lyophilized powder in single -use vials. Each vial contains 100 
mg of azac itidine and 100 mg of mannitol as a freeze -dried cake or powder. The azacitidine 
vial does not contain any preservative and is for single use. Store unreconstituted vials at 
25° C (77° F); excursions permitted to 15° -30° C (59° -86° F).  
For IV administratio n: Reconstitute vial with 10 mL SWFI to form a 10 mg/mL solution; 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 100 
Version date: 9/25/19 
vigorously shake or roll vial until solution is dissolved and clear. Following reconstitution, 
further dilute azacitidine in  NS or lactated Ringer's injection for infusion  to a final 
concent ration be tween 0.9 mg/mL and 4 mg/mL . The reconstituted product may be stored 
at 25° C (77° F), but the administration of the intravenous solution must be completed 
within [ADDRESS_1076321] be prepared immediately prior to each dose . 
Azacitidine is a cytotoxic drug and caution should be exercised when handling and 
preparing injectable azacitidine. Procedures for proper handl ing and disposal of azacitidine 
(vials or reconstituted azacitidine) should be applied according to standards established at 
each facility for cytotoxic drugs. If a vial is broken or damaged, dispose of the drug product 
and do not use.  
Azacitidine is incom patible with 5% dextrose solution, Hespan, or solutions that contain 
bicarbonate. These solutions have the potential to increase the rate of degradation of 
azacitidine and should therefore be avoided.  
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment and Dose M odification sections of the 
protocol.  
Supplier:  
Azacitidine is supplied by [CONTACT_782665] (DCTD), NCI. Do not use commercial supply.

6.2 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE INJECTION  
(Cytoxan) NSC#[ZIP_CODE]        (03/13/13)  
Source and Pharmacology:   
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent related to nitrogen mustard. Cyclophosphamide is 
inactive until it is metabolized by P450 isoenzymes ( CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4) in 
the liver to active compounds. The initial product is 4 -hydroxycyclo phosphamide (4 -HC) 
which is in equilibrium with aldophosphamide which spontaneously releases acrolein to 
produce phosphoramide mustard. Phosphoramide mustard, which is an active bifunctional 
alkylating species, is 10 times more potent in vitro  than is 4 -HC and has been shown to 
produce interstrand DNA cross -link analogous to those produced by [CONTACT_200961]. 
Approximately 70% of a dose of cyclophosphamide is excreted in the urine as the inactive 
carboxyphosphamide and 5 -25% as unchanged drug. The plasma ha lf-life ranges from 4.1 to 
16 hours after IV administration.

Page 103 
Version date: 9/25/19 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Cytarabine appears to act through the inhibition of DNA polymerase. A limited, but 
significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has also been repo rted. It 
exhibits cell phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA synthesis (S -phase) 
and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 phase to the S -
phase. Cytarabine is metabolized by [CONTACT_782667] r nucleotide kinases to 
the nucleotide triphosphate (Ara -CTP), an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. Ara -
CTP is inactivated by a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which converts it to the nontoxic 
uracil derivative (Ara -U). It appears that the balance o f kinase and deaminase levels may 
be an important factor in determining sensitivity or resistance of the cell to cytarabine. It 
has an initial distributive phase t ½ of about 10 minutes, with a secondary elimination phase 
t½ of about 1 to 3  hours. Peak leve ls after intramuscular or subcutaneous administration of 
cytarabine occur about 20 to 60  minutes after injection and are lower than IV 
administration. Intrathecally administered doses are metabolized and eliminated more 
slowly with a t ½ of about 2 hours.

6.4 DAUNORUBICIN  
Daunomycin, rubidomycin, Cerubidine®)  NSC #[ZIP_CODE]    (05/09/11)  
      
Source and Pharmacology :  
Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces 
coeruleorubidus . Daunorubicin is closely related structurally to doxorubicin only differing 
in that the side chain of daunorubicin terminates in a methyl group rather than a n alcohol. 
The cytotoxic effect of daunorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various 
organs are similar to those of doxorubicin and are thought to be related to nucleotide base 
intercalation and cell membrane lipid binding activities. Interc alation inhibits nucleotide 
replication and action of DNA and RNA polymerases. The interaction of daunorubicin with 
topoisomerase II to form DNA -cleavable complexes appears to be an important mechanism 
of cytocidal activity. Daunorubicin cellular membrane binding may affect a variety of 
cellular functions. Enzymatic electron reduction of daunorubicin by a variety of oxidases, 
reductases, and dehydrogenases generate highly reactive species including the hydroxyl 
free radical (OH•) which may lead to DNA damag e or lipid peroxidation. Daunorubicin is 
metabolized more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_782612], daunorubicinol, 
than is doxorubicin. Daunorubicin hydrochloride is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_782613], with the highest levels in the s pleen, kidneys, liver, lungs, and heart. Daunorubicin 
serum decay pattern is multiphasic. The initial t ½ is approximately 45 minutes followed by 
a terminal t ½ of 18.5 hours. By 1 hour after drug administration, the predominant plasma 
species is daunorubici nol, which disappears with a half -life of 26.7 hours. Twenty five 
percent of an administered dose of daunorubicin is eliminated in an active form by [CONTACT_782668] 40% by [CONTACT_782669].

6.5 DEXAMETHASONE    
(Decadron®, Hexadrol®, Dexone®, Dexameth®) NSC #[ZIP_CODE]   (05/09/11)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Dexamethasone is a synthetic fluorinated glucocorticoid devoid of mineralocorticoid 
effects. Dexamethasone, 0.75  mg, has potent anti -inflammatory activity equivalent to 
approximately 5  mg of prednisone. Glucocorticoids produce wi despread and diverse 
physiologic effects on carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, electrolyte and water 
balance, functions of the cardiovascular system, kidney, skeletal muscle, and the nervous 
systems. Glucocorticoids reduce the concentration of th ymus -dependent lymphocytes 
(T-lymphocytes), monocytes, and eosinophils. Glucocorticoids selectively bind to the 
cortisol receptors on human lymphoid cells which are found in larger numbers on leukemic 
lymphoblasts. They also decrease binding of immunoglobu lin to cell surface receptors and 
inhibit the synthesis and/or release of interleukins, thereby [CONTACT_16538] T -lymphocyte 
blastogenesis and reducing expansion of the primary immune response. The specific cellular 
mechanisms that act to halt DNA synthesis are  thought to be related to inhibition of glucose 
transport or phosphorylation, retardation of mitosis, and inhibition of protein synthesis. 
Elimination half -lives for the following age groups have been reported to be: infants and 
children under 2 years of a ge: 2.3 to 9.5  hours, 8 to 16  years: 2.82 to 7.5  hours, and adults 
(age not specified): 3 to 6  hours. The biologic half -life is 36 -72 hours. It is primarily

ingestion during the first trimester has shown a 1% incidence of cleft palate in humans. There 
are no reports of dexamethasone excretion into breast milk in humans; however, it is expected 
due to its low molecular weight that it would partition into breast  milk.

6.7 LEUCOVORIN CALCIUM  
(LCV, Wellcovorin ®, citrovorum factor, folinic acid) NSC #003590  (05/09/11)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Leucovorin is a mixture of the diastereoisomers of the 5 -formyl derivative of 
tetrahydrofolic  acid (THF). The biologically active compound of the mixture is the ( -)- l-
isomer, known as Citrovorum factor or ( -)-folinic acid. Leucovorin does not require 
reduction by [CONTACT_782670] a source of “one -carbon” moieties.  Administration of leucovorin can

Page 111 
Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076330], leucovorin can enhance t he 
therapeutic and toxic effects of fluoropyrimidines used in cancer therapy, such as 5 -
fluorouracil. Leucovorin is readily converted to another reduced folate, 5,10 -
methylenetetrahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the binding of fluorodeoxyuridylic acid  
(an active metabolite of 5 -FU) to thymidylate synthase and thereby [CONTACT_642663].  Peak serum levels of 5 -methyl THF (an active metabolite) were reached at 
approximately 1.3 -1.5 hours (IV/IM) and 2.[ADDRESS_1076331] 100% of the l-isomer (the biologically active fo rm) but only 20% of the d-
isomer is absorbed. Oral absorption of leucovorin is saturable at doses above 25  mg. The 
apparent bioavailability of leucovorin was 97% for 25  mg, 75% for 50  mg, and 37% for 
100 mg doses.  Both oral and parenteral leucovorin raise the CSF folate levels.  
 
Toxicity:  
 Common  
Happens to 21 -100 children 
out of every 100  Occasional  
Happens to 5 -20 children out of 
every 100  Rare  
Happens to <5 children out of 
every 100  
Immediate:  
Within 1 -2 days of 
receiving drug    Anaphylaxis, urticaria, seizure  
Unknown Frequency 
and timing:  Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of leucovorin in humans are unknown.  It is 
unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk.  
 
 
Formulation and Stability:   
Leucovorin calcium for injection is supplied as a sterile ready to use liquid and a sterile 
powder for injection. The 10  mg/mL preservative free liquid is available in 50  mL vials 
containing sodium chloride 400  mg/vial. Store  preservative free liquid in th e refrigerator at 
2°-8°C (36° -46°F) protected from light. The powder for injection is available in 50  mg, 
100 mg, 200  mg, and 350  mg vials. Store at room temperature 15° -25°C (59° -77°F) 
protected from light. Reconstitute the sterile powder with sterile wat er for injection or 
bacteriostatic water for injection to a concentration of 10  mg/mL leucovorin calcium. Do not 
use diluents containing benzyl alcohol for doses >  10 mg/m² or in infants < 2  years of 
age or patients with allergy to benzyl alcohol. When Bac teriostatic Water is used, the 
reconstituted solution is good for 7  days. If reconstituted with SWFI, use solution 
immediately as it contains no preservative.  One milligram of leucovorin calcium contains 
0.004  mEq of leucovorin and 0.004  mEq of calcium.  
 
The oral form of leucovorin is available as 5  mg, 10  mg, 15  mg, and 25  mg tablets. Inactive 
ingredients vary depending on manufacturer but tablet formulations may include: corn 
starch, dibasic calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch, la ctose, 
microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate.  
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See Treatment and Dose Modifica tions sections of the 
protocol.  
 
Injection : 
Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, no more than 160  mg of 
leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16  mL of a 10  mg/mL solution per 
minute ). IV leucovorin and sodium bicarbonate are incompatible.

6.8 MERCAPTOPURINE   
(6-MP, Purinethol®, PurixanTM, 6-mercaptopurine) NSC #000755  (11/27/17 ) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Mercaptopurine is an analogue o f the purine bases adenine and hypoxanthine. The main 
intracellular pathway for MP activation is catalyzed by [CONTACT_782671] -guanine 
phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT) which catalyzes the conversion of MP to several 
active nucleotide metabolites including thioinosinic acid, a ribonucleotide which can 
interfere with various metabolic reactions necessary for nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) 
biosynthesis. It c an also cause pseudofeedback inhibition of the first step in de novo purine 
biosynthesis or convert to another ribonucleotide which can cause feedback inhibition. 
Mercaptopurine  can be incorporated into DNA in the form of TG nucleotides as well and 
thus pr oduce toxicity . The absorption of an oral dose of MP is incomplete an d variable, 
with only about 16% -50% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation 
secondary to a first pass metabolism in the liver. Food intake and co -administration with 
cotrimoxazole (TMP/SMX) significantly reduces absorption of MP. After IV  
administration, MP has a plasma half -life of 21  minutes in children and 47  minutes in adults. 
Approximately 19% is bound to protein. Mercaptopurine is well distributed into most body 
compartments except the CSF. (With high dose IV MP the CSF to plasma rat io is 0.15.) MP 
is metabolized by [CONTACT_782672] 6 -Thiouric acid an inactive metabolite. In 
patients receiving both MP and allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) the dose of MP 
must be reduced by 50 -75%.  Since TPMT, [ADDRESS_1076332] an inherited 
deficiency of the enzyme may be unusually sensitive to the myelosuppressive effects of 
MP and prone to develop rapid bone marrow suppression following the initiation of 
treatment. Mercaptopurine is excreted in urine as metabolites and some unchanged drug; 
about half an oral dose has been recovered in 24 hours. A small proportion is excreted over 
several weeks.  
 
Toxicity:  
Incidence  Toxicities  
Common

patients)  Neutrophil count decreased, white blood cell decreased, anorexia, fatigue  
Occasional

Pregnancy and 
Lactation  Pregnancy Category D  
Mercaptopurine  can cause fetal har m, including an increased incidence of abortion and 
stillbirth. Advise women to avoid  becoming pregnant while receiving mercaptopurine . 
Mercaptopurine was embryo -lethal and teratogenic in several animal species (rat, mouse, 
rabbit, and hamster).  It is not known whether mercaptopurine is excrete d in human milk ; 
breastfeeding should be avoided.  
 
Formulation and Stability:   
Mercaptopurine is available as a 50  mg tablet containing mercaptopurine and the inactive 
ingredients corn and potato starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid. Store at 
15°-25°C (59° -77°F) in a dry place. In the [LOCATION_002], mercaptopurine is also available 
as an oral suspension in a con centration of 20 mg/mL (2000 mg/100 mL per bottle). The 
oral suspension is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_782617] -dose 
bottles with a child resistant closure . It should be stored at 15° -25°C (59° -77°F) in a dry 
place.  
 
NOTE : the concentration of the commercially available suspension (20 mg/mL) and the 
compounded suspension (50 mg/mL) are NOT the same; doses should be prescribed in t he 
milligrams required, not mL.  
 
Guidelines for Administration:  
See Treatment and Dose Modifications  sections of the protocol.  
Mercaptopurine should be taken consistently at the same time every day.  
 
If allopurinol is also given, the oral dose of mercaptopurine should be reduced by 67 -75%. 
Patients with severe myelosuppression should have their thiopurine S -methyltransferase  
(TPMT) status and/or their thiopurine metabolite concentrations evaluated, so that the dose 
of mercaptopurine can be reduced in patients with a TPMT defect. Patients with the rare 
homozygous deficient TPMT phenotype may tolerate only 1/10th to 1/20th the average 
mercaptopurine dose. TPMT testing and thiopurine metabolite measurement s are 
commercially available.  
 
Suspension:  
For children unable to swallow the tablets whole, a 50 mg/mL oral suspension can be 
compounded. The suspension is prepared by [CONTACT_782673] 50 mercaptopurine 50 mg tablets in a 
mortar and adding 8.5 mL sterile water fo r irrigation. The mixture is triturated to form a 
smooth paste. Next, 16.5 mL simple syrup (pH=7) are added with continuous mixing and 
finally cherry syrup (pH=7.1) is added to a total volume of 50 mL. The suspension is stable 
in amber glass bottles at roo m temperature (19ºC -23ºC) for up to 5 weeks. The suspension 
should be shaken well before each use.  Procedures for proper handling and disposal of 
cytotoxic drugs should be used when preparing the suspension. (Aliabadi HM, Romanick

6.9 METHOTREXATE – ALL ROUTES  
(MTX, amethopterin, Trexall ® , Xatmep ®)  NSC#000740   (11/27/17) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
A folate analogue which reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that reduces 
folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate formation limits the 
availability of one carbon fragments necessary for the synthesis of purines  and the conversion 
of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate in the synthesis of DNA and cell reproduction. The 
polyglutamated metabolites of MTX also contribute to the cytotoxic effect of MTX on DNA 
repair and/or strand breaks.  MTX cytotoxicity is highly dependen t on the absolute drug 
concentration and the duration of drug exposure.  MTX is actively transported across cell 
membranes. At serum methotrexate concentrations exceeding 0.1  µmol/mL, passive 
diffusion becomes a major means of intracellular transport of MTX . The drug is widely 
distributed throughout the body with the highest concentration in the kidney, liver, spleen, 
gallbladder and skin. Plasma concentrations following high dose IV MTX decline in a 
biphasic manner with an initial half -life of 1.5 -3.5 hours , and a terminal half life of 
8-15 hours. About 50% is bound to protein. After oral administration, approximately 60% of 
a 30 mg/m2 dose is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_60750], with peak blood levels at 1  hour. At 
doses >  30 mg/m² absorption decreases signi ficantly. Even at low doses absorption may be 
very erratic, varying between 23% and 95%. The elimination of MTX from the CSF after an 
intrathecal dose is characterized by a biphasic curve with half -lives of 4.5 and 14  hours. After 
intrathecal administratio n of 12  mg/m², the lumbar concentration of MTX is ~100  times 
higher than in plasma. (Ventricular concentration is ~ 10% of lumbar concentration). MTX 
is excreted primarily by [CONTACT_782674]. Renal clearance usually equals or exceeds creatinine clearance. Small 
amounts are excreted in the feces. There is significant entero -hepatic circulation of MTX. 
The distribution of MTX into third -space fluid collections, such as pleural effusions and 
ascitic fluid, can substantially alter MTX pharmacokinetics. The slow release of accumulated 
MTX from these third spaces over time prolongs the terminal half -life of the drug, leading to 
potentially increased clinical toxicity.

Oncaspar®)  
NSC #624239          (06/05/17) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Pegaspargase  is a modified version of the enzyme L -asparaginase. L -asparaginase is modified by 
[CONTACT_521460] (PEG), molecular weight of 
5000, to the enzyme, forming the active ingredient PEG -L-asparaginase. The L -aspara ginase (L -
asparagine amidohydrolase, type EC -2, EC  [IP_ADDRESS]) used in the manufacture of Pegaspargase is 
derived from Escherichia coli  which is purchased in bulk from [COMPANY_006], Sharp and Dohme. L -
asparagine is a nonessential amino acid synthesized by [CONTACT_782675] L -aspartic acid by a 
reaction catalyzed by [CONTACT_98804] L -asparagine synthetase. The ability to synthesize asparagine is 
notably lacking in malignancies of lymphoid origin. Asparaginase depletes L -asparagine from 
leukemic cells (especially lympho blasts) by [CONTACT_521461] L -asparagine to aspartic 
acid and ammonia. In predominately L -asparaginase naive adult patients with leukemia and 
lymphoma, initial plasma levels of L -asparaginase following intravenous administration of 
pegaspargase  were determined. Apparent volume of distribution was equal to estimated plasma 
volume. L -asparaginase was measurable for at least 15  days following the initial treatment with

bind to the cortisol receptors on human lymphoid cells which are found i n larger numbers on 
leukemic lymphoblasts. They also decrease binding of immunoglobulin to cell surface receptors 
and inhibit the synthesis and/or release of interleukins, thereby [CONTACT_16538] T -lymphocyte 
blastogenesis and reducing expansion of the primary immune response. The specific cellular 
mechanisms that act to halt DNA synthesis are thought to be related to inhibition of glucose transport 
or phosphorylation, retardation of mitosis, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Peak blood levels occur 
within 2  hours of oral intake. Prednisone is approximately 75% protein bound with a plasma t ½ of 3.2

(6-thioguanine,  tioguanine, 2-amino -1,7-dihydro -6H-purine -6-thione,  WR-1141, Tabloid®, 
Lanvis®)  
NSC #752          (12/05/16) 
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Thioguanine is a purine analogue of the nucleic acid guanine with the substitution of a thiol group in 
place of the hydroxyl group on guanine. The main intracellular pathway for 6 -TG activation is 
catalyzed by [CONTACT_782671] -guanine phosphoribosyl  transferase (HGPRT) which 
catalyzes the conversion of 6 -TG to the active nucleotide, 6 -thioguanylic acid. The monophosphate 
nucleotide form of 6 -TG inhibits de novo  purine synthesis and purine interconversion reactions, 
whereas the nucleotide triphosphate  metabolite is incorporated directly into nucleic acids. 
Incorporation of fraudulent nucleotides into DNA interferes with DNA replication and results in 
the formation of DNA strand breaks.  The net consequence of its action is a sequential blockade of 
the synthesis and utilization of the purine nucleotides. The relative cont ribution of each of these 
actions to the mechanism of cytotoxicity of 6 -TG is unclear. The absorption of an oral dose of 6 -
TG is incomplete and variable, averaging approximately 30% of the administered dose (range: 14% 
to 46%).  
 
6-TG undergoes deamination by [CONTACT_782677] [ADDRESS_1076338] an inherited 
deficiency of the enzyme may be unusually sensitive to the myelosuppressive effects of 6 -TG and 
prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_782619].  
 
Peak levels occur 2 to 4  hours after  oral administration with a median half -life is about 90  minutes 
(range: 25 -240 minutes). Very little unchanged drug is excreted renally.

For patients unable to swallow tablets, a 20 mg/mL oral suspension may be compounded. Crush 
fifteen (n=15) 40 mg tablets in a mortar and reduce to  a fine powder. Add 10 mL methylcellulose 
1% in incremental proportions and mix to a uniform paste. Transfer to a graduated cylinder, rinse 
mortar with simple syrup, and add quantity of simple syrup sufficient to make 30 mL. Dispense in 
an amber glass bott le and label "shake well" and "refrigerate". If methylcellulose is not available, 
substitute [ADDRESS_1076339] of the methylcellulose and qs with Ora -Sweet (in place of 
simple syrup) to a final volume of 30 mL. Both preparations are stable for 63 days at 19 °C –

6.13 VINCRISTINE SULFATE  
(Oncovin ®, VCR, LCR) NSC #[ZIP_CODE]       (08/16/12)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Vincristine is an alkaloid isolated from Vinca rosea Linn (periwinkle). It binds to tubulin, disrupting 
microtubules and inducing metaphase arrest. Its serum decay pattern is triphasic.  The initial, middle, 
and terminal half -lives are 5  minutes, 2.3  hours, and 85  hours respectively; however, the range of 
the term inal half -life in humans is from 19 to 155  hours. The liver is the major excretory organ in 
humans and animals; about 80% of an injected dose of vincristine sulfate appears in the feces and 
10% to 20% can be found in the urine. The p450 cytochrome involved  with vincristine metabolism 
is CYP3A4. Within 15 to 30  minutes after injection, over 90% of the drug is distributed from the 
blood into tissue, where it remains tightly, but not irreversibly bound.  It is excreted in the bile and 
feces. There is poor CSF p enetration.

chromosome abnormalities, malformation, pancytopenia, and low birth weight. It is 
unknown whether the drug is excret ed in breast milk.  
 
Formulation and Stability:  
Vincristine is supplied in 1 mL and 2 mL vials in which each mL contains vincristine sulfate 1  mg 
(1.08  µmol), mannitol 100  mg, SWFI; acetic acid and sodium acetate are added for pH control. The 
pH of vincristine sulfate injection, USP ranges from 3.[ADDRESS_1076340] is a sterile, preservative 
free solution. Store refrigerated at 2˚ -8˚C or 36˚ -46˚F. Protect from light and retain in carton until 
time of use.  
Do not mix with any IV solutions other than those containing dextrose or saline.  
 
Guidelines for  Administration: See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of protocol.  
 
The World Health Organization, the Institute of Safe Medicine Practices ([LOCATION_002]) and the 
Safety and Quality Council (Australia) all support the use of minibag rather than syringe for the 
infusion of vincristine. The delivery of vincristine via eithe r IV slow push or minibag is acceptable 
for COG protocols. Vincristine should NOT  be delivered to the patient at the same time with any 
medications intended for central nervous system administration. Vincristine is fatal if given 
intrathecally.  
 
Injection of vincristine sulfate should be accomplished as per institutional policy. Vincristine 
sulfate must be administered via an intact, free -flowing intravenous needle or catheter. Care should 
be taken to ensure that the needle or catheter is securely within th e vein to avoid extravasation 
during administration. The solution may be injected either directly into a vein or into the tubing of 
a running intravenous infusion.

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
This study will accrue infant patients with ALL for approximately 1.5 to 3.0 years (3.0 if 
there is a dose reduction). Based on review of infant patient accrual onto COG protocol 
AALL0631, and since this protocol will be open group -wide, we expect an enrol lment rate 
of approximately 40 patients/year. The study will enroll a minimum of [ADDRESS_1076343] dose level (DL1; Azacitidine 2.5 mg/kg). If a dose reduc tion is required , then a 
minimum of 2 and maximum of 58 infants would be enrolled on the reduced dose level 
(DL0; Azacitidine 1. 8 mg/kg).

Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076344] 30 evaluable KMT2A -R 
patients for a given dose level.  This accounts for the assumptions of 80% KMT2A -R, 90% 
eligibility, and up to 25% drop out before conclusion of the evaluability period.  
 
Ame ndment # 3 
The study was temporarily closed to enrollment on October 30, 2018, when the accrual 
goal was met for dose level 1 (DL1).  
 
With this amendment the study  accrual is increased to allow enrollment of an additional 20 
subjects at DL1 to reach accru al of 30 evaluable subjects to ensure fulfillment of the 
primary study aim. If we use the actual study rates  of 71% KMT2A -r rate, 90% eligibility 
rate, and 43% drop -out rate, [ADDRESS_1076345]

9.2.4 Analysis for Primary Endpoint  
A single dose level design, with continuous enrollment, will be used for dose level 
tolerability and biologic activity determination. Enrollment will begin on DL1, 
with reduction to DL0 only if DL1 is deemed too toxic. Up to 58  patients will be 
enrolled at DL1, with the goal of evaluating 30  patients with KMT2A -R for 
tolerability and biologic activity  (see Section 9.5  for defini tion of evaluability for 
primary endpoint) . If dose reduction to DL0 is required, then up to 5 8 additional

patients will be enrolled at DL0, with the goal of evaluating 30  patients with 
KMT2A -R for tolerability and biologic activity.  
 
With Amendment #3, the study  accrual is increased to allow enrollment of an 
additional 20 subjects at DL1 (total 78 patients) to reach accrual of 30 evaluable 
subjects to ensure fulfillment of the primary study aim. If we use the actual study 
rates  of 71% KMT2A -r rate, 90% eli gibility rate, and 43% drop -out rate, 20 
additional subjects w ill result in about 7 additional evaluable subjects.  
 
DL1 and/or DL0 will be considered intolerable at any time if the number of patients 
with a DLT meets or exceeds pre -determined stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]. In the event that 
DL1 is deemed too toxic, any patient with remaining doses of azacitidine planned at 
DL1 wi ll instead receive DL0. If neither dose level is tolerable, then the investigators 
will review the biologic correlates to determine if there is sufficient evidence of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_782620] a lower DL.   
 
After the 6th evaluable patient, DLTs will be monitored continuously using Pocock 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782621].[ADDRESS_1076347] chemotherapy alone would result in a DLT 
rate of approximately  10% ( including a <  10% rate of delays in subsequent courses 
and a toxic death rate of approximately 3%). The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782622] 5% when the true DLT rate is 
10%. The dose level stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782623] a dose level excessively toxic 
are based on the number of evaluable patients and the number of patients with 
DLTs at any given time (Table  2). Table  2 assumes evaluation of 6  patients prior 
to initiation of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74239]. The intent of this design is to allow the trial to 
progress in the event of a spuriously high rate of DLT during early enrollment, 
while maintaining safety by [CONTACT_782680]. With 30  evaluable patients, the probabilities of declaring the 
dose level as too toxic are approximately 82.5%, 40.1%, and 4.3% when the true 
DLT rates are 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively.

Toxic deaths will be considered DLT events (see definition of DLT in Section 5.1 ) 
and will also be monitored independently of DLT. Toxic death will be defined as 
any Grade [ADDRESS_1076348] event during protocol therapy. The 
expected toxic death rate during the DLT evaluation period is 3%. The study will

experience a toxic death during the evaluation period. Using 3% as the planning 
rate, the study will have a 75.8%  probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782624] 
12% and a 10.0% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782625] 3%. 
Pending the outcome of the toxicity and safety review, the study may progress with 
further enrollment, with amendments if necessary.  
 
An informal interim analysis of toxicity and safety will be conducted af ter 3 
patients complete EPI #1 and Consolidation. Prior to the completion of this interim 
analysis, no more than 6 patients will be exposed to azacitidine (i.e., if a 7th patient 
is due to receive the first dose of azacitidine prior to the interim analysis  of the first 
3 patients, this patient will be removed from protocol therapy). The study 
committee will convene to review the toxicity data for each of these 3 patients, and 
will formulate an adjusted plan for further enrollment, if necessary.

The following are all optional studies and hence sample size availability for 
analyses cannot be accurat ely assessed.  Statistical analyses will be primarily 
descriptive. Minimal Residual Disease evaluations are optional studies; hence it is 
not possible to estimate how many patients will be evaluable for this endpoint. 
Descriptive analysis will be conducted  to correlate MRD with the EFS for the 
KMT2A -R patients. Pharmacokinetic (PK) testing and analysis of azacitidine in 
infants will be performed by [CONTACT_782681]. Optional 
biological  study participation will explore the feasibility of T -cell collection for 
the purposes of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell production from the 
peripheral blood in infants with ALL as described in Section 14.5 . 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) data for asparaginase activity following pegaspargase 
administration in infants will be collected and correlated with EFS  for the KMT2A -
R patients  (see Section 14.6 ).

10.0 EVALUATION CRITERIA  
10.1 Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize version 4.0 of the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for 
toxicity and performance reporting. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded 
from the CTEP website  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
Additionally, toxicities are to be reported on the appropriate case report forms.  
 
Please note:  ‘CTCAE v4.0’ is understood to represent the most current version of CTCAE 
v4.0 as referenced on the CTEP website ( i.e., v4.02 and all subsequent iterations prior to 
version 5.0).  
 
10.2 Response Criteria for Patients with Leukemia  
See definitions in Section 3.4

11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those 
who will enroll in future studies using similar a gents. Certain adverse events must be 
reported in an expedited manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. 
The following sections provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
11.2 Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient 
has received an investigational or commercial agent ; 2) the characteristics of the adverse 
event including the grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and 
the prior experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the 
trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431423].  
 
An investigational agent is a prot ocol drug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
package label.  
 
Commercial ag ents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some 
occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
When a study includes both investigational and co mmercial agents, the following rules 
apply.  
• Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in 
combination with a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be 
investigational and expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the 
guidelines for investigational agents.  
• Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent 
and a commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is 
given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, 
expedited reporting of adverse events that occur prior to starting the 
investigational agent would follow the guidelines for commercial  agents. 
Once therapy with the investigational agent is initiated, all expedited 
reporting of adverse events follo w the investigational agent reporting 
guidelines.  
 
11.3 Expedited Reporting Requirements – Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
To ensure compliance with these regulations/this guidance, as IND/IDE sponsor, NCI 
requires that AEs be submitted according to the timeframe s in the AE reporting tables 
assigned to the protocol, using the CTEP Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS).  
 
Any AE that is serious qualifies for expedited reporting . An AE is defined as any 
untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a dr ug in humans, whether or not 
considered drug related. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any adverse drug event 
(experience) occurring at any dose that results in ANY of the following outcomes:  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 133 
Version date: 9/25/19 
 
1) Death.  
2) A life -threatening adverse drug experience.  
3) An adverse event resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929] (for ≥  24 hours). This does not include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6718].  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial di sruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience 
when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1076353] 
administration of the investigational agent/intervention and has an attribution of a 
possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study therapy must be reported 
according to the CTEP -AERS reporting tables in this protocol.  
 
11.4.2  Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
Any AE that results in persisten t or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), 
congenital anomalies or birth defects, must be reported via CTEP -AERS if it 
occurs at any time following treatment  with an agent under a NCI IND/IDE since 
these are considered to be serious AEs.  
 
11.4.3  Death  
Reportable Categories of Death  
 
o Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
o Death Neonatal: Newborn death occurring during the first 28 days  after 
birth .  
o Sudden Death NOS: A s udden (defined as instant or within one hour of the 
onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
o Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associate d with Grade 5.  
o Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “ Disease 
progression ” in the system organ class (SOC) “ General disorders and 
administration site conditions ”. Evidence that the death was a manifestation 
of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) 
should be submitted.  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 134 
Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076354] dose, regardless of attribution to 
the investigational agent /intervention requires expedited reporting within [ADDRESS_1076355] dose of the investigational 
agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention.  
 
11.4.4  Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or 
chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary 
malignancy.  
 
The NCI requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with 
an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three options are 
available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary  malignancy  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) must 
also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in this protocol.  
 
11.4.5  Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and 
is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require 
ONLY routine reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified.  
 
11.5 Reporting Requirements for Specialized AEs  
11.5.1  Baseline AEs  
Although a pertinent positive finding identified on baseline assessment is not an 
AE, when possible it is to be documented as “Course Zero” using CTCAE 
terminology and grade. An expedited AE report is not required if a patient is 
entered on a protocol with a pre -existing condition ( e.g., eleva ted laboratory value, 
diarrhea). The baseline AE must be re -assessed throughout the study and reported 
if it fulfills expedited AE reporting guidelines.  
 
a. If the pre -existing condition worsens in severity, the investigator must 
reassess the event to dete rmine if an expedited report is required.  
b. If the AE resolves and then recurs, the investigator must re -assess the event 
to determine if an expedited report is required.  
c. No modification in grading is to be made to account for abnormalities 
existing at  baseline.  
 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 135 
Version date: 9/25/19 
11.5.2  Persistent AEs  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution between 
treatment cycles/courses.  
 
ROUTINE reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in a subsequent course. If the gra de becomes more severe 
the AE must be reported again with the new grade.  
EXPEDITED reporting: The AE must be reported only once unless the grade 
becomes more severe in the same or a subsequent course.  
 
11.5.3  Recurrent AEs  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and re solves during a cycle/course of therapy 
and then reoccurs in a later cycle/course.  
ROUTINE reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course must be reported by [CONTACT_293862].  
EXPEDITED reporting: An AE that resolves and then recurs during a subsequent 
cycle/course does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unless:  
1) The grade increases OR  
2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
11.6 Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
11.6.1  Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER)  
SPEER: Is a subset of AEs within the Comprehensive Adverse Events and 
Potential Risks (CAEPR) that contains a list of events that are considered expected 
for CTEP -AERS reporting purposes. (Formerly referred to as the Agent Speci fic 
Adverse Event List (ASAEL).  
 
AEs listed on the SPEER should be reported expeditiously by [CONTACT_293863] -AERS ONLY  if they exceed the grade of the event listed in 
parentheses after the event. If the CAEPR is part of a combination IND using 
multiple investigational agents and has an SAE listed on different SPEERs, use the 
lower of the grades to determine if expedited reporting is required.  
 
11.6.2  Special Situations as Exceptions to Expedited Reporting  
An expedited report may not be required f or a specific protocol where an AE is 
listed as expected. The exception or acceptable reporting procedures will be 
specified in the protocol. The protocol specific guidelines supersede the NCI 
Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines. These special situations ar e listed under the 
CTEP -AERS reporting Table A  for this protocol.  
 
11.7 Reporting Requirements – Investigator Responsibility  
Clinical investigators in the treating institutions and ultimately the Study Chair have the 
primary responsibility for AE identification , documentation, grading, and assignment of 
attribution to the investigational agent/intervention. It is the responsibility of the treating 
physician to supply the medical documentation needed to support the expedited AE reports 
in a timely manner.  
 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 136 
Version date: 9/25/19 
Note:  All expedited AEs (reported via CTEP -AERS) must also be reported via routine 
reporting. Routine reporting is accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report 
Form (CRF) within the study database.

11.13  Syndrome Reporting  
Unless otherwise specified in this protocol, syndromes should be reported as a single event 
using the CTCAE term for the composite syndrome, and not as the individual events that 
make up the syndrome. For example, Tumor Lysis Syndrome should be reported under the 
composite definition rather than reporting the component events (hyperkalemia, 
hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricem ia) separately.

APPENDIX IV: SUPPORTIVE CARE GUIDELINES  
General  
These are provided for institutional consideration. Investigator discretion should be used, and individual 
considerations made for specific patient situations and institutional practices. Study Chairs must be notified 
of any Serious Adverse Events, an Investigator’s decision to deviate in a major way from protocol directed 
therapy, or a patient taken off study.  
 
Aggressive supportive care improves outcome, particularly in high -risk patient populations receiving very 
intensive therapy as incorporated in this trial. The following g uidelines are intended to give general 
direction for optimal patient care and to encourage uniformity in the treatment of this study population.  
 
The Children’s Oncology Group Supportive Care Guidelines may be found at 
https://childrensoncologygroup.org/index.php/cog -supportive -care-endorsed -guidelines . 
 
Hydration/Allopurinol/Rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase)  
All infants should be placed on allopurinol  (150-300 mg/m2/day or 10 mg/kg/day in 2 -3 divided doses) 
when the diagnosis of leukemia is made or strongly suspected .  In some situations it may be appropriate to 
use rasburica se (recombinant urate oxidase).  Prior to instituting Induction therapy, all patients should be 
well hydrated. Potassium should not be added to the hydration fluids. Urine alkalinization is NOT necessary 
for TLS prophylaxis. There is paucity of evidence demonstrating benefit of urine alk alinization and it can 
potentially lead to calcium phosphate precipi[INVESTIGATOR_389050]/or metabolic acidosis. If the patient has oliguria or 
severe renal dysfunction, consider the use of rasburicase at 0.1 to 0.2  mg/kg/dose (or as per institutional 
guidelines) and  obtaining a nephrology consult. In patients with a prior history of glucose -6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase (G -6PD) deficiency, rasburicase is contraindicated and allopurinol should be utilized 
instead of rasburicase. Evidence of severe tumor lysis syndrome sho uld be stabilized prior to the institution 
of therapy. In patients with extremely elevated WBC (> 300,000 /µL), exchange transfusion is strongly 
recommended.  
 
Venous Access  
Due to the need for frequent blood sampling, intensive chemotherapy, nutritional sup port and vesicant use, 
it is essential  that all patients have a central venous catheter placed.  
 
Blood Components  
Blood products should be irradiated following current FDA guidelines found at:  
http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/981218g2.pdf  
 
Investigat ors in Canadian institutions need to follow the CSA standards for Blood and Blood Components 
CAN/CSA -Z902 -10 issued in February 2010 and available at: http://www.shopcsa.ca  
 
Red blood cells (RBCs)  
Transfusion with RBCs is indicated to correct severe or symptomatic anemia or acute blood loss. In the 
setting of extreme hyperleukocytosis investigators should be mindful that packed RBC transfusion may 
contribute to hyperviscosity.  
 
Platelets  
Transfusion  with platelets is indicated to correct bleeding manifestations and may be indicated for severe 
thrombocytopenia without bleeding particularly in the setting of an invasive procedure.  
 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 156 
Version date: 9/25/19 
Nutrition  
Protein -calorie malnutrition due to chemotherapy induced loss  of appetite, nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and 
sepsis is a major concern. Aggressive nutritional support should be instituted when patient’s weight/height 
ratio ÷ median weight/median height ratio for age and sex falls below 80% or when the serum albumin i s 
less than 3 mg/dL.  
 
Caution is advised with the use of early feeding / tube feeding in patients with difficult early courses or 
extensive mucositis/diaper area skin ulceration. Necrotizing enterocolitis and intestinal perforation have 
been observed in su ch infants. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be strongly considered in such 
infants until it is certain there is no risk to the gut.  
 
Fever and Neutropenia  
Aggressively manage epi[INVESTIGATOR_3942] (≥ 100.5ºF or 38.0oC), particularly during Induction, C onsolidation, 
Interim Maintenance, and Delayed Intensification, or when the patient is neutropenic with an ANC ≤ 1000. 
The risk of life threatening infection is particularly high during the first 4 -6 weeks of therapy or when 
patients are neutropenic with a n ANC ≤ 1000. It is strongly advised that patients with fever and neutropenia 
(ANC < 1000) not be managed with an outpatient antibiotic regimen. It is mandatory that patients with an 
ANC < [ADDRESS_1076390] s pectrum IV antibiotics adjusted 
appropriately for the causative organism.  
 
See COG endorsed Fever and Neutropenia Guidelines at 
http://childrensoncologygroup.org/d ownloads/COG_SC_FN_Guideline_Document.pdf  for empi[INVESTIGATOR_782638] . 
 
Infants with ALL are also at high risk for life -threatening viral infections, particularly RSV (see RSV 
Prophylaxis and Treatment sections below), during respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] s eason.  
 
Use of filgrastim (G -CSF)  
Filgrastim  or biosimilar  may be used for severe infections with neutropenia, but routine use is discouraged. 
Filgrastim should not be given concurrently with azacitidine or chemotherapy and it must be discontinued 
at least [ADDRESS_1076391] coverage for BOTH gram -positive and gram -negative organisms. As the predominant pathogenic 
bacteria are gram -positive organisms including viridi ans streptococci, the empi[INVESTIGATOR_447962] -positive coverage 
should include vancomycin, clindamycin or a drug appropriate for the treatment of viridians streptococci.  
 
Intravenous Immunoglobulin   
All patients are to receive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 400 mg/kg if serum IgG level 
is below 500 mg/dL. Doses should be repeated every 4 weeks as needed to keep IgG level at 500 mg/dL or 
greater.  
 
Antibiotic and Antifungal Prophylaxis  
Infection related mortality is high during all phases prior to Maint enance.  Interfant -06 mandates antibiotic 
and antifungal prophylaxis and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_782639] (Induction, Consolidation, Interim Maintenance, and Delayed 
Intensification).   There are insufficient data to make specific recommendations regarding the choice of 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 157 
Version date: 9/25/19 
antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis for infants enrolled on AALL15P1. Azole antifungal agents (i.e., 
fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) given concurrently with v incristine may increase the risk of 
neurotoxicity. Investigator caution is advised  if azole antifungals are used.  
 
The following are strongly recommended for infants enrolled on AALL15P1, during the intensive phases 
of therapy (Induction, Consolidation, De layed Intensification, and Interim Maintenance).  
 
1) Monitor the patient in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_782640]/she shows signs of bone marrow recovery (specifically evidence that the absolute 
neutrophil count is rising for 2 consecutive days after the nadir) and the patient is afebrile 
and clinically stable.  
2) Consider antibiotic prophylaxis against gram -positive and gram -negative organisms . 
3) Consider antifungal prophylaxis.  Options include an echinocandin such as caspofungin  or 
micafungin, or azoles.  Concomitant administration of an azole with vincristine should be 
avoided.  
 
Pneumocystis Prophylaxis  
PCP prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis of ALL is confirmed and 
continued until 6 months afte r all therapy is completed.  
 
1. The drug of choice is trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole at a dosage of 150 mg TMP /m2/day in 2 divided 
doses on 2 or 3 consecutive days per week in infants > [ADDRESS_1076392] 
72 hours after the start of the HD MTX infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.1 μM.  
 
2. Second line options include: Dapsone 2 mg/kg/day or 4mg/kg once a w eek in infants ≥ 1 month of age, 
IV pentamidine for infants ≥ 5 months of age , Aerosolized pentamidine for all ages.  
 
RSV Prophylaxis   
Palivizumab 15 mg/kg IM every month should be initiated at the start  of the RSV season and terminated at 
the end of the R SV season.  
 
RSV Treatment   
All RSV infections (upper and lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_696])  should be treated. Follow institutional guidelines for RSV 
treatment in high risk patients.  
 
Additionally, palivizumab 15 mg/kg IM should be administered, if not already given as p rophylaxis.  
 
Influenza Immunization   
Infants ≥ 6 months of age should receive 2 doses of the influenza immunization per CDC guidelines. 
Household contacts and out -of-home caregivers should also receive the influenza immunization.  
 
Varicella Infection and Prophylaxis   
Varicella -Zoster Virus (VZV) immunization should be avoided until at least 3 months following the end of 
Maintenance chemotherapy. Patients with exposure to VZV should be treated with Varicella Zoster 
Immunoglobulin (VZIG) within  [ADDRESS_1076393] 96 hours . If VZIG is not 
available, patients should be treated with IVIG 400 mg/kg.  Consideration may be given to oral acyclovir 
prophylaxis, beginning 7 to 10 days after exposure and continuing for 7 days . Patients with symptoms of 
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 158 
Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076394] is advised for 
the treatment of infants with VZV infection.  The use of oral acyclovir for prophylaxis is recommended after 
completion of treatment for VZV infection.  
 
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_782641]’s clinic al and laboratory profile as 
well as institutional infection pattern. If the patient is not neutropenic and the pulmonary lesions on CT 
scan are not particularly suggestive of a mold infection (Aspergillus, Mucor), consider coverage with broad 
spectrum ant ibiotics and evaluate for viral causes of pulmonary infiltrates including RSV, influenza, and 
CMV. If the patient develops progressively worsening clinical or laboratory features or if the pulmonary 
lesions on CT scan are suggestive of a fungal infection ( Aspergillus, Mucor), more aggressive diagnostic 
measures should be undertaken. Pulmonary infiltrates may be evaluated with bronchoscopy and biopsy, 
lavage, or open lung biops y. If a procedure cannot be tolerated and/or if there is high clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798] o f 
fungal disease, begin empi[INVESTIGATOR_782642] B, given the high likelihood of fungal disease.  
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_431894] -negative and positive bacteria, fungi, RSV, influenza, CMV, 
Pneumocystis, and Legionella. If fungal pulmonary  disease is documented, surveillance radiographic 
imaging studies of the sinuses, abdomen/pelvis, and brain are indicated. Surgical excision should be 
considered and is at the discreti on of the treatment physician. Treatment of fungal infections with 
ampho tericin B and/or other antifungal agents will be at the discretion of the treating physician.  Azole 
antifungal agents (i.e. fluconazole, voriconazole) given concurrently with vincristine may INCRE ASE the 
risk of neurotoxicity. Caution is advised if azole antifungals are used. It is advisable to seek an infectious 
disease consult during the evaluation and treatment of an infant with pulmonary infiltrates and/or suspected 
invasive fungal infection.  
 
Stress Steroid Support  
If serious illness (particularly a potentially life -threatening infection) should occur in close proximity to the 
completion of the Induction or Delayed Intensification, consider additional "stress steroid" support.  
 
Mucositis  
Moderate (Grade 3) or sever e (Grade 4) mucositis requires vigorous treatment including IV fluids, 
hyperalimentation, and strong consideration of broad spectrum antibiotics if febrile or ill appearing. 
Antifungal and antiviral therapy should be considered based on culture results and  clinical evaluation. Daily 
oral antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole should be strongly considered in patients not receiving 
vincristine. DO NOT PROCEED WITH FURTHER HD MTX or DAUNORUBICIN UNTIL MUCOSITIS 
BEGINS TO HEAL.  
 
Perineal Irritation   
There is a high risk of Grade 3 -4 diaper area skin ulceration with daunorubicin and HD MTX. Placement 
of a Foley catheter for 48 -72 hours during administration/urinary excretion of these drugs may dramatically 
reduce this diaper area skin ulceration. Use of a stron g barrier technique is also recommended. If unable to 
place a Foley catheter, frequent diaper changes are advised during HD MTX/daunorubicin administration. 
If severe skin ulceration occurs, manage skin care aggressively and strongly consider antibiotic co verage 
until skin heals. DO NOT PROCEED WITH FURTHER HD MTX/DAUNORUBICIN UNTIL SKIN 
BEGINS TO HEAL.  
 
Antiemetic Protection  
Azacitidine is moderately emetogenic and antiemetics are strongly advised on Days 1 to 5 of every 
azacitidine course.  Antiemetics should be given as needed during all phases of chemotherapy. The routine 
use of corticosteroids as antiemetics is discouraged.

APPENDIX VI: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR PHARMACODYNAMIC 
ASSESSMENT OF DNA METHYLATION  
a) Rationale  
Preclinical studies of methylation patterns in infant ALL cell lines and patient samples have 
identified DNA hypermethylation as an important pathway driving leukemogenesis and is a 
potential target for testing in infant ALL models.7,9,[ADDRESS_1076398] demonstrated preclinical efficacy in the treatment of 
KMT2A -R ALL cells. Bhatla et al., described reversal of the gene methylation signature [CONTACT_782705] B -ALL patient samples and 
KMT2A -R cell lines.12 Stumpel et al., further demonstrated that infant ALL cells with KMT2A -R 
are susceptible to deme thylating agents.5 In a study of the methylation patterns of infant ALL, 
Schafer et al.  identified significantly more promoter hypermethylation in KMT2A -R patient -
derived cells, compared with KMT2A -wild type infant ALL cells.7 Genes with promoter 
hypermethylation correlated with down -regulated or silenced expression. Treatment with 
decitabine preferentially led to cytotoxicity o f KMT2A -R cell lines, compared with KMT2A -wild 
type cell lines, supporting the role for demethylating agents in inducing cytotoxicity and 
chemosensitivity in the treatment of infant KMT2A -R ALL.  There is growing clinical experience 
with DNMTis in combinati on with chemotherapy in acute leukemia in children, but no specific 
treatment experience in infants. Thus, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_782644]. For this trial in a highly vulnerable infant pop ulation, 
azacitidine has been chosen for study, based upon its availability and preferred profile of safety and 
tolerability in prior pediatric studies.  
 
A secondary endpoint of this trial is to determine if there is biologic activity of azacitidine at a 
tolerable dose level. Dosing of azacitidine and the metabolism of azacitidine may be altered in 
infants, and the starting dose level is reduced from the typi[INVESTIGATOR_782588] -based dosing, so we feel 
that it is important to directly assess for evidence of DNA d emethylation at each dose level tested.  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_782645]. Rather, DL1 (and DL0 if necessary) will be evaluated for tolerability and 
evidence of biologic epi[INVESTIGATOR_782646]. If both DL1 and DL0 
are too toxic, but show evidence of biologic activity, then consideration will be given to amending 
the study to test lower doses. If no biologic activity is seen, the strat egy will not be pursued further. 
If DL1 is tolerable but shows no biologic activity, then consideration will be given to amending the 
study to test higher doses.  
 
b) Hypotheses and specific aims  
We hypothesize that the dose levels of azacitidine to be tested on this trial will lead to reduction of 
global DNA methylation (i.e., 5 -methylcytosine content) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
when comparing cells collected just prior to the first dos e of azacitidine and cells collected after 5 
consecutive days of azacitidine dosing.  
 
• Specific Aim 1:  To determine, for each patient and for the population of patients as a  
  whole, the total DNA  5-methylcytosine (5mC) content in peripheral blood 
  mononu clear cells (PBMCs) isolated from samples of peripheral blood  
   THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY , SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  AALL15P1  
Page 165 
Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076399] two courses of azacitidine.  
 
c) Methods  
Refer to Secti on 14.1  for specimen collection and shipment. All blood samples will be diluted in 
HBSS and centrifuged over Lymphocyte Separation Medium (LSM) to isolate mononuclear cells, 
then suspended in culture medium. V iable cells will be counted by [CONTACT_782690]. For yields 
≤ 5e6, all cells will be used for immediate DNA extraction. For yields > 5e6, excess cells will be 
suspended in c ryoprotectant solution and viably cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen in aliquots of up 
to 5e6 cells for subsequent batched assa ys as needed.  
 
Using the freshly isolated PBMCs, total cellular DNA will be extracted using Qiagen commercial 
kits according to manufacturer’s protocol. DNA quantity and quality will be assessed using 
NanoDrop.  DNA will be stored at -80 C for subsequent ba tched assays.  
 
Batched DNA will be thawed and assessed for global DNA methylation using a commercial ELISA 
LINE -1 kit which measures 5 -methylcytosine (5mC) content in the long interspersed nucleotide 
element 1 (LINE -1) repeat elements, which is a validate d surrogate of global DNA methylation. 
Each sample will be assayed in triplicate using 200 ng of starting DNA for each of the three 
replicates. The endpoint with the assay is a point estimate of the %5 -mC in each replicate, ranging 
from 0 -100%.  
 
The Brown laboratory routinely processes blood specimens from cooperative group clinical trials 
and performs a wide variety of assays using freshly isolated and/or viably cryopreserved cells. 
Samples are generally received in the laboratory within 48 hours of collec tion and processed 
immediately. Cells are sufficiently stable in transport under these conditions for the proposed 
assays.  
 
d) Analysis and Statistical Considerations  
The mean and standard error of the %5 -mC triplicates will be calculated for each sample.   
 
The difference between the mean %[ADDRESS_1076400] -treatment sample will be 
calculated and expressed as ΔM (change in methylation). A positive value will represent a decrease 
in methylation after exposure to azacitidine.  
 
Each set of pai red pre - and post -treatment %[ADDRESS_1076401] two ΔM values (ΔM1 for course 1, and ΔM2 for 
course 2).  
 
There are two possible dose levels that patients will receive on this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. The patients treated 
at DL1 and DL0 will be analyzed separately.  
 
We will first describe the distribution of all ΔM values for the entire cohort for each dose level. 
The anticipated result is that the mean ΔM for the entire cohort will be positive and the paired t -
test will demonstrate statistical significance, reflectin g the expected reduction in DNA methylation 
upon exposure to azacitidine.

Page 166 
Version date: 9/25/[ADDRESS_1076402] been tested in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. We anticipate that there will be a detectable dose -response relationship.  
 
In published clinical tr ials where LINE -1 methylation has been measured in PBMCs before and 
after DNMTi treatment, the reduction in %[ADDRESS_1076403] studies showing an 
average reduction in the 3 -10% range at standard doses. Given the relative paucity of data ava ilable 
and the wide variability, we will simply describe the observed differences in %[ADDRESS_1076404] decision rule in 
terms of the magnitude of %[ADDRESS_1076405] 
30 patients will provide a full set of 4 samples (pre - and post -treatment for each of the first two 
courses of a zacitidine). We anticipate that this sample size will be sufficient to detect clinically 
significant biologic activity of azacitidine.

APPENDIX VII:  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR T CELL PROLIFERATION 
CAPACITY CORELATIVE BIOLOGY STUDY  
 
a) Rationale  
Adoptive immunotherapy with CART -19 has had great early success in pediatric patients with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)79-81. In order for patients to receive this therapy, we must be 
able to harvest functional T cells from the patient. Not all patients who undergo apheresis have 
successful collections or ex vivo T cell expansions, and this corresponds with the absence of early 
memory T cell subsets in the peripheral blood of these patient s82. This can be directly related to 
chemotherapy, but is also true at diagno sis in lymphoma and solid tumor patients. Of the first 70 
pediatric patients treated with CART19, only one was less than 3 years old. Prospective data on the 
feasibility of CAR T cell manufacture indicates that very young children (<3 years old) quickly 
lose T cell proliferative capacity after successive chemotherapy cycles, much more quickly and 
completely than older children. At diagnosis, however, >80% of children under age 3 had excellent 
T cell proliferative capacity similar to the rate for children of  all ages (81.2%). After 2 cycles of 
chemotherapy, however, only 16% of children under age 3 had suitable T cells for cellular therapy 
compared with 75% of all ages. Only one infant ALL patient has been able to be analyzed in any 
of these studies from a si ngle institution.  
 
This trial includes a correlative study testing the feasibility of T -cell collection for the purposes of 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell production from the peripheral blood in infants with ALL. 
For those patients who consent, per ipheral blood samples will be collected prior to therapy 
initiation, at the end of Induction, and at the end of Consolidation therapy. Lymphocyte subsets 
will be quantified, and functional studies will be performed to assess the ability of the lymphocytes 
to expand in response to artificial antigen presenting cell stimulation ex vivo. The ability to expand 
in response to this stimulus is a critical determinant of the feasibility of adoptive immunotherapy, 
specifically for CART -19. 
 
 
b) Hypotheses and specif ic aims  
The central hypothesis is that infants and very young children with ALL have highly proliferative 
T cells available for collection at diagnosis, and that these cells are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_782647].  
 
• Specific Aim 1 : Determine the lymphocyte subset and phenotype of T cells from infants with 
ALL.  
 
• Specific Aim 2 : Determine the feasibility of CART19 manufacture from infants with ALL 
with T cells collected at diagnosis or after Induction and Consolidation 
therapy.  
 
c) M ethods  
Sample receipt and processing. Please refer to Section 14. 5 for detail.  
 
The Barrett laboratory routinely processes blood and marrow specimens from cooperative group 
clinical trials and performs a wide variety of assays using fresh and viably cryopreserved cells. 
Samples are generally received in the laboratory within 48 -72 hou rs of collection and processed 
immediately. T cells are sufficiently stable in transport under these conditions for the proposed 
assays. The flow cytometric and T cell expansion assays are also routinely performed in the Barrett

laboratory.  
 
Multiparameter  flow cytometric measurement of lymphocyte subsets and phenotype  
Blood samples will be separated by [CONTACT_599191] (Ficoll) the day of receipt. White blood 
cells will be isolated from the buffy coat and plated on plastic overnight at 37◦C to remove  adherent 
cells. Cells will then be stained with isotype controls and the following antibody panels, and 
analyzed in triplicate by [CONTACT_4133].  
 
o For lymphocyte subsets: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 (to exclude leukemia), CD45RO, 
CD45RA, CCR7, CD62L, CD95, PD -1, Lag -3, Tim -3, VISTA, and TIGIT.  
 
The endpoint for this assay will be the relative percentage of each of the following:  
 
o Naïve T -cells 
o Memory T -cells (stem central memory vs central vs. effector)  
o Terminal effector T cells  
o Number of negative checkp oint regulators (NCRs) on each subset and in total  
 
T cell proliferative capacity  
Small scale manufacture of CART19 replicates the potential of clinical scale manufacturing. 
Samples from 1 -4 mL of peripheral blood subjected to the same manufacturing conditions using 
CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (called a test expansion) accurately predict the suc cess of clinical CART19 
manufacture. T cells from the sample will be counted and plated with CD3/CD28 beads at a ratio 
of 3:1, and followed for cell size (by [CONTACT_782691]), number and change in T cell subset 
composition by [CONTACT_83549].  A cutoff of a 5 -fold expansion or higher within 14 
days is used to determine successful potential for CART19 manufacture.  
 
The endpoint for this assay will be pass (≥5 fold expansion) or fail (< 5 fold).  
 
Rationale for selection of methods and laboratori es 
The methods described above are performed routinely in the Barrett lab, who published the first 
and most comprehensive analysis of T cell subsets and CART19 potential in children with B cell 
malignancies. Thus use of this lab is likely to optimize the c hances that the proposed studies will 
be successful.  
 
d) Analysis and Statistical Considerations  
 
Since we are proposing to use standard assays (flow cytometric quantification of marrow cell 
subsets) in a novel population, we do not have a priori knowledge  of the expected range of observed 
values. As such, these studies are exploratory and definitive power calculations are not possible.  
 
Final cell counts from the test expansions will be used to estimate the volume of blood necessary 
for making clinical sc ale CART19 for patients of this population. In addition, the test expansions 
will be used to judge feasibility of CART19 manufacture from infants at the early time points in 
their therapy. This knowledge will be used to guide future cell therapy studies in  this high risk 
population.

APPENDIX VIII: PHARMACOKINETIC OF AZACITIDINE  
Pharmacokinetic sampling will be done on Days 3, 4 and 5 of EPI [INVESTIGATOR_782587] #1 for determination of plasma 
azacitidine concentrations. A total of 7  samples (7 mL of blood) will be collec ted from each patient. 
Azacitidine is unstable in blood, therefore all blood samples will be processed and plasma harvested 
immediately  per the instructions provided. Sample collection kits and supplies will be provided by [CONTACT_782692] . Kit ordering details and shipment instructions are provided in the PK of Aza information packet 
found on the AALL15P1 protocol webpage.  
 
To obtain accurate measurements of azacitidine levels in plasma, it is very important  that tetrahydrouridine 
(THU) be added to blood  collection tubes immediately  after obtaining PK blood samples. THU inhibits 
the activity of cytidine deaminase, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of azacitidine.  The following 
preparations should occur  in advance of PK blood collections.  
 
Preparation of Tetrahydrouridine  
 
Supplies provided by [CONTACT_782693] : 
• (3) vials containing 0.3 mL THU -Solution A in 10 mL  polypropylene capped vial  
 
NOTE:  Clinical Logistics  will ship the THU - Solution A  frozen, in single -use vials,  separately from 
the collection kits. The THU -Solution A  must be stored at -20C immediately upon receipt . Use one 
vial of THU -Solution A for each PK sampling visit . 
 
1. THU -Solution A:  
a. THU -Solution A will be provided in single -use vials at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 
methanol.  
 
b. One the day of use remove one single -use vial of THU -Solution A from the -20°C freezer.  
 
c. Mix vigorously and thoroughly using a vortex mixer or sonicator after thawing,  
 
 
2. THU -Solution B - must be prepared on each PK day:  
a. Transfer 5 mL of distilled water into the thoroughly mixed, single -use vial of THU -
Solution A to prepare THU -Solution B . 
 
b. Mix thoroughly.  
 
c. The final concentration of THU -Solution B is 0.3 mg/mL.  
 
d. Store THU -Solution B at 4 C. 
 
e. Label the tube “ THU -Solution B ” with the “date of preparation” and the “ expi[INVESTIGATOR_69089]” (i.e., expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]  = date of preparation + 1 day). Clinical Logistics  will provide 
a label.  
 
f. Discard any remaining THU -Solution B at the end of each day. Prepare a  fresh batch of 
THU -Solution B at the beginning of each PK sampling visit.

Pharmacokinetics Analysis  
A validated high -performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method (LC -MS/MS) 
will be used for azacitidine plasma concentration analysis by [CONTACT_782658].  
 
The PK population will consist of all patients who had sufficient concentration time data to enable the 
calculation of PK parameters for azacitidine. For patients that did not receive adequate azacitidine dose, or 
for patients with incomplete data, a decis ion as to their inclusion in the analysis will be made on a case -by-
case basis.  
 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of azacitidine will be calculated from plasma concentration -time profiles using 
non-compartmental methods, though compartmental analysis may be empl oyed if appropriate. Plasma PK 
parameters will include, but not be limited to:  
• Cmax: observed maximum plasma concentration  
• Tmax: observed time to maximum plasma concentration  
• AUC t: area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to the last quantifiable 
time point, calculated by [CONTACT_24390]  
• AUC inf: area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated 
by [CONTACT_782694]:  
AUC inf = AUC t + (C t/λz), where C t is the last quantifiable concentration  
• λz: terminal phase rate constant, determined by [CONTACT_782695]-linear plasma concentration -time curve  
• t½: terminal phase hal f-life, will be calculated according to the following equation:   
t½ = 0.693/λ z 
• CL: total clearance, calculated as Dose/AUC inf 
• Vz: volume of distribution will be calculated according to the equation: V z = (CL)/λz

of 5,000/µL with 20% b lasts). If only PB is submitted, please obtain and send twice  the volume of PB 
as the recommended BM volume specified in the tables. As long as there are at least 1,000/µL PB 
blasts, institutions are encouraged to submit PB in addition to BM samples to mak e sure that adequate 
material is available to perform the required studies.  
 
Technical Aspects for Cytogenetic Laboratory Directors  
 
Probes:  
BCR -ABL1  dual fusion preferred, extra signal acceptable, single fusion not acceptable  
ETV6 -RUNX1 (TEL -AML1 ) 
KMT2A breakapart.  
Centromeres for chromosomes 4 and 10. Simultaneous (i.e., 2 -color) evaluation preferred.  
 
Technique:  
• Samples must be unstimulated.  
• All probes should be validated prior to use.  
• Follow manufacturer’s directions.  
• KMT2A  (MLL ) break -apart should be scored positive if the 5’ and 3’ signals are split OR if the 3’ signal 
is deleted with retention of 5’ signal. Loss or translocation of both the 5’ and 3’ KMT2A  signals is NOT 
indicative of an KMT2A  (MLL ) rearrangement and should NO T be scored as positive.  
• Evaluate/count signal patterns in 200 cells. If less than 100 cells are analyzed for any 1 of the probes, 
please call Andrew Carroll (West) at (205) 934 -0665 or Nyla Heerema (East) at (614) 292 -7815 to 
discuss.

Definition of double trisomy:  
For a case to be “positive” for trisomy 4 & 10 (double trisomy, DT), it must be positive for both 
trisomy 4 and trisomy 10, and the percentage of one trisomy cannot be ≥  2X the percentage of the 
other. Examples: If trisomy 4 in 20% and trisomy 10 in 40%, the case is not DT. If trisomy 4 in 21% 
and trisomy 10 i n 40%, the case is DT.  
 
In addition to completing this form, the cytogenetic laboratory must submit all cytogenetics results and

         Research Protocol: 18F-DOPA PET to Elucidate the Antidepressant Mechanism of Lurasidone in Bipolar Disorder 9/17/2019             
Recruitment Procedures Patients will be recruited through referrals from treating outpatient psychiatrists, or from clinics at Columbia University. Advertisements will be placed through the Columbia University website including the "RecruitMe" site and on advertising sites such as Craig’s List. A website that describes the study will be created. Messages will be posted on email list-serves of mental health clinicians describing the study and asking for referrals. Subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_481863]#6669R. Study staff and investigators will contact [CONTACT_257287]. For clinical patients at Columbia, only subjects who the clinical staff has identified as appropriate will be approached. The clinical staff will first ask the patient if he or she can be approached by [CONTACT_3647]. Only if the subject agrees to be approached will the staff from this study do so. All potential subjects will be given the telephone number of the research coordinators who will discuss the purpose and procedures of the research and screen the subjects for potential eligibility.  Texts of written materials to be distributed via advertisements and websites will be submitted to the IRB for approval before they are distributed. 1. Initial screening will be completed as detailed in IRB#6879R or IRB#6669R.  2. If eligible, subjects will be asked to sign the consent form for IRB# 4815 (Sublette). Participants will then be given a physical exam, laboratory test (via blood draw) and psychiatric examinations as performed under IRB#4815. IRB#4815 allows for clinical assessments, a medical screening for significant illness, a screening for drugs of abuse, a developmental history and acquisition of blood samples for genetic analyses. IRB#4815 allows for the above procedures so that subjects can enter any of several different types of studies and protocols.  3. If eligible for IRB#4815, subjects will be given a detailed verbal explanation of this study by a research psychiatrist. During the consent process, the consenting psychiatrist will obtain a history of participants' past radiation exposure. Participants will then give written informed consent if they choose to participate in the study.

The patients will be off of all medications for three weeks before PET scanning. This medication-free treatment period is necessary to obtain imaging and clinical outcome data that are not significantly influenced by [CONTACT_257290]. The design will also allow us to measure the clinical response to lurasidone that is independent from an interaction with the previous medications. Patients will meet with a psychiatrist from MIND or DES at least weekly 
in person during this time. A CGI, HAM-D, YMRS, psychotic symptoms of BPRS and CSSRS will be performed at least weekly to detect new onset of manic symptoms or clinical deterioration. Only patients who still meet inclusion criterion of HAM-D>15, including atypi[INVESTIGATOR_257267], at the clinical appointment one week before the scheduled PET scan will continue. Patients who no longer meet inclusion criteria at the end of the period, including those that are no longer sufficiently depressed, will not continue with imaging and will be offered up to 6 months of open label outpatient treatment.  Frequency of Clinical Visits: Throughout the study, outpatients will meet with a treating MIND or DES psychiatrist at least once a week in-person. Subjects will do the washout on the [ADDRESS_618898] daily, except for weekends and holidays.  MRI Scans: All subjects will have an MRI of the brain to obtain information on brain structure to co- register PET data. MRI scans will be obtained at the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_257268] a 3.[ADDRESS_618899] the option of visiting the MRI suite before the scan to enter a mock (fake) MRI scanner. The mock MRI scanner has the same dimensions as the real scanner so it allows participants to experience what it is like to be inside the actual magnet. The purpose of this is to have the subject be as comfortable as possible before the actual scan. Patients will receive an MRI scan lasting not more than 30 minutes. Structural scans will include T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging sequences. The procedure will be immediately stopped if the participant reports significant distress.  PET Imaging: Each subject will undergo two PET scans with [18F]DOPA at the David A. Gardner PET Center at [ADDRESS_618900], [LOCATION_001], NY [ZIP_CODE]. One scan will be before lurasidone is initiated and the second will be four weeks (+/- one week) after starting lurasidone. Patients will not eat within [ADDRESS_618901] will be placed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_257270]. A head holder will be used to decrease head movement during the scan. A low dose computer tomography scan will be used to obtain data for attenuation correction. 5 mCi or less of [18F]DOPA will be administered I.V. over about [ADDRESS_618902] conducted after the PET scan within 2 weeks of the scan.  Clinical Treatment: Open-label lurasidone will be taken by [CONTACT_378449] a meal, beginning at [ADDRESS_618903] two weeks. At that time, the dose can be increased to 40 mg daily for two weeks. Dosage will be raised only if the participant is tolerating the medication and has not been rated "much improved" or "very much improved" on the CGI improvement scale for that week. At week 4, blood samples will be drawn to measure blood glucose and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_481860]. Treatment will be up to [ADDRESS_618904], unless the participant is rated much improved at week four, in which case visits will be biweekly thereafter. Additional visits can be scheduled at the study doctor's discretion for purposes of clinical management. At each visit, the study psychiatrist will complete the MADRS, YMRS, CGI, CSSRS, psychotic symptoms of BPRS, and SAFETEE-GI. Patients will complete self-rating forms at each visit. Participants with a Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) score of 6 ("much worse") or 7 ("very much worse") on two consecutive weeks during the trial will be terminated early from the study. Patients without alcohol or benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_481861]/agitation (maximum dose equivalent to 4 mg of lorazepam per day). All patients may also receive zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_257273].  Lurasidone and all laboratory tests will be provided for free of charge to the participant. Participants will receive six months of free outpatient treatment including the treatment obtained through this protocol, with treatment visits at least monthly.  Emergency Procedures: A research psychiatrist will be available by [CONTACT_481867]. Patients requiring urgent admission at the time of a study visit will be brought to the CUMC Emergency Department by [CONTACT_481868], security assistance will be provided. The treating psychiatrist will arrange non-urgent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], preferably to the NYSPI 5-South unit. If patients refuse hospi[INVESTIGATOR_481862], the team will arrange all necessary interventions including contact[CONTACT_481869], family or Emergency Medical Services.  Patients lost to follow-up: Upon enrollment, patients will be asked to provide the name [CONTACT_481872]. These people will be contact[CONTACT_481870].  
Criteria for Early Discontinuation 1) Intolerable side effects of lurasidone  2) Refusal to continue regimen and willingness to receive open treatment 3) DSM-IV criteria for a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_257274] > 12 on the YMRS  4) During the washout period, if subjects score a six (much worse) or seven (very much worse) on the CGI- I, the protocol will be discontinued. If the participants do not tolerate the washout because of marked agitation, severe anorexia such as inability to drink adequate amount of fluids, or suicidal ideation or behavior with plan or intent, the protocol will be discontinued. In these cases, subjects will be offered open clinical treatment.  5) During the lurasidone treatment phase, if subjects score a six (much worse) or seven (very much worse) on the CGI-I for two consecutive weeks, the trial will be terminated early. If there is clinical reason to change to open treatment, such as onset of psychotic symptoms, manic symptoms of clinical concern, active suicidal ideation on two consecutive visits, the clinical team will evaluate whether the risks outweigh the benefits of continuing protocol.  6) If the patient requests withdrawal for any reason.  7) The PI [INVESTIGATOR_257275], for example if the subjects are unable to comply with the study procedures and rules.  Radiotracer Information Name [CONTACT_481873]/compound: [18F]DOPA Manufacturer and other information: [18F]DOPA will be synthesized by [CONTACT_481871]. IND 140398 is to use [18F]DOPA with lurasidone (latuda) as per this PSF. Lurasidone (Latuda) will not be used in an off label manner, however.  IND is approved IND# 140398.  IND is held by [CONTACT_976]/CU Investigator Lan, Martin, MD  Data Analysis Plan The aim of the analyses is to provide feasibility data for a larger grant application. We will visualize all data to assess for trends that are not detectable in standard statistical analyses due to the small power of this preliminary study.

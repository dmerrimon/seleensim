 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 6.0 RATIONALE  
The primary purpose of this amendment was to address the following requests from the FDA:  
 To include additional hepatitis viral load testing in patients who had detectable 
hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) viral load at Screening,  
 To add myocarditis  and myositis/ rhabodmyol ysis as potential immune -related 
adverse events and provide guidelines for their treatment and study drug 
management,  
 To add serum creatine kinase (CK) and creatine kinase cardiac muscle isoenzyme 
(CK-MB) monitoring due to 2 cases of myositis reported with tislelizumab, and  
 To add additional ophthalm ologic evaluation time points.  
 
Additional changes  made in the amendment are noted below.   Minor editorial changes were 
also made throughout the protocol.  
Applicable Sections  Description of Revision  
Change: Changed BGB -A317 to the compound’s INN name, tislelizumab, throughout the 
document (did not change the study number or protocol name).  
Reason:  INN name [CONTACT_635741] -A317 is available  
Change: Included add itional hepatitis viral load testing every 4 cycles throughout the study for 
patients who had detectable hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) viral load at Screening, and 
how to manage subjects with HCC who test positive for HBV or HCV.  
Reason: Based on a request from the FDA, in order to reduce the risk of significant hepatic toxicity 
in patients with active or prior HBV infection, and for consistency across protocols.  
Section 5.1:  
Table 5 + footnote 17,  
Table 7 + footnote 16,  
Table 8 + footnote 16,  
Table 9 + footnote 16,  
Table 11 + footnote 17  
 
Section 8.2.2  
 
Section 11.3.10  
 
Appendix 3   In Section 8.2.2, revised heading to “Physical Examination, 
Ophthalmologic Examination and, Vital Signs , and Hepatitis B and C 
testing  
 In Section 8.2.2, and in Section 5.1 footnotes for Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 
pertaining to hepatitis B and C assessment, added the following text:  
Subjects enrolled in the study who had detectable HBV DNA or HCV 
RNA at Screening should be tested for HBV or HCV viral load, 
respectively , every 4 cycles (± 7 days) throughout the study, eg 
Screening, Cycle 5, Cycle 9, and so on (and whenever clinically 
indicated). For subjects who already received [ADDRESS_849230]’s next v isit and 
every [ADDRESS_849231] dose (Cycle 1 Day 1), 
and whenever clinically indicated. HCC subjects who test positive for 
HCV will not be discontinued. HCC subjects who test positive for HBV 
should be treated as per local gui delines at the investigator’s discretion.  
 In Section 5.1, study assessment tables for each phase/part of the study 
(Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11), separated HIV assessment from hepatitis B and 
C assessment for clarity.  For hepatitis B and C assessment, in addition to 
the “x” at Screening, added “x (Cycle 5 and every 4 cycles)” to each table.

 Applicable Sections  Description of Revision  
 Added Section 11.3.10 Hepatitis B and C, to add the assessment as a safety 
analysis.  
 In Appendix 3, for each separate study phase, added collection of 3 -5 mL 
blood for hepatitis B and C analysis on Cycle 5 Day 1 (and every 4 cycles 
thereafter).  
Change: Clarified the timing of ophthalmologic examinations after Cycle 3 (for Q2W patients)/End 
of Week 9 (for Q3W patients) as shown below, including subjects who may not have previously had 
an assessment after Cycle 3/Week 9, respectively. Additionally, all references to “eyesight” as part 
of an ophthalmologic exam were changed to “ey esight/visual acuity”.  
Reason: Changes to ophthalmologic examination were made to ensure all subjects have an 
assessment every 15 -16 weeks throughout the study.  Reference to visual acuity was specifically 
requested by [CONTACT_635667] n. 
Section 5.1:  
Table 5  footnote 24,  
Table 7 footnote 23, 
Table 8  footnote 23, 
Table 9 footnote 23,

Section 8.2.2   In Section 8.2.2 (first sentence of paragraph 3), and in footnotes for 
Tables  5, 7, 8, 9, 11 (Phases 1a and 1b) pertaining to ophthalmological 
examinations (first sentence), revised the text as follows:  
Ophthalmological examinations (such as eyesight/ visual acuity , 
fundoscopy, slit lamp microscopy, and optical coherence tomography [or 
equivalent diagnostic test]) …  
 In Section 8.2.2, revised last sentence of paragraph 3 as follows:  
Subjects dosed on a Q2W schedule will then undergo ophthalmologic 
examinations by [CONTACT_635668] 1 Day 15 
(± 7 days) (Phase 1 A Part 1 only), Cycle 3 Day 1 (± 7 days), and 
thereafter every 4 cycles/16 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment. 
Subjects dosed on a Q3W schedule will undergo an ophthalmologic 
examination by [CONTACT_635669] 9 
(± 7 days), and thereafter every 5 cycles/15 weeks (± 7 days) during 
study treatment.  Patients Subjects in all groups  will undergo repeat 
assessments by [CONTACT_635670] 15 weeks 
(± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment <[ADDRESS_849232]’s next visit and then 
approximately either every 4 cycles/16 weeks (± 7 days) for subjects 
dosed on a Q2W schedu le or every 5 cycles/15 weeks (± 7 days) for 
subjects dosed on a Q3W schedule, according to the schedule from 
first dose (Cycle 1 Day 1).  
 In Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, 1 1, footnotes  pertaining to schedule of 
ophthalmological examinations ( second sentence), revised  sentences in 
accordance with the edits made to Section 8.2.2, above.  
Change: Revised the window for the Safety Follow -up visit from 30 ± 7 days to 30 ± 3 days.     
Reason:  To increase clarity and consistency throughout the protocol.   
Section 5.1  
Table s 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 
(including footnote 2 
in each table)   In each table, in the header column “Safety Follow -up”, the “Days” box 
was changed as follows: “30 ± [ADDRESS_849233] dose”.   
 Table 2 footnote in each table was similarly revised to state:  “2.  The 
mandatory Safety Follow -Up visit should be conducted 30 days (± 73 days) 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849234]. ” 
Section 10.5  Changed the first sentence as follows: Subjects will be assessed  for AEs and 
SAEs beginning immediately after signing the informed consent form and 
continuing through to follow up which is 30 ±  [ADDRESS_849235] dose of 
investigational drug.   
Change:  For subjects who have confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease 
after 2 years and want to take a break in treatment without discontinuing, the frequency of 
assessments and procedures was changed from once every cycle to once every 1 2 weeks.  
Reason: To reduce the number of subject visits while on break, aligning the timing of assessments 
and procedures with the schedule for radiographic imaging.  
Section [IP_ADDRESS]   Modified last bullet point as follows:  
If subjects have confirmed CR, PR, or SD after [ADDRESS_849236] agrees. . . The study 
assessment and procedures schedule will remain the same.  In such a 
case, the study assessments and procedures will be  performed every 
12 weeks (in conjunction with repeat radiographic imaging, as 
described in Sectio n 8.5) rather than every cycle.  If a subject has 
evidence of PD within [ADDRESS_849237].  
Change: Clarified that during Survival Follow -up phase, in addition to survival data, 
immune -related AEs ( irAE s) will be collected through [ADDRESS_849238]  at 90 days  rather than via office visit unless  a 
suspected irAE is reported.   
Reason: The AE follow -up period for irAEs is [ADDRESS_849239] 
the discrepanc ies. 
Section 5.1:  
Tables 5, 7, 8, 9, 11 
(footnote 7 in each 
table) , 
Section 8.4,  
Section 10.5   Clarified the following sentence as follows:  
Telephone contact s with patients should be conducted to assess irAEs 
[ADDRESS_849240], the 
investigator should arrange an unscheduled visit if further 
assessment is indicated.  
Section 8.4  Corrected the last paragraph as follows:  
Following completion of the treatment and safety follow -up periods, all 
subjects will be  followed for survival status. Subjects will have their 
survival status assessed approximately every 3 months ± [ADDRESS_849241] -treatment  (as described  above ), no other data 
(eg subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], performance status etc.) beyond survival will 
be collected during these calls/visits.

 Methodology:  
This is a two -stage study consisting of a Phase 1A dose escalation and dose -finding component to establish 
the MTD , if any,  and RP2D(s), followed by a Phase 1B componen t to investigate efficacy in select tumor 
types and  to further evaluate safety and tolerability of tislelizumab  at RP2D(s) .. Archival tumor tissue will be 
collected for purpose of biomarker analysis, although a fresh tumor biopsy at baseline is strongly 
recommended. In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh biopsy of a tumor lesion is required at 
baseline; for these subjects, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after two cycles of treatment is 
strongly recommended. Optional biopsy will also be  taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who 
have confirmed disease progression during the study from accessible tumor sites to obtain samples to explore 
resistance mechanism. If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally taken from the same tumor lesion 
as the baseline biopsy. Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies.  
Mandatory biopsy at baseline and on treatment  are required for some tumor types in the Phase 1B study . 
Subjects will be monitored for safety,  anti-tislelizumab  antibodies and efficacy throughout  the study. 
Radiological assessment of tumor response status should be performed approximately  every [ADDRESS_849243] year, then every 12 weeks thereafter.  
 Phase 1A, Part [ADDRESS_849244] -in-human 
study. Four dose levels are planned: 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg, Q2W (once every two weeks) . The study 
will follow a modified 3+[ADDRESS_849245] three (3) subjects will be enrolled into each 
cohort. Additional subject(s), up to a maximum of six (6) subjects in total, will be enrolled if more than 
three (3) have been screened and are eligible for the cohort.  The dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment  
will be conducted in the first cycle consisting of 28 days. Dose escalation will continue until identification of 
MTD or 10 mg/kg in the event that a MTD is not identified due to pauc ity of DLTs. Two (2) or more DLT in 
a cohort of three (3) to six (6) subjects is considered to have exceeded MTD.  
Continuous safety evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_1034] , the Coordinating Investigator , and 
Investigators . A Safety Monitoring Committee  (SMC) will be established for the determination of dose levels 
to be administered and dose regimen during dose escalation based on the data available from the previous 
dose levels.  
The SMC may decide to evaluate an intermediate, not pre -defined and not pr eviously -studied dose, if 
evaluation of toxicity at such a dose is desired. If this approach is taken, up to 6 new subjects should be 
enrolled at the new intermediate dose.  
 Phase 1A, Part 2  
The Phase 1A, Part 2  component  will evaluate the safety and PK of two dosing schedules Q2W versus Q3W  
(once every three weeks)  at selected doses that have cleared the DLT period without exceeding  MTD ( eg, 2 
mg/kg  or 5 mg/kg, up to 10 mg/kg). Ten to 20  subjects per dose schedule will be enrolled  to evaluate the 
safety , the PK and preliminary efficacy. Tumor types to be enrolled include  but are not limited to  colorectal 
cancer ( CRC ), non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ), renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ), bladder cancer, melanoma 
and ovarian cancer . Other cancers that are deemed to be likely to benefit from programmed cell death -1 
(PD-1) inhibition based on high mutational load, preclinical or clinical data from other studies may be 
considered for enrollment subject to discussion with the medical monit or. Q2W and Q3W schedule  cohorts 
for each dose may be evaluated sequentially  or in parallel . 
To adequately monitor safety of subjects enrolled in dosing schedule  expansion,  when at least [ADDRESS_849246] 
been treated at a specific dose and schedule and  ≥33% of the subjects experienced a DLT during the first [ADDRESS_849247] tumor types.  
 Phase 1A, Part 3 
The Phase 1A, Part 3 component will evaluate the safety and PK of tislelizumab  at flat doses  (ie 200 mg , 
Q3W)  that do not  exceed the exposure of the MTD  as determined in the Phase 1A, Part 1 study .  
Approximately 10 to 20 subjects will be enrolled. Tumors types to be enrolled include but not limited to 
NSCLC, RCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) , bladder cancer, melanoma , gastric, 
oesophageal, Merkel -cell carcinoma and HCC . Other cancers that are deemed to be likely to benefit from 
PD-[ADDRESS_849248] been treated and ≥33% of the subjects experienced a DLT during the first cycle consisting of 
[ADDRESS_849249] cycle  of treatment, or withdrew due to any reason (progressive disease  [PD] , adverse event  [AE], or 
death) . 
This part of the Phase 1A study will be conducted  in Australia and/or New Zealand sites only and may be 
conducted in parallel with a Phase 1B study that evaluates a RP2D  selected based on the P hase IA, Part 1 and 
2 data  as described in Section 2.5.4 . 
 Phase 1B  
The Phase 1B stage  is a multicenter, open -label, multiple -dose, multiple -arm, indication  expansion study. 
The various arms of the study will investigate RP2D(s)  to examine the potential efficacy as well as safety  and 
tolerability of tislelizumab  in cancer  patients who failed standard care therap ies. The cancer  indications may 
include:  
Arm 1. Subjects with NSCLC (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 2. Subject s with ovarian cancer (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 3. Subject s with gastric cancer (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 4. Subject s with HCC  (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 5. Subject s with HNSCC (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 6. Subject s with esophageal carcinoma (approximately 50 subjects)  
Arm 7. Subject s with triple n egative breast cancer ( TNBC ) (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 8. Subject s with cholangiocarcinoma (approximately 20 subjects)  
Arm 9. Subject s with RCC, bladder cancer , melanoma , Merkel -cell carcinoma, sarcoma,  
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  (cuSCC) . Or any other 
solid tumors  with  microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) , such 
as CRC or pancreatic cancer  (approximately 50 subjects)

accrual will be held pending data review by [CONTACT_4484].  
Tumor response will be assessed by [CONTACT_10670] s based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version  (v) 1.1.  
For immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_635632] , pseudo -progression may occur due to immune cell infiltration 
and other mechanisms as manifested by [CONTACT_635672]  (Wolchok et al, 2009 ). Thus for PD suspected by [CONTACT_635673] -progression, 
treatment may continue until confirmation of   PD with repeat imagin g at least [ADDRESS_849252] be met in order to continue the treatment  
after initial PD :  
a. Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including w orsening laboratory values).  
b. Stable Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status.  
c. Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites ( eg cord 
compression) that necessitates urgent alternative medical intervention.   
Planned number of subjects:  Phase 1A stage: Approximately 120 subjects  for the dose escalation , 
dosing schedule  expansion  and flat dos e exploration . 
Phase 1B stage: Approximately 330 subjects  for indication expansion .

Criteria for evaluation:  
Primary Endpoints : 
The primary endpoint of the Phase 1A stage is the following:  
 Tislelizumab  safety and tolerability: The safety of tislelizumab  will be assessed throughout the study by 
[CONTACT_635679] 
(NCI-CTCAE ) Version 4.03, physical examination , ophthalmologic examination , electrocardiograms, 
labor atory measurements  and severity of  AEs. 
The primary endpoint of the Phase 1B stage is the following:  
 ORR: (complete response [ CR] + partial response [ PR]) based on  RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_849271] 
tumor types  as evaluated  by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator s. 
Secondary Endpoints : 
The secondary endpoints of the Phase 1A stage of the study are the following:  
 Pharmacokinetic evaluations : include but not limited to area under the plasma concentration -time curve 
from Day 0 to Day 14 (AUC 0-14 day), maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax), time to maxi mum 
observed plasma concentration ( Tmax), minimum observed plasma concentration ( Ctrough ), half-life (T ½), 
clearance ( Cl), and volume of distribution ( Vd). 
 The MTD , if any,  and RP2D  (s) for tislelizumab  will be determined based on safety , tolerability, PK, 
preliminary  efficacy, and other available  data. 
 Efficacy evaluations: ORR  (CR+PR ), CR  rate, PR rate, stable disease (SD) rate, progression -free 
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) , and duration of re sponse  (DOR)  will be determined based on 
RECIST v 1.1 and the results of Investigator evaluations.  
 Anti-tislelizumab  antibody: immunogenic responses to tislelizumab  will be assessed to determine 
incidence of anti -drug antibody  (ADA) .  
The secondary endpoints of the Phase 1B stage of the study are the following:  
 PFS; disease control rate (DCR: CR + PR + SD); and clinical benefit rate (CBR: CR or PR or durable 
SD [SD ≥24 weeks]).  
 Safety and tolerability assessment of AEs, serious adverse events ( SAEs ), physical examination , 
ophthalmologic  examination , vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECG s), and laboratory measurements.  
 Plasma concentrations of tislelizumab  at selected time points.  
Exploratory Endpoints  for Phase 1A, and Phase 1B:

 All subjects who are expose d to (or started receiving) tislelizumab  will be included in the safety analysis set 
(SAF).  All subjects for whom valid tislelizumab  PK parameters can be estimated will be incl uded in the PK 
Population on an as -treated basis.  
Sample size  
In Phase 1A, the number of dose levels and schedules examined and the emerging tislelizumab  toxicities will 
determine the sample size.  It is anticipated that approximately 24 subjects will be required to establish the 
RP2D(s)  of tislelizumab  when administered as a single agent.  In addition, 10  to 20  subjects will be enrolled 
in each of the schedule expansion and flat dose cohort at one or more dose level (up to 10 mg/kg Q2W  or 
Q3W  in schedule expansion cohort; 200 mg Q3W in flat dose cohort ) not exceeding MTD to further evaluate 
safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of tislelizumab . 
In Phase 1B, approximately 2 0 to 50 subjects for each arm (except A rm 9) will be evaluated to examine the 
potential efficacy as well as safety  and tolerability of tislelizumab  in select tumor types.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background and Pharmacology  
Immune check point -inhibitory receptor, programmed cell death -1 (PD -1) is mainly 
expressed in activated T -cells including cluster of differentiation ( CD) 8+ cytotoxic 
T-lymphocytes and CD4+ T -helper lymphocytes  (McDermott and Atkins, 2013 ).  It is 
believed that PD -1 plays an important role in immune modulation of tumor progression by 
[CONTACT_635681] T -cells when engaged by [CONTACT_344752].  The PD -1 
signaling cascade negatively regulates T -cell receptor (TCR) and att enuate T -cell 
proliferation and functional activities, leading to T -cell exhaustion.  PD-1 expression is 
markedly up -regulated in tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes  (TILs) , while the expression of 
programmed death -ligand  1, (PD-L1) is significantly increased i n tumor cells and tumor -
associated immune cells in the presence of stimulating cytokines such as interferon -gamma 
(IFN-and interferon -alpha ( IFN- in the tumor  microenvironment  (Riley, 2009 ).  
Furthermore, the increased PD -1 expression in TILs  and/or PD -L1 expression in tumor and 
tumor -associated stromal cells is observed in many types of solid human tumors including, 
but not limited to, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), uveal melanoma, non-small 
cell lung cancer (NS CLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), triple -
negative breast cancer (TNBC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, and ovarian 
cancer  (Ghebeh et al, 2006 ; Hamanishi et al,  2007 ; Konishi et al, 2004 ; Thompson et al, 
2007 ; Thompson et al, 2004 ; Tsushima et al, 2006 ; Jie et al, 2013 ; Hino et al, 2010 ).  This 
evidence  provided the basis for cancer immunotherapeutic intervention via the approach of 
antagonizing PD -1.  
Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant efficacy  for anti-PD-1 mo noclonal 
antibodies  such as  nivolumab and pembrolizumab  in advanced  melanoma, NSCLC and RCC .  
These antibodies were well tolerated without demonstrating dose -limiting toxicities (DLT) 
when patients were dosed up to 10 mg/kg intravenously , once every two weeks (Q2W) or 
once every three weeks (Q3W).   The first -in-human (FIH)  phase 1 trial o n nivolumab (a fully 
human anti –PD-1 immunoglobulin G [ IgG] 4 antibody) evaluated its safety profile at 
increasing doses of 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg given intravenously Q2W  in 39 patients with 
advanced melanoma, colorectal cancer ( CRC ), castration -resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), 
NSCLC, or RCC  (Brahmer et al, 2010 ; Topalian et al, 2012 ).  The FIH Phase 1 study  on 
pembrolizumab (a humanized anti –PD-1 IgG4 antibody) evaluated its safety at 1 to 10 mg/kg 
given intravenously at 4 week interval followed by [CONTACT_13452] -weekly d oses in cohorts of three to 
six patients with various advanced solid tumors  (Hamid et al, 2013 ).  The most common  
adverse events ( AEs) were Grade 1/2, including arthralgia, cough, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, 
nausea, pruritus, and rash.  However, Grade 3/4 treatment -related AEs occurred in 15% of 
patients and there were three deaths  in the nivolumab study, all attributed to pulmonary 
toxicity.  Grade 3/4 AEs were also reported in the pembrolizumab studies and one patient

 died of myocardial infarction while being treated for pneumonitis/pneumonia.   Drug -related 
AEs of special in terest (AEs with potentially immune -related etiology) included vitiligo, 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, thyroiditis, and hypophysitis.  
Based on the overwhelming positive  results that pembrolizumab and nivolumab 
demonstrat ed in their pi[INVESTIGATOR_36491], the [LOCATION_002] ( US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) approved th ese two drugs for  the treatment of metastatic melanoma in 2nd or 3rd line. 
In the nivolumab p ivotal study, the cohort of 120  patients treated at 3 mg/kg  Q2W  exhibited 
an objective  response rate (ORR)  of 32% with 4 complete responses (CRs) and  34 partial 
responses (PRs).  Thirteen patients ha d object ive responses lasting  6 months or longer ( FDA 
News Release, Dec. 2, 2014 ). In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_635636], 173 patients were  
treated with pembrolizumab at either 2 or 10  mg/kg dose, approximately 24% patients 
demonstrated  tumor shrink age (2 mg/kg regimen ; FDA News Release, Sept. 4, 2014 ). 
Interestingly, melanoma patients who became resistant to  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_635637].  The ORRs of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645] -naïve and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_445645] -resistant are 
40% and 28%, respectively .  
Anti-PD-1 antibody treatment not only generated  higher response rate, but also prolonged  
overall survival (OS).  In a cohort of 107 patients treated with nivolumab, 1 and 2 years OSs 
were 63% and 48% , respectively , with median OS at 17.3 months. Similarly  in a cohort of 
411 patients treated with pembrolizumab, 1 year OS was 69% and 18 month OS was 62% , 
respectively  (Weber et al, 2014 ). 
In addition  to melanoma, anti -PD-[ADDRESS_849282] or 4th line, one year or two year survival rate were  42% and 
24%, respectively,  with median OS of 9.9 months.  Retrospective analysis indicated both 
patients with K -Ras and EGFR mutations responded to the immunotherapy ( BMS  Press 
Release, 2013). 
Recent exploratory studies suggested that c ombinatory immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_437876] -PD-1 
antibody may provide more benefits to cancer patients. In one study in patients with 
metastatic melanoma, nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_635638]  80%. Patients with wild type or mutant BRAF, with 
or without  PD-L1 expression , all responded well to the  combination treatment  (Sznol et al , 
2014 ; Wolcho k et al, 2013 ).  Of note , the immune -related AEs (irAEs) also increased 
significantly  in the combination treatment .  
Tislelizumab (also known as BGB -A317 ) is a humanized IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody 
against PD-1. It is being developed for the treatment of human malignancies. Tislelizumab  
was manufactured under Good Manufacture Practice ( GMP ) quality control systems.  The 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849283] is formulated in an aqueous buffer with pH  6.5 and isotonic 
osmolality.  The suggested administration route is intravenous ( IV) infusion after the 
appropriate dilution in 0 .9% sodium chloride solution.  
Tislelizumab  binds to the extracellular domain of human PD -1 with high specificity and 
affinity ( dissociation constant = 0.15 nM) as demonstrated by [CONTACT_635682] .  It competitively blocks the binding of both PD -L1 and 
programmed death -ligand 2 ( PD-L2), inhibiting PD -1 mediated negative signaling in T -cells.  
In in vitro  cell-based assays, the humanized antibody consistently and dose -dependently 
enhanced the functional activity of human T -cells and pre -activated, primary peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells  (PBMCs) .  In addition, tislelizumab  demonstrated anti -tumor activity in 
several human cancer allogeneic xenograft models, including A431 human epi[INVESTIGATOR_635639], BCCO -028 colon cancer, and BCLU -054 NSCLC models, where the PBMCs 
were co -injected with the human cancer cells (A431) or the tumor fragments (BCCO -028 and 
BCLU -054) i nto the immunocompromised mice.  
The IgG4 variant antibody has very low binding affinity to fragment crystallizable region 
gamma receptor ( FcR) IIIA and complement 1q  by [CONTACT_397761], suggesting a low or no 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity  and complement -dependent cytotoxicity effect in 
humans.   Unlike natural IgG4 antibody, tislelizumab  has no observable fragment antigen -
binding -arm exchange activity by [CONTACT_635683], predicting the antibody would be stable 
in vivo , unlikely forming bispecific antibody.  
Tislelizumab  binds to the cynomolgus monkey and human PD -1 with similar affinity, but 
does not bind to mouse PD -1 due to the significant sequence divergence from human and 
monkey PD -1.  Therefore, cynomolgus monkeys were considered to be the relevant species 
for nonclinical safety evaluation.  
Refer to the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) for more detailed information on the background of 
tislelizumab .  
2.2 Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics  
A pharmacokinetic (PK) study of tislelizumab  was conducted i n monkeys at single doses of 
3, 10, or 30 mg/kg or at repeat dose of 10 mg/kg weekly for 5 doses via IV infusion.  The 
systemic exposure appeared to increase dose -proportionally without gender difference or 
accumulation.  After single dose administration o f 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, the half -life (T 1/2) 
ranged from 74 to 183 hours; maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax) ranged from 
90 to 999 g/mL, and  the a rea under the plasma concentration  time curve from 0 to 1008 
hours  (AUC 0-1008h) ranged from 12,322 to 163,755 h* g/mL; volume of distribution (V d) was 
low, ranged from 22 to 52 mL/kg.

Page 33 of 207 
 A PK bridging study for tislelizumab  manufactured by [CONTACT_635684].  was conducted in monkeys at a single dose of 10 mg/kg vi a IV infusion.  No 
marked differences on T 1/2, Cmax, AUC, V d, clearance ( Cl) and mean residence time  were 
noted between the two batches . 
The T 1/2 of tislelizumab  in monkeys supported once biweekly dosing in the repeat -dose 
toxicology study with adequate systemic exposure to support toxicology evaluation of 
tislelizumab .  Based on PK results in monkeys, the V d of tislelizumab  in humans is expected 
to be similar to that in monkeys.  The T 1/2 of tislelizumab  in humans is expected to be 10 -20 
days depending on the actual dose levels, which allows multiple -dose treatment of 
tislelizumab  for humans with a dosing interval of 14 or 21 days to provide the target systemic 
exposure at the projected therapeutic dose of 0.5 to 10 mg/kg without excessive drug 
accumulation.  
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the PK properties of tislelizumab . 
2.3 Toxicology  
The toxicity and safety profile of tislelizumab  was characterized in single dose toxicology 
studies in mice and monkeys and in a 13 -week repeat dose toxicology study in monkeys.  The 
tissue cross reactivity was evaluated in the normal frozen tissues from both humans and 
monkeys.  The cytokine release a ssays were also evaluated using  fresh  human whole blood  
cells.  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_635640] ( GLP ) 
regulations .  The single  dosing regimens were spanning from the intended human doses to 
10-fold higher than the maxi mum of the intended human doses, and the repeat dosing 
regimens spanning to 3 -fold higher than the maximum of the intended human doses.  
Cynomolgus monkey was  the only  relevant species based on the target sequence homology 
and binding activity.  
No apparen t toxicity was noted in both mice and monkeys fo llowing a single dose up to 
100 mg/kg and in monkeys following a repeat dose up to 30 mg/kg biweekly for 13 weeks.  
The toxicokinetics (TK) profile was characterized in monkey studies and the systemic 
exposur e appeared to be dose proportional without gender difference or accumulation over 
the dosing period.  No apparent immunotoxicity was observed as no apparent changes in 
clinical pathology or histopathology were noted in these studies.   The immunogenicity wi th 
positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) against tislelizumab  was noted in the single dose monkey 
study with one of two monkeys in each of three dose groups and in the repeat dose study with 
8/12, 6/12, and 5/12 of animals at doses of 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, resp ectively.  The ADA 
against tislelizumab  was demonstrated to have neutralization function in a cell based assay  
and it appeared to have some impact on the systemic expos ure over the dosing period at 
3 mg/kg, but little at 10 and 30 mg/kg .

 The tissue cross reactivity of tislelizumab  was evaluated in normal human and cynomolgus 
monkey frozen tissues using immunohistochemistry (IHC) method, with appropriate positive 
and negative controls.  Under the study condition, no specific tissue cross re activity with 
tislelizumab  was noted in both human and cynomolgus monkey tissues.  Neither hemolytic 
effects induced by [CONTACT_635685].  
Overall, no apparent toxicity was noted in mice and monkey toxicity studies .  No tissue cross 
reactivity was found in both human and monkey tissues, nor effect on cytokine release was 
observed in human whole blood  assay.  The TK profile was well characterized with dose 
proportionally increases in systemic exposure without apparent accumulation or sex 
difference.  Immunogenicity was observed without apparent immunotoxicity  and effect on 
the systemic exposure.  The No Observed Adverse Effect Level ( NOAEL ) of tislelizumab  in 
13-week monkey toxicity study was considered to be 30 mg/kg .  The safety profile of 
tislelizumab  is considered adequate to support FIH dose safely and ethically.   
Refer to the IB for more detailed information on the toxicology of tislelizumab . 
2.[ADDRESS_849284] one dose of tislelizumab  in the 
Phase 1A part of the study , ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg  Q2W (n= 62) and from  2 
mg/kg to 5 mg/kg Q3W  (n=3 8).  During dose escalation,  the following dose levels: 0.5 mg/kg 
Q2W (n=3), 2 mg/kg Q2W (n=6), 5 mg/kg Q2W (n=6) , and 10 mg/kg Q2W (n=7)  were 
evaluated for safety and tolerability.  One DLT  (1/6)  of Grade 3 colitis was observed in the 5 
mg/kg Q2W.  Additional cohorts  of 2 mg/kg Q2W  (n=20) , 5 mg/kg Q2W  (n=20) , 2 mg/kg 
Q3W  (n=19)  and 5 mg/kg Q3W (n=19) were further evaluated as tolerated  in schedule 
expansion.      
Preliminary safety analysis showed that t he most common treatment -emergent adverse events  
(TEAEs) (≥10%) were fatigue ( 31%), diarrhoea ( 21%), nausea ( 20%), constipation (16%), 
abdominal pain ( 14%), pruritus (13%), rash ( 12%), decreased appetite ( 12%), back pain 
(12%)  and vomiting (10%) . Immune -mediated AEs were reported in 1 0 subjects including 
colitis (1 Grade  3, 2 Grade  2), diabetes mellitus (1 Grade  3, 1 Grade  2), alanine 
aminotransferase ( ALT ) increase (1  Grade  3), diarrhea (1 Grade  2), worsening liver functions 
(1 Grade  2), hypothyroidism (1  Grade  1) and onychoclasis (1 Grade  1).  As of March 29, 
2016, 9 drug-related serious adverse events (SAE)  were  reported  including 1 Grade  2 colitis 
in the 2 mg/kg Q2W dose escalation cohort (n=6), 1 Grade  3 colitis  in the 5 mg/kg Q2W dose 
escalation cohort  (n=6), 1  Grade  2 colitis and 1 Grade  2 infusion reaction in the 5 mg/kg 
Q2W schedule expansion cohort (n= 20), 1 Grade  3 diabetic ketoacidosis , 1 Grade  3 diabetes 
mellitus, 1 Grade  3 hypotension  and 1 Grade  2 diarrhoea  in the 2 mg/kg Q2W schedule

Grade  3 back pain and 1 Grade  3 fatigue in the 5 mg/kg Q2W schedule expansion cohort 
(n=20), and 1 Grade  3 fatigue and 1  Grade  3 hyperglycaemia in 5 mg/kg Q3W schedule 
expansio n cohort (n=19) .  
In addition,  as of May 5, 2016, [ADDRESS_849285] been treated with tislelizumab  in 
combination with BGB -290 (a PARP1/2 inhibitor) in the BGB -A317/BGB -290_Study_001 
combo study  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  One subject , who was treated with tislelizumab  at 2 mg/kg 
Q3W in combination of BGB -290 (a PARP1/2 inhibitor) at 20 mg BID, experienced a n 
immune -mediated  SAE of G rade 4 drug induced hepatopathy  that was attributed to 
tislelizumab  by [CONTACT_093] .  
Refer to the IB for more detailed information regarding the safety of tislelizumab . 
Clinical experience with existing drugs of the same therapeutic class ( anti-PD-1 monoclonal 
antibodies ) suggests the most common AEs were Grade  1/2, including arthralgia, cough, 
diarrhea, fatigue, fever, nausea, pruritus,  and rash.  However, Grade  3/4 treatment -related 
AEs occu rred in 15% of patients in the nivolumab study, and there were three deaths, all 
attributed to pulmonary toxicity  (Brahmer et al, 2010 , Topalian et al, 2012 ).  Grade  3/[ADDRESS_849286] died of myocardial 
infarction while being treated for pneumonitis/pneumonia  (Hamid et al, 20 13).  Drug -related 
AEs of special interest (AEs with potentially immune -related etiology) included vitiligo, 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis , thyroiditis, and hypophysitis  may be observed during multiple 
dose escalation in subjects with cancer.  
2.5 Study Ratio nale  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clini cal Practice (GCP) 
guidelines, t he Declaration of Helsinki and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of tislelizumab  as well as 
preliminary evidence of the anti -tumor activity of tislelizumab .  Through its dose escalation 
and safety, schedule and efficacy expansion components, it will determine the maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) and the recomm ended Phase 2  dose (RP2D) for tislelizumab . 
2.5.[ADDRESS_849287] equally well, but does not bind to mouse or rat PD -1.  
From conservative point of view, the NOAEL (100 mg/kg) observed in the single dose 
toxicity study in monkeys was not used for FIH dose estimation.  Therefore, the NOAEL was 
considered to be  30 mg/kg based on the 3 -month repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  The FIH dose could be estimated based on NOAEL divided by a safety factor 
(10 or larger ; FDA Guidance for Industry M3(R2) , Zou et al, 2012 ).  Based on this rule, the 
FIH dose for tislelizumab  could be selected as 3 mg/kg.  
Alternatively, the FIH dose for tislelizumab  may be estimated based on the minimum 
anticipated biological effect level (MABEL).  For tislelizumab , MABEL was determined to 
be around 0.5 mg/kg, through PK/pharmacodynamic  modeling of allogeneic tumor models, 
the monkey PK, and predicted human exposure.  Therefore, the FIH dose projected based on 
the MABEL should be 0.5 mg/kg.  
Predicted e fficacious doses in human  
MABEL of tislelizumab  as described above was predicted to be 0.5 mg/kg.   Therefore, the 
selected FIH dose at 0.5 mg/kg may have efficacy on human tumor growth inhibition.  
Furthermore, the best efficacious dose rang is predicted to  be in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg 
based on the PK/pharmacodynamic  modeling.  
2.5.2 Rationale for Evaluating Different  Dosing Schedules  in Phase 1A Part 2   
Preliminary  PK data of subjects in Phase 1A study indicate that the half -life of tislelizumab  is 
approximately 17 days and there is  moderate  drug accumulation in the blood when dosed at a 
Q2W schedule .  Thus a decision is made to investigate a less frequent dosing schedule  at 
Q3W.  The objective is to identify one or two safe, effective and conven ient dose regimen for  
the Phase 1 B study.   
2.5.3 Rationale for Evaluating Flat Dosing in Phase 1A Part 3  
Population PK analysis was conducted using 411 observed tislelizumab  serum concentrations 
from 31 patients who received doses of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg Q2W and 13 patients who 
received doses of 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg Q3W (Phase 1A Part 1 and Part  2).  As described in 
Section 2.5.[ADDRESS_849288] order elimination .  In the covariate analysis, patient body weight was not 
found to be a significan t covariate on the clearance of tislelizumab  (Figure 2-1), which 
supports the exploration of flat -dosing.

Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 37 of 207 
 Figure 2-1 Lack of Correlation between Clearance (C l) and Patient Body Weight  
Thus a decision is made  to explore flat dosing as part of the Phase 1A study, conducted in 
parallel with a Phase 1B study that evaluates the RP2D as described  in Section 2.5.4 .  The 
proposed flat dose of 200 mg Q3W ha s the dose intensity between 2 mg/kg Q 3W and 
10 mg/kg Q2W. Tislelizumab  is generally well tolerated between these doses.  
2.5.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  in Phase 1B   
After reviewing safety and PK data from Phase 1A Part 1 (dose escalation) and Phase 1A 
Part 2 (schedule expansion), the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) has recommend ed 
5 mg/kg  Q3W as the dose regimen to be taken into Phase 1B of the study, based on the 
following rationales:  
Safety   
As of March [ADDRESS_849289] one dose of tislelizumab  in the Phase 1A 
part of the study , ranging from 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg Q2W (n=62) and from  2 mg/kg to 
5 mg/kg Q3W  (n=38).   Safety and to lerability including dose limiting toxicities, PK, and 
preliminary efficacy were evaluated.  
As describ ed in Section 2.4, all dose levels in the dose escalation part were well tolerated 
with only one reported DLT.  MTD was not reached and 10 mg/kg Q2W was considered the 
maximum administered dose  (MAD).  No appa rent relationship between  dose level and AEs 
was established . 
Drug -related AE from  2 mg/kg Q2W to 10 mg/kg Q2W were similar  (Table 1 and Table 2). 
AE profiles from Q3W regimen between 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg based on data reported from  
the first 2 cycles slightly favor 2 mg/kg, although with short treatment duration.   

BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 38 of 207 
 Tislelizumab  is generally well tolerated between these doses with slightly fewer  AEs from 
the Q3W regimen.  
Efficacy  
Clinical response (PR or better) was observed in patients who  received 0.5 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 
5 mg/kg Q2W, and 2 mg/kg Q3W cohorts ( Table 3).  The majority of responses  came from 
5 mg/kg coho rts.  The proposed Phase 1B dose of 5 mg/kg Q3W has a dose intensity between 
2 mg/kg Q3W and 5 mg/kg Q2W.  Further investigation of 5 mg/kg Q3W is warranted.

Population Pharmacokinetics  
Population PK analysis was conducted using 411 observed tislelizumab  serum concentrations 
from 31 patients who received doses of 0.5, 2.0, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg Q2W and 13 patients who 
received doses of 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg Q3W (Phase 1A Part 1 and Part 2).  PK from 
tislelizumab  is linear and was characterized with a [ADDRESS_849292] order 
elimination.  Systemic clearance of A317 was 0.[ZIP_CODE] L/h, volume of distribution in the 
central and peripheral compartment are 2.79 and 1.44 L, respectively, and  terminal 
elimination half -life is 16 days.  
In conclusion, tislelizumab  regimen of 5 mg/kg Q3W was well -tolerated with promising 
clinical activity from a limited number of patients in the Phase 1A trial.   Further testing of 
this regimen is warranted in Pha se 1B.

signif icantly higher  antitumor activities  than nivolumab and pembrolizumab in mouse 
model s carrying allogenic human cancer cells and PBMCs (see Figure 2-2).  Therefore, we

in certain insensitive  cancer types .

BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849294] shown various 
clinical efficacies , including melanoma, lung cancer, RCC, HNSCC, hepatocellular 
carcinoma ( HCC ), bladder, gastric, ovarian and breast cancer.   The ORRs  for nivolumab and 
pembrolizumab in these tumors range from 15 to 35%  with durable response shown  in most 
cases .  Tislelizumab  is expected to be equal or more efficacious  in some indica tions such as 
HCC, ovarian, gastric , TNBC , bladder cancer and NSCLC. It is also hypothesized that 
tislelizumab  may show better therapeutic potential when used in combination with certain 
cancer therapeutic agents.  The hypothesis that  tislelizumab  may pose  differential activities 
from  nivolumab and pembrolizumab is based on our studies on tumor microenvironment and 
other  factors driving tumorigenesis and progression  in different cancer types .  
Based on the discussion above, the 9 expansion arms may be  class ified into the following 
categories : 
1. Indications where  nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown variable efficacy with 
ORR ranging from 10+ to 20+%, but tislelizumab  is expected to be more active , such 
as NSCLC, HCC, ovarian  cancer , gastric  cancer , esophageal  cancer  and TNBC , 
which are covered  in the expansion arms 1-8. 
2. Indications in which nivolumab and pembrolizumab have shown very good efficacy 
and tislelizumab  is anticipated to be equally or more active , such as melanoma, RCC 
and bladder cancer, which are covered in the expansion Arm 9.  A recent study 
indicated that a small portion (15%) of CRC patients with mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR)  responded well to pembrolizumab  (Le et al, 2015 ).  Tislelizumab  is

4.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoint of the Phase  1A stage is the following:  
 Tislelizumab  safety and tolerability: The safety of tislelizumab  will be assessed 
throughout the study by [CONTACT_635687]  (NCI-CTCAE version [v] 4.03 2010 ), physical 
examination , ophthalmologic  examination , electrocardiograms, laboratory measurements 
and severity of AEs 
Given the mechanism of action by [CONTACT_635688], 
particular attention should be given to irAEs, which include pruritus, vitiligo, pruritic rash, 
macular rash, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and other skin disorders; hypo - and hyperthyr oidism, 
hypophysitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, nephritis, allergic rhinitis, diarrhea, abdominal pain, 
fatigue, hypersensitivity and any other irAEs  (see Section  7.3.4 ).  Appropriate investigations 
should be undertaken to exclude toxic, metabolic, infectious, neoplastic or other non -drug-
related etiologic causes of such events.  
The primary endpoint of the Phase 1 B stage is the following:  
 ORR  (CR + PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v 1.[ADDRESS_849295] tumor types  as evaluated  by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator s 
Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 ( PCWG2 ) criteria  (Scher et a l, 2008 ) may 
also be used to evaluate responses in patients with prostate cancer enrolled on the study as 
describe d in Appendix  9. 
The Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup ( GCIG ) criteria  (Rustin et al,  2011 ) in addition  to 
RECIST  v 1.1 may also be used to evaluate response in patients with ovarian cancer  enrolled 
on the study . 
Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO) criteria  (Wen et al, 2010 ) may also be 
used to evaluate  response in patients with glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) enrolled on the 
study.  
4.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The se condary endpoints of the Phase 1 A stage of the study are the following:  
 Pharmacokinetic evaluations: include but not limited to AUC from Day 0 to Day 14 
(AUC 0-14 day), Cmax, time to maxi mum concentration ( Tmax), minimum observed

 plasma concentration ( Ctrough), T½, clearance ( Cl), and V d.  The MTD , if any,  and 
RP2D  (s) for tislelizumab  will be determined based on safety , tolerability, PK, 
preliminary  efficacy, and other available  data. 
 Efficacy evaluations: ORR  (CR+PR ), CR rate, PR rate, stable disease ( SD) rate, 
progression -free survival ( PFS), OS and duration of response  (DOR ) will be determined 
based on RECIST  v 1.1 and the results of Investigator  evaluations  
 Anti-tislelizumab  antibody: Immunogenic responses to tislelizumab  will be assessed to 
determine incidence of ADA  
The secondary endpoints of  the Phase 1 B stage of the study are the following:  
 PFS as described above; disease control rate (DCR: C R + PR + SD); and clinical benefit 
rate (CBR: CR or PR or durable SD [SD ≥24 weeks] ) 
 Safety and tolerability assessment of AEs, SAEs, physical examination , ophthalmologic  
examination , vital signs, E CG, and laboratory measurements

5.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1  Summary of Study Design  
This is a two -stage study consisting of a Phase 1A dose escalation and dose -finding 
component to establish the MTD, if any, and RP2D(s), followed by a Phase 1B component to 

BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849296] tumor types and to further evaluate safety and tolerability of 
tislelizumab  at RP2D(s).   
Archival tumor tissue will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis, although a fresh 
tumor biopsy at baseline is st rongly recommended.  In the absence of archival tumor tissues, 
a fresh biopsy of a tumor lesion is required at baseline; for these subjects, an optional biopsy 
for biomarker analysis after two cycles of treatment is strongly recommended.  Optional 
biopsy w ill also be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed 
disease progression during the study from accessible tumor sites to obtain samples to explore 
resistance mechanism.  If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally tak en from the 
same tumor lesion as the baseline biopsy.  Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor 
biopsies.  
Mandatory biopsies  at baseline and on treatment are required for some tumor types in the 
Phase 1B study.    
Subjects will be monitored for safety, anti -tislelizumab  antibodies and efficacy throughout 
the study.  Radiological assessment of tumor response status should be performed 
approximately every [ADDRESS_849297] year, 
then every 12  weeks thereafter.  
A flow chart of the study design is presented in  Appendix  7. 
5.1.1 Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
All toxicities or AEs will be graded according to the  NCI-CTCAE Version 4.0 .  The 
occurrence of a ny of the following toxicities during Cycle 1 will be considered a  DLT, if 
judged by [CONTACT_110515], probably or definitely related to study  drug 
administration:  
Non-hematologic:  
1. Grade 5 adverse events  
2. Grade 4 toxicity  
3. Grade 3 toxicities irrespective of duration, with the exception of laboratory abnormalities, 
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, and asymptomatic biochemical abnormalities that 
improve to Grade 2 or lesser severity within 3 days of institution of supportive care  
4. Grade 3 tumor fla re (defined as local pain, irritation, or rash  localized at sites of known or 
suspected tumor ) of > 7 day duration  
5. Immune -related adverse events (irAE) of Grade 3 or greater severity

6. Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities irrespective of duration  
 
7. Grade 2 ophthalmologic toxicities  
 
Hematologic:  
1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days  
2. Febrile neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000/mm3 with a 
single temperature of 38.3oC or a sustained temperature of 38oC for >1 hour)  
3. Grade 3 neutropenic in fection  
4. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
5. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia  
6. Grade 4 (life threatening) anemia  
Any grade toxicity which in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor requires removal of 
the subject from the study.  
Subjects who received <90% of the tislelizumab  infusion in Cycle 1 (eg, because the infusion 
had to be discontinued due to an infusion reaction) and did not experience a DLT will not be 
taken into account in the assessment of the overall DLT rate for the particular dose level 
cohort an d will need to be replaced.  
Resumption of tislelizumab  administration for subjects experiencing DLTs may be permitted  
according to the criteria described in Section 5.1.2 , if clinically appropriate, contingent on the 
return of the DLT to ≤ Grade 0-1 severity and interruption or delay of treatment for no more 
than 6 weeks (12 weeks for Phase 1A Part 3 and Phase 1B).  
5.1.[ADDRESS_849298] be adjusted if body weight changes reach 10% or greater (increase or 
decrease) .  
In the case that an infusion cannot be administere d at a scheduled visit, the instruction below 
should be followed.   If the delay is between [ADDRESS_849299] should be dosed as soon as possible and  procedures at the 
original scheduled visit shoul d be performed.  If the delay is more than 7 (for Q2W) or 10  
(for Q3W)  days, the delayed dose should be skipped  and considered a missed dose, the 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849300]  will be dosed at Day 1 of the next scheduled cycle.  In both cases, subsequent visits 
will follow ever y 2 weeks (Q2W schedule) or Q3W schedule  according to the original 
schedules .  Subjects with infusion delays > 6 weeks  from planned dosing date for reason(s) 
other than treatment -related toxicity should normally discontinue treatment and enter the 
Follow -up Period with the exception of delays related to prophylactic vaccinations or after 
specific consultation and agreement between the Investigator and Sponsor medical monitor 
in settings where benefit/risk may justify continued study therapy (eg, subject der iving 
clinical benefit who requires prolonged steroid taper for management of non -DLT irAEs).  
Tislelizumab  will be withheld for any of the following treatment -related adverse 
reactions : 
1. Grade 2 pneumonitis  
2. Grade 2 or 3 colitis /diarrhea  
3. Grade 3-4 hypophysit is 
4. Grade 2 -3 nephritis  
5. Grade 3 -4 thyroid disorders  
6. Grade 2 -3 ALT or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) elevations  
7. Grade 2 neurological toxicity  
8. Grade 3 skin reactions  
9. Grade 3 -4 diabetes/hyperglycemia  
10. Grade 3 ocular toxicity  
11. Grade 3 pancreatitis  
12. Grade 3 arthritis  
13. Grade 3 mucositis/stomatitis

 Refer to Section 7.3 and Appendix  10 for more detailed information regarding dose 
modification and management of irAEs.  
In Phase 1A Part 1 and 2, tislelizumab  dosing can be resumed for subjects whose adverse 
reactions recover to Grade 0 -1 within 6 weeks.  The dosing interval in subsequent cycles may 
be increased  by 1 week (eg, to 3 weeks in subjects who were on Q2W schedule, and to 
4 weeks in subjects who were on Q3W schedule) .  The visit and assessment schedule for 
subjects on 3 week  interval will follow  those designed for Q3W, and the visit and assessment 
schedule for subjects on 4 week  interval will follow those designed for Q2W, but maybe with 
reduced freque ncy for some of the assessments at the Investigator ’s discretion.   The dosing 
interval can only be prolonged once.   
In Phase 1A Part 3, tislelizumab  dosing can be resumed for subjects whose adverse reactions 
recover to Grade [ADDRESS_849301] occurrence of  a 
toxicity which would require dosing delay, study therapy will be discontinued  permanently  
after consultation with the Sponsor . 
Tislelizumab  will be permanently di scontinued for any of the following  after 
consultation with  the Sponsor :

levels to be administered and dose regimen during dose escalation, and will utilize the data 
available from the previous dose levels (see Section 8.3.1  for committee composition).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation and Dose Finding  
Evaluation of a cohort of at least three (3)  subjects completing one cyc le of treatment at that 
dose level and dose regimen without a DLT is required prior to determining the next dose 
level and dose regimen for the next cohort.   
The study will follow a modified 3+[ADDRESS_849309] three (3) subjects will 
be enrolled into each cohort.  Additional subject(s), up to a maximum of six (6) subjects in 
total, will be enrolled if more than three (3) have been screened and are eligible for the 
cohort.  Dose-escalation scheme will follow the rules stipulated  in the standard 3 + 3 dose 
escalation scheme .  For example, three (3) additional subjects will be enrolled if a DLT is 
observed in one (1) of three (3) subjects; additional two (2) subjects will be enrolled if a DLT 
is observed in one (1) of four (4) subj ects; and additional one (1) subject will be enrolled if a 
DLT is observed in one (1) of five (5) subjects.  No additional subjects are required if a DLT 
is observed in one (1) of six (6) subjects.  
If none (0) of the subjects in the cohort experience a DLT  by [CONTACT_42334]  1, escalation to 
the next dose will occur , as determined by [CONTACT_4484] . 
If one (1) out of six (6) subjects experience a DLT by [CONTACT_42334]  1, escalation to the 
next dose will occur , as determined by [CONTACT_4484].  
No additional subjects wi ll be treated at a given dose level if two (2) or more  of the subjects 
in a cohort develop a DLT in Cycle  1.  In this instance the MTD is considered to have been

 exceeded  and as noted above, the MTD will be considered to be the dose level below this 
level  or an intermediate  dose level that has been evaluated and has not exceeded the MTD . 
The SMC may decide to evaluate  an intermediate, not pre -defined and not  previously -studied 
dose or less frequent dosing schedule ( eg, Q3W ), if evaluation of toxicity at suc h a dose or 
schedule is desired.  If this  approach is taken, up to [ADDRESS_849310] s who received <90% of the tislelizumab  infusion in Cycle 1 ( eg, because the infusion 
had to be discontinued due to an infusion reaction) and did not experience a DLT will not be

Lab Manual. All trough samples should be drawn at the same time as bl ood collection for anti -tislelizumab  antibodies.  
16. Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_1696]. Include HCV antibody, HBsAg, HBcAb and HIV 1/2 antibodies. Su bjects who are 
HBsAg and HBcAb positive or HCV antibody positive at screening mus t not be enrolled until further definite testing with HBV DNA titers  and HCV 
RNA tests can conclusively rule out presence of active infection requiring therapy with Hepatitis B and C respectively.  Subjects enrolled in the study 
who had detectable HBV DNA o r HCV RNA at Screening should be tested for HBV or HCV viral load, respectively, every 4 cycles (± 7 days) 
throughout the study, eg Screening, Cycle 5, Cycle 9, and so on (and whenever clinically indicated). For subjects who already  received [ADDRESS_849371]’s next visit and every [ADDRESS_849372] dose (Cycle 1 Day 
1), and whenever clinically indicated. HCC subjects who test positive for HCV will not be disconti nued. HCC subjects who test positive for HBV 
should be treated as per local guidelines at the investigator’s discretion.  
17. Standard tumor markers ( eg, AFP for HCC  and CA 125 for ovarian cancer, as appropriate for a given tumor type) will be collected within [ADDRESS_849373] 12 months and approximately every 3 months thereafter, and at the 
mandatory Safety Follow -Up Visit. Analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_79428] w here feasible. If not feasible, tests will be  performed 
by a central laboratory.  
18. Tumor imaging (either CT or MRI, with preference for CT) will be performed within [ADDRESS_849374]  documentation of response (CR or PR) , imaging performed at the next regularly scheduled time point  will be used  for response 
confirmation. After patient ’s re-consenting, PD suspected as pseudo -progression needs to be confirmed  in a subsequent imaging at least [ADDRESS_849375]  withdraws  consent  from the trial. This imaging schedule will be maintained and will never be 
adjusted regardless of any intermediate unsche duled scans.  Subjects who withdraw from the study for clinical or symptomatic deterioration 
before objective documentation of PD will be requested to undergo appropriate imaging to confirm PD.  Every effort will be ma de to confirm a 
clinical diagnosis of PD by [CONTACT_9661]  (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
19. Bone scans must be done for subjects with mCRPC  as described in Section 8.2.4 . For other subjects, bone scans at baseline or subsequent visits 
will be performed only if clinically indicated.  
20. Collection of archival tumor tissue for purpose of biomarker analysis. Written patient consent is  required for collection of archival tumor tiss ue. Specific 
instructions for tissue collection and shipment are provided in the Lab Manual.  
21. Archival tumor tissue  will be collected for purpose of biomarker analysis , although a fresh baseline tumor biopsy (within 8 weeks before  starting 
treatme nt) is str ongly recommended . In the absence of archival tumor tissues, a fresh baseline biopsy of a tumor lesion is  mandatory; for these  subjects, 
an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after 2 cycles of treatment  (approximately C ycle 3 Day 1) is strongly recomme nded . Optional biopsy will also 
be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who have confirmed disease progression during the  study  from accessible tumor sites to obtain 
samples to explore resistance mechanism . If feasible, any follow up biopsy  should be ideally taken from the same tumor lesion as the baseline biopsy. 
Written patient consent is required for fresh tumor biopsies . Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessible  tumor lesions ( eg, skin; peripheral 
lymph nodes; lung, liver or  internal lymph node metastases which can be readily accessed using CT guidance). If performed, a core or excisional biopsy 
of the tumor (cytologic or fine -needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27808]) should be obtained that has proper size for histologic al examination and

22. Following completion of the treatment and Safety Follow -up phases of the study, every effort should be made to follow up all subjects for their survival 
status until  subject death or termination by [CONTACT_1034].  
23. Ophthalmological examinations (such as eyesight /visual acuity , fundoscopy , slit lamp microscopy , and optical coherence tomography  [or equivalent 
diagnostic test] ) will be performed within [ADDRESS_849376]  dose and at the end of week 9 (± 7 days ). Subjects will subsequently undergo repeat 
assessments by [CONTACT_635670] 5 cycles/ 15 weeks (± 7 days) during study treatment and a final assessment <[ADDRESS_849377] already received 3 or more doses of study drug, the tests should be repeated at the

emergency agents.  
Tislelizumab  will be diluted to a concentration  between 1 mg/mL to 10 mg/mL  up to 100 m L 
in sterile normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) as described below .  For the 0.5 mg/kg dose, 
deliver first infusion over 60 min; if well -tolerated, second and subsequent infusion s may be 
administered over 30 min . For 2 mg/kg dose and above, along with flat doses, deliver first 
infusion (Cycle 1 Day 1) over 60 min; if well -tolerated, second infusion  and each subsequent 
infusion may be administered over [ADDRESS_849435] the solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to preparation. 
The antibody drug solution is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorl ess to slightly yellow 
solution

 4. Aseptically w ithdraw the required volume from the vial(s) of tislelizumab  into a syringe, 
and t ransfer into an IV  bag (If multiple vials are needed for a  subject, it is important to 
use a separate sterile syringe and needle for each vial  to prevent problems such as dulling 
of needle tip, stopper coring, repeated friction of  plunger against syringe barrel wall and 
so on) .  Visually inspect used vial(s) and quarantine the vial (s) for investigation  if 
extraneous particulate matter other than translucent to white proteinaceous particles is 
observed.  
5. Please use the following example to guide study drug preparation.  The total dose to be 
administered will be diluted to a total volume of not more than  100 mL in sterile normal 
saline (0.9% sodium chloride).  In case where the total volume is more than 100 mL, no 
additional dilution is necessary.  
Prepare tislelizumab  solution for infusion per the example provided below:  
For 2 mg/kg dose and assume subject  body weight of 70 kg (other dose levels and body 
weights can be calculated similarly):  
Total drug to be administered:    2 mg/kg x 70 kg =140 mg  
Drug needed for dose preparation:   140 mg / 10 mg/mL = 14 mL  
0.9% sodium chloride needed for dilution:  50 mL – 14 mL = 36 mL 
Target final concentration:    140 mg / 50 mL =  2.8 mg/mL  
For flat dose  200 mg : 
Drug needed for dose preparation:   200 mg / 10 mg/mL = 20 mL 
0.9% sodium chloride needed for dilution:  50 mL – 20 mL = 3 0 mL 
Target final concentration:    200 mg / 50 mL = 4 mg/mL  
The detail  of drug preparation is presented for reference in Appendix [ADDRESS_849436] the final solution. If the infusion is not clear or the contents appear to

drugs, infectious disease, metabolic, toxin, disease progression or other neoplastic causes) 
with appropriate diagnostic tests, which may include but is not limited to serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data.  If alternative causes have b een ruled out; the AE 
required the use of systemic steroids, other immunosuppressants, or endocrine therapy and is 
consistent with an immune mediated mechanism of action, the irAE indicator in the eCRF 
AE page should be checked.  
A list of potential irAEs i s shown below in Table 13.  All conditions similar to those listed 
should be evaluated in patients receiving tislelizumab  to determine whether they are immune -
related.  
Recommendation for diagnostic evaluation and management of irAEs is based on a recent 
European Society for Medical Oncology ( ESMO ) guideline ( Haanen et al , 2017 ) and 
common immune -related toxicities are detailed in Appendix  10.  For any AEs not included in 
Appendix  10, please refer to the recent ESMO guideline ( Haanen et al, 2017 ) for further 
guidance on diagnostic evaluation and management of immune -related toxicities.

If a toxicity does not resolve to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_849455] or ALT values ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_849456]/ALT abnormalities at baseline, therapeutic interventions with a 
steroid treatment may be required with rising AST and ALT labora tory abnormalities.  The 
following algorithm is proposed for the use of steroid treatment:  
 If AST or ALT increases by ≥ 50% relative to baseline and lasts for at least 1 week, start 
oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day and taper over at least 2 -4 weeks; re -escalate dose if liver 
function tests (LFTs) worsen, depending on clinical judgment (manage as per 
Appendix  10).  Study treatment should be held until AST/ALT increase 
resolved/improved to baseline and prednisolone tapered to ≤ 10 mg.  
 If any ALT or AST increases meets Grade [ADDRESS_849457] or ALT improves to value 
≤ Grade  2.  Study drug may be reintroduced only after discussion with the Sponsor.  
 If any ALT or AST increases meets Grade [ADDRESS_849458] be obtained prior to screening assessments and

Clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis will be performed at the time 
points specified in  Table 5, Table 7, Table 8, and  Table 9 for Phase 1A and  Table 11 for 
Phase 1B respectively .  In the event of neutropenia (ANC <1000/mm3), thrombocytopenia

Grade 1 or Grade 2, unless these are not likely to improve due to the underlying disease.  
On routine urinalysis, if urine protein is ≥2+ by [CONTACT_5230], a 24 -hour urine sample for total 
protein and a random urine sample for total protein and creatinine will be obtained. Subjects 
should NOT be dosed until the result of 24 -hour urine protein  is confirmed.  If urine protein is 
>2 g/[ADDRESS_849464] administration will be interrupted until it returns to 
≤2 g/24 hours.  If urine protein is ≤2 g/24 hours, further clinical evaluation and/or more 
frequent testing may be performed as clinicall y indicated.  A random urine protein to 
creatinine ratio can serve as a reliable surrogate for the 24 -hour urine protein when following 
subjects with urine protein of ≤2 g, documented by a 24 -hour urine collection.  In such cases, 
the 24 -hour urine for tot al protein should be repeated only if a clinically significant increase 
is observed in the random urine protein to creatinine ratio.

 8.2.4 Computed Tomography  
A computed tomography ( CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis plus other relevant 
evaluations as appropriate, including bone scan for subjects with bone metastasis, will be 
performed to assess all known disease.  All known disease must be documented at baseline as 
target or no n-target lesions using RECIST  v 1.1.  The same method of assessment and the 
same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline 
and during follow -up.  The CT scan will be used for the evaluation of RECIST  v 1.[ADDRESS_849474] be used to maximize visualization 
of all lesions.  Five millimeter (mm) contiguous scans at baseline and subsequent scanning  
approximately every [ADDRESS_849475] 12 months and 
approximately every 12 weeks thereafter (as calculated by [CONTACT_635711]) until progression, with mandatory imaging coverage from 
thoracic inlet t o symphysis pubis should be performed.  Subjects who cannot tolerate 
enhanced CT due to increased risk of allergic reaction to iodinated contrast media  should 
follow local practice  to obtain diagnostic  quality images with an appropriate  imaging 
modality  and the same imaging modality should be utilized consistently . 
Technetium bone scans will be used to assess bone lesions.  In patients with prostate cancer 
baseline bone scans will be performe d during the screening window.  Repeat bone scans will 
be performed every 16 weeks (Q2W) or 18 weeks (Q3W) to keep with  the schedule of the 
CT scans.  Bone scan results will be reported as either no lesions or lesions present along 
with the number of bone lesions.  Disease progression by [CONTACT_635712]2  criteria as presented in Appendix  9; progression is defined as [ADDRESS_849476] ‘progression’ scan, confirmed by a subsequent scan at least [ADDRESS_849477], will be 
collected from signing the informed consent form and throughout the study.  
8.3 Safety Assessments  
Vital signs, weight, physical examinations , ophthalmologic  examination s, ECOG 
performance status, ECGs and  laboratory safety tests ( eg, PT/ aPTT, urinalysis, hematology , 
serum chemist ry, autoantibodies,  thyroid function, viral antigen reactions, cytokine / 
chemokine panels) will be  obtained and assessed at designated intervals throughout the study 
(see Table  5, Table 7, Table 8, and  Table 9 for Phase 1A , and Table 11 for Phase 1B , 
respectively ).  Special attention will be given to immune -related adverse effects ( eg, gut,  
skin, lung, liver,  kidney  endocrine organs, others).  
Adverse events will be graded an d recorded throughout the study according to NCI -CTCAE  
v 4.03.  Characterization of toxicities will include severity, duration, and  time to onset.  
Safety endpoints will include all types of AEs, in addition to  laboratory safety assessments, 
ECOG performance scale status, ECGs, and vital signs.    
The continuous safety evaluation will be performed by [CONTACT_1034] , the Coordinating 
Investigator , and Investigator s.  An SMC will be established for the determination of dose 
levels to be administered duri ng dose escalation and dose regimens in this study .  Details of 
the safety monitoring process will be specified in a dedicated SMC charter.  
8.3.1 Phase  1A Part 1  
The SMC consists of the Coordinating Investigator , selected recruiting Investigator s, the 
Sponsor ’s medical monitor , and the contract research organization  (CRO) ’s medical monitor .  
Ad hoc members will be consulted as needed and may include, but are not restricted to the 
biostatistician and pharmacokineticist.   
Before moving to the next dose level, the SMC will review all safety data available to 
determine whether recruitment to the next cohort should be initiated.  At the conclusion of 
the dose escalation phase, the SMC will determine the RP2D(s) to be further investigated.  
The SMC will determine when n o further dose escalation is appropriate and whether the 
MTD will be defined as a preceding dose or an intermediate dose.   
The SMC will meet for cohort safety reviews after all subjects in a dosing cohort have 
completed the first treatment cycle.  All ava ilable safety data will also be provided for 
subjects who discontinue prior to this time.  Safety data from prior cohorts may also be 
presented.  The decision to escalate dose and the determination of the MTD will be based on 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849478] 
impacted evaluation of potential DLT.  The SMC may weigh collective evidence and may 
determine a DLT for reasons in addition to those explicitly stated in the final protocol.  
Response from all SMC mem bers, including Investigators with subjects enrolled in the 
Phase  1 stage, or their designees, shall be required for each escalation/review.  
Adequate time for review of results will be given to SMC members (approximately 1 to 
2 business days).  Enrollment in subsequent dose levels will be put “on hold” during each 
review period, pending the decision of the SMC.  
The SMC decision points may fall into one of the categories detailed below:  
 Escalate to a higher dose  
 Recruit an additional 3 subjects into existing  dose level  
 Stop escalation and investigate lower dose(s)  
 End part of the study  
 End the overall study  
Decisions will be made using the criteria defined within the protocol (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The SMC will make the dose escalation decisions . 
8.3.2 Phase  1A Part 2  and Part 3  
In order to adequately monitor safety during in the Phase  1A Part 2 and Part 3 stage s of the 
study,  data review w ill be routinely conducted by [CONTACT_4484] .  The SMC consists of the 
Coordinating Investigator , representative recruiting Investigator s, the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor, and the CRO’s  Medical Monitor.   Ad hoc members will be consulted as needed and 
may include, but are not restricted to the biostatistician and pharmacokineticist.  
The SMC will review safety data ( including but not limited to, AEs, SAEs, laboratory 
parameters, investigational product lo gs, treatment delays or reductions, and treatment 
discontinuation due to toxicity), when all the  subjects have completed the first cycle of 
treatment  in each stage , or withdrew due to any reason ( PD, adverse event, or death) .  The 
SMC will make the decisio n using the criteria as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (Part 2) or 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (Part 3) .  Any treatment -related death will also trig ger review by [CONTACT_4484].  
The SMC will determine whether it is safe to proceed.

 8.5 Efficacy Assessments  
This study includes preliminary assessments of efficacy as outlined in the sections below.  
Disease assessment by [CONTACT_128656] (CT or MRI, with a preference for CT) will be 
performed and recorded at screening  within [ADDRESS_849481]  v 
1.1.  Pseudo -progression may occur due to immune cell infiltration and other mechanisms as 
manifested by [CONTACT_635714]  (Wolchok et al, 2009 ).  These patients may go on to exhibit a partial response at a 
later time point. It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to determine if the patient should 
be considered for treatment beyond progression due to clinical benefit.  This decision should 
be considered carefully so as to permit patients who are likely to be benefiting to continue 
treatment while at the same time preventing prolonged exposure of a futile therapy in patients 
who may not be benefitting.  Any decisions to c ontinue treatment beyond initial progression 
must be discussed with the medical monitor  and documented in the study records .  
Thus subject s with documented progression in tumor burden or the appearance of new 
lesions in the absence of significant clinical deterioration (decline in performance status 
and/or laboratory values) are permitted to continue with treatment (after re -consenting  in 
Phase 1)  until confirmation of PD with repeat imaging  at least [ADDRESS_849482] be met:  
 Absence of clinical symptoms and signs of disease progression (including worsening 
laboratory values)  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 121 of 207 
  Stable ECOG performance status  
 Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tumor at critical anatomical 
sites ( eg cord compression) that necessitates urgent a lternative medical intervention  
In rare cases, a subject with unequivocal  radiographical  PD may be allowed to continue study 
treatment  if, in the judgment  of the investigator, the subject is benefiting from the treatment.  
Prior consultation with the Sponsor is required .  
8.5.2 Efficacy Endpoints  
Efficacy measures  include:  
 The ORR, defined as the percentage of subjects in the study whose best overall response 
was either CR or PR, as as sessed by [CONTACT_635715]  v 1.1. 
 The PFS  and DCR (CR  + PR + SD) as assessed by [CONTACT_393]  v 1.1; and CBR 
(CR + PR + durab le SD [SD ≥24 weeks])  
 DOR for responders (CR or PR)  
PCWG2 criteria  (Scher et al, 2008 ) may also be used to evaluate responses in patients with 
prostate can cer enrolled in the study as presented in  Appendix  9. 
GCIG criteria  (Rustin et al, 2011 ), in addition  to RECIST v 1.1 may also be used to evaluate 
response in patients with ovarian cancer  enrolled in the study.  
RANO criteria  (Wen et al, 2010 ) may also be used to evaluate response in patients with 
GBM enrolled on the study.  
8.6 Pharmacokinetics

postdose (end infusion to 30 min ). 
Safety Follow -up  
One blood samples (3.5 mL ) will be collected at the mandatory Safety Follow -up Visit. 
Other Blood Samples  
Unscheduled blood samples may also be collected whenever any notable safety is seen, to 
evaluate if the observation is exposure related. Blood samples ( 3.5 mL) should be obtained, 
when possible, for analysis of serum tislelizumab  in the event of a DLT  or any Grade  3 or 
above irAE  (refer to Section 7.3.4 ).  The Investigator  must record the time the blood samples 
obtained and the time of the previous administration in the eCRF.

8.[ADDRESS_849494] available  archival tumor tissue samples , although a fresh baseline tumor 
biopsy (within 8 weeks before  starting treatment) is strongly recommended.   In the absence 
of archival tumor tissues, a fresh  baseline biopsy of a tumor lesion is mandatory . For these 
subjects, an optional biopsy for biomarker analysis after approximately 2 cycle s of treatment 
is strongly recommended.    
For Arm 2 (ovarian  cancer ), Arm 3 (gastric cancer) , and Arm 4 (HCC) of Phase 1B 
study, a fresh baseline biopsy within 8 weeks before  starting treatment is mandatory for 
biomarker analysis  
For Arm 9 (melanoma) of Phase 1B study, a fresh baseline biopsy within [ADDRESS_849495] easily accessible  lesions are strongly recommended for 
baseline or the paired biopsy.  
Optional biopsy will also be taken at the safety follow up visit for the subjects who ha ve 
confirmed disease progression during the study from accessible tumor sites to obtain samples 
to explore resistance mechanism.  If feasible, any follow up biopsy should be ideally taken 
from the same tumor lesion as the baseline biopsy.  Written patient consent is required for 
fresh tumor biopsies.  Fresh biopsies should be limited to readily accessible tumor lesions

readily accessed using CT guidance).  Risk ass essment of tumor biopsy must be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_635716] -significant risk procedures ( ie, those procedures 
associated with an absolute risk of mortality or major morbidity of less than 2% based on 
institutional experience, biopsy location, and patient’s clinical status) will be performed for 
protocol -mandated biopsies . From the baseline biopsy or archived tumor tissue, either a 
formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded block with tumor tissue (preferred) or at least [ADDRESS_849496] be sent to the central laboratory. If performed, a core or excisional biopsy of the 
tumor (cytologic or fine -needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_27808]) should be obtained 
that has proper size for histological examination and bioma rker. 
Specific instructions for tissue /plasma  collection and shipment are provided in the Lab 
Manual.  The maximum amount of blood collected during the study is presented in

  Identify any issu es and address their resolution  
This will be done in order to verify that the:  
 Data are authentic, accurate, and comp lete 
 Safety and rights of subjects are being protected  
 Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol (and any 
amendm ents), GCP, and all app licable regulatory requirements  
The Investigator  agrees to allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents and to 
allocate his/her time and the time of his/her personnel to the monitor to discuss findings and 
any relevant i ssues.  
At study closure, monitors will also conduct all activities described in Section 13.1.  
9.2 Data Management/Coding  
Data generated within this clinical study will be handled according to the relevant SOPs of 
the data management and biostatistics departments of Quintiles.  
An electro nic data capture (EDC) system will be used for this study, meaning that all eCRF 
data will be entered in electronic forms at the study center.  Data collection will be completed 
by [CONTACT_635718] .  Appropri ate training 
and security measures will be completed with the Investigator  and all authorized study center 
personnel prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any 
subjects.  
The eCRFs should always reflect the latest observations on the subjects participating in the 
study.  Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or after the 
subject’s visit.  To avoid inter -observer variability, every effort should be made to ensure that 
the same individual  who made the initial baseline determinations completes all safety 
evaluations.  The Investigator  must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and 
correct.  If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available or not 
applicable or unknown, the Investigator  should indicate this in the eCRF.  The Investigator  
will be required to electronically sign off on the clinical data.   
The monitor will review the eCRFs and evaluate them for completeness and consistency.  
The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no 
discrepancies between critical data.  All entries, corrections, and alterations are to be made 
by [CONTACT_635719]/her designee.  The monitor cannot enter data in the  
eCRFs.  Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to the central server, corrections 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018

Page 129 of 207 
 to the data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name [CONTACT_162081], together with time and date will b e logged.  Roles and 
rights of the study center personnel responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF 
will be determined in advance.  If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor 
or data manager will raise a query in the EDC a pplication.  The appropriate study center 
personnel will answer queries sent to the Investigator . 
The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original 
(or source) medical records unless otherwise specified.  Source do cuments are all documents 
used by [CONTACT_635720][INVESTIGATOR_5182]’s medical history, that verify the 
existence of the subject, the inclusion and exclusion criteria and all records covering the 
subject’s participation in the study.  They include laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, 
pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc.  
The Investigator  is responsible for maintaining source documents.  These will be made 
available for inspection by [CONTACT_635721] v isit.  The Investigator  must 
submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives the investigational product, 
regardless of the duration.  All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as 
laboratory or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], should be clearly ide ntified with the study and subject number.  
Any personal information, including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible 
to preserve individual confidentiality.  
Electronic CRF records will be automatically appended with the identification of t he creator, 
by [CONTACT_5248].  Specified records will be electronically signed by [CONTACT_635722]/her review of the data and acknowledgement that the data are 
accurate.  This will be facilitated by [CONTACT_132158] ’s unique User ID and 
password; date and time stamps will be added automatically at the time of the electronic 
signature.  If an entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction should be made in 
accordance with the relevant software procedures.  All chang es will be fully recorded in a 
protected audit trail, and a reason for the change will be required.  
Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Concomitant medications will be coded  using the World 
Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD).  Concomitant diseases/medical history 
will be coded using the most current version of MedDRA.

 completion of the study.  If an audit or inspection occurs, the Investigator  and institution 
agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access to all relevant documents and to allocate 
his/her time and the time of his/her personnel to the auditor/inspector to discuss findings and 
any relevant issues.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associa ted with the 
use of an investigational product.  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication under 
study.  See Section 10.3 for additional information.  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency an d/or intensity of the condition  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after inves tigational product administration even 
though it may have been present  before the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequ elae of a suspected interaction  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigat ional product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should no t be 
reported as an AE or SAE)  
 Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action.  See Section 10.3 for 
additional information

Page 131 of 207 
 Examples of an AE do not include:  
 Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to 
the procedure is an AE  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
conve nience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
 The disease/disorder being studied,  or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expec ted for the subject’s 
condition  
10.[ADDRESS_849501] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Results in d eath 
 Is life -threatening  
NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, i f it were more severe.  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_635654]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_635655] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
out-patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236] , the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an  AE. 
 Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively

Page 132 of 207 
 minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Medically  Significant:  A m edical or scientific judgment regarding that the event , such as 
important medical events t hat may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_635656] (in the office or an Emergency Department visit with treatment) to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition s.  These should also be 
considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, inte nsive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
10.3 Lack of Efficacy  
“Lack of efficacy” will not be reported as a n AE.  The signs and symptoms or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the AE or SAE 
definition (including clarifications).  
10.4 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal 
Assessments as Adverse Events or S erious Adverse Events  
Abnormal laboratory findings ( eg, clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, urinalysis) or 
other abnormal assessments ( eg, ECGs, X -rays, vital signs, etc.) that are judged by [CONTACT_635723], as defined in Section 10.1, or an SAE, as defined in Section 10.2.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
detected during the study or are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the 
start of the study or require a medical intervention for treatment will be reported as AEs or 
SAEs.  However, clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal 
assessments that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by [CONTACT_635724]’ s condition, or that are present or 
detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
The Investigator  will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an 
abnormal laboratory finding or othe r abnormal assessment is clinically significant.

 10.5 Time Period, Frequency, and Method of Detecting Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events  
Subjects will be assessed for AEs and SAEs beginning immediately after signing the 
informed consent form and continuing through to follow -up which is 30 ± [ADDRESS_849502] questions:  
 How are you feeling?  
 Have you had any medical problems since your l ast visit?  
 Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the source documents.  All AEs and SAEs will be 
reported in the eCRF.  
10.6 Recording of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
When an AE or SAE occurs,  it is the responsibility of the Investigator  to review all 
documentation ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) relative to 
the event.  The Investigator  will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or SAE 
in the eC RF.  It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238]’s 
medical records to the Sponsor  or designee in lieu of completion of the appropriate AE or 
SAE eCRF pages.  However, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_184120] r 
certain cases are requested by [CONTACT_221301] .  In this instance, all subject identifiers 
will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_635657] . 
The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the 
AE or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms. Adverse events are independent 
compo nents of the study.

 10.7  Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
10.7.1  Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study , at the time the event is reported .  When applicable, AEs  and SAEs should be 
assessed and graded based upon the NCI -CTCAE v 4.03.  In addition to performing the 
CTCAE assessment, the intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF should also be 
assigned to one of the following categories based on the Investig ator’s clinical judgment ： 
 Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities  
 Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities  
 Severe: An event that prev ents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as 
severe.  An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as 
described in Section 10.2. 
10.7.[ADDRESS_849503] will be considered and investigated.  
The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or Product Information,  for marketed products, 
in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the Investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor  or designee .  However, it is very 
important th at the Investigator  always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior 
to transmission of the SAE eCRF to the Sponsor  or designee .  The Investigator  may change 
his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information, amending the SAE eCRF  
accordingly.  The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting requirements.  
The Investigator  will provide the assessment of causality as per instructions on the SAE 
eCRF.  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849504]’s condition.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact  [CONTACT_5258], will 
be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  Once res olved, the 
appropriate AE or SAE eCRF page(s) will be updated.  The Investigator  will ensure that 
follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the 
nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional  laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  
The Sponsor  or designee may request that the Investigator  perform or arrange for the conduct 
of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  The Investigator  is obligated to assist.  If a subject dies 
during participation in the stu dy or during a recognized follow -up period, the Sponsor  or 
designee  will be provided with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on th e originally completed SAE eCRF .  The 
updated SAE eCRF  should be resubmitted to the Sponsor  or designee within the time frames 
outlined in Section 10.9.

BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849506], he/she will report 
the information to the Sponsor  or designee within 24 hours as outlined in Table 14.  The SAE 
eCRF will always be completed as thoroughly as possible with all  available details of the 
event.  The SAE should be recorded  by [CONTACT_737]  (or designee) and report ed to the 
Sponsor  within the designated timeframes.  The data alert letter will be automatically 
submitted to sponsor or designee immediately by [CONTACT_618199].   If the Investigator  does not  
have all information regarding an SAE, he/she will not wait to receive additional information 
before notifying the Sponsor  or designee of the event and completing the form.  The form 
will be updated when additional information is received.  
The Investigato r will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report as described in Section 10.7.[ADDRESS_849507] (IRB)  /Independent Ethics Committee (IEC).  
This protocol may be  filed under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the US 
FDA.  On ce active, a given SAE may qualify as an IND safety report if the SAE is both 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849508] and unexpected.  In this case, all Investigator s filed 
to the IND (and associated INDs for the same compound) will receive an expedite d 
Investigator  safety report, identical in content to the IND safety report submitted to the FDA.  
Expedited Investigator  safety reports are prepared according to the Sponsor ’s policy and are 
forwarded to Investigator s as necessary.  Such a report is prepar ed for an SAE that is both 
attributable to investigational product and unexpected.  The purpose of the report is to fulfill 
specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
When a study center receives an initial or follo w-up report or other safety information ( eg, 
revised IB) from the Sponsor  or designee , the responsible person according to local 
requirements is required to promptly notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
10.[ADDRESS_849509] -study AE or SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE detection 
period, defined in Section 10.5. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former subjects.  However, if 
the Investigator  learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been 
discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event reasonably r elated to the 
investigational product, the Investigator  will promptly notify the Sponsor  or designee . 
10.12  Serious Adverse Events Related to Study Participation  
An SAE considered related to study participation ( eg, procedures, invasive tests, a change in 
existi ng therapy), e ven if it occurs during the pre - or post -treatment period, will be reported 
promptly to the Sponsor  or designee  (see Section 10.9). 
10.13  Pregnancy   
10.13.1  Contraception and Pregnancy Testing  
Childbearing potential is defined as being physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. 
Refer to  Appendix 12  for contraception guidelines and definitions of “women of childbearing 
potential” and “no childbearing potential.”  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening in women of childbearing potential.  
Any female subject who is pregnant will not be el igible for the study (see Section 5.2.1 ).  A 
urine or serum pregnancy test must be performed if any woman suspects that she has become 
pregnant dur ing the study.  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849510]-study assessments will be collected at the time of discontinuation as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
The Investigator, or his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on any female 
subject or a female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant while participating in 
this study.  The Investigator, or his/her designee, will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor  or designee  within [ADDRESS_849511]’s pregnancy.  The subject will also be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy.  Information on  the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the 
Sponsor  or designee .  Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 8 weeks following the 
delivery date.  Any premature termination  (spontaneous or elective abortion prior to 20 
weeks or stillbirth  after 20 weeks gestational age) of the pregnancy will be reported.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE, as 
described in Section 10.[ADDRESS_849512] by [CONTACT_737], will be 
reported to the Sponsor  or designee  as described in Section 10.11.  While the Investigator is 
not obligated to actively seek this information in former subjects, he/she may learn of an 
SAE through spontaneous re porting.

BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849513] ATISTICAL CONSIDERAT IONS  
11.1 Sample Size Considerations   
11.1.1  Sample Size Considerations for Phase  1A 
In the Phase 1A stage, the number of dose levels and schedules examined and the emerging 
tislelizumab  toxicities will determine the sample size.   It is an ticipated that approximately 
24 subjects will be required to establish the RP2D(s) of tislelizumab  when administered as a 
single agent.  In addition, 10  to 20  subjects will be enrolled in each of the schedule expansion  
and flat dose  cohort at one or more dose level (up to 10 mg/kg Q2W  or Q3W  in schedule 
expansion cohort; 200 mg Q3W in flat dose cohort ) not exceeding MTD to further evaluate 
safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary efficacy of tislelizumab .  In total approximately 
[ADDRESS_849514] s are planned for the study.  
11.1.2  Sample Size Considerations for Phase  1B 
In the Phase 1B stage, approximately 330 subjects ( approximately 20 , 30 or  50 subjects for 
each arm  except arm 9 ) will be evaluated  for efficacy as well as safety and tolerability of 
tislelizumab  in select tumor types.   One or more arms may be closed early due to difficulty in 
patient recruitment.  
Using binomial approach, the 95% confidence interval (CI) width of an observed ORR of 
10% is  reduced by  12%, from 30.5% to 18.5%, when sample size  increases from 20 to 50. 
The 95% CI width of an observed ORR=50% is reduced by 16 .6%, from 45.6% to 29.0%, 
when sample size  increases from 20 to 50.   There is approximately 88% chance to observed 
at least one responder in an expansion arm of size 20 when the underlying ORR is 10%; and 
such chance  increases while sample size expands . 
11.2 General Considerations for Data Analysis  
Data will be listed and summar ized using SAS® v 9.2 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
North Carolina) according to Sponsor  agreed reporting standards, where applicable.  
Complete details will be documented in the reporting and analysis plan.   Primary safety and 
efficacy analyses wi ll be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_849515] being 
enrolled.  
The following descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the trial data on the basis of 
their nature unless otherwise specified:  
• Continuous variables: number of non -missing  observations, mean, standard deviatio n, 
median, minimum, and maximum  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL

Page 140 of 207 
 • Categorical variabl es: frequencies and percentages  
• Time -to-event variables: number of non -missing observations (N), median, minimum 
and maximum. Kaplan -Meier (KM) event rates may also be  provided if applicable for 
specific time to event variables  
Efficacy and safety data will be summarized by [CONTACT_635725], unless otherwise specified.  
Further description of the statistical methods and analyses will be provided in the statistical 
analysis  plan.  
11.2.1  Analysis Populations  
All Subjects Enrolled Set (ENR)  
The all subjects enrolled (ENR) set will include all subjects who provide informed consent 
for this study.  The ENR analysis set will be used to summarize and describe the subject 
disposition, and deaths, unless stated otherwise.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
The safety analysis set (SAF) will include all subjects in the ENR  set who receive at least one 
dose of tislelizumab .  The SAF will be used for all efficacy and safety summaries (except 
DLTs , PK and PD analyses ). 
DLT Analysis Set (DLT)  
The DLT Analysis Set includes all subjects who experienced a DLT during Cycle [ADDRESS_849516] 90% of the planned doses of treatment during the DLT 
observation period (Cycle 1).   
PK Analysis Set (PKS)  
The PK Analysis Set will include subjects who have received at least the first dose of 
tislelizumab  and provided PK samples as per protoco l following first dosing on Day  1. 
PD Analysis Set (PDS)  
The PD Analysis Set will include subjects who have received at least the first dose of 
tislelizumab  and have evaluable pharmacodynamic data.  
11.2.2  Interim Analysis  
Phase 1A stage of this study is a dose escalation and schedule expansion study, safety, PK 
and pharmacodynamic data will be evaluated on an ongoing basis.  The interim analysis will 
be performed once the Phase 1A stage is completed .

 11.2.3  Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy is not a primary objective of the Phase 1A stage of this study.  Objective response is 
the primary endpoint of the Phase 1B stage.  There is no formal statistical testing for the 
efficacy endpoints in Phase  1B.  The efficacy analyses will be descriptive only.  
Response based on Investigator s’ judgment will be collected at screening and while on study 
approximately every [ADDRESS_849517] 
12 months and approximately 12 weeks  thereafter  in the simple form of four categories: PD, 
SD, CR, and PR (according to RECIST  v 1.1). 
PCWG2 criteria  (Scher et al, 2008 ) may also be used to evaluate responses in patients with 
prostate cancer enrolled in the study.  
GCIG criteria  (Rustin et al, 2011 ), in addition  to RECIST v 1.1 may also be used to evaluate 
response in patients with ovarian cancer enrolled in the study.  
RANO criteria  (Wen et al, 2010 ) may also be used to evaluate response in patients with 
GBM enrolled on the study.  
Listing of the data will be provided.  If data warrant, a summary by [CONTACT_635726].  
Objective Response  
The number and proportion of subjects who achieve objective tumor response (CR or PR) or 
SD will be summarized.  The ORR  will be determined along with 95% CI. 
Progression Free Survival  
Progression -free survival  is defined as th e time from the date of first study dose to disease 
progression or death whichever occurs first.  Subjects without an event (no disease 
progression or death) will be censored at the date of “last tumor assessment”.  Subjects with 
no baseline or post-baseline tumor assessments will be censored at Day 1. 
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate median PFS and 95% CI.  Kaplan -Meier 
curves will be constructed to provide a visual description of the PFS change with time.  
Duration of Response  
Durati on of response for responders (CR or PR) is defined as the time interval between the 
date of the earliest qualifying response and the date of PD or death for any cause, whichever 
occurs earlier.  For subjects who are alive without progression following the  qualifying 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849518] 
follow -up for progression of disease.  
Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to estimate median time and 95% CI for DOR .  
Disease Control Rate  
The DCR is defi ned as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR, PR, and SD based on 
RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_849519] tumor types.  The DCR will be calculated for each 
tumor type with 95% CI estimated.  
Clinical Benefit Rate  
The CBR is defined as the proportion of sub jects who achieve CR, PR, and durable SD [SD 
≥24 weeks] based on RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_849520] tumor types.  The CBR as well as 
95% CI will be estimated for each tumor type.  
Overall Survival  
Overall survival is defined as the time interval between t he date of the first study drug dose

 APPENDIX 5:  THE RESPONSE EVAL UATION CRITERIA IN S OLID 
TUMORS (RECIST) GUID ELINES  
The text below was obtained from  Eisenhauer et al , 2009 . 
DEFINITIONS  
Response and progression will be  evaluated in this trial using the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee 
(Version 1.1).  Changes in only the largest diameter (uni -dimensional measurement) of the 
tumor lesions are used in th e RECIST criteria.  Note: Lesions are either measurable or 
non-measurable using the criteria provided below.  The term “evaluable” in reference to 
measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
Measurable Disease  
Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
 [ADDRESS_849541] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice 
thickness an d a minimum of 10  mm).  
 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (when superficial).  
 [ADDRESS_849542] X -ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]).  
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node mus t be ≥  [ADDRESS_849543] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesions (longest diameter ≥10 to 
<15 mm with conventional techniques or <  [ADDRESS_849544] scan), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural, or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast di sease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_635732] -measurable.  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 172 of 207 
 Bone lesions:  
 Bone scan, positron emission tomogra phy ( PET) scan, or plain films are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be 
used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions  
 Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with i dentifiable soft tissue components, 
that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_86123].  
 Blastic bone lesio ns are non -measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
 Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, 
by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 Cystic lesion s’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as 
target le sions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
 Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion.  T rial protocols should detail the conditions under 
which such lesions would be considered measurable.  
Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2  lesions per organ and 5  lesions in total, should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded an d measured at baseline.  Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of 
all involved organ, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible 
repeated measurements.  
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may 
be visible by [CONTACT_33490].  Pathological nodes which are defined 
as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion  of a short axis 
of ≥[ADDRESS_849545] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for 
MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital, or coronal).  The smaller of these 
measures is the short axis.  For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 
20 mm x 30 mm has a short axis of 20  mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In 
this example, 20  mm should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological 
nodes (those with short axis ≥10  mm but <15  mm) should be considered non -target lesions.  
Nodes that have a short axis <10  mm are considered non -pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed.  
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for a ll 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes 
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  
The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further  characterize any objective 
tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Non-target Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified 
as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at  baseline.  Measurements are not required 
and these lesions should be followed as “present”, “absent”, or in rare cases “unequivocal 
progression” (more details to follow).  In addition, it is possible to record multiple non -target 
lesions involving the sam e organ as a single item on the case record form ( eg, “multiple 
enlarged pelvic lymph node” or “multiple liver metastases”).  
GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATION OF MEASURABLE DISEASE  
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and 
never more than [ADDRESS_849546] erize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging based evaluation 
should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed 
cannot be imaged but are accessible  by [CONTACT_12148].  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial and P10  mm diameter as assessed using calipers ( eg, skin nodules).  For the case 
of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate  the size of 
the lesion is suggested.  As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_635733] -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849547] X -ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X -ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions.  However, lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are clear ly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment.  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that  CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_849548] 
slice thickness greater than 5  mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice 
the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( eg, for body scans).  
Ultrasound: Ultras ound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to 
the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation 
by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be 
used instead of CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when 
biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following CR or 
surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response.  If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, how ever, they must normalize for a 
subject to be considered in complete response.  Because tumor markers are disease specific, 
instructions for their measurement should be incorporated into protocols on a disease specific 
basis.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA 
response (in recurrent prostate cancer), have been published.  In addition, the Gynecologic 
Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -[ADDRESS_849549] -line trials in ovarian cancer.  
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ 
cell tumors, wher e known residual benign tumors can remain).  When effusions are known to 
be a potential adverse effect of treatment ( eg, with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis 
inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that a ppears

Page 175 of 207 
 or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criteria for 
response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and 
progressive disease.  
RESPONSE CRITERIA  
Evaluation of Target Lesi ons 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target les ions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.   
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on st udy).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5  mm.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new 
lesions is also considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to  qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded (measured in the s ame anatomical plane as the baseline 
examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10  mm on study.  This means that when 
lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the “sum” of lesions may not be zero even if 
complete response criteria are met, since a  normal lymph node is defined as having a short 
axis of <  [ADDRESS_849550] achieve a short axis <10  mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis 
measurement of the nodes i s to be included in the sum of target lesions.  
Target lesions that become “too small to measure”.  While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each 
subsequent evaluation, even whe n very small ( eg, 2 mm).  However, sometimes lesions or 
lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that 
the radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exact measure and may report them as 
being “too small  to measure”.  When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on 
the eCRF.  If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the 
measurement should be recorded as 0  mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present and is 
faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5  mm should be assigned (Note: It is 
less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 176 of 207 
 when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_635734] t he retroperitoneum; however, 
if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a 
default value of 5  mm should be assigned in this circumstance as well).  This default value is 
derived from the [ADDRESS_849551] slice thickness ( but should not be changed with varying CT slice 
thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non -reproducible, therefore 
providing this default value will prevent false responses or progressions based upon 
measurement error.  To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual 
measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5  mm. 
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. When non -nodal lesions “fragment”, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion 
sum.  Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid 
in obtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion.  If the lesions have 
truly coalesced such that t hey are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in 
this instance should be the maximal longest diameter for the “coalesced lesion”.  
Evaluation of Non -target Lesions  
While some non -target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol.  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in s ize (<10  mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing 
non-target lesions.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).  
When the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of  
substantial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target 
disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of 
therapy.  A modest “increase” in the size of one or more non -target lesi ons is usually not 
sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall 
progression solely on the basis of change in non -target disease in the face of SD or PR of 
target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
When the pa tient has only non -measurable disease.  This circumstance arises in some 
Phase  III trials when it is not a criterion of trial entry to have measurable disease.  The same

Page 177 of 207 
 general concept apply here as noted above, however, in this instance there is no measu rable 
disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non -measurable disease 
burden.  Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: 
if all lesions are truly non -measurable) a useful test that can  be applied when assessing 
patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden 
based on the change in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase 
that would be required to declare PD for measu rable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden 
representing an additional 73% increase in “volume” (which is equivalent to a 20% increase 
diameter in a measurable lesion).  Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from 
“trace” to “large”, an incr ease in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may 
be described in protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy”.  If “unequivocal 
progression” is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  
While  it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non -measurable disease, the 
very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be 
substantial.  
New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differe nces in scanning technique, change in imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some 
“new” bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions).  This is 
particularly important when the patie nt’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response.  
For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a “new” cystic 
lesion, which it is not.  
A lesion identified on a follow -up trial in an anatomical location that was not  scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression.  An example of this 
is the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on trial has a CT or MRI brain 
ordered which reveals metastases.  The subject’s brain m etastases are considered to be 
evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow -up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new dis ease.  If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan.  
While fluorodeoxyglucose  (FDG )-PET response assessments need additional study, it is 
sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 178 of 207 
 scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible “new” disease).  New lesions on 
the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 Negative FDG -PET at b aseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.  
 No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET 
at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site 
of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not 
PD. 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best respon se recorded from the start of the study drug 
treatment until the end of treatment taking into account any requirement for confirmation.  
On occasion a response may not be documented until after the end of therapy so protocols 
should be clear if post -treatm ent assessments are to be considered in determination of best 
overall response.  Protocols must specify how any new therapy introduced before progression 
will affect best response designation.  The subject’s best overall response assignment will 
depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into 
consideration the appearance of new lesions.  Furthermore, depending on the nature of the 
trial and the protocol requirements, it may also require confirmatory measurement.  
Specifi cally, in non -randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation 
of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the “best overall response”.  
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the patient is known.  Best 
response de termination in trials where confirmation of complete or partial response IS NOT 
required: Best response in these trials is defined as the best response across all time points 
(for example, a subject who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on 
last assessment has a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be best response, 
it must also meet the protocol specified minimum time from baseline.  If the minimum time 
is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the subject’s best response 
depends on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a subject who has SD at first 
assessment, PD at second and does not meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best 
response of PD.  The same subject lost to follow -up after th e first SD assessment would be 
considered inevaluable.

Note:  
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and  the nodes decrease to 
“normal” size (<10  mm), they may still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate 
progression should it be based on increase in size of the no des.  As noted earlier, this means 
that subjects with CR may not have a total sum of “zero” on the eCRF.  
In trials where confirmation of response is required, repeated ‘NE’ time point assessments 
may complicate best response determination.  The analysis pl an for the trial must address 
how missing data/assessments will be addressed in determination of response and 
progression.  For example, in most trials it is reasonable to consider a subject with time point 
responses of PR -NE-PR as a confirmed response.  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document objective 
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   21 May 2018  
Protocol Amendment 6.0  
Page 180 of 207 
 progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a 
descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_397699].  
Conditions that define “early progression, early death, and inevaluability” are trial s pecific 
and should be clearly described in each protocol (depending on treatment duration, treatment 
periodicity).  
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of complete response depen ds upon this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before 
assigning a status of complete response.  FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a 
CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases  where a residual radiographic abnormality is 
thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_635735].  Ho wever, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.  
For equivocal findings of progression ( eg, very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes, or necrosis  in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment.  If at the next scheduled assessment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected.  
CONFIRMATORY MEASUREMENT/D URATION OF RESPONSE  
Confirmation  
In non -randomized trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR 
is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error.  This will 
also permit appropriate interpretatio n of results in the context of historical data where 
response has traditionally required confirmation in such trials.  However, in all other 
circumstances, ie, in randomized trials (phase II or III) or trials where stable disease or 
progression are the pri mary endpoints, confirmation of response is not required since it will 
not add value to the interpretation of trial results.  However, elimination of the requirement 
for response confirmation may increase the importance of central review to protect against  
bias, in particular in trials which are not blinded.  
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after trial entry 
at a minimum interval (in general not less than 6 weeks).  
BeiGene Aus Pty Ltd   CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -A317_Study_001   [ADDRESS_849552] met 
for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive 
disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smal lest 
measurements recorded on study).  
The duration of overall complete response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of Stable Disease  
Stable dis ease is measured from the start of the treatment (in randomi zed trials, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum 
on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for ca lculation of PD).  
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease varies in different studies and 
diseases.  If the proportion of subjects achieving stable disease for a minimum period of time 
is an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, th e protocol should specify the minimal 
time interval required between two measurements for determination of stable disease.  
Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as the progression -free survival are 
influenced by [CONTACT_150065] -up after baseline evaluation.  It is not in the scope of 
this guideline to define a standard follow -up frequency.  The frequency should take into 
account many parameters including disease types and stages, treatment periodicity, and 
standard practice.  How ever, these limitations of the precision of the measured endpoint 
should be taken into account if comparisons between trials are to be made.

 APPENDIX 8:  GUIDELINES FOR SUPPORTIVE CARE  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_635736]:  
 Diarrhea: Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis  (such 
as diarrhea, abdominal  pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and  of 
bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus). In symptomatic patients,  
infectious etiologies should be ruled out, and if symptoms are persistent and/or 
sever e, endoscopic evaluation sh ould be considered.  
o In patients with severe enterocolitis, tislelizumab  will be permanently 
discontinued  and treatment with systemic corticosteroids should be initiated at 
a dose of 1 to  2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. When symptoms 
improve to Grade [ADDRESS_849557] 1 month.   
o In patients with moderate enterocolitis, tislelizumab  should be withheld and 
antidiarrheal  treatment should be started. If symptoms are persistent for more 
than one week, systemic corticosteroids should be initiated ( eg, 0.5 mg/kg/day 
of prednisone or equivalent). When symptoms improve to Grade [ADDRESS_849558] 1  month.  
Regarding guidelines for continuing  treatment with tislelizumab , see 
Section  5.1.2 . 
 All patients who experience diarrhea should be advised to drink liberal quantities of  
clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should  
be substituted via IV infusion.  
 Nausea/vomiting: Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and  
consideration should be given in subsequent cycles to the admini stration of  
prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard institutional practice. Patients  
should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.  
 Anemia: Transfusions and/or erythropoietin may be utilized as clinically indicated  for 
the treatment of anemia, but should be clearly noted as concurrent medications.  
 Neutropenia: Prophylactic use of colony -stimulating factors including Granulocyte  
Colony -Stimulating Factor (G -CSF), pegylated G -CSF or Granulocyte Macrophage  
Colony -Stimulating  Factor GM -CSF is not allowed in this study. Therapeutic use of  
G-CSF is allowed in patients with Grade 3 -4 febrile neutropenia.

Page 188 of 207 
  Thrombocytopenia: Transfusion of platelets may be used if clinically indicated. 
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura should be ruled  out before initiation of platelet 
transfusion.  
 Anti-infectives: Patients with a documented infectious complication should receive  
oral or IV antibiotics or other anti -infective agents as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_635737] a given infe ctious condition, according to standard  
institutional practice.  
 Immune -related adverse events: Patients who develop a G2 or higher irAE ( eg, 
colitis, skin rash, hepatitis, uveitis, hypo - or hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, or any  
other), should be discussed immediately with the Sponsor . Depending on the type  and 
severity of an irAE, oral or intravenous treatment with a corticosteroid should be  
considered, in addition to appropriate symptomatic treatment of a given condition.  
 Infusion reaction: Infusion reacti ons may consist of fever, chills/rigor, nausea,  
pruritus, angioedema, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, urticaria, rash,  
vomiting, myalgia, dizziness or hypertension. Severe reactions may include acute  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarctio n, ventricular fibrillation, and  
cardiogenic shock. Patients should be closely monitored for an infusion reaction  
during and immediately following drug infusion.  
o In the event of a Grade 1 or 2 infusion reaction, reduce the infusion rate by 
50% for the entire remaining duration of that infusion. Proper medical 
management  should be instituted, as indicated per type of the reaction. This 
includes but is not  limited to an antihistamine ( eg, diphenhydramine or 
equivalent), anti -pyretic  (eg, paracetamol or eq uivalent), and if considered 
indicated oral or IV  glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bro nchodilators, and 
oxygen.  
o In the event of a Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction, immediately stop the infusion.  
Proper medical management should be instituted immediately, as ind icated 
per type and severity of the reaction. This includes but is not limited to oral or 
IV anti-histamine, anti -pyretic, glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bro nchodilators, 
and oxygen.  
o Regarding continuation of study therapy after an infusion reaction has 
occurred,  see the guidelines in Section 7.3.2 .

EVALUATION AND MANAG EMENT   
The recommendations below for the diagnosis and management of any irAE  are intended as a 
guidance.  This document should be used in conjunction with expert clinical judgment (by [CONTACT_635739]), and individual 
institutional guidelines or policies.  
Criteria used to diagnose irAEs include blood tests, diagnostic imaging, histopathology, and 
microbi ology assessments to exclude alternative causes such as infection, disease progression, and 
adverse effects of concomitant drugs.  In addition to the results of these tests, the following factors 
should be considered when making an irAE diagnosis:  
 What wa s the temporal relationship between initiation of tislelizumab  and the adverse 
event?  
 How did the patient respond to withdrawal of tislelizumab ? 
 Did the event recur when tislelizumab  was reintroduced?  
 Was there a clinical response to corticosteroids?  
 Is the event an autoimmune endocrinopathy?  
 Is disease progression or an alternative diagnosis a more likely explanation?  
When alternative explanations to autoimmune toxicity have been excluded, the irAE field, associated 
with the AE in the eCRF should be chec ked.

with patients is required  
 Immune -related AEs should improve promptly after introduction of 
immunosuppressive therapy.  If this does not occur, review the diagnosis, seek further 
specialist advice and contact [CONTACT_635740] 
 For some grade 3 toxicities that resolve quickly, rechallenge with study drug may be 
considered if there is evidence of a clinical response to study treatment, after 
consultation with the study medical monitor  
 Steroid dosages in the table below are for  oral or intravenous (methyl)prednisolone.  
Equivalent dosages of other corticosteroids can be substituted.  For steroid -refractory 
irAEs, consider use of steroid -sparing agents (eg, mycophenolate mofetil [MMF])  
 Consider prophylactic antibiotics for opport unistic infections if the patient is 
receiving long -term immunosuppressive therapy

OF “WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL ”, “NO 
CHILDBEARING POTENTI AL” 
Contraception Guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy 
testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control. These methods 
include the following:  
 Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation (transdermal , implants or subcutaneous or 
intramuscular in jections ) 
 Combined oral contraceptives (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) may be used, but only if a 
concur rent barrier method is employ ed 
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implantable)  
 Intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized male partner  (with azoosp ermia demonstrated by a post -procedure 
medical examination of the semen)   
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of exposure asso ciated with the study treatment)  
o NOTE:  Total sexual abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method 
if it is in line with the patient’s usual and preferred lifestyle. Periodic 
abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), 
declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study d rug, and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Of note , barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) is not 
considered a highly effective method of contraception and if used, this method must be combined 
with another acceptable method listed above . 
Definitions of “Women of Childbearing Potential,” “Women of No Childbearing Potential”  
As defined in this protocol, “women of childbearing potential” are female patients who are 
physiologically capable of becoming pregnant.  
Conversely, “women of no childbearing potential” are defined as female patients meeting any of the 
following criteria:

  Surgically sterile (ie, through bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy)  
 Postmenopausal, defined as:  
o ≥ 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12 months OR  
o < 55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥ 12  months AND with 
postmenopausal  
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration > 30 IU/mL  and all 
alternative medical causes  for the lack of spontaneous menses for ≥ [ADDRESS_849584] been ruled out, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, 
hyperprolactinemia, etc.  
If an FSH measurement is required to confirm postmenopausal state, concomitant use of hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy should be excluded.

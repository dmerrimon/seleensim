Study Objectives/Endpoints  The objective of this post -market clinical follow -up 
study is to collect data conﬁrming safety, performance and clinical beneﬁts of the ToggleLoc 2.9mm Soft Tissue System when used for soft tissue to bone ﬁxation in the 
elbow.  
The primary objective is the assessment of performance by [CONTACT_750101]. 
The secondary objective is the assessment of safety 
and clinical beneﬁts. Safety will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_750102]. Relation of the events to device, instrumentation and/or procedu re will 
be speciﬁed. Clinical beneﬁts will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_330454] -reported outcome measures (PROMs) 
at the longest follow -up after surgery (minimum one 
year).  
Indications/Target Population  Consecutive series of patients who have been operated 
with the ToggleLoc 2.9mm Soft Tissue System in the 
elbow and who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are based on the indications and contraindications in the 
Instruction for Use (IFU).  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  Inclusion Criteria  
- Patients who received the ToggleLoc 2.9 mm 
Soft Tissue device for soft tissue to bone ﬁxation in the elbow.  
- Patients 18 years or older and skeletally mature.  
- Patients capable of understanding the surgeon’s 
explanations and following his/her instructions, 
able and willing to participate in the follow -up 
program and who gave consent to take part in the study.  
Exclusion Criteria  
- Infection.  
- Patient conditions including blood supply limitations, and insufficient quantity or quality of 
bone or soft tissue.  
- Patients with mental or neurologic conditions 
who are unwilling or incapable of following 
postoperative care instructions.  
- Foreign body sensitivity. Where material 
sensitivity is suspected, testing is to be 
completed prior to implantation of the device.  
- Patients who have any condition that would in the judgment of the Investigator place the 
patient at undue risk or interfere with the study.  
- Patient is a vulnerable subject (prisoner, 
mentally incompetent or unable to understand 
what participation to the study entails, a known alcohol or drug abuser, anticipated to be non-compliant).  
- Off-label use.  
Study Design  Global, Multicenter, Retrospective, Consecutive series  
Clinical Phase  Post -market  
Sample Size  83 cases implanted with the study device in the elbow.  
Length of Study  18 months  
Materials and Methods  Clinical records of these patients will be obtained from 
the clinic database, including pre -operative and 
intraoperative information. A ﬁnal follow -up (FUP) visit 
(minimum [ADDRESS_1026466]- operation) will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_750103]. Protocol deviations a nd adverse 
events will be captured throughout the study.  
Data Collection  Paper/Electronic  
Statistical Reporting  Data collected will be summarized and reported to each 
participating investigator. Statistical analysis will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_738783].  
 
Data collected in the study will be summarized 
descriptively. Descriptive summaries will be the basis of study reports to participants, as well as to generate an 
overall summary of the clinical evaluation of the 
ToggleLoc 2.9mm Soft Tissue System and its instrumentation when used in the elbow. Continuous data (e.g. age) will be summarized through means, 
medians, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and 
95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) over time periods of interest. Categorical data (e.g. gender) will be summarized using counts, percentages and 95% 
conﬁdence limits over time periods of interest. Summaries of complication data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. Subgroup summaries will be generated as needed either by [CONTACT_750104] (e.g. male vs. female, preop diagnosis) or by 
[CONTACT_682314] -points (e.g. body mass index (BMI) ranges). 
Patient conﬁdentiality will be protected at all times, and 
patient identiﬁers will not be included in data 
summaries.  
Scores/Performance Assessments  EuroQol (EQ -5D), Oxford Elbow Score, Adverse Events.

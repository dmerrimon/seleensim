V 4.[ADDRESS_1051771] of sharing audio recorded clinic visits on self- management in older adults: a multi-site trial Study Design Multi-site, patient level, randomized controlled trial. The three sites are Dartmouth-Hitchcock Primary Care (D- H; Manchester, NH and Bedford, NH), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC; Nashville, TN), and University of [LOCATION_007] Medical Branch, (UTMB; Galveston, TX). Primary Objective To determine the feasibility of a multisite trial of audio- recording Secondary Objective(s) Gather preliminary data on impact on behavioral, health and health care utilization outcomes. Research Intervention(s)/ Investigational Agent(s) Audio-recording of clinic visit shared via HIPAA compliant website. IND/IDE # N/A Study Population Older adults (≥65 years) with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 or 2) and hypertension managed in an outpatient setting. Sample Size Aim 1: N=108 (30 patients and 6 clinicians per site) Aim 2: N=54 (6 trial patient-participants and 6 trial clinician- participants from each site total N=18 patients, N=18 clinicians and 6 caregivers of trial patient participants per site, total N=18-caregivers).

 2.0 Objectives*  Aim 1. Conduct a multi-site, two-arm, parallel group, patient-randomized, blocked, controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_124250] 3-month follow up, to determine the feasibility and acceptability of sharing audio recordings of clinic visits (AUDIO) on self- management in older adults with diabetes and hypertension, compared to the after visit written summary (AVS) alone (Usual Care/UC). We will determine: 1.1 Feasibility of a larger trial by [CONTACT_766962] (n=30 patients and 6 clinicians per site; total N=108) and determining the optimal strategy to achieve a high retention rate and adherence to the study protocol. 1.[ADDRESS_1051772] of audio recordings on patient experience, understanding, self-management and clinician behavior. We will explore our main hypothesis that compared to those receiving UC, patients randomized to also receive audio recordings (AUDIO) of clinic visits will report greater self-management (Patient Activation Measure – Short Form) at [ADDRESS_1051773] of AUDIO on self- management compared to UC is greater for patients with low health literacy than those with high health literacy.  Aim 2. Assess the acceptability of study protocol and the use of audio recording of visits as part of care by [CONTACT_271936]-structured interviews with participating clinicians, patients and caregivers (i.e. person involved in the patient’s care, including a family member, friend or formal caregiver).  We hypothesize that this multisite trial will be highly feasible and that recording and sharing of clinic visits will be highly acceptable.  3.0 Background* 3.1. Significance Up to 80% of healthcare information is forgotten by [CONTACT_766963] a clinic visit.1–4 Poor recall of medical information has been identified as a significant barrier to self-management, key to the Chronic Care Model.5–7 This barrier is amplified in older adults with multimorbidity,8–11 where reduced cognitive capacity,12–14 low health literacy,15,16 and complex treatment plans are common.17–19 Older adults with multimorbidity account for 96% of Medicare expenditures, and in the absence of optimal self-management, they experience low quality of life and functional decline.10,11,20–26 Yet,

 when these patients are “activated,” they recognize that they have an important role in self-managing their conditions and have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to do so resulting in better functional status and health outcomes.27 A written after-visit summary (AVS) is the current U.S. standard of addressing poor recall of visit information with the goal of improving patient’s ability to self- manage.28–30 The AVS includes information on diagnoses, medications, allergies, clinician visited, and visit summary recommendations.29,31 While access to visit information is highly valued by [CONTACT_1962],30,32–[ADDRESS_1051774] AVS, provides a full detailed account of the clinic visit. Evidence suggests that sharing recordings can lead to greater patient recall and understanding of visit information35–41 and is acceptable to clinicians and patients.42–44 In our national survey (456 clinicians and 524 patients), 28% of clinicians reported having recorded a clinic visit for a patient’s personal use at least once, while 18% of patients had recorded a visit for their own use at least once.[ADDRESS_1051775]– positive or negative–of audio recordings on patients’ self-management or other health- related outcomes: especially relevant to older patients with chronic disease where self- management is critical. To answer this question, we propose a multi-site pi[INVESTIGATOR_766934] a fully powered trial to evaluate the impact of augmenting the AVS with audio recordings of the clinic visit compared to the AVS alone (Usual Care; UC).  Consistent with PA-18-[ADDRESS_1051776] is to: (a) operationalize and determine the feasibility of a multi-site trial where clinic visits are audio recorded and shared with older adults with diabetes and hypertension; (b) gather preliminary data examining the impact of routinely adding audio recordings of clinic visits to UC on self-management ability; and (c) identify factors pertinent to the acceptability of our study protocol and the audio recording of visits. Hypotheses are based on our substantial preliminary work and supporting evidence from scopi[INVESTIGATOR_766935].35–41

  3.2 Preliminary Data Our research team has conducted substantial preliminary work in this area, highlighting the acceptability of recording, feasibility of our trial and scalability of recording in practice. We describe this work below.  3.2.1 The prevalence of clinic audio recording in the U.S. Our research group (MPIs Barr, Cavanaugh and Masel) conducted a cross-sectional survey of [ADDRESS_1051777] clinic visits (see Section 3.6).  3.2.2 The routine sharing of audio recordings in America: a case study of clinics. Drs. Barr and Masel conducted a case study at three clinics that routinely share visit recordings: the Ryan Family Practice (Ludington, MI); the Barrow Neurosurgical Institute (BNI) (Phoenix, AZ); and the University of [LOCATION_007] Medical Branch (UTMB) Cancer Center (League City, TX). Seventy interviews were conducted with patients, caregivers, clinicians and administrators to understand implementation strategies, motivations, and recording use. Of the 34 patients and caregivers interviewed, 17 (50%) were ≥65 years, 28 (82%) reported listening to and 16 (47%) shared recordings. Major themes include the benefits of recording on patient understanding and recall, patient use of recordings to prepare for visits and greater engagement of caregivers. At BNI, clinicians who record now receive a 10% reduction in malpractice premiums and a $1 million increase in liability.46  3.2.3 “Taking the Message and the Medicine Home” program, UTMB, Galveston, TX.

In 2017, a diagnosis code was added to the Epic EMR system to indicate when a patient records during the encounter. The system reports, in 2017, 1,100 unique patients’ recordings.  3.2.[ADDRESS_1051779] medical visits? The emergence of audio recording in clinic practice has raised questions about its legality. We published in JAMA an analysis of legal statutes related to recording.[ADDRESS_1051780] of Columbia (single party consent; including TN and TX), but they do require

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations only applied to recordings that are owned by a health entity, not those that are owned by a patient.  3.2.[ADDRESS_1051781]. Barr is currently leading a pi[INVESTIGATOR_766936], compared toa written discharge summary (usual care), with cardiology inpatients (mean age: 67 years). This study mirrors the methods of the current proposal, including the approach to randomization, recruitment strategy, data collection procedures – however patients received a digital recorder. All eligible providers consented to take part in the project (N=6). We recruited 57 participants in 5 months (a recruitment rate of 56%) with an attrition rate of approximately 30%. The study protocol was administered with high fidelity.  3.2.[ADDRESS_1051782]. No primary care clinicians refused to participate. Procedures were developed to ensure integration into clinical practice workflow, including privacy protection of people in the clinic but not involved in the research study, and these will be applied in the current proposal.  3.2.7 Developi[INVESTIGATOR_766937] (Audio PHL) for older adults with multimorbidity. We have developed an application that supports the recording of clinic visits, performs secure transfers of these recordings to a HIPAA-compliant server infrastructure at Dartmouth, and allows patient-participants to set up a password- protected account to listen, share and manage their recordings online (Barr, GBMF#4952, STUDY00030397, STUDY00030126; Barr, R01LM012815; STUDY00030531).[ADDRESS_1051783] experience in recording of clinic visits as described above.

 Baseline assessment took approximately 20 minutes (n=12), provision of recording instructions took 10 minutes and follow up assessments by [CONTACT_756] (n=10) took 20 minutes.  4.0 Study Endpoints*  4.1 Primary endpoint The primary endpoints of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_766939]: 1) Feasibility: We will determine the optimal strategy to achieve a high retention rate and adherence to the study protocol. We will also assess retention rates (proportion of included patients completing T2 follow up; we will target >70%), fidelity to the study protocol (Borrelli et al48 criteria; we will target >90%) and the Feasibility of Intervention Measure49 (FIM, 4 items, see Appendix 1. 3-month Follow Up Assessment (T2); we will target an average score of >3).  2) Acceptability: We will determine the acceptability of the AUDIO intervention and study protocol by [CONTACT_766964]. Our primary indicator of acceptability will be the recruitment of 108 participants (N=30 patients and 6 clinicians per site) over our planned data collection period of six months. We will determine the listening rates (we will target >70%): this will include the proportion of patients in the intervention arm that log in to the online system and listen to (and how often) the recording. We will also document the number of patients who share or report sharing the recording and caregivers who access the recording. Participants will complete the Acceptability of Intervention Measure49 (AIM, 4 items, see Appendix 1. 3- month Follow Up Assessment (T2); target an average score of >3).  4.[ADDRESS_1051784] assessments* Corresponding Appendix  T0 T1 T2   Exploratory outcomes

 5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent  5.1 Usual care (UC): During the trial, patients will receive the AVS per the current standard at each site. The AVS is similar at all sites, as each clinic uses EPIC, and includes information such as clinician comments, diagnoses, orders and results. It is available both in paper and via the patient portal  5.2 Audio Intervention: We will audio record both in-person and telehealth visits of patients in the intervention group. For in-person visits, the RA will follow standardized instructions demonstrating how to start and stop the recording on the electronic tablet with patients and ask patients to demonstrate to confirm understanding. The RA will then enter the exam room and begin the recording with the patient’s permission, after the medical assistant has completed rooming the patient and before the clinician enters. The patient and clinician can choose to stop or start the recording at any time and a sign on the door will indicate “Recording in Progress”. The RA will wait outside the visit room. Once the visit is complete, the RA will enter the room, turn off the recording, and bring the patient to a private room where the RA will follow standardized instructions demonstrating how to access recordings.  Telehealth visits may be recorded in two ways. 1) the RA will meet the clinician in the private room where the visit will take place, and follow standardized instructions demonstrating how to start and stop the recording on the electronic tablet with the clinician and ask the clinician to demonstrate to confirm understanding. The RA will then begin the recording with the patient’s permission. A sign on the door will indicate “Recording in Progress”. The RA will wait outside the visit room. Once the visit is complete, the RA will enter the room and turn off the recording. 2) The RA will receive a link to the telehealth visit. They will join the visit at the time it is due to begin. The RA will inform the patient and clinician that the visit will be recorded and will notify them once the recording has begun. The recording will be captured directly in to HealthPAL and a digital back up will also be used.  In both instances the patient and clinician can choose to stop or start the recording at any time by [CONTACT_766965][INVESTIGATOR_766941] (e.g. where RA is outside of the room). The RA will schedule a time to meet with the patient via web conference, by [CONTACT_766966], during which the RA will follow standardized instructions demonstrating how to access recordings. Pre- and post-visit surveys will be administered remotely, by [CONTACT_166932], for patients having telehealth visits.  The research team will maintain a copy of all recordings locally on a secure, HIPAA

 compliant server, captured by a second recorder, which will also serve as a back-up; once transferred to the server, the recording will be deleted from the digital recorder. Patient access to recordings will be possible via a secure web-based platform: HealthPAL.  HealthPAL. All patients with access to email will be able to access their recording online. The recording and sharing of the recorded data will be facilitated via HealthPAL, an online platform developed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_766942] (Appendix 4. HealthPAL system). The RA will register the patient in the HealthPAL system. Within the system they can record visits, which can then be accessed later online at home. The RA will demonstrate how to access and playback the recording on a computer or smartphone using each patient’s unique login information. Access details (web address, login and use instructions) will be shared with patients both by [CONTACT_766967]. HealthPAL is a web application that runs on Amazon’s cloud infrastructure (AWS). The root account under which the application is hosted is owned by [CONTACT_552631], which has a Business Associates Agreement (available upon request) in place with Amazon for the use of Amazon’s HIPAA-eligible cloud services with Protected Health Information. All cloud services used by [CONTACT_766968] (Appendix. 5 HealthPAL security document).  5.1.1 Listening regime: We will instruct patients to listen to their most recent recording both within 24 hours after their visit (as a means to reinforce and recall self- management information discussed), at one week (to reinforce learning) and within three days prior to their next visit (to identify information that needs clarification or goals of care they would like to raise with their clinician). A reminder to listen to the recording will be sent to patients by [CONTACT_54769]/or text message (Appendix 24. Patient HealthPAL Reminder Emails). Patients will have the option of providing the contact [CONTACT_3031] (email) of a family member, or caregiver who typi[INVESTIGATOR_766943], or is involved in their care, and the study team will send this person access to the recording via the website.  5.1.2 Recording future visits: The RA will review the EMR of participants and document in REDCap scheduled patient visits (up to 6 months from recruitment). For patients in the AUDIO group, the RA will also attend each visit and assist with recording as described above, and administer the IPC survey post visit. While patients in the UC group have no further in clinic procedures following baseline assessment, we will plan to attend these visits when possible and offer participants the opportunity to complete the IPC survey post visit. We anticipate that patients will have one additional scheduled clinic visit over the 3-month period based on the average number of visits of these types of patients estimated from EMR data at each clinic site in 2017. We will neither record nor conduct follow-up assessments of unscheduled/urgent or acute visits so as to

When not being used to capture recordings in the clinic, the electronic tablet will be stored securely in the office of the research coordinator at each site.   6.0 Procedures Involved Study Design: We will conduct a multi-site, two-arm, parallel group, patient- randomized, blocked, controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_124250] 3-month follow up, to determine the impact of sharing audio recordings of clinic visits (AUDIO) on self-management in older adults with diabetes and hypertension, compared to the AVS alone (Usual Care). We will recruit 108 adults (30 patients and approximately 6 clinicians per site), ≥[ADDRESS_1051786] on the patients’ ability to self-manage their care as well as exploratory outcomes, at baseline (T0 = pre-visit) and at regular intervals from enrollment (T1 = 1 week, T2 = 3 month). We will also adhere to the CONSORT Statement extension to randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_766944], publish a study protocol and register the study on ClinicalTrials.gov.62 Our decision to use a patient level randomized trial design is justified for several reasons: 1) randomization reduces the impact of selection bias and confounding; 2) the risk of contamination is low as audio recordings will be reviewed outside of the clinic and the information will be unique to the each patient; 3) individual-level randomization is more efficient than cluster (e.g. clinic) randomization; 4) the use of blocking further improves the statistical precision of results by [CONTACT_766969], avoiding reliance on statistical models to adjust for any imbalances and 5) we will set up routine evaluations of key operational features of the study design e.g., recruitment rates, intervention use, fidelity - determining the need to make changes/refinements to study procedures throughout the trial.  6.1 Randomization process: Patients will be randomly allocated to AUDIO or UC alone using a block-randomization technique with the clinician acting as the blocking variable. Blocks of 2 patients per clinician will be generated to ensure an equal number of patients per clinician will be randomly assigned to the AUDIO and UC arm. The 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The impact of sharing audio recorded clinic visits on self-management in older adults: a multisite trial 
V 4.[ADDRESS_1051787] coordinator at Dartmouth College will prepare and send recruitment materials to each site prior to the beginning of data collection and will prepare the randomization sequence in REDCap. Upon completion of pre-visit baseline assessment (T0), the RA at the study site will reveal the participants group allocation using the randomization feature in REDCap. Patients will be offered an AVS per the usual practice at their clinic, either on paper or via patient portal, but only patients in the AUDIO arm will receive access to audio recordings from the RA to review online at home. The randomization process will be operationalized and supervised by [CONTACT_150963] (Co-I O’Malley).  Study procedures: All participating patients and clinicians will provide informed consent. Clinicians will proceed to complete a brief demographic survey. Patients will proceed to complete the pre-visit baseline assessment surveys. The baseline assessment will be administered in a private area of the waiting room in the clinic, private research office, or an available exam room. Patients will also have the option to complete baseline assessment online in REDCap or over the phone with research staff prior to the clinic visit if they opt for eConsent. We have pi[INVESTIGATOR_766945] [ADDRESS_1051788] been assigned to. If patients are unable to complete pre-visit surveys prior to meeting with the clinician due to time constraints, the surveys may be completed after the visit. Patients meeting the clinician in person will then be escorted by [CONTACT_766970] a medical assistant and/or back to the waiting room. Patients randomized to the AUDIO group will have their visit recorded using an electronic tablet; a second study recorder will also be used and act as a backup in case the primary recorder fails. For participants in the AUDIO arm, a sign will be placed on the clinic room door by [CONTACT_766971] a recording is taking place (see Appendix 6. Recording Sign). Upon completing their visit the RA will demonstrate to patients how to access their recording (see Appendix 7. HealthPal Instructions), and administer the post-visit baseline assessment survey items, specifically the PHQ-8 and GAD-7 surveys, and the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey (IPC). These tasks may take place in clinic for patients having an in-person visit, or remotely by [CONTACT_766972], telephone, and/or email, for patients having a telehealth visit. Patients will identify times and days that are most convenient for follow up assessments, as well as contact [CONTACT_21115] a person who could be reached in the event they are unreachable. Patients will receive honorariums to promote retention; a thank you note will be mailed with $30 (gift card, egift card, or site-specific payment method such as Greenphire) following recruitment and $20 ( gift card, egift card, or site- specific payment method such as Greenphire) upon completion of each follow-up assessment.  6.2 Monitoring, tracking, and retention: RAs will receive standardized training on how

Study data will be directly inputted to electronic surveys using REDCap, providing an opportunity to prevent and monitor missing data. At recruitment, the RA will ask patients for an email and phone number to conduct follow-up assessments (by [CONTACT_54769]/or telephone calls), and to provide contact [CONTACT_766973]-up. Follow-up contact [CONTACT_766974], email, or post, but will be limited to no more than one attempt per day, for up to two weeks from planned T1 assessment, and three weeks from planned T2 assessment.

We will also conduct weekly workbench reports from the EMR to confirm scheduled visits of recruited patients during the follow-up period.  6.3 Description of what research material, data, and information will be collected: Data will consist of written and audio information. Where possible, we will use item phrasing compatible with items from the Common Data Elements (CDEs) database. Data will be collected by [CONTACT_766977], transferred and stored centrally in a REDCap database at Dartmouth College. We will collect information on recruited patients from several sources:  The electronic medical record (EMR): We will collect information on patient demographics (age, sex) and contacts (address, telephone, email), primary language spoken, the number and type of patient conditions, current treatment (e.g., medication), laboratory tests (e.g., urine albumin, blood pressure, HbA1c) number of clinic visits and contacts (e.g. phone calls, patient portal emails), and emergency room visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Baseline laboratory tests may be collected as much as 12 months prior to the T0 (baseline) timepoint, as certain tests (e.g., urine albumin and HbA1c) are routinely done on a yearly basis.  Patient reported: We will collect the following information from patients: demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, language spoken at home, and educational attainment), cognitive function (Six Item Screener scale)63, the Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL-E)64, brief health literacy screen (BHLS)65,66, Patient Health Questionnaire(PHQ- 8)67, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)68 the Patient Activation Measure – Short Form (PAM-SF)69, an assessment of mental and physical functioning (PROMIS)58, an assessment of Quality of life (EURO-QOL)59, an assessment of satisfaction with care (PSQ-18)50, clinic visit process (Interpersonal Process of Care)61, comprehensive diabetes stigma scale (CSSS-15)70, Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness (SSCI-8)71, and treatment adherence (Medical Outcomes Study General Adherence measure55–57; ARMS-772).

  Assessments: A trained RA will collect data (T0= Baseline Assessment) by [CONTACT_766978]. Patients who complete eConsent can also complete the baseline assessments via REDCap prior to the clinic visit. The PHQ-8 and GAD-7 will be administered after the clinic visit. Follow up is planned by [CONTACT_6968] (Appendix 25 for the REDCap Survey Template) or telephone at T1= one week, T2= three months. For T1, the allowable window is up to two weeks from the scheduled timepoint. For T2, the allowable window is up to three weeks from the scheduled timepoint. Deviations from the follow up strategy (e.g., a patient who completes an assessment outside of the planned follow up window) will be reported to the IRB. No participant identifiers will be included on the labeling of study data. Study Unique ID code numbers instead of names will be used on participant materials, data and data-collection instruments to minimize risks regarding breach of confidentiality.  Patients will receive a printed schedule of follow-up assessments, tailored to times and days convenient to them. Outside of the standard study follow up assessments, the patient will be met in clinic or contact[CONTACT_766979] a participating clinician to assess intervention use (AVS or AUDIO) and interpersonal processes of care (IPC) survey (immediately following the clinic visit, or within 1 week of the visit by [CONTACT_766980]).  6.4 Outcomes: Our primary and exploratory outcome measures are outlined in Section 4.2 Table 1. 6.4.1 Covariates: Demographic information (age, sex, race, ethnicity, language used at home, educational attainment using categories from the 2016 American Community Survey) will be collected by [CONTACT_766981]. We will document if a caregiver (a support person, family member or friend) is present at the visit. We will collect demographic and practice information about participating clinicians including their age, sex, race, ethnicity and years in practice. The following covariates will be examined in our exploratory moderator analysis: Health literacy: We will use two assessments, the 3-item validated Brief Health Literacy Scale (BHLS) and the 18-item validated Short Assessment of Health Literacy (SAHL-E). Both scales are validated in English and Spanish. Scores on the BHLS range between 3 and 15, with higher scores indicating higher subjective health literacy. Scores on the SAHL-E range from 0 – 18; ≤14 is considered low health literacy Disease burden: The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)73 using EMR data. Each condition is assigned a score, based on risk of death, which is summed, with higher scores indicating higher disease burden. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The impact of sharing audio recorded clinic visits on self-management in older adults: a multisite trial 
V 4.6  29June2022 Page 21 of 53  
 Depression: The eight-item PHQ-8 validated in both English and Spanish. Scores range from 0 – 24; a score ≥10 indicates major depression, and a score of ≥20 indicates severe major depression.  Anxiety: The seven-item GAD-7 validated in both English and Spanish. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. Diabetes Stigma: The comprehensive diabetes stigma scale (CSSS-15) is a validated 15-item assessment of diabetes-related stigma. It is composed of four subscales: (1) enacted (0-6), (2) perceived (1-5) and (3) self-stigma(1-5), and (4) concealment (1-5). Subscale scores are means of responses, and an overall score is the sum of all items (11-96). Stigma of Chronic Illness. The Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness (SSCI-8) is validated, eight-item assessment of stigma related to chronic disease. It is scored from 8 (low stigma) to 40 (high stigma), and can be converted on to a standardized T-distribution score with a mean of [ADDRESS_1051790] deviation of 10.  Audio & AVS Use: Intervention use by [CONTACT_766982]: we can determine when a 1. patient logs into their account; 2. listens to a recording; and 3. shares the recording. AVS use will be assessed at standard outcomes assessments and one week from scheduled clinic visit during the data collection period: we will determine whether the patient reviewed the AVS and whether they shared it. 6.8 Debrief interviews (Aim 2): Upon completion of the data collection for Aim 1, we plan to enroll participants for Aim 2. We will evaluate the acceptability of our study protocol and AUDIO intervention, barriers and facilitators to implementation of audio recordings through semi-structured interviews with patients, caregivers of intervention arm participants (a person who assists with the patient’s care e.g. family member, friend) and clinicians at the three study sites: Dartmouth-Hitchcock Primary Care (Manchester, NH and Bedford, NH), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN), and University of [LOCATION_007] Medical Branch, Internal Medicine - Geriatrics Clinic (Galveston, TX). We will select a sample of trial patient-participants (N=6), caregivers of intervention arm participants (N=6) and clinicians (N=6) at each site, for a total of 54 participants (18 patients, 18 caregivers, and 18 clinicians). In addition to this, we will plan to supplement our interviews with two additional Spanish language patient and caregiver participants at our UTMB site if the participants wish to take part. Given estimates that thematic saturation typi[INVESTIGATOR_434178] 12-[ADDRESS_1051791] that our sample size for each stakeholder group (patients, caregivers, clinicians) will be adequate to achieve saturation of key themes.  Study procedures: Interview procedures will be similar across the stakeholder groups.

The posting of all final data from the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare is perhaps the best example of this institutional commitment to reinforcing open scientific inquiry, encouraging diversity of analysis and opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], promoting new research and critical review, and facilitating alternative analyses of datasets used in our published work. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_766946], we will publish results from this research work in peer-reviewed medical, economic and health policy journals. We will make analytic code and variable creation and restructuring de-identified information publicly available through the Dartmouth website (https://dataverse.dartmouth.edu).  In addition to the study-specific sharing plan outlined above, Dartmouth maintains the following universal data sharing policy for all investigators:  1. Data will be made available, in accordance with the NIH Data Sharing Policy (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing) to all researchers in both the private and public sector free or for a nominal charge and with minimal restriction. In some cases the Trustees of Dartmouth College (the institution) may determine that the public and the research community are better served by a licensing program whether or not patents have been filed.  2. So that the entire research community can benefit from the data generated by [CONTACT_8236], pending third parties rights, the institution will transfer materials to outside researchers under Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) generated and monitored by [CONTACT_265188]’s Technology Transfer Office. Such MTAs will be made with no more restrictive terms than the Simple Letter Agreement (SLA) to non-profit institutions or the Uniform Biological Material Transfer Agreement (UMBTA) to for-profit ones.

As a means of sharing knowledge, NIH encourages grantees to arrange for publication of NIH-supported original research in primary scientific journals, registered in PubMed Central database of the National Library of Medicine. Awardees therefore will strive to publish their findings in a timely manner and acknowledge that the research was supported by [CONTACT_18121]. Brief delays in publication may be appropriate to permit the filing of patent applications and to ensure that confidential information obtained from industrial collaborator is not inadvertently disclosed.

  10.1 Inclusion / Exclusion criteria (Aim 1 Trial) Inclusion criteria (Aim 1): Inclusion criteria will be assessed by [CONTACT_766983] a telephone screening assessment (SA). We will include patients who are (1) ≥ 65 years (EMR abstraction); (2) with diabetes and hypertension and receiving medication for each (EMR abstraction); (3) have had one or more clinic visits in the previous seven months (EMR abstraction); and (4) plan on receiving ongoing care at the clinic for the subsequent 6months (SA). By [CONTACT_766984] ≥ [ADDRESS_1051793] a greater opportunity to benefit from visit recordings. We will only include patients of clinicians (MDs, NPs) who (1) are based at the study clinic; (2) who treat adult patients. Clinic leads have presented the project to clinical teams and confirmed willingness of clinicians to take part.  Exclusion criteria (Aim 1): We will exclude patients (1) without capacity to consent to the project (SA) (2) with dementia, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, substance-use disorders, uncorrectable hearing or visual impairment (EMR abstraction) or a six item screener (SIS) cognitive function score ≤ 4 as this indicates significant cognitive impairment (SA); (3) living in skilled nursing homes or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_766949]-management (SA); (4) patients who have audio- recorded a clinic visit for their personal use in the previous six months (SA); (5) patients who do not have their diabetes and hypertension medication managed by [CONTACT_1003]; and (6) patients who (a) do not have access to a personal email, (b) do not have an email address shared with a family member or patient-identified caregiver, and/or (c) are not interested in creating an email account between the time they are first contact[CONTACT_766985]. The SIS of cognitive function is validated for use with older adults and highly correlated with Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Study clinicians will be notified in-person, by [CONTACT_756], or by [CONTACT_3725]-specific secure communication method of any patients with a six item screener (SIS) cognitive function score ≤ 4, in order to alert them of a potentially clinically-significant finding which may require follow up. We will exclude clinicians who (1) are trainees, e.g., medical students or residents; or (2) commonly audio or video record clinic visits for patient’s personal use.  10.2 Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria (Aim 2 Debrief Interviews) 10.2.1 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Aim 2) Patients: We will recruit a purposive sample of patient-participants from Aim 1 based on recording use (listened to none, one or all recordings; shared recording or not) and health literacy [SAHL-E score ≤14 (low health literacy) or >14 (high health literacy)].

  Caregivers: Patients will identify family members / caregivers who are 1) ≥18 years of age, 2) who can communicate in English or Spanish; and 3) have received access to the patient’s audio recordings.  Clinic staff: We will include healthcare professionals and administrators who have been involved in the trial at each site including MDs, NPs, Nursing Staff, Medical Assistants, and Administrators.  11.0 Vulnerable Populations* • N/A.  12.0 Local Number of Subjects A total of 30 patients and 6 clinicians will be recruited at each site (N=108). Based on prior work, we anticipate that a total of 60 patients will be approached to reach a sample of n=30 eligible patient participant patients at each site. Hertzog74 estimated that a sample of 10 – [ADDRESS_1051794]. With 30 patient participants and 6 clinicians per site (total sample, n=108) we will be able to estimate the operating diagnostics of a future study (e.g., retention rates) and approximate effect sizes with a satisfactory level of precision to 1) determine if a future study is feasible and 2) be able to accurately inform power and sample- size calculations for the future study. We are not powered to detect significant differences in outcomes.  13.0 Recruitment Methods  13.1 Recruitment procedures (Aim 1 Trial) Identification of participants (Aim1): A standard procedure will be enacted at all study sites. We will identify a cohort of potentially eligible patients who have planned clinic visits with study clinicians. In line with privacy guidelines we will initially use the site-specific Data Warehouse which will identify potentially eligible patients of study clinicians who meet preliminary inclusion criteria, including age (≥65 years) and diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes. Additional study data will also be extracted including: patient contact [CONTACT_3031] (name, telephone - cell and home, email address, home address), sex, primary language spoken, existing diagnoses (dementia, Alzheimer’s, Schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, substance use disorder, deaf, blind), Charlson Comorbidity Index (each condition contributing to Charlson: present/absent), number of visits to study clinician in prior 7 months, scheduled visit dates in upcoming 6 months with study clinician, and current medications. We will also

V 4.[ADDRESS_1051795] in order to generate lists of potential patients of study clinicians, and to check scheduled visits for recruited patients. A waiver of HIPAA Authorization has been applied for with the D-H Privacy Office. An RC in clinic, fluent in English (and in Spanish at our UTMB site where there is a significant portion of patients with Spanish as their preferred language), will review the scheduled appointment list for each upcoming month period from the EMR for patients who meet provisional eligibility criteria. This information will be transferred to a local REDCap Recruitment database for each site, which will only be accessible to IRB approved research staff at those sites. A list of potentially eligible patients will be sent to the study clinician for review, to ensure that they manage the patient’s hypertension and diabetes medication. The study clinician will indicate any patients who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Potentially eligible patients will receive a letter, signed by [CONTACT_137021], informing them about the project, that they may be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of a research team and offering them the opportunity to opt-out (by [CONTACT_166932]). No less than two weeks after letters have been sent, an RA will contact [CONTACT_766986]. Patients will be given a number and email address to opt out of receiving a call. For those receiving a telephone call, the RC will briefly describe the project to the patient (Appendix. 9 Telephone Patient Recruitment Script): (1) their clinic visits during the study will be audio- recorded if they are randomly allocated to the AUDIO group for 3 months, or that they will continue to receive UC (an AVS); and (2) there will be a standard follow-up assessment for all study participants via telephone call or email at 1 week, and 3 months; additionally within one- week after any scheduled visit during the 3 month study period, the Interpersonal Processes of Care (IPC) Scale will be administered. Importantly it will be emphasized that willingness to get involved in the project will not affect their care and that no providers in the clinic are opposed to their patient participation. Interested patients will be asked screening questions to establish eligibility. We will gather minimal data on patients who fail screening (demographics, eligibility criteria failed). Patients who are eligible will be asked to arrive at clinic 30 minutes before their scheduled visit and will be reminded that the early arrival will not be indicated in appointment date/time reminders or MyChart/MyDH/MyHealthAtVanderbilt appointment times. Patients will also be sent a reminder letter/email/phone call prior to their scheduled visit (Appendix 10. Appointment Reminder Letter) and will also have the opportunity to complete eConsent and baseline assessment prior to the clinic visit (see Section 22).  Identification of clinicians (Aim1). Under the guidance of our clinic leads (Raji, Hoffley, Peterson) clinicians (MDs, NPs) have demonstrated an interest in taking part inthe proposed project. Before the study commences, clinicians will receive an email fromPI [INVESTIGATOR_288019] (Appendix 21. Clinician Aim 1 Recruitment Email) and be invited to learn about the purpose of the study in a large group setting (routine conferences attended by [CONTACT_766987], fellows and

 attendings and nursing staff meetings) or one-on-one including acknowledgment of support to conduct the study from clinic leadership and the intent to audio-record and share their clinic visits with patients. An opportunity to ask and answer questions about participation in the study will be provided.  We aim to recruit a minimum of 3 - 6 clinicians prior to the initiation of patient recruitment who will participate in both arms of the study. We will document the number of providers who are offered enrollment and the number who consent to participate in audio recordings. For clinicians who decline to participate in the study, we will anonymously document reasons for their refusal in a REDCap database. At the time of enrollment, we will ask providers to provide demographic information via survey including age, sex, race, ethnicity, years in practice and specialty (Appendix.11 Clinician Demographic Survey). Clinicians who enroll in the study will be offered the opportunity to participate in a brief semi-structured interview about their experience with recording when patient enrollment is complete (Appendix 12. Clinician Interview).  13.2 Recruitment procedures (Aim 2 Debrief Interviews) All interviewees will be recruited after their involvement in Aim [ADDRESS_1051796] of the interview on outcomes. 13.2.1 Patients: We will recruit a purposive sample of patient-participants who completed research activities in Aim 1 based on audio recording use and health literacy. At T2 follow up, the RA will assess the participant’s interest in taking part in an interview about their experience with audio recordings. A list of patients who are interested will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], from which we will identify patients to interview stratified by [CONTACT_766988]. We will use the generated lists to identify potential patient interviewees. We will call by [CONTACT_766989] a letter informing them that they have been selected for an interview. If a letter is sent, it will be followed by a telephone call to confirm interest and arrange a time and place to conduct the interview(Appendix 13. Patient Interview Guide). People interested in participating will meet with the research assistant at the clinic, office, or by [CONTACT_766990] (Appendix 13b Patient Consent Form)  13.2.2 Caregivers: During telephone calls to patients from the AUDIO group, the RA will also explain that we would like to conduct interviews with caregivers who have received or listened to recordings from the patient. If the patient is willing to share the contact [CONTACT_21115] a caregiver (family member, friend) we will then contact [CONTACT_766991] a telephone call. We will inform the caregiver that the patient has given us permission to contact [CONTACT_766992]. We will generate a list of interested caregivers stratified by [CONTACT_766993].

People interested in participating will meet with the research assistant at the clinic, office, or by [CONTACT_766990] (Appendix 14b. Caregiver Consent Form). A follow up call will be conducted with all caregivers who took part in an interview in order to obtain demographic information (Appendix 33. Caregiver Demographic Script).  13.2.3 Clinical staff: Clinical staff who took part in the project will be contact[CONTACT_766994] a time convenient to them. Interested clinicians will meet with RA to complete informed consent. In all instances, participants will be offered a $30 honorarium for taking part in an interview.  14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects* Any participant can discontinue participation at any time. An investigator may also discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following reasons: 1) disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study intervention, or 2) if the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that precludes further study participation. The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study in either case will be recorded on the Participant Withdrawal Case Report Form (Appendix 15. Participant Withdrawal Form).  15.0 Risks to Subjects* The risks associated with participation in the project activities are deemed to be low and are outweighed by [CONTACT_658]. Before data collection starts, all study personnel will be required to undertake appropriate CITI coursework, including, but not limited to, HIPAA training and Good Clinical Practice. The MPIs and research staff will meet weekly by [CONTACT_577], from the time of study award, to plan protocol implementation at each site. In month six, a two-day ‘kick off’ training event will be hosted at Dartmouth College, and all study team members will join in person and/or virtually. During this training event, we will review and train research coordinators and assistants in all aspects of the study protocol including identification of patients, screening administration, recruitment and consent, survey administration and follow-up calls/emails and plans for unexpected events. Additionally, patient recruitment will not begin until the clinical trials office at each site approves the study binder containing IRB approved protocol, surveys, protocol checklists, staff training and CITI certifications, and the trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. The following sections provide a detailed overview of our specific efforts to minimize risks including risks to privacy and

 confidentiality:  1. Information on eligible patients collected at each study site prior to consent will only be shared with Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI)-trained researchers from Dartmouth College, UTMB Health and VUMC, and will be stored securely on the HIPAA-compliant REDCap database. Names and contact [CONTACT_766995], to ensure the patient is not contact[CONTACT_766996]. Following the completion of recruitment, we will immediately delete their information from the database. 2. We have consulted with research and privacy officers who have approved our proposed research, including the recording and sharing of clinic visits with patients. Patients will provide written consent for our research team to maintain a copy of all recorded clinic visits. The storage of all patient information collected for this project, including audio-recordings will be stored in HIPAA-compliant server (audio recordings), and REDCap database (all study data and audio recordings) housed in the Geisel School of Medicine, Dartmouth College. An additional copy of the study data and audio recordings may be housed securely at each participating site. 3. Steps taken to reduce the possibility of recruiting individuals with significant cognitive deficits: 1) a trained research assistant will review the medical record – individuals meeting any exclusion criteria will not receive a telephone call; 2) a trained Research Coordinator will administer a cognitive assessment using the validated Six Item Screener of Cognitive Function (SIS); and 3) the clinician may choose to exclude a patient due to significant cognitive deficits. Should a clinician choose to exclude a participating patient due to the development of significant cognitive deficit (or one of the other exclusion criteria) during the 3-month follow up, we will document this and the patient will be thanked and informed both in person and by [CONTACT_2319], that participation in the project is complete. 4. Both in-person and telehealth clinic visits in each primary care setting happen in a private room. We will place a sign on the door of the consultation room indicating a recording is currently taking place and that those who enter may be recorded (see Appendix 6. Recording Sign). At any time, the clinician or patient may choose to pause the recording. In the case a medical translator is needed to support the visit, this will be identified ahead of the patient visit by [CONTACT_21118]. The translator will be informed that the patient is participating in a research project where the clinic visit is being recorded and their consent (written or verbal) will be sought. This strategy has been used successfully at UTMB where visits at the cancer clinics are audio recorded and in our recently completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_127232]: The impact of sharing audio recorded clinic visits on self-management in older adults: a multisite trial 
V 4.[ADDRESS_1051798] not been documented during our previous studies. However, should either event occur we will follow these processes: Social media post. While the study team is not monitoring participants’ social media, in the event that the study team are informed that a patient has ‘posted’ an audio-recording created for the proposed study on a social media website the patient will be asked to remove the post by [CONTACT_3476]. We will also inform our IRB, risk management at the clinic site and the participating clinician. Refusal to remove the recording from social media may result in the participant’s administrative removal from the study. Legal proceeding. Should the study team be informed that a recording has become part of the legal proceeding, we will also inform our IRB, risk management at the clinic site and the participating clinician. This would lead to administrative removal of the participant from the study 6. Patients who have consented to take part in the study will be assigned a unique study identification number. All data collected from participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_766997]. This will minimize risks regarding breach of confidentiality with respect to the study data. The link between each study identification number and participant name [CONTACT_7637] a password-protected file on a password protected computer. 7. Printed forms with identifiable patient data, e.g. signed consent forms and medical releases of information, will be stored in separate file folders in locked filing cabinets at the offices of the project coordinator of each clinic site. 8. All digital data, including audio-recordings (clinic visits and debrief interviews),will be stored in secure, password-protected computer files on a password- protected computer, or in a HIPAA-compliant database. 9. No medical records or protected health information shall be re- disclosed, unless required by [CONTACT_2371]. 10. De-identified data will be stored in the Dartmouth Dataverse, and available, upon request, to the broader research community and appropriate IRB approval; approval to use data in for this purpose will be included in the consent forms. 11. The entire research team will complete confidentiality training.

 16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects* Participants who are randomly assigned to the AUDIO arm will have immediate post- visit access to audio-recordings of their clinical visits, evidence suggests such access may enhance understanding and recall of health care information. We hypothesize that patient will also be better able to manage their health due to recording access. While patients in the control group will not receive a recording, they will benefit from knowing that findings from this research may benefit future patients like themselves. The inclusion of older adult patients with a complex condition, who are often excluded from trials, is also a benefit, as patients may enjoy the opportunity to take part in research. As such, we believe the risks to research participants about potential loss of confidential information, which we will take rigorous precautions to avoid (see Protection Against Risks), are outweighed by [CONTACT_766998]-management, and satisfaction with care, for both participants and the larger population of older adults with diabetes, hypertension, and complex multimorbid conditions more broadly.  17.0 Data Analysis, Management and Confidentiality 17.1 Data analysis plan (Aim 1 Trial) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_766950]. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_766951]. We will focus on the feasibility of study processes, resources, and study management, concurrent adaptations to the trial protocol as needed. We will review data weekly, and determine the need to make adjustments to the trial (in accordance with the current IRB policies regarding amendments to protocols). We will also gather preliminary data on the impact of the AUDIO intervention on: self- management ability at 3 months as measured by [CONTACT_33745]-Short Form (PAM-SF), interpersonal processes of care in the visit (Interpersonal Processes of Care Scale), patient satisfaction (PSQ-18), treatment adherence (Medical Outcomes Study, General Adherence survey; ARMS-7), physical and mental functioning (PROMIS 10), quality of life (EURO-QOL), quality of diabetes and hypertension care (EMR abstraction), number of clinic contacts e.g., phone calls, patient portal messages (EMR abstraction), ER visits (EMR abstraction) and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (EMR abstraction). We will also explore whether the impact of audio recording is greater for individuals at highest risk of poor self-management including those with low health literacy (Short Assessment of Health Literacy), moderate to severe depression (PHQ-8) or anxiety (GAD-7), high perceived stigma and high disease burden (Charlson Co-Morbidity Index), or by [CONTACT_400581], race or ethnicity. As such our analysis consists principally of descriptive statistics.  17.1.1 Feasibility (Aim 1.1) 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The impact of sharing audio recorded clinic visits on self-management in older adults: a multisite trial 
V 4.6  29June2022 Page 32 of 53  
 We will determine the optimal strategy to achieve a high retention rate and adherence to the study protocol. We will also assess retention rates (proportion of included patients completing T2 follow up; we will target >70% retention), the Feasibility of Intervention Measure (4 items; we will target an average score of >3), and high fidelity to the study protocol (Borelli et al48 criteria). Reasons for low-recruitment rates (e.g., eligibility criteria restrictions, participant refusal (and reason why, if available), and losses to follow-up) will be gathered as part of the fidelity checklist. If we fall short of targeted thresholds, we will determine the need for deviations from the existing study protocol. We will also gather data on management resources required to conduct the trial i.e., time required to recruit participants, and field notes on any idiosyncratic issues that arise at each site that will be documented and reported to site PIs.  17.1.2 Acceptability (Aim 1.2) Assessing the proportion of patients and clinicians who agree to take part in the project and proportion of patients who listen to the recording (we will target >70%). Our primary indicator of acceptability will be the recruitment of 108 participants (n=30 patients and 6 clinicians per site) over our planned data collection period of six months. We will determine the listening rates (we will target >70%): this will include the proportion of patients in the intervention arm that log in to the online system and listen to (and how often) the recording. We will also document the number of patients who share or report sharing the recording and caregivers who access the recording. Finally, participants will complete the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (4 items; target an average score of >3). If we fall short of targeted thresholds, we will determine the need for deviations from the existing study protocol. We will contact [CONTACT_766999], outside of the standard follow-up assessments to determine if changes are required to the intervention delivery.  17.1.3 Exploratory outcomes (Aim 1.3) Compared to those receiving UC, patients randomized to also receive audio recordings (AUDIO) of clinic visits will report a greater self-management ability (PAM-SF) at [ADDRESS_1051799] of audio recordings on patients’ self-management. While we are not powered to test this primary hypothesis in the current project, our analytic strategy will enable us to gather crucial preliminary data on the potential effectiveness of AUDIO, preliminary data on mediators and moderators of the AUDIO intervention and refinements to the study protocol that may be required.52,[ADDRESS_1051800] protected from bias due to erroneous modeling assumptions in comparing the AUDIO and UC groups. We later describe more nuanced analyses to allow for problems such as non- compliance, that can enable more statistical power by [CONTACT_767000] a longitudinal series (including control for the baseline value of the outcome) as opposed

V 4.[ADDRESS_1051801] cross-sections, as well as the analyses for the exploratory outcomes.  Because patients’ AUDIO status varies within clinician, our statistical analysis of the PAM-SF score at 3 months’ accounts for any dependence of the outcomes due to clinician within site effects. Therefore, to maximally benefit from the randomization of patients in physicians and generalize our results to a broader population, we will use a mixed-effect regression model of the form: 𝑌𝑖𝑗	= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑗	+ 𝛽2𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑗	+ 𝛽3𝐴𝑢𝑑𝑖𝑜𝑖𝑗	+ 𝜃𝑗	+ 𝜀𝑖𝑗	(1) where denotes the outcome (e.g., PAM-SF score) for the ith patient treated by [CONTACT_767001]; and are indicator variables of whether clinician j is at D-H or VUMC, respectively, versus the UTMB; is the i’th patient’s AUDIO status; is assumed to be a normally distributed random effect for clinician j; and is the idiosyncratic (or pure) error term. Although the data are clustered within study site, we will model study site as a random variable because with only three sites the estimated variance of any site effect would be unstable. The key parameter of interest is, the effect of AUDIO on the outcome—a positive value implies that being assigned to AUDIO increases PAM-SF compared to what it would have been under UC.  We will also explore the impact of AUDIO to UC on the interpersonal processes of care in the visit, patient satisfaction, adherence, physical and mental functioning, quality of life, quality of diabetes and hypertension care, number of clinic contacts, emergency room (ER) visits, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. Linear regression models analogous to the model in (1) will be used to estimate the effect of AUDIO versus UC alone on exploratory outcomes with continuous scales. These outcomes include clinic visit experience (Interpersonal Processes of Care), GLOBAL PROMIS (mental and physical functioning), patient satisfaction (PSQ-18), EURO-QOL measures and quality of diabetes and hypertension care. For the binary-valued outcome of general treatment adherence, and the non-negative count outcomes (phone calls, ER visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), we will replace the linear model specification in (1) with the analogous logistic and Poisson (or negative-binomial) generalized linear mixed models, respectively.  17.1.4 Deviation from protocol: Patients assigned to AUDIO, and possibly also to UC, can deviate from the protocol under their assigned study group (e.g., AUDIO patients failing to receive a recording and UC patients who start recording and listening to their visits), the instrumental variable (IV) counterpart of the analysis of the model in (1) estimates the quantity, where is the proportion of compliers (patients who would listen to the audio recording if assigned to the AUDIO group but not otherwise). We will use the proportion of patients assigned to AUDIO who self-report that they did not receive a recording to estimate the quantity, the proportion of refusers, and the proportion of 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The impact of sharing audio recorded clinic visits on self-management in older adults: a multisite trial 
V 4.[ADDRESS_1051802] described proportions being substituted on the right-hand-side. This procedure corresponds to substituting the estimated value of for in (1) as the resulting model can be seen as the second-stage of the two-stage least squares procedure adapted to a mixed-effect outcome model.  17.1.5 Longitudinal use of recordings: Another extension of our basic analysis will be to analyze the data from the two follow-up time periods (T1–T2) simultaneously using a longitudinal model. An advantage of this analysis is that it allows the form of the trajectory of the outcome variable over the follow-up time (e.g., is it constant, does it have an initial rise at T1 and then decline, does it grow with time) to be compared to a null model having a constant effect. This analysis provides a more powerful test of the effect of AUDIO than a cross-sectional comparison. In both the cross-sectional analyses of the outcome at a single follow-up time and the longitudinal analyses, the inclusion of the baseline (T0) value of the outcome variable as a covariate and/or making the difference in the outcome between Tk (k = 1, 2) and T0 as the outcome are alternative analyses. Because our study is randomized, it is not necessary to include the outcome variable at T0 as a covariate from a bias standpoint, yet, doing so may improve the precision of our results. The chosen strategy will depend on the extent to which the baseline and follow-up outcomes cluster within patients. If clustering is high (e.g., intra- class correlation coefficient > 0.5) we will include the T0 value of the outcome variable as a covariate.  17.1.6 Overall Predictiveness, Direction of Causality and Meditator Role of PAM-SF: We first want to explore (i) whether self-management (PAM-SF), affects the exploratory (health) outcomes. We will then perform mediation analyses to decompose the overall effect of AUDIO into its indirect, or mediated, component that acts through PAM-SF and the direct component that affects the health outcomes independently of PAM-SF. With the availability of longitudinal data (1 week, and 3-months) we have the capability of regressing each health outcome on the lagged value of PAM-SF. The analyses in (i) will be performed by [CONTACT_767002]-SF as a predictor variable and removing the intervention indicator variables from the statistical models used to analyze the health outcomes. Using the product of coefficients method,[ADDRESS_1051803] of the mediator (PAM-SF) on a given health outcome is estimated in a second regression model that also conditions on the AUDIO intervention. The product of the two coefficients corresponding to these effects is the mediation (or indirect) effect of the intervention on the outcome via the mediator while the coefficient for the AUDIO effect is in the latter regression and represents the direct effect of AUDIO. Standard errors will be evaluated using the bootstrap76 or the PRODCLIN program.77 A new body

 of research clarifies sequential ignorability and other assumptions required to obtain causal estimates of mediation effects in randomized studies.78–81 In addition to basic exploratory analyses, we will incorporate these new methods of performing mediation analysis into our analyses.  17.1.7 Missing data analysis: We will use multiple imputation to cope with missing baseline, interim, and outcome data, protecting our results from bias against all forms of missing data that are classed as missing-at-random.[ADDRESS_1051804] and report all reasons for dropout and missing data for data-handling checks and to gauge the justifiability of the missing-at-random assumption. We will examine sensitivity of inferences to data missing-not-at-random specified based on information from the reasons for missing data we obtain.  17.1.8 Moderator analyses: To explore whether patient health literacy is a modifying factor of the effect of audio on the patient-reported ability to self-manage their care, we add health literacy (denoted HlthLit in the statistical model in (2) and abbreviated as HL) as a main and an interaction variable with AUDIO to the model in (1) to obtain the interaction-effect model: 𝑌𝑖𝑗	= 𝛽0 + 𝛽1𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑗	+ 𝛽2𝑉𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑗	+ 𝛽4𝐻𝑙𝑡ℎ𝐿𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑗	+ (𝛽3 + 𝛽5𝐻𝑙𝑡ℎ𝐿𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑗)𝐴𝑢𝑑𝑖	+ + where quantifies the extent to which the patient’s HL modifies the effect of AUDIO on PAM-SF. A in (2) implies that the effect of AUDIO is lower in patients with high HL and higher in patients with low HL. We will also explore whether the impact of audio recording is greater for individuals at highest risk of poor self-management including those with moderate to severe depression and high disease burden. The variables described for the exploratory analyses will be analyzed using the model in (2) to form an analogous series of secondary and extended analyses for depression, anxiety, stigma and disease burden. Furthermore, we will examine whether 1) the presence of a caregiver or 2) sharing information (recording or AVS) with a caregiver moderates the impact of audio on PAM-SF. We will repeat these analyses to explore interaction effects by [CONTACT_4321], race and ethnicity (Sex as a Biological variable), reporting interaction size and statistical significance.  17.1.9 Appropriateness of Study Design: The use of patient level randomization greatly 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The impact of sharing audio recorded clinic visits on self-management in older adults: a multisite trial 
V 4.[ADDRESS_1051805] a randomized block design. This allows analyses for site and clinician to be control variables whose inclusion sharpens the precision of our inferences, which are determined primarily off variation within clinician and site  17.1.10 Appropriateness of Sample Size and Analysis: Hertzog74 estimated that a sample of 10 – [ADDRESS_1051806]. With 30 patient participants and 6 clinicians per site (total sample, N=108) we will be able to estimate the operating diagnostics of a future study (e.g., retention rates) and approximate effect sizes with a satisfactory level of precision to 1) determine if a future study is feasible and 2) be able to accurately inform power and sample-size calculations for a future trial. We are not powered to detect significant differences in outcomes.  17.2 Qualitative Data analysis plan (Aim 2 debrief interviews) Content analysis will be used to code and analyze qualitative data, informed by [CONTACT_767003], and guided by a consensual approach.84 [CONTACT_212893]- Song will oversee key stages (e.g. development and application of code book, creation of memos and themes) to ensure rigor of the process and increase the validity of findings. All interviews will be transcribed using a HIPAA compliant medical transcription company and de-identified transcripts will be imported to NVIVO which has a CFIR constructs coding template. RCs at each site will independently review and code the same transcripts, one from each stakeholder group, using the CFIR constructs. Codes will be developed in a manner similar to the “template approach” using a priori domains from CFIR and additional categories that emerge from inductive review of transcripts and field notes.85 Coded data will be aggregated and reviewed within and across codes. Coders will meet by [CONTACT_767004], discuss disagreements, and settle on a final codebook with definitions and examples. To ensure consistent application of the codebook, coders will independently review every fourth transcript from another site and compare codes. Based on aggregated codes, summary memos will be created using the CFIR constructs and organized into a matrix of barriers/facilitators (major/minor) by [CONTACT_767005]. We will adhere to the Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research (COREQ) checklist.86

  17.3 Data security: Our research team is experienced in training, instrument construction, editing, and data management. We will use the same procedures for data acquisition and management used in prior studies, including: (1) a common core of initial and refresher training for the research team; (2) continuous team feedback to the site; and (3) final data editing and management at our institute, The Dartmouth Institute, Lebanon, NH. 17.3.1 Training: All members of the research team and clinic staff will be trained in the study protocol and will have completed appropriate CITI training. The MPIs and research staff will meet weekly by [CONTACT_767006], from the time of study award, to plan protocol implementation at each site. Additionally, in month 6, a two-day ‘kick off’ training event will be hosted at Dartmouth College, and all study team members will join in person and/or virtually. During this training event, we will review and train research coordinators and assistants in all aspects of the study protocol including identification of patients, screening administration, recruitment and consent, survey administration and follow-up calls and plans for unexpected events. All RAs and site leads/coordinators will receive training in the identification, recruitment, consent, intervention and assessment administration. Training will involve role-play and feedback, as well as pi[INVESTIGATOR_766952]. 17.3.2 Protocol Adherence: A fidelity checklist will be used (see Appendix. [ADDRESS_1051807]) to ensure the standard delivery and receipt of the audio recording. RAs will complete the checklist during initial recruitment and interim follow-up visits, documenting deviations from protocol and reasons. Site PIs will administer the fidelity checklist on 10% of the sample (approximately 3 patients per site), checking for 1) protocol adherence and 2) high agreement between their fidelity assessment and the RAs. Deviations from the protocol will be reported to the PIs and a mitigation plan developed during the weekly PI [CONTACT_109406]. Participants from all sites will be given the option to contact [CONTACT_440434]-Hitchcock Health (D-HH) Human Research Protection Program (HRPP), if they are dissatisfied or concerned about any aspect of the project; this information will be shared in the consent form.  We will use a direct-entry of data collected to a HIPAA compliant web-based system for data collection, REDCap, at all study sites during the trial for both in-clinic and telephone outcome assessments. This system provides entry validation range tests for all fields, as well as default (missing) values. All study data will be identified only with study ID numbers. The database will be protected by [CONTACT_767007]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_766953], where all study data will be held, carried out by [CONTACT_65460] (e.g. extent of missing data). Prior to analyses, data will be exported from the entry database into statistical analysis packages (e.g.,

V 4.6  29June2022 Page 38 of 53  
 Stata, SPSS, R) with complete labeling intact (variable names, variable labels, value labels, and missing value declarations). All clinic recordings will be labeled by [CONTACT_61212]. In all Aims participant identification numbers will be a sequential series (e.g., 1001, 1002, 1003) and the crosswalk to the participants’ names will be kept separate from data and in a password-protected, encrypted file on a password-protected, HIPAA-compliant, secure server to which only the research team will have access, behind a restrictive firewall. To maximize data capture, patients can choose to complete baseline assessment using a paper form. These forms will be labeled with a patient unique identifier and entered immediately into REDCap by [CONTACT_21118].  17.4 Health Information Sharing and Security: An AVS will be offered to patients per the usual practice at their clinic, either printed or via the patient portal. Audio-recordings will be made available in via a HIPAA-compliant website developed for a related project, requiring a participant- specific username [CONTACT_2383], which will be shared with patients on a paper card and by [CONTACT_6968]. The web platform for recorded visits also provides a solution for patients to share their clinic visit information with their family and caregivers using a secure web application. This data-sharing mechanism will enable patients to share specific or all existing/incoming clinic visit recordings with another individual. The selected individual would receive an invite to the web platform through an email provided by [CONTACT_102], and is required to register in our web application to have access to the visit recordings. Data- access privileges can be revoked by [CONTACT_13935], or study team, at any time. All patient data will be encrypted in a database residing within a Virtual Private Cloud which itself is within Dartmouth’s domain on Amazon Web Services. Data will be managed in accordance with privacy and security policies that are consistent with the HealthCare Information Security and Privacy Practitioner Standards. All communication with the platform’s servers will also be encrypted. See Appendix 5 for further information regarding the study’s server infrastructure and security-related practices. 17.5 Data quality: Data quality is the responsibility of the research staff at the site under the supervision of the site PI. The RC, under the supervision of the site PI, is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported. Data, both clinical and patient reported assessments, will be directly entered into case report forms developed using REDCap. Separate Case Report Forms will be created for Screening data (including demographics); assessment (baseline(T0), T1, T2,); and intervention use. The data system includes password protection and internal quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents (EMR). Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system (REDCap) and data quality control checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be

 communicated to the site(s) by [CONTACT_767008]/resolution, and reported to PIs and Trial Steering Committee.  Any Quality Control issues arising from this monitoring will be reported by [CONTACT_767009] [INVESTIGATOR_766954]. Action (further training, protocol change) will be considered, and if a protocol change is deemed necessary, it will be reported to the study Funder and IRB of Record. The investigational site will also provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_767010], if required.  18.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects* Strategies to monitor, track and retain participants will be based on the research team’s experiences of successfully conducting multi-site trials with older adults in primary care and guidance outlined by [CONTACT_709957].87 Recruitment and Retention will be monitored by [CONTACT_534287], who will monitoring of enrollment, tracking of participants and retention of participants in REDCap across all sites. Reasons for loss (e.g., refusal, change in provider, death) to follow-up will be documented by [CONTACT_17033], reported to the Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318], and discussed at weekly PI [INVESTIGATOR_766955], where mitigation plans will be considered.  While psychiatric or medical emergencies are very unlikely, they may be disclosed by [CONTACT_767011]. As such we have developed procedures for responding to psychiatric and medical emergencies and elevated levels of depression and anxiety, described in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (see Appendix 17. DSMP). In any such case, the research assistant will follow up with the clinical team within 7 days to determine the patients continued involvement in the trial and document the outcome of the event.  18.1 Monitoring enrollment: Enrollment will be closely monitored on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_63689]-site research assistant and reported to the PIs and coordinators. The research assistant will review the electronic medical record (EMR) and calculate 1) the number of eligible patients scheduled to visit the clinic; 2) the proportion of eligible patients scheduled in the previous week who were successfully contact[CONTACT_767012] 3) the proportion of patients who met with the research assistant and consented to take part in the project. Should the proportion of patients contact[CONTACT_767013] (2) or proportion who agree to meet with the research assistant in-clinic and consent to take part drop below 60% the Site PI (Barr, Cavanaugh, Masel) will visit the clinic to observe study recruitment (both telephone call to invite patients to learn more about the project and in-

 clinic consent). We will provide regular feedback on recruitment numbers to clinicians and clinic staff involved in the project, as well as weekly reports at the Steering Committee meetings.  18.2 Tracking of participants. The RA will review the EMR of participants and document in REDCap, scheduled patient visits (up to six months from recruitment). An RA will attend all scheduled visits of patients in the AUDIO group, to assist with recording visits as described above. Each Monday the RA will review the schedule of participating clinicians to confirm returning patients appointments. We will also use a tracking system within the EMR to alert the RA when a patient has scheduled a new appointment, which will be checked weekly by [CONTACT_21118]. 18.[ADDRESS_1051808] retention. 1) The RA will review the EMR of participants and document in REDCap, scheduled patient visits (up to six months from recruitment); 2) patients will receive a tailored schedule, based on their preferences, of days and times that are best for follow up telephone calls; 3) patients visiting the clinic within one-week of a planned follow-up assessment (T1, T2) will be met by [CONTACT_767014]; 4) patients on the UC arm may be met in clinic by [CONTACT_767015]; 5) patients will provide the contact [CONTACT_21115] a family member or caregiver who could be contact[CONTACT_767016] 6) patients will receive reminder letters a week prior to scheduled outcome assessments and 7) Breuton et al.[ADDRESS_1051809] of increasing participant retention. Patients will receive honorariums to promote retention; a thank you note (Appendix 20. Patient Participant Thank You Note) will be mailed with $30 (gift card or site-specific payment method such as Greenphire) following recruitment and $20 (gift card or site-specific payment method such as Greenphire) upon completion of each follow-up assessment.  18.[ADDRESS_1051810] (DSMB). A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be appointed to provide additional oversight of the trial and will meet prior to recruitment to review the study protocol, Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP; see Appendix 17), DSMB Charter (see Appendix 18) and at the end of data collection. PIs will attend these meetings, with minutes documented and any recommendations documented. Minutes and recommendations will be shared with the trial steering committee. The DSMB will consist of four members identified through the NIA standard approval process. The DSMB will then meet by [CONTACT_767017] (approximately every 6 - 9 months). The DSMB will review enrollment and attrition rates and advise the PIs on any potential risks as well as on any risk mitigation plans. The DSMB recommendations will be discussed with the PIs as well as the Steering Committee. All data will be reviewed for protocol adherence, including a data verification check that the appropriate outcome measures are given at

V 4.[ADDRESS_1051811] any Serious Adverse Events (SAE) or Adverse Events (AE) in the trial that would require immediate reporting since there are no invasive procedures related to the interventions. If for any reason an SAE, AE or unanticipated problem were to occur, the DSMB would be immediately notified, as well as the sIRB at Dartmouth. The DSMB would convene by [CONTACT_767018] 72 hours and immediately review the Serious Adverse Events/Adverse Events and determine if in any way they were related to the research study. If an SAE or AE occur, a full review would be performed by [CONTACT_7676], Steering Committee and the DSMB.  19.[ADDRESS_1051812], to plan protocol implementation at each site. In month 6, a two-day ‘kick off’ training event will be hosted at Dartmouth College, and all study team members will join. During this training event, we will review and train research coordinators and assistants in all aspects of the study protocol including identification of patients, screening administration, recruitment and consent, survey administration and follow-up calls and plans for unexpected events. Additionally, patient recruitment will not begin until IRB approval is gained protocol, staff training occurs (including CITI certifications), and the trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. We have extensive experience recruiting patients on to clinical trials and other projects. Participants will initially be contact[CONTACT_61936] a letter signed by [CONTACT_767019] (Appendix 8. Recruitment Letter). Patients will then be contact[CONTACT_48671] a member of the research team to further inform them about the research project and assess their interest in joining (Appendix 9. Telephone Patient Recruitment Script). This strategy was recommended by [CONTACT_767020] ‘decline’ participation in a study when speaking with a member of a research team vs. speaking with a clinician or member of the clinical team. Interested patients will arrive at the clinic early to allow time to complete consent processes and baseline assessment in an unhurried fashion. They will be informed of the data that is required (see 22.0 Consent Process) and will provide consent for the research team to access this data. They will be reassured that their data will be handled in confidence and maintained privately, and that neither their clinician or clinical team will have access to study data. Clear information will be provided on the study follow up schedule. Patients will be reminded that at any time, including after they leave the clinic, they can request to be removed from the project.  20.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury ● N/A

The eConsent will consist of the same, age-appropriate materials as in- person consent (described below). Patients will be instructed to review the eConsent. Participants will have the ability to move forward or backward on the eConsent form as needed prior to completing consent. A short quiz to confirm patient understanding of the project will be completed electronically as part of the eConsent process - this is a common step in eConsent processes (Appendix 23. eConsent Comprehension Quizzes). Contact [CONTACT_767021]. Participants will also have the option to provide the name [CONTACT_767036] a friend or family member who they involve in their care and would be willing to share their recording with. Those who complete eConsent will leave a digital signature; they will be emailed a copy of their signed eConsent form and will also be offered a mailed paper copy of the consent form. Participant and study staff signatures on the eConsent may have different dates, as participants may sign during non-business hours. Study staff will sign the eConsent electronically as soon as feasible after participant completion. Participants will also receive an email asking them to attend clinic 30 minutes early on the day of the research if they would prefer to complete pre-visit surveys in person rather than electronically. On the day of the visit, a member of the research team will meet with the participant, either in person or by [CONTACT_756]/web conference, and proceed with study procedures.  In-person consent: For participant who prefer to complete consent in clinic, they will be met by [CONTACT_767022]. A member of the registration staff may also receive a list of patients who have agreed to learn more about the project, to facilitate a warm hand-off of patients to the RA. Patients will join the RA in a private room/area where they will confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria with the patient. This will be done using a short, standardized screening form. Once it is determined that the

 participant meets all study criteria, the RA will review the consent form (Appendix 13b. Patient Consent Form), stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_766956]. During consent, patients will review the information discussed during the initial phone call (see above). All consenting patients will agree to best practice when using recordings. While sharing access to caregivers is allowed, we will request patients do not share the audio-recording on social media (this will be clearly stated on the informed consent form). In our experience of implementing recording in clinical practice and studying clinics that offer recordings, social media posting of recordings has not been documented. Patients will also be told that they can start, stop, and/or delete recordings at any time during the clinic visit. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The patient will also have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The patient will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. Patients will be informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the patients for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the date), and the form signed, before the patients undergoes any study- specific procedures. The rights and welfare of the patients will be protected by [CONTACT_34693]. The RA should scan the consent form to the participant’s medical record and create a consent note in eDH using the study smartphrase (Appendix 22. Audio Trial Smartphrase for EMR). Should the patient be accompanied to the clinic visit by a caregiver (family member, friend or other person who assists the patient with their care) they will also accompany the patient and RA if the patient wishes. 22.1.2 Clinicians (Aim1). Clinicians who are interested in taking part will be invited to complete informed consent (Appendix 11b. Clinician Consent Form) and a brief demographic survey (see Appendix 11. Clinician Demographic Survey) with a member of the research team after the conference in a private room, by [CONTACT_767023]. Interested clinicians who are not present at the recruitment conference(s) and who respond to recruitment emails will be offered an appointment with a research assistant during business hours to review informed consent and enroll in the study, or can complete eConsent via email. Clinicians will have the ability to move forward or backward on the eConsent form as needed prior to completing consent. A short comprehension quiz will be administered electronically as part of the eConsent process; all questions must be answered correctly to determine understanding of key study procedures (Appendix 23. eConsent Comprehension Quizzes).

A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the clinicians for their records. The informed consent process will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the date), and the form signed, or electronic signature, prior to the beginning of recruitment.  Family members & caregivers/companions (Aim1). As patients are the focus of the project we will initially identify, inform and consent patients. To be eligible, patients must meet inclusion / exclusion criteria and be able to provide consent independently. If a family member is present, we will provide them with study information upon patient consent, including whether the patient has been randomized to the AUDIO arm and explain that patients in the AUDIO arm will have their scheduled visits with this clinician audio recorded and shared for the patient’s personal use during the study period (3 months). As such the caregiver or family member will be aware that recording is taking place at the visits. At each visit, the research assistant will remind accompanying caregivers or family members that the patient has consented for the visit to be audio recorded. It is important to note that patients will always be able to pause or stop a recording of the visit, and we plan to document such instances on our fidelity checklist. Family or other members may elect to not be in the visit room, and this will be documented. This approach was developed after careful discussion with clinic risk management, clinicians, patients and caregiver partners. It also reduces selection bias issues as the alternative approach of consenting accompanying family members or caregivers may impact the patient’s decision to participate or not. This strategy has also been approved and successfully used in a prior project by [CONTACT_767025] (STUDY00031211).  22.1.3 Certified Translators (Aim1). In the case a medical translator is needed to support the visit, this will be identified ahead of the patient visit by [CONTACT_21118]. The translator will be informed that the patient is participating in a research project where the clinic visit is being recorded and their consent (written or verbal) will be sought. This strategy has been used successfully at UTMB where visits at the cancer clinics are audio recorded. In the unlikely situation that a translator is uncomfortable, a new translator for the patient will be sought prior to the visit. Additionally, all study materials will be translated using a certified translation service, the Spanish Group LLC (Irvine, CA). The Spanish Group offer Certification by [CONTACT_767026]. All interactions with Spanish speaking participants will be conducted by [CONTACT_767027]. Upon IRB approval of the English protocol, we will submit Spanish language versions of all study materials via a modification prior to commencing patient recruitment.

  22.2 Consent Process (Aim 2 Debrief interviews) Consent procedures will be similar across all groups and will be as follows: Individuals interested in participating by [CONTACT_767028], complete eConsent via REDCap at home, schedule a time to complete consent and interview in the future, or make an appointment to meet the RA for the consent process at the clinic location. A waiver of written documentation of consent will be requested for participants who prefer to conduct interviews by [CONTACT_756] (Appendix 19. Waiver Alteration Request Form). Verbal consent will be documented and a copy of the informed consent form by [CONTACT_2319], or email; we have successfully adopted this strategy in similar minimal risk studies previously. The informed consent form will be reviewed with all potential participants, informing them about the goals of the study, the nature of the information collected. Throughout this process, potential participants will be encouraged to ask any questions they may have about the study. Participants will be reassured that all information exchange will be held in confidence and not shared beyond the study team or noted HIPAA compliant transcription service. Additionally, participants will not be identified in any presentation or publications related to the work. Once they have had all their questions answered and have had the opportunity to fully review the informed consent form, if applicable, those who wish to take part in the study will be asked to provide written or verbal informed consent. All signed consent forms if available, will be stored securely in locked cabinets at each study site and collected monthly by [CONTACT_65460]. Audio-recorded consent will be uploaded to REDCap by [CONTACT_767029], managed by [CONTACT_65460]. 23.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing Aim1. Informed consent will be documented in writing or by [CONTACT_767030] 1. The process of documentation is described above (section 22). All Consent documentation will be stored securely in 1) locked cabinets at each study site 2) on REDCap. While we will attempt to gather written informed consent for Aim 2 debrief interviews, a waiver of written informed consent will be an option for those participants who would prefer to complete consent over the telephone.  24.0 Setting  We will identify and recruit participants from three sites: Dartmouth-Hitchcock Primary Care (D-H; Manchester, NH and Bedford,NH), Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC; Nashville, TN), and University of [LOCATION_007] Medical Branch, (UTMB; Galveston, TX and League City,TX). The Dartmouth- Hitchcock Human Research Protection Program (HRRP) IRB will serve as the IRB of record. All sites have agreed to rely on

V 4.[ADDRESS_1051813].  25.0 Resources Available We are confident we can recruit the necessary number of patients at each site. D-H offers primary and specialty-care services, with 35 primary care clinicians, where in 2017, there were 1,144 unique patients ≥[ADDRESS_1051814] 2 visits in the preceding 7 months, with only 7% cancellations. Like the geographic region it serves, the D-H clinic population is predominantly white, non-Hispanic (94%). The VUMC Adult Primary Care consists of two sites located on the VUMC campus; and two sites in the community. These four clinics are staffed by > 59 attending physicians. In 2017, they saw 1,500 unique patients ≥65 with multimorbidity. UTMB clinics are staffed by 11 attending clinicians, with 1,805 unique patients aged ≥[ADDRESS_1051815] over the course of several presentations at standing clinical team meetings and one-on-one meetings with participating clinicians.  26.0 Multi-Site Research*  This is a multi-site study that will involve 3 sites and a total of 30 patients and 6 clinicians recruited per site for a study total of N=108 participants (90 patients and 18 clinicians). All procedures (identification, recruitment, consent, data collection) described above will be followed at each site. REDCap will be used to gather, share and store data securely, across all sites.  Weekly meetings will be planned between the MPIs (Barr, Dartmouth; Cavanaugh, VUMC; and Masel, UTMB).  26.[ADDRESS_1051816]: administrative, technical and scientific.

D-HH IRB Approved Effective Date: 9/14/[ADDRESS_1051833] and what will I need to do? We expect that you will be in this research study for 3 months. You will be asked to complete surveys at: (1) your next doctor’s visit, (2) 1 week after your doctor’s visit, and (3) 3 months after your doctor’s visit. The surveys include questions about you, how you manage your health, and your care experience. A computer will decide which of two groups you will be part of for the study. If you are in the usual care group, you will receive information from your doctor’s visit as normal. If you are in the audio-recording group, we will audio record any of your planned office visits with your doctor/nurse who is taking part in this research for 3 months. More detailed information about the study procedures can be found under “What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?” Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me? We do not believe there are any physical, legal, social, or economic risks from taking part in this study. More detailed information about the risks of this study can be found under “Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me? (Detailed Risks)” Will being in this study help me in any way? We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, the study may result in better memory and understanding of your doctor’s visit. This may help you better manage your health conditions. Additionally, if we understand more about the use audio-recordings in doctor’s visits, we may be able to develop better ways of communicating medical information for patients and caregivers. What happens if I do not want to be in this research study? Participation in research is completely voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate. Your alternative to participating in this research study is to not participate.

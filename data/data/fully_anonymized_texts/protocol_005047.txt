Cryovagotomy Trial

 2 I. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE AND PURPOSE : 33 
Obesity is a growing epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], currently affecting over 1/3 of the adult US population1 and is a 34 
well-established risk factor for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.2 Given 35 
that the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are obese, weight loss is the cornerstone 36 
of treatment, and has been shown to decrease risk of long term complications3, lead to 37 
improvements in A1c and lipid levels4,5, as well as decreased need for medications and 38 
improvements in quality of life6. Unfortunately, lifestyle intervention is often ineffective at 39 
achieving long- term sustainable, clinically significant weight loss7. Bariatric surgery is a 40 
successful intervention, leading to 20 -30% weight loss with remission of diabetes in 30 -65% of [ADDRESS_1118473] surgery8,9. However, this invasive procedure is associated with high rates 42 
of short- and long- term complications, including need for reoperations, vitamin/mineral [ADDRESS_1118474] on average 8.8% of total body weight at 1 year; patients with T2D experienced 54 
improved glycemic control, with an average A1c improvement of 1.0% at 12 months14. 55 
Unfortunately, nearly 40% of subjects experienced side effects related to the device15. A recent 56 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_808926] (see preliminary results) reported weight loss [ADDRESS_1118475] 5.6% of total body weight and 22.7% excess body weight at [ADDRESS_1118476] of weight loss on diabetes control and complications: Over 12% of adults in the 65 
United State s are affected by [CONTACT_24975] 2 diabetes (T2D), the majority (>90%) of whom are 66 
overweight or obese. Weight loss, through lifestyle intervention, medications or bariatric 67 
surgery, is recommended for all overweight/obese individuals with T2D. Patients who are able  to 68 
achieve >5% weight loss at [ADDRESS_1118477] shown that long- term maintenance of weight loss is 73 
tremendously difficult19,20. 74 
 75 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 3 Current weight management options: medication and bariatric surg ery: Weight loss 76 
medication and bariatric surgery are approved when adequate weight loss is not achieved with 77 
lifestyle interventions alone. Medications lead to clinically significant weight loss of >5% in 78 
approximately 50% of patients for whom they are prescribed, while the other half have 79 
suboptimal weight response21. Furthermore, weight loss effects are durable only while patients 80 
take the medications, with regain after cessation of drug therapy22. Bariatric surgery has proven 81 
superior efficacy over lifestyle interventions with regards to weight management, diabetes 82 
remission and reduction of comorbidities8,23. However, due to the invasive nature of surgery, 83 
concerns about long- term complications, and limited p atient access to accredited centers, 84 
bariatric surgery is underutilized. Up to 5% of patients experience a surgical complication 85 
following the procedure24, and rates of vitamin and mineral deficiency can reach >60%25. As 86 
such, options for long- term effective weight loss are limited and alternative strategies are needed 87 
to improve outcomes for obese patients. 88 
 89 
Gut-brain axis is an important regulator of diet induced obesity: In a lean, healthy milieu, [ADDRESS_1118478] system28. In the setting of chronic overeating and 93 
obesity, the release of satiety -inducing neuropeptides is decreased, while orexigenic signaling 94 
(hunger promoting) is preserved29, which may contribute to further hyperphagia. This data has 95 
been replicated in several animal models30-32 and provides a compelling argument that aberrant 96 
vagal nerve signaling promotes weight gain. Neuromodulation of the vagus nerve, therefore, is 97 
an attractive therapeutic intervention for obesity management.  98 
 99 
Historical utilization of vagotomy: The rationale behind the procedure is rooted in historical [ADDRESS_1118479] been largely supplanted by 102 
the medical management of Helicobacter Pylori, their safety and ancillary value for the 103 
management of obesity – and even subsequent heart disease and diabetes – have long been 104 
investigated .36-41 of particular relevance to this proposal is the development and study of an 105 
implanted vagal nerve stimulator f or purposes of managing obesity, the Vbloc® device. [ADDRESS_1118480] a long history in humans without 110 
associated cardiac or sympathetic complicati ons. 111 
 112 
Vagus nerve blockade using an implantable device leads to weight loss and improvement in 113 
glycemic control and blood pressure:  A small, prospective, open label trial evaluated the 114 
efficacy of an implantable electric vagus blocking device (VBLOC) on gl ycemic control and 115 
blood pressure in obese subjects with T2D. Patients were implanted with VBLOC and followed 116 
prospectively for 12 months. Excess weight loss at 12 months was 25± 4%, with improvement in 117 
HbA1c from 7.8% ±0.2% at baseline to 6.8%. Decreases were also seen in fasting plasma [ADDRESS_1118481] reported pain at the VBLOC site in nearly 40% of subjects [ADDRESS_1118482] guided cryoablation of the vagus nerve for weight loss:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_26923] [ADDRESS_1118483] 125 
guided cryoablation of the posterior vagal trunk in patients with mild to moderate obesity (BMI 126 
30-37 kg/m2). This small and uncontrolled study enrolled twenty subjects for a cryoablation of 127 
the vagus nerve along the distal esophagus. This rapid, minimally invasive procedure was found 128 
to be 100% technically successful. There were no procedure related complications or adverse [ADDRESS_1118484] an average of 5.6% total body weight, with 22.7% excess BMI lost [delta BMI / 134 
(initial BMI -25)] over the 6-month monitoring period. Participant s reported decreases in appetite 135 
following the procedure at all time points, with 15.8% reporting “somewhat less appetite”, 136 
68.4% reporting “much less appetite”, and 10.5% reporting “very much less appetite.”16  137 
 138 
II. SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION:  [ADDRESS_1118485] guided cryoablation of the posterior vagal trunk in patients with mild to 142 
moderate obesity (BMI 30-40 kg/m2). This  small and uncontrolled study enrolled ten subjects 143 
for a cryoablation of the vagus nerve along the distal esophagus. This rapid, minimally invasive 144 
procedure was found to be 100% technically successful. There were no procedure related [ADDRESS_1118486] an average of 146 
5.6% total body weight, with 22.7% excess BMI lost [delta BMI/(initial BMI -25)] over the 3 - 147 
month monitoring period. Participants reported decreases in appetite following the procedure at 148 
all time points, with 15.8% reporting “somewhat less appetite”, 68.4% reporting “much less 149 
appetite”, and 10.5% reporting “very much less appetite.”43  150 
 151 
In addition to weight loss, we anticipate that the cryovagotomy procedure will result in 152 
significant improvement in glycemic co ntrol and cardiovascular risk factors, which may result in 153 
long-term benefit is reducing diabetic complications. We propose a prospective, randomized 154 
controlled trial to determine if a minimally invasive cryoablation procedure of the vagus nerve 155 
will lead to greater weight loss and improvements in glycemic control, metabolic profile, and 156 
cardiovascular risk factors compared to lifestyle intervention in obese patients with T2D. Our 157 
data will provide preliminary data to support application for an NIH grant to further investigate 158 
manipulation of the gut-brain axis for management of type 2 diabetes and obesity. 159

 D. STUDY PROCEDURE:  243 
Cryoablation procedure  (to be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Prologo or [CONTACT_808938]) : Subjects will 244 
be NPO for 12 hours prior to the ablation procedure. Metformin and sulfonylureas will be held 245 
the evening prior to the procedure. Subjects will present to the Interventional Radiology pre - 246 
procedure holding area at 8:[ADDRESS_1118492] a peripheral 247 
IV placed by [CONTACT_75462]. Point of care blood glucose level will be checked; the procedure will 248 
be deferred for BG >250 mg/dl until diabetes control can be better optimized. Low doses of [ADDRESS_1118493] guidance and involves a 4- 5 mm scalpel incision followed 252 
by [CONTACT_808933] (the location of 253 
the posterior vagal trunk). The probe will create a zone of decreased temperature ( -20 to -40oC) 254 
involving the posterior vagal nerve fibers/plexus. The cryoablation process will include a 3- 255 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 8 minute freeze, followed by a 1- minute thaw, and a second 3-minute freeze  and 1 minute thaw . 256 
After the procedure, a sterile dressing will be applied, and subjects will be monitored for 12 257 
hours. 258 
 259 
Lifestyle Intervention: All subjects will receive standardized diet ary and exercise counseling [ADDRESS_1118494] ([CONTACT_808939]). Participants will be counseled 261 
to follow a low carbohydrate diet providing a moderate amount of carbohydrates per day (~100 262 
g). Focus will be on increasing fruits and vegetables and decreasing refined sugars and processed [ADDRESS_1118495] 150 265 
minutes weekly. The lifestyle intervention structure will include detailed counseling sessions at 266 
baseline, 3 and 6 months. These sessions ideally will occur face- to-face, although telemedicine 267 
visit (via zoom) will  be permitted on case -by-case basis due to the COVID -19 pandemic. In 268 
addition, there will be weekly phone calls or texts (participants’ choice) providing a total of [ADDRESS_1118496] recommended by [CONTACT_406065] ([LOCATION_002] Preventive Services Task 270 
Force).45  271 
 272 
Surveys: Subjects will complete a number of surveys  as part of participation in the trial.  at 273 
baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. Three-day food records are a validated method of 274 
assess food intake46 and will be administered at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12 275 
months.S ubjects will also complete visual analogue scale ratings of appetite at baseline, 1 week, 276 
1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 12 month.47 The International Physical Activity Questionnaires 277 
(IPAQ) is to provide a set of well -developed instruments that can be used internationally to [ADDRESS_1118497] an 280

E. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS:  291 
Risk to Human Subjects: Specific to this procedure, a [ADDRESS_1118500] pi[INVESTIGATOR_808928] 292 
that demonstrated no procedure related complications or adverse events during 6 months of 293 
follow up. During the 12 month extension, 1/[ADDRESS_1118501] was asymptomatic . The Visual –Ice Cryoablation [ADDRESS_1118502]. Prologo’s group has conducted three other [ADDRESS_1118503] been founded is the induction of a specific, reversible nerve injury.56-58 Nerve 313 
injury classifications are classically described and correlated with clinical course following 314 
trauma (crush, stretch, laceration, etc.), the most widely cited of which are the Seddon and 315 
Sunderland classifications.59,60  it has been shown that temperatures induced by [CONTACT_101352] 316 
devices correspond with Sunderland 2 injuries in peripheral nerves.56,57 This precise neural injury 317 
results in several well described events that lead to favorable clinical outcomes – cessation of [ADDRESS_1118504] connective tissue scaffold. 57,58,61 the translation of these events (beyond conduction 320 
cessation) has been documented as nerve function recover y in animal studies and in humans62-65. 321 
62-66 322 
Please see below with more details on the identified potential risks of procedures performed 323 
percutaneously in interventional radiology: 324 
1.  Bleeding: The risk of bleeding is estimated to be <2%, and is specifically localized to 325 
the site of the skin incision (4- 5 mm). The risk of any internal bleeding is negligible since [ADDRESS_1118505] a sterile bandage placed on the incision and will be monitored for 12 hours. 329 
2. Pneumothorax : Estimated risk is <1%. We feel that the risk of pneumothorax is non- [ADDRESS_1118506] scan 332 
and immediate treatment will be provided.  333 
3. Sedation associated risks : <0.5% risk. Conscious sedation using fentanyl and versed [ADDRESS_1118507] procedural doses. Should any excess sedation occur, this will be 335 
reversed immediately in the procedural suite.  336 
4. Off target ablation : This refers t o any inadvertent ablation of other nerves, estimated to 337 
be <1.0% risk. This would be seen in real -time on CT guidance, and ablation could be [ADDRESS_1118508] risks: Our strict inclusion and exclusi on criteria for entry will help to [ADDRESS_1118509] information for study personnel should any 344 
events occur in between visits. Unscheduled events can be arranged to assess any urgent matte rs. 345 
All AEs, regardless of whether or not they are related to the procedure and use of the device, will 346 
be documented and reported to the IRB, DSMB, and FDA  in a timeline as specified by [CONTACT_62673] 347 
Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, section 812.150 reporti ng (21CFR812.150(b)).Outcomes 348 
regarding hypo- and hyper- glycemia will also be collected and reported for safety monitoring. 349 
 350 
Subjects with poorly controlled diabetes ( A1c >10.5%) or a history of DKA will be excluded 351 
from enrollment. Subjects will be educated on the potential for development of hypoglycemia. 352 
Diabetic medications will be adjusted in event of hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia under the [ADDRESS_1118510]. Alexandra Migdal (Endocrinologist). Self -monitoring of blood glucose (BG) 354 
levels will be recommend ed twice daily and any time symptoms of hypo/hyperglycemia occur. 355 
In the setting of hyperglycemia (average BG >250 mg/dl x 1 week), medication doses will be [ADDRESS_1118511] the dose titrated to a maximum of 2000 mg/d if 357 
tolerated. Sulfonylureas can be titrated to maximal doses per manufacturer instruction. Subjects 358 
may be prescribed rescue therapy with insulin in the event of significant hyperglycemia 359 
unresponsive to titration of oral agents.  In the setting of BG <100 mg/dl, sulfonylurea doses will 360 
be decreased by 50% and discontinued if necessary. If BG <55 mg/dl, sulfonylureas will be 361 
stopped. Metformin will be stopped if hypoglycemia persists. 362 
 363 
Technical success rate of the procedure and procedure related complications: [ADDRESS_1118512] 8 of 30 planned experience 365 
significant adverse events (AEs) (Grade 3 procedure -related AE or procedure -related serious 366 
AE) at any point during follow -up and if 4 participants experience significant AEs (Grade 3 367 
procedure- related serious AE) at any time. The trial will be stopped at any point if a Grade 4 or 368 
Grade 5 AE occurs until determination can be made regarding its potential relationship to study 369 
involvement.  370 
 371 
Grading of AEs: 372

contravention to the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria. Any subjects experiencing a Grade 3-[ADDRESS_1118514] will be 392 
encouraged to keep follow up appointments with the study team for monitoring of adverse events 393 
or until resolution of any adverse events related to the procedure.  394 
Data Safety Monitoring: In addition, an independent data safety monitoring committee 395 
(DSMC) will be established to serve as the primary data and safety monitoring group for the [ADDRESS_1118515]. At each meeting, the DSMC will review the incidence 402 
of adverse events, severity of each, statistical considerations, and safety concerns (including 403 
information on hypo- or hyper -glycemia) – as well as conduct of the trial and accrual goals.  [ADDRESS_1118516] SELECTION:  411

G. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  463 
Cryovagotomy Trial  
February 22. 2021  
 13 The primary outcome is the difference in glycemic control (as measured by [CONTACT_13505]1c) at [ADDRESS_1118521] or a two- sample t-tests 468 
(with appropriate data transformation if needed).  We will conduct one -way ANOVA to estimate [ADDRESS_1118522] for some important confounders by [CONTACT_808934] 471 
regression models. We will also assess the glycemic control outcomes simultaneously across 472 
different follow -up visits (i.e.  12, 24 weeks) through repe ated measures ANOVA models, which [ADDRESS_1118523] (or Fisher’s exact test) to compare the occurrence of this [ADDRESS_1118524] model selection (e.g. forward, backward variable selection) and model checking 486 
procedures (e.g. deviance residual plot and Hosmer - Lemeshow test) will be performed to ensure [ADDRESS_1118525] cross -sectional comparisons based on Chi -squared 492 
tests or Fisher’s exact test.  If the discrete outcome is measured at multiple visits, we will fit 493 
repeated measures generalized linear models to simultaneously assess the difference in the 494 
longitudinal discrete outcome between the two treatment groups. Other covariates may be 495 
included in the models if feasible. 496 
 497 
Sample Size Calculation and Power Analysis:   498 
This study is generating pi[INVESTIGATOR_808930] a novel patient population. 499 
Given the 15 patients per group, taking into account 20% attrition rate, we would have [ADDRESS_1118526] 80% power to detect a difference in glycemic [ADDRESS_1118527] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]:  [ADDRESS_1118528] their samples to be destroyed at any time. Presentation of the study 514 
results at regional or scientific meetings or in publications will not identify subjects.  Access to 515 
research and confidential r ecords will be limited to clinical investigators, research coordinators, 516 
and the IRB at Emory University.  517 
 518 
Study coordinators and/or investigators will collect baseline and follow up data, complete the 519 
CRF (case report form) and enter data into RedCap (el ectronic database provided by [CONTACT_808935] 520 
Research Information Technology Department). Baseline data will include demographics 521

V. ETHICS:  529 
A. INFORMED CONSENT   530 
After identification of eligible patients these individuals will be provided basic information 531 
regarding the study and, if interested, a member of the research staff using inclusion/exclusion [ADDRESS_1118530] 536 
questions, and a member of the research staff will answer questio ns.  The principal investigator 537 
(PI) will also be available at all times to answer questions that participants may have during the [ADDRESS_1118531] undergone CITI training in accordance with the IRB 541 
guidelines of Emory University.  A signed copy of the consent form will be provided to the 542 
participant  and a copy will be placed in the file that is maintained for each participant in the 543 
study office. Adults who speak any of the following languages (English, Spanish) will be [ADDRESS_1118532] INSURANCE:  [ADDRESS_1118533] of their usual ongoing medical care, including 561 
procedures and/or non-study medications that their doctor requires as part of their usual medical 562 
care. 563 
 564 
B. PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION     565 
Participation in this study is voluntary.  Patients will receive $25 for the screening visit, $75 for 566 
the enrollment visit, $30 for the 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month and 12 month visit to 567 
compensate for time and effort.  Total compensation will be two hundred and fifty dollars 568 
($250.00).  [ADDRESS_1118534]. Migdal and investigators at each 572 
institution, along with the medical facilities will make medical care available .  Emory University, 573 
however, has not set aside any money to pay participants or to pay for their medical treatment. 574 
The only exception is if it is proved that the injury or illness is directly caused by [CONTACT_593696] 575 
of an Emory /Grady employee.  “Negligence” is the failure to follow a standard duty of care. [ADDRESS_1118535] wages, disability or discomfort due to an injury 577 
related to the study is not available.   578

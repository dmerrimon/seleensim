Title  A Multicenter, Open -Label, 24-Week , Uncontrolled Study to 
Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Oral 
Treprostinil Extended Release Tablets Following  Transition from 
Remodulin or Inhaled Prostacyclin  Therapy or as Add- on to Current 
PAH Therapy in De Novo  Prostacyclin Pediatric Subjects  Aged 7 to 
17 Years with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension  
Study Phase  Phase II  
Indication  Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)  
Primary Objective  To assess the safety and tolerability of oral treprostinil extended 
release tablets in t hree cohorts of pediatric subjects with PAH aged 
7 to 17 years:  
• Cohort 1: Subjects  transitioning from intravenous ( IV) or 
subcutaneous  (SC) Remodulin® 
• Cohort 2: Subjects  transitioning from inhaled prostacyclin  
• Cohort 3: A s add -on to current PAH therapy in de novo 
prostacyclin subjects  
Secondary 
Objective(s) 1)  To assess the effect of oral treprostinil on the following (assessed 
in all cohorts):  
• Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with progressive 
cycle ergometry  
• Symptoms of PAH  
• Panama functional class ification  
• WHO functional classification  
• Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (with oximetry  and heart 
rate [HR]  recovery monitoring ) 
• Borg dyspnea sc ore 
• Quality of life assessed via the Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory (PedsQLTM) questionnaire  
• Plasma N -terminal pro -B-type natriuretic peptide (NT -Pro BNP)  
• Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI)  
 2)  To describe treprostinil pharmacokinetics  (PK)  in pediatric  
subjects  with PAH aged 7 to 17 years . 
Study Design  Multi -center, open -label, safety, tolerability and PK study of oral 
treprostinil in pediatric subjects  with stable PAH aged 7 to 17 years 
who are, (1) transitioning from IV/SC Remodulin therapy ; (2) 
transitioning from inhaled prostacyclin  therapy; or (3 ) not currently 
receiving prostacyclin therapy.  
Sample Size  Up to 40 pediatric subjects  aged 7 to 17 years (25 transition [ IV/SC 
Remodulin  and inhaled]  subjects and 15  de novo  subjects)   
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545114]  Eligibility 
Criteria  All Cohorts:  
Eligible subjects are between [ADDRESS_545115] a diagnosis of PAH as confirmed by a previous right heart 
catheterization  (RHC) .  Panama functional class ification  IIIb and  IV 
subjects will be excluded.  
All subjects must be optimally treated (as determined by [CONTACT_3786]) with background PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., 
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor [PDE -5i], endothelin receptor 
antagonist  [ERA ], soluble guanylate cyclase [sGC] ) for at least 
[ADDRESS_545116] been on a stable dose without changes (except 
documented weight based adjustments) for at least [ADDRESS_545117] dose of oral treprostinil.  
Cohort 1:  Remodulin to Oral Treprostinil Transition  
Subjects must have b een receiving IV/SC Remodulin for at least 
[ADDRESS_545118] 
dose of oral treprostinil.  The IV/SC Remodulin dose  will be 
between  
25-75 ng/kg/min, inclusive , for the first five subjects enrolled in 
Cohort  1.  Following a safety review  by [CONTACT_399786] (DSMB) after the first five Cohort [ADDRESS_545119] been 
enrolled and transitioned to oral treprostinil  (study drug) , the dose  
range may be expanded to 25- 125 ng/kg/min, inclusive , for the 
remaining subjects.  
Cohort 2:  Inhaled Prostacyclin to Oral Treprostinil Transition  
Subjects must have been receiving inhaled prostacyclin therapy for 
at least [ADDRESS_545120] dose of oral treprostinil.  
Cohort 3: Add- On to Current PAH Therapy in De Novo 
Prostacyclin  
Subjects must weigh at least 22  kg.  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  6 of 98 Drug Dosage and 
Formulation  All Cohorts:  
All subjects will receive study drug (oral treprostinil  extended 
release tablets) .  The tablets may be provided a s 0.125, 0.25, 1, or 
2.5 mg strengths.  Oral treprostinil will be dosed three times daily 
(TID) or four times daily  (QID)  at the discretion of the Investigator, 
with food.  Dosing will take place approximately every [ADDRESS_545121]’s lifestyle and 
schedule. Sudden dose escalation or reductions should be avoided as 
they may lea d to intolerable adverse events (AEs)  or worsening of 
PAH.  Gradual dose titrations are recommended to reduce the risk to 
subjects.  
Cohort 1:  IV/SC Remodulin to Oral Treprostinil Transition  
Dose Transition Schedule:  
Once all entry criteria have been met and Baseline assessments 
completed, subjects will begin transition in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430976]/SC 
Remodulin to oral treprostinil with a goal for complete transition 
off of IV/SC Remodulin within f ive days of the start of the 
transition.   If possible, Day 5 (or last day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], if 
transition occurred in less than 4 days)  should be reserved as an 
observational period for subjects successfully transitioned to oral 
treprostinil and no longer receiving IV/SC Remodulin.  Subjects 
will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430977]/SC Remodulin, reache d their target oral treprostinil dose, or as 
the Investigator feels appropriate.  If necessary or appropriate pe r 
Investigator discretion, subjects can prolong or complete the 
transition in an outpatient setting for a total transition time of up to 
four weeks.  A cross titration will occur so that the dose of IV/SC 
Remodulin is  decreased as the dose of  oral treprost inil is increased .  
Once subjects have been transitioned off IV/SC Remodulin, the 
dose of oral treprostinil may continue to be modified/titrated to the 
appropriate optimal dose for that subject th roughout the rest of the 
study.  
Cross Titration D osing G uidelines:  
• IV/SC Remodulin should not be decreased more than 
30 ng/kg/min within a 24 hour period 
• Oral treprostinil should be increased in proportion to 
Remodulin decreases and  the subject’s weight  
• IV/SC Remodulin doses should be adjusted (i.e ., decreased) 
at the same time oral treprostinil dose is increased

Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  7 of 98 Cohort 2:  Inhaled Prostacyclin to Oral Treprostinil Transition  
Dose Transition Schedule:  
Once all entry criteria have been met and Baseline assessments 
completed, dosing of oral treprostinil  will be initiated at 0.[ADDRESS_545122]’s lifestyle and schedule . The first 
dose of 0.125 mg oral treprostinil should occur at the study site.  
Dose escalations may occur every 24 hours (following three or  four 
consecutive doses, depending on TID or QID dosing, respectively) 
and should occur in increments of 0.[ADDRESS_545123] is fully 
transition ed off the inhaled prostacyclin by [CONTACT_410499] 4. 
Cohort 3: Add -On to Current PAH Therapy in De Novo 
Prostacyclin  
Dose Schedule:  
Once all entry criteria have been met and Baseline assessments 
completed, dosing of oral treprostinil  will be initiated at 0.[ADDRESS_545124]’s lifestyle and schedule. The first 
dose of oral treprostini l should be t aken at the study site.  Dose 
escalations may occur every 24 hours  (following three or four 
consecutive doses depending on TID or QID dosing, respectively) 
and should occur in increments of 0.[ADDRESS_545125] four weeks of the study 
as clinically indicated.  Following four weeks of treatment, dose 
escalations may occur in either 0.125 mg or 0.25 mg increments 
every 24 hours, as tolerated.  
Control Group  None  
Route of  
Administration  Oral 
Procedures  Up to seven study visits will occur during the 24 -week study at the 
following time points : Screening, Baseline, Week 0 (Cohort 1 only; 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430978] 1- 5), Week 3 Week 6, Week 12, and 
Week  24. 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  8 of 98 Screening/ Baseline  (All Cohorts ): 
All subjects will be assessed fo r eligibility during the 28 day 
screening period.  Baseline assessments can be conducted over five 
days ( 120 hour s) prior  to the first dose of oral treprostinil, to allow 
for scheduling of all activities .  The Screening and Baseline visits 
may be combined if all entry criteria are satisfied and all 
assessments are completed within five days (120 hours) prior t o the 
first dose of oral treprostinil.  The following assessments will be 
performed:  vital sig ns, physical examination, six -minute walk test 
(6MWT )/Borg dyspnea score, CPET, 12- lead ECG, Panama and 
WHO functional classification  assessments, symptoms of PAH, 
PedsQL , NT-Pro BNP, c MRI, clinical laboratory assessments, and 
safety assessments.  Females of child bearing potential will undergo 
a urine pregnancy test.  In addition, all subjects in Cohort 1will 
undergo an 8- hour PK  assessment , which may occur  up to seven 
days prior to the first dose of oral treprostinil (study drug) .  
Pharmacokinetic assessment s at Baseline will not be conducted in 
Cohort 2 or Cohort 3 subjects.  
Transition  Phase  (Cohort 1) : 
Within five days (120 hours) of beginning Baseline assessments 
Cohort  1 subjects will undergo an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430979] (Week 0) to transition from IV/SC 
Remodulin to oral treprostinil.  The target transition goal is no 
longer than five days and for the subject to be completely 
transitioned off IV/SC Remodulin prior to discharge from the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Subjects will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430980]/SC Remodulin, reached their target oral 
treprostinil dose, or as the Investigator feels appropriate.  If 
necessary or appropriate per Investigator discretion, subjects can 
prolong or complete the tra nsition in an outpatient setting for a total 
transition time of up to four weeks. 
The maximum time to titrate off IV/SC Remodulin is four weeks 
from the start of the transition; if the subject is not fully transitioned 
by [CONTACT_10585] 4, they will be removed from the study.  If the subject is in 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430981], the 
assessments for that visit should be conducted as scheduled du ring 
the defined visit window. 
Treatment Phase ( Cohort 2 and 3) : 
Following completion of Baseline assessments, the first dose of 
0.[ADDRESS_545126] 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545127]’s lifestyle and schedule.   Dose changes should be 
conducted under appropriate medic al supervision in co nsultation 
with the study site.  
Dose Op timization/Evaluation Phase (All Cohorts ): 
Weeks 3, 6, and 12:  Subjects will return to clinic for the following 
assessments:  vital signs, 6MWT/Borg dyspnea score, Panama and 
WHO functional classi fication , symptoms of PAH, and safety 
assessments.  At each visit, females of childbearing potential will 
undergo a urine pregnancy test.  At Week 12, QOL (as measured by 
[CONTACT_431020]) and clinical laboratory assessments, including  
NT-pro-BNP , will occur.  
Week 24 (or premature termination ):  Subjects will return to the 
clinic for the following assessments:  vital signs, physical 
examinat ion, 6MWT/ Borg dyspnea score, CPET, 12- lead ECG, 
Panama and WHO functional class, symptoms of PAH, PedsQL , 
NT-Pro BNP, cMRI, clinical laboratory assessments, and safety 
assessments.  Females of child bearing potential will undergo a 
urine pregnancy test.  In addition, all subjects will undergo an 8-
hour PK assessment . 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_430982]:  
• Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157194] a result of worsening PAH  
• Clinically significant worsening in PAH symptoms or signs, 
which the Investigator feels requir es a change of current 
therapy  
If one of these  events occur within the four weeks following the first 
dose of oral treprostinil, the subject should be transitioned back to 
IV/SC Remodulin (for Cohort 1 subjects) and tapered off oral 
treprostinil, as appropriate, and discontinued from study.  If any of  
these events occur after the first four weeks of the study, it is not 
required that a subject be removed from the study.  The  Investigator 
will determine whether it is safe for the subject to remain in the 
study.  
If two  or more of the first five  subjects in any cohort meet the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], the data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_431021] . 
Statistical 
Considerations  The study is not powered to test a null hypothesis.   A sample size of 
40 pediatric PAH subjects aged 7 to 17 years ( 25 transition [ IV/SC 
Remodulin and inhaled] subjects and 15 de novo prostacyclin 
subjects ) will enable a descriptive evaluation of the PK and an 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545128]  
population for (1) transition from moderate to high doses of IV/SC 
Remodulin to oral treprostinil, (2) transition from inhaled 
prostacyclin  to oral treprostinil, and ( 3) initiation of oral treprostinil 
as add -on therapy in de novo prostacyclin subjects . 
The safety and tolerability of transitioning subjects  from IV/SC 
Remodulin to oral treprostinil (Cohort 1) or from inhaled 
prostacyclin (Cohort 2) will be based on the percentage of subjects 
successfully transitioning to oral treprostinil.  A successful 
transition is defined as a subject from Cohort 1 or 2 who is receiving 
oral treprostinil and no longer receiving IV/SC Remodulin or 
inhaled prostacyclin, respectively  at Week 4 and clinically 
maintained on oral treprostinil treatment through Week 24.  A 
successful initiation of oral treprostinil (Cohort  3) will be defined as 
a subject who has been clinically maintained on oral treprostinil 
through Week 24. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints will be descriptive in nature.  
Numeric endpoints for post -Baseline assessments will be compared 
to Baseline using Wilcoxon signed rank test, and p- values will be 
calculated for descriptive purposes; no formal hypothesis testing is 
planned.

1.1 DEFINITION OF CLINICAL PROBLEM  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is defined as an elevation in mean pulmonary arterial 
pressure (PAPm) greater than [ADDRESS_545134] as measured by [CONTACT_137910] 
(RHC) and is also associated with an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).  
Elevation in PVR causes an increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular 
function and ultimately leading to heart failure and death.  
The typi[INVESTIGATOR_308726]  (IPAH) , heritable  (FPAH),  or associated 
with collagen vascular/connective tissue disease, portal hypertension, infection with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), history of cocaine or appetite suppressant drug use.  
Estimates of disease incidence have been reported between 2.4 and 7.6 cases per million 
individuals [ Peacock  2007; Humbert  2006].  
There are three major factors thought to contribute to the increased pulmonar y vascular 
resistance seen in this disease: vasoconstriction, remodeling of the vessel wall, and 
thrombosis.  There are a number of metabolic pathways which contribute to these changes 
that involve vasoactive mediators such as the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin, and 
the vasoconstrictor endothelin -1.  These substances affect both vascular tone and remodeling 
leading to their use as pharmacologic targets [Farber, 2004] . 
PAH occurs in both adults and children. Of the etiological subgroups of PAH, c ongenital 
heart disease (CHD)  and IPAH are the most common etiologies  in pediatric  patients 
[Beghetti, 2008; va n Loon, 2011].   For the annual incidence and point prevalence averaged, 
respectively  for IPAH and PAH- CHD, has been estimated at 0.7 and 4.4 (IPAH) and 2.2 and 
15.6 (PAH -CHD) cases per million children  [van Loon, 2011].  T he characteristic pathologic 
processes of  pulmonary vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling , 
inflammation, and thrombosis that characterize PAH in adult s are also observed in children 
[Galie, 2009].  Although, more pulmonary vascular medial hypertrophy and a lesser amount 
of intimal fibrosis and formation of plexiform lesions is observed in children compared to 
adults [Barst, 2011].  I t has also been  observed that the prevalence of acute vasoreactivity is 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  16 of 98 higher in children with IPAH than adults with  IPAH, suggesting that vasoconstriction may 
precede vascular remodeling  in this subset of PAH  patients  [Rosenzweig , 2004; Tissot, 2009] . 
Clinical symptoms are similar in children and adults, and include exertional dyspnea , fatigue, 
chest pain and  syncope.  Syncope and near -syncope presents more commonly in children than 
adults .  Additionally, children appear to tolerate increased workload on the right heart better 
than in adults, with better preservation of cardiac output and less frequent occurrence of right 
heart failure with edema [Barst, 2011] .  Dyspnea  is the most  common symptom in older 
children, occasionally accompanied with chest pai n [Rosenzweig , 2004] . 
Pediatric  patients with PAH are currently diagnosed, classified, and treated in the same 
manner as adults.  Treatment efficacy in adults is commonly measured by [CONTACT_431022] ( WHO ) classification or  exercise capacity, usually measured as 
the change in the six  minute walk distance (6MWD).  Unfortunately, the 6MWD can be 
difficult to reliably assess in children and may underestimate a child’s exercise limitations 
[Ivy, 2006; Tissot , 2009 ; Barst , 2011].   Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with gas 
exchange is a complementary non- invasive test to measure functional capacity and better 
reflect functional status, especially in children with a 6MWD of m ore than 300 meters 
[Ivy, 2006; Adati a, 2013; Barst , 2011] . 
Changes in hemodynamic  parameters measured with right heart catheterization  can be used to  
measure treatment efficacy;  however, there is increased risk as general anesthesia is required 
to perform this procedure in the pediatric  population [Carmosi no, 2007].  Biomarkers, such as 
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), have also b een positively correlated with disease severity  in 
children  and can be used to measure treatment efficacy [Bernus, 2009].  
Children with IPAH have a worse prognosis than adults, with an estimated median survival of 
less than one year.  Children also have a shorter length of time between the onset of 
symptoms and diagnosis [ D’Alonzo , 1991; Galie, 2009; Rosenzweig, 2004] .  Overa ll 5-year 
pediatric PAH survival estimates have been reported between 64% and 81%; although one 
study reported survival without transplantation or atrial septostomy as 57% [Yung, 2004; va n 
Loon, 2010; Haworth , 2009].

Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  17 of 98 1.2 ORAL TREPROSTINIL BACKGROUND  
Prostacyclin is an endogenous substance produced by [CONTACT_431023], antiplatelet aggregation, and antiproliferative properties.  T reprostinil 
(1R,2R,3aS,9aS) -2,3,3a,4,9,9a -Hexahydro- 2-hydroxy- 1-[(3S)- 3-hydroxyoctyl] -1H-
benz[f]inden -5-yl]oxy]acetic acid)  is a tricyclic benzindene analogue of prostacyclin.  
Treprostinil is approved as the inhaled (Tyvaso®), intravenous (IV)/subcutaneous (SC)  
(Remo dulin®) and oral (Orenitram®) formulations f or the treatment of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension in adults . 
Oral treprostinil is an innovative diolamine salt form of treprostinil formulated as an extended 
release osmotic tablet for oral administration , and exists in the same biologically active form 
in the plasma as the inhaled and parental formulations.  The tablet core is coated with a semi -
permeable membrane and has a laser -drilled aperture through the membrane.  Upon contact 
[CONTACT_50641] ( e.g., after inges tion), the core tablet absorbs water through the semi -permeable 
membrane. The water dissolves the water -soluble treprostinil diolamine and the water -soluble 
osmotic excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], which creates hydrostatic pressure within the membrane, eventually 
forcing the drug out through the tablet at a controlled rate.  Oral treprostinil was recently 
approved in the [LOCATION_002] under the brand name [CONTACT_431061] [ADDRESS_545135] vasodilation of pulmonary and 
systemic arterial vascular beds and inhibition of platelet aggregation.  In vitro , treprostinil 
induced concentration dependent relaxation of rabbit isolated pre -contracted mesenteric 
arteries and inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) induced platelet aggregation in human 
and rat platelet rich plasma.  In animals, the vasodilatory effects of treprostinil reduce right 
and left ventricular afterload, also increasing  cardiac output and stroke volume.  Prostacyclins 
lower pulmonary artery pressure, increase cardiac output without affecting the heart rate, 
improve systemic oxygen transport as well as possibly revers e pulmonary artery remodeling.  
There is also increasin g evidence that the ability to block the proliferation of pulmonary artery 
smooth muscle cells may contribute, along with vasodilation, to the therapeutic effects of 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  18 of 98 prostacyclins in the treatment of PAH.  The mechanism of action is therefore likely to be 
multifactorial.  
1.2.2 General Toxicology  
Treprostinil diolamine did not demonstrate any carcinogenic effects in mouse or rat 
carcinogenicity studies.  Oral administration of treprostinil diolamine to Tg.rasH2 mice at 0, 
5, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 3, 7.5 and 15 mg/kg/day in females daily for [ADDRESS_545136] 
dose levels used in males and females are about 8 - and 17- fold, respectively, the human 
exposure at the mea n dose of 3.4 mg BID.  Oral administration of treprostinil diolamine to 
Sprague Dawley rats at 0, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg/day daily for [ADDRESS_545137] doses for fertility, fetal viability/growth, fetal development (teratogenicity), 
and postnatal development were determined in rats.  In pregnant rabbits, external fetal and 
soft tissue malformations and fetal skeletal malformation occurred with the no observed 
adverse effect level for these adverse effects of 0.5 mg/kg/day ( five times the human 
exposure).  
1.2.3 Clinical Pharmacology  
The absolute bioavailability following administration of the oral treprostinil extended release 
tablet is 17% compared with IV Remodulin.  Maximum treprostinil concentrations occur 
between approximately 4 and 6 hours following administration of oral treprostinil in adults.  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  19 of 98 Following administration, oral treprostinil is widely distributed.  Oral treprostinil is 
approximately 96% protein bound with no effect on warfarin or digoxin displacement.  
Pharmacokinetic area under the curve (AUC) data;  indicate that Day 1 data are predictive of 
Day 13 and linearity was observed in plasma exposure comparing 1 mg and 2 mg doses in 
healthy volunteers.  Food, particularly a high calorie meal, has been observed to increase 
absorption and prolong exposure, contributing to the desired pharmacokinetic profile.  The 
relative bioavailability of treprostinil following oral ad ministration of a 1 mg extended release 
tablet wa s not significantly altered by [CONTACT_431024] 250 to 500 calories in healthy 
adult volunteers.  
Treprostinil is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] ( CYP ) 2C8 and to a lesser extent by 
[CONTACT_097]2C9.   It is unknown if the metabolism of oral trepros tinil will be altered in pediatric  
patients . A study evaluating the metabolism of paclitaxel by [CONTACT_097]2C8 using pediatric  and 
adult liver microsomes found no age -related differences in metabolism [Blanco , 2000] ; 
however, CYP2 C9 activity  appears to  be increased in children.  Clearance is approximately 
twice that of adult values for several drugs  predominately metabolized  by [CONTACT_097] 2C9, including 
warfarin, phenytoin, and celecoxib [ Anderson, 2009] .  Co -administration of oral treprostinil 
with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (e.g ., gemfibrozil) has been demonstrated to result in 
significant elevation of treprostinil plasma concentrations.   
In a study conducted in healthy volunteers using [14C] treprostinil, 78.6% and 13.4% of the 
subcutaneous dose was recovered in th e urine and feces, respectively, over 10 days.  Only 4% 
was excreted as unchanged treprostinil in the urine.  Five metabolites were detected in the 
urine, ranging from 10.2% to 15.5% and representing 64.4% of the dose administered.  
Metabolites of treprost inil were tested for pharmacologic activity and found to be much less 
hemodynamically active than treprostinil itself .  Specifically , metabolite M388 was 100-  to 
1,000- fold less active than treprostinil, metabolites M392 and M566 were [ADDRESS_545138] 10,000 -fold less active than 
treprostinil (i.e., did not affect blood pressure or heart rate at the highest dose tested).  
Metabolites M348 and M374 likewise had little cardiovascular activity, having s ome 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  20 of 98 0.01- 0.05% the activity of parent drug.  It is concluded that the metabolites contributed very 
little to pharmacologic activity in this model.  
Initial clinical stu dies used a twice a day  dosing regimen; however, a three times a day dosing 
(TID) regimen has been evaluated and a  reduction in  the peak -to-trough fluctuations  
observed.  A  TID regimen more closely resembles a parental infusion to facilitate the 
achievement of higher doses with greater clinical effect on the signs and symptoms of PAH, 
and reduce s the occurrence of prostacyclin -related adverse events previously seen with the 
twice daily regimen.  Successful transition of stable  adult PAH subjects from parent eral 
treprostinil (IV or subcutaneous [SC ] infusion) to a TID regimen with oral treprostinil without 
a significant decline in exercise capacity or worsening functional classification has been 
demonstrated in a recent clinical trial  [White,  2014] .

In a 12- week, randomized (2:1 oral treprostinil to placebo), double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
international study in subjects with WHO Group [ADDRESS_545140] s receiving oral trepros tinil impro ved their median 6MWD at W eek 12 by

covariance in accordance with the pre- specified statistical analysis plan in the primary 
analysis population; n=228) as compared to s ubjects  receiving placebo.  The within group 
median change from baseline was +25 meters for oral treprostini l and -5 meters for placebo at 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  21 of 98 Week 12 (n=228).  Mean dose (±SD) in the oral treprostinil group was 2.3 ±1.3, 3.2 ±1.9, and 
3.4 ± 1.9 mg BID at Weeks  4, 8, and 12, respectively.  
The study enrolled 349 subjects  (overall analysis population) who were not receiving any 
PAH medication.  Subjects  were in WHO functional class II (~33%) and class III (~66%) 
with either idiopathic or heritable PAH (~75%), collagen vascular disease associated PAH 
(~19%), or PAH associated with HIV (1%) or congenital heart defect (5%) or other conditions 
(~6%).  The mean baseline 6MWD was approximately [ADDRESS_545141] up to a maximum of 12 mg BID based on clinical response and study drug tolerability.  
At the beginning of the study, subjects were dosed with only the 1 mg tablets , with 0.5 and 
0.25 mg tablets introduced at sequentiall y later dates during the study.  The primary analysis 
population consisted of the 228 subjects  who had access to the 0.25 mg tablet at the time of 
randomization.  Discontinuations occurred in 17% of subjects receiving oral treprostinil 
compared to 14% of s ubjects  on placebo in this population.  
Two 16- week, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, international efficacy and safety 
studies of oral treprostinil in subjects with WHO Group [ADDRESS_545142] been conducted.  The results did not 
demonstrate a benefit in exercise testing with median 6MWD at Week 16 (11 meters 
[Hodges -Lehmann estimate; p=0.072] and 10 meters [Hodges -Lehmann estimate; p=0.089], 
respectively).  S ubjects  were in WHO functional class ification II (~23%) and  III (~77%) with 
either idiopathic or heritable PAH (~66%), collagen vascular disease associated PAH (~29%), 
or PAH associated with HIV (1%) or congenital heart defect (4%).  The mean baseline 
6MWD was approximately 340 meters.  Approximately 40% of enrolled subjects were 
receiving both an ERA and a PDE -5i. 
Over [ADDRESS_545143] received oral treprostinil in a long -term, uncontrolled, open- label 
ongoing extension study.  About 70% of subjects continued treatment with oral treprostinil for 
at least a year.  The mean dose was 4.2 mg BID at one year.  The dose of oral treprostinil 
continued to increase over time with doses (mean ± SD) of 3.6 ± 2.7, 4.1 ±3.1, and 5 ± 3.7 mg 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  22 of 98 BID at 6 (n=649), 12 (n=433), and 24 months (n=238) , respectively.  In the 522 subjects that 
completed the 12- month efficacy assessment, their mean 6MWD improved by 24 meters 
compared to baseline (30 meters in subjects not on another PAH therapy and 20 meters when 
oral treprostinil was used in combination with an ERA and/or a PDE -5i).  Of the subjects that 
remained in the study, overall survival was 92%, 87%, and 82% at the end of 1, 2, and 
3-years, respectively, with progression -free survival (progression defined as death, 
discontinuation or addition of a PAH therapy) of 74%, 61%, and 47%.  Reasons for 
discontinuation from the study included adverse event (16%), progression of disease (15%), 
death (13%), and withdrawn consent (7%).  
The most frequent adverse events (AEs) associated with oral treprostinil tha t occurred more 
frequently than placebo in clinical trials were related to systemic effects that are characteristic 
of prostacyclin ( e.g., headache, diarrhea, nausea, flushing, pain in jaw, pain in extremity).  
A comprehensive description of oral treprostinil, including the pharmacology, toxicology, and 
clinical studies completed to date may be found in the Orenitram P ackage Insert and current 
version of the Investigators’ Brochure. 
1.3 RATIONALE FOR DEVELO PMENT OF S TUDY DRUG IN 
DISEASE/CONDITION 
Parenteral prostacyclins are considered by [CONTACT_308759] “gold standard” treatment 
for PAH.  Currently, the complexity and risks associated with approved prostanoid therapy 
including line sepsis, thromboembolism, and rebound hypertensive crisis limit its utility in 
clinical practice, particularly in children [Melnick , 2010].  Because of the risks and limitations 
of continuous parenteral infusion, an alternative route of administration would be desirable  for 
adults as w ell as children.  
Oral treprostinil is a prostacyclin analogue, a class of medication that has long played a 
prominent  role in the treatment of PAH [Badesch , 2004].  Prostacyclin, an endogenous 
compound produced by [CONTACT_431025] , has several activities that are relevant to the 
treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.  The similarity between adults and children with 
PAH in underlying pathobiological mechanisms supports the extrapolation that medicinal 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  23 of 98 products that are effecti ve in adults would also be effective in children.  In addition to the data 
in adult patients establishing the safety and efficacy and support ing the regulatory approval of 
parent eral prostacyclin and prostacyclin analogue products, it has been reported tha t the use of 
IV epoprostenol in children is associated with clinical benefit and improved survival 
[Barst,  1999; Yung, 2004].   In a recent observational study evaluating the efficacy and 
tolerability of SC treprostinil for refractory pediatric  pulmonary hypertension, eight children 
aged  from 15  months to 10 years old received SC  treprostinil therapy at doses ranging from 
37-60 ng/kg/min.  Of the eight children treated, seven showed improvement in functional 
class ification , hemodynamic , and/or 6MWD  (p<0.05), suggesting treprostinil is effective in 
childre n with pulmonary hypertension [Levy, 2011].   Additionally , a study in [ADDRESS_545144] enol, with fewer side effects [Ivy , 2007].  Successful transition s from IV to oral or 
inhaled therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (PDE -5i, ERA, calcium channel blockers, inhaled iloprost) ha ve been 
previously demonstrated in studies in children aged  six years or greater [Ivy , 2004; 
Melnick,  2010].   A re trospective study of 77 pediatric PAH patients receiving epoprostenol  
(n=37), treprostinil (n=20), or were transitioned from epoprostenol to treprostinil (n=20), 
reported a 5- year transplant -free survival of 70% (95% confidence interval, 56% -80%).  
Hemodynamic changes over time on treprostinil were similar to epoprostenol.  There was a 
significant improvement in the pulmonary- to-systemic vascular resistance ratio with 
treprostinil after [ADDRESS_545145] improvement on epoprostenol after  1 to 
2 years of therapy; although, these changes were not sustained over the 4 year follow -up 
period [Siehr,  2013]. 
Given the established beneficial effects of prostanoid therapy in PAH and the limitations of 
existing prostanoid medications, oral treprost inil may provide  therapeutic  benefit to pediatric  
patients with PAH who are old enough to safely take the medication.  
1.[ADDRESS_545146] the safety and tolerability of oral treprostinil in three cohorts of 
pediatric subjects aged 7 to 17 years : transitioning from IV /SC Remodulin, transitioning from 
inhaled prostacyclin, and as add- on to current PAH therapy in de novo prostacyclin subjects.  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  24 of 98 The hypothes is of this study is  that stable PAH pediatric subjects can be safely be transitioned 
from IV/SC Remodulin to oral treprostinil therapy while maintaining the clinical benefit of 
the infused therapy.  A recent study in stable, carefully- selected PAH adult subjects receiving 
IV/SC Remodulin  demonstrated that subjects can be safely transitioned to oral treprostinil 
three times daily (TID ) dosing under close medical observation without a significant decline 
in exercise capacity or worsening functional classification [White, 2014].  After analysis of 
interim pharmacokinetic data from this study, it was determined that a four times daily (QID) 
dosing regimen in select pediatric subjects  may achieve a better pharmacokinetic profile than 
a TID regimen, potentially providing a clinical benefit.  Additionally, we hypothesize that 
initiation of oral treprostinil in pediatric subjects following transition from inhaled 
prostacyclin or added to current PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_430983].

7 to 17 years . 
3 EXPERIMENTAL PLAN  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multi -center, open -label, safety and tolerabilit y study of oral trep rostinil (study drug) 
administered TID  or QID, at the discretion of the I nvestigator, with food in pediatric PAH 
subjects aged 7 to 17 years of age (1) transitio ning from continuous IV/SC  Remodulin; 
(2) transitioning from inhaled prostacyclin ; or (3) as add -on to current PAH therapi[INVESTIGATOR_430984] .  Eligible subjects will be assigned to a cohort based  upon their 
background therapy.  
Up to seven study visits will occur during the 24 -week study at the following time points; 
Screening, Baseline, Week 0 (Cohort 1 only; in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430978] 1 -5), Week 3, 
Week  6, Week 12, and Week 24. 
Cohort 1 Subjects:  
Following completion of Baseline assessments,  including an 8- hour PK  assessment  while  
receiving IV/SC Remodulin within s even days prior to the first dose of oral treprostinil, 
subjects in Cohort 1 will undergo an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430985]/SC Remodulin to oral treprostinil.  The target transition goal is five days 
and for t he subject to be completely transitioned off IV/SC Remodulin prior to discharge from 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Subjects will be discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430977]/SC Remodulin, reached their target oral treprostinil dose, or as the Investigator deems 
appropriate.  If necessary or if appropriate per Investigator discretion, subjects can prolong or 
complete the transition in an outpatient setting for a total transition time of up to four weeks. 
The maximum time to titra te off IV/SC Remodulin is four weeks from the start of the 
transition; if the subject is not fully transitioned by [CONTACT_10585] 4, they will be removed from the 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206

assessments for  that visit will be conducted as scheduled during the defined visit window. 
Cohort  2 and 3 Subjects :  
Following completion of Baseline assessments, the first dose of 0.[ADDRESS_545149]’s lifestyle and schedule.   Dose changes should be 
conducted under appropriate medical supervision in consultation with the study site.  
Dose Op timization/Evaluation Phase (All Cohorts ): 
Week 3, Week 6, and Week 12: Subjects will return to clinic for the following assessments:  
vital signs, six-minute walk test (6MWT )/Borg dyspnea score, Panama and WHO functional 
class ification , symptoms of PAH, and safety assessments.  At each visit, females of 
child bearing potential  will undergo a urine pregnancy test.  At Week 12, QOL (as measured 
by [CONTACT_18639]) and clinical laboratory assessments, including NT -pro-BNP , will occur.  
Week 24 (or premature termination): Sub jects will return to the clinic for the following 
assessments:  vit al sig ns, physical examination, 6MWT/ Borg dyspnea score, CPET, Panama  
and WHO  functional classification , symptoms of PAH, QOL assessment , NT-Pro BNP,  
cMRI, clinical laboratory assessments, electrocardiogram (ECG ), and safety assessments.  
Females of child bearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test.  In addition all  
subjects will undergo an 8- hour PK assessment.  
Once the first five subjects have enrolled in Cohort 1 and transitioned from IV/SC Remodulin, 
the safety data will be reviewed  by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  The IV/SC 
Remodulin dose will be between 25- 75 ng/kg/min, inclusive, for the first five subjects 
enrolled in the cohort.  The dose  range may be expanded to 25- 125 ng/kg/min, inclusive, for 
the remaining subjects fo llowing the safety review.  
Additionally, i f two or more of the first five subjects within a ny cohort meet the pre -specified 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]  (see Section 5.4)  the data from that cohort will be reviewed by [CONTACT_431026]. TDE -PH-206

3.3.1 Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)  
Exercise testing will be performed with progressive cycle ergometry and ventilatory expi[INVESTIGATOR_430987] a metabolic cart at Baseline and Week 24 /Premature Termination .  
The CPET may be waived in subje cts less than 130 cm in height based on equipment 
available at the center.  Cardiopulmonary exercise testing entails measurements of oxygen 
uptake (VO 2), carbon dioxide output (VCO 2), minute ventilation (VE) and other variables, in 
addition to a 12 -lead EC G, blood pressure (BP) monitoring, and pulse oximetry.  T esting  
should be performed a minimum of two hours after the 6MWT when they occur on the same 
visit, and should be  conducted 2- 6 hours after the morning dose of oral treprostinil  (study 
drug)  at the Week 24 visit.  
Resting m easurements will be made for 1 -3 minutes; followed by [CONTACT_431033] (no 
tension/resistance) cycling as a warm -up period.  The workload will then be increased at a 
rate designed to allow reachin g maximum work capacity i n 8-12 minutes.  Workload will be 
increased in a continuous (ramp) fashion, with 5 Watt/minute for subjects < 40 kg, 
10Watt/min f or subjects 40 to < 70 kg, and 15 Watt/min for subjects ≥ 70 kg.  Subjects will be 
instructed to maintain a pedaling cadence between 50- 60 revolutions per minute (RPM).  
Maximal effort will be defined as the attainment of a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_363282] (RQ) equal to 1.10 
or greater.  Subjects will be encouraged to put forth a maximal effort on CPET.  Tests will be 
terminated according to published guidelines and institutional standards . 
• Metabolic data will be continuously collected  and recorded in the subject’s source 
documentation during baseline, warm up, exercise , and the first two minutes of 
recovery.  Breath by [CONTACT_431034] h data should be averaged in 20- second intervals.  Blood 
pressure should be recorded every [ADDRESS_545166] portion of 
the exercise.  The VE/VCO 2 slope will be measured to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_208175].  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  35 of 98 • The raw exercise data will be sen t to a central site and reviewed  by a centralized 
specialist to ensure consistency and accuracy of t est performance.  Th e centralized 
specialist may communicate with the site and establish study specific analysis settings 
for assessments performed for purposes of this protocol.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Six-Minute Walk Test  
The intent of the 6MWT is to evaluate exercise capacity associated with carrying out 
activities of daily living.  All 6MWTs will be conducted by [CONTACT_3784], trained personnel in a 
designated 6MWT area which meets the requirements as outlined in Appendix 15.1.  The 
subject should rest (seated) for at least five  minut es prior to the start of each 6MWT .  The 
start time of the pre -walk, and five minute rest period should be clearly documented in the 
subject’s medi cal records.  
A 6MWT will only be required at Screening if the subject has not previously undergone a 
6MWT at the study site  and will serve as a practice test .  If conducted, it must be separated by 
[CONTACT_431035] 6MWT at Baseline.  Given that the 6MWT needs to be performed 
during inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094] (Cohort 1 subjects only) and the subsequent study visits, it is 
permissible to conduct the 6MWT at different locations,  if needed, during this study.  
Oxygen saturation and HR will be measured at rest prior to the 6MWT and monitored 
continuously during the walk.  Oxygen saturation may be measured by [CONTACT_431036].  Recovery monitoring (HR and oxygen saturation) will b e performed and 
documented at minute 0 ( immediately upon stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_100025] 6MWT ), minute  1, minute  [ADDRESS_545167] continue until the HR is within 10 beats of 
resting values and the oxygen saturation is within 2% of resting values  or until at least 
[ADDRESS_545168] to be clinically stable.

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Treatment Six- Minute Walk Tests  
The 6MWTs will be conducted during each day of the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (Cohort 1  
subjects only)  and all subsequent study visits , and should occur within [ADDRESS_545171]’s last  dose (i.e., most recent dose) o f oral treprostinil.   Subjects receiving 
supplemental oxygen during the Baseline 6MWT must continue to receive the same flow rate 
and mode of oxygen therapy at all subsequent 6MWT assessments.   The 6MW T should be 
performed a t least two  hours prior the CPET at Week 24/Premature T ermination.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Borg Dyspnea  
The Borg dyspnea score will be assessed prior to and following the completion of each 
6MWT.  The Borg dyspnea score is a 10- point scale rating the maximum level of dyspnea 
experienc ed during the 6MWT (Section 15.1).  Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) to 
10 (for the worst condition).  
[IP_ADDRESS] PAH Symptoms  
PAH symptoms (fatigue, dyspnea, edema, dizziness, syncope, chest pain, orthopnea) will be 
assessed at the Baseline visit prior to the initiation of oral treprostinil dosing and at all 
subsequent visits, including each day of the inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (Cohort 1 subjects only) .  
Scores range from 0 (for the best condition) to 3 (for the worst condition). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Functional Class ification  
Subject clinical status will be assessed at Screening, Baseline, and all subsequent study visits.  
Functional class ification  will be recorded according to the Panama functional classification s 
for childre n with pulmonary hypertension and the WHO functional classification .  Functional 
classification scales are provided in Section  15.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] N-terminal pro -BNP  
Plasma N -terminal pro -BNP concentration is a useful biomarker for PAH as it is associated 
with changes in right heart morphology and function [Fijalkowska , 2006].  NT pro -BNP 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  37 of 98 sample collection will occur at Baseline (or as part of the Screening visit assessment if the 
Screening and Baseline visits are combined) prior to starting oral treprostinil and repeated at 
Week 12 and Week 24/Premature Termination .  Bloo d for NT -pro-BNP assessment must  be 
drawn prior to conducting the 6MWT or CPET.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQLTM) 
Health -related quality of life will be assessed via the 23- item PedsQL questionnaire  at 
Baseline (or as part of the Screening visit assessment if the Screening and Baseline visits are 
combined) , Week 12, and Week 24/Premature Termination .  The appropriate questionnaire 
must  be administered based upon the subject’s age group and in accordance with the  
questionnaire administration guidelines .  The PedsQL must  be completed  as the first 
assessment  (after informed consent is obtained) before the respondents complete any other 
health data forms, and before they see their physician /healthcare provider  or have other  
assessments performed .  An example of the PedsQL is provided in Section 15.3. 
3.3.2 Safety  
During this study, treatment emergent changes in physical findings, vital signs, clinical 
laboratory parameters, and the development of AEs will be the primary assessments of safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History and Physical Examinations  
A complete medical history, demographics, PAH history, and physical examination will be 
conducted at Screening.  If any changes to the medical history occur between the Screening 
and Baseline visit, those should be recorded.  Significant past or present illnesses, current 
prescription or nonprescription medications (including vitamins and herbal products), and 
history of medication allergies should be rec orded.  Any significant changes to the subject ’s 
medical condition, physical examination, and concomitant medications must be documented 
throughout the course of the study.  
A complete physical examination will be conducted by a physician at Screening and a t 
Week  24/Premature Termination .  All treatment emergent clinically significant findings 
during the study will be reported as AEs . 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  38 of 98 [IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed during all study visits, including every day of  the inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  (Cohort 1 subjects only) .  Vital signs measured will include blood pressure (BP, 
systo lic and diastolic), HR , respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR), temperature (°C), and weight.  Vital signs 
must be assessed following at least five minutes of rest (sitting) to ensure accurate 
measurement.   No other measurements or procedures should be performed during this five -
minute period.  V ital signs will be collected prior to or after at least 30 minutes following the 
6MWT.  Vital signs should also be assessed in the case of abnormal clinical signs and 
symptoms.   Height will be recorded at Screening.  
[IP_ADDRESS] 12-Lead ECG 
A [ADDRESS_545172] in the semi -recumbent position 
at Baseline and repeated at Week 24/Premature Termination .  Recordings should inc lude lead

least five minutes rest) include HR , PR interval, QT interval, QRS duration, and any clinically 
significant abnormalities.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The results of all clinical laboratory tests conducted at Screening and Baseline must be 
assessed by [CONTACT_431037]’s eligibility to participate in the study.  
Clinical laboratory results outside the normal reference range must be assessed and 
documented by [CONTACT_350071].  Clinically significant refers to a 
laboratory value that is unusual with respect to the subject’s medical history or current health 
status.  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values will be treated and/or followed -up until 
the symptoms or values return to normal or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_737].  
When appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution 
of event(s).

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Pregnancy Testing  
Females of childbearing potential  include any female who has experienced menarche.  Urine 
pregnancy tests ( for all females of child -bearing potential) will be conducted at Screening, 
Baseline, and all subsequent study visits .  A positive pregnancy test will exclude the subject 
from further participation in the  study.  Pregnant subjects who are discontinued from the study 
will be transitioned to an alternate therapy at the discretion of the Inve stigator.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
Adverse Events  will be recorded throughout the course of the study from the tim e that each 
subject and/or care giver signs the informed consent /assent form until the time screen failure is 
documented, or until the subject is either discontinued from the study or all Week [ADDRESS_545173] /caregiver will be directly questioned for AEs 
at each scheduled study visit and dur ing required tele phone contacts.  Subjects/caregivers will 
also be instructed to spontaneously report all AEs throughout the study.  Additionally, a 
detailed collection of pro stacyclin -related AEs will be ca ptured via a standardized diary 
comple ted by [CONTACT_3184]/or care giver each day of the five  day inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430988]/SC Remodulin to oral treprostinil or all subjects in Cohort 1.  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  40 of 98 All AEs should be followed until either resolution (or return to normal or baseline value s), 
until they are judged by [CONTACT_80196], or for at least 30 
days if the AE extends beyond the final  study visit.   All AEs meeting the criteria for serious 
(i.e., serious adverse events [ SAEs ]) should be followed until resolution, death, or the subject 
is lost to follow -up even if they are ongoing more than 30 days after completion of the final 
study vis it. 
All AEs/SAEs that occur while the subject is on oral treprostinil will be recorded as 
instructed in this protocol (Section 9.3).  
If, at any time, the subject withdraws from the study and/or changes from study drug to 
commercially available Orenitram, any AEs/SAEs that occur on Orenitram (including 
product use errors, product quality problems, and therapeutic failures) will be reported 
following local post -marketing reporting requirements.  These events will not be included in 
the eCRF.  
Pulmonary arterial hypertension symptoms  (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and PAH disease related events 
(Section  9.1.4)  should only be recorded as an AE if the event is serious, new, or unusual with 
respect to intensity, frequency, or duration as compared to symptoms in the subject’s medical 
history; or there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by [CONTACT_5257].

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic Sampling  
Pharmacokinetic blood sampling will occur  twice for each sub ject in Cohort 1; once during 
Baseline while the subject is still receiving IV/SC Remoduli n prior to starting oral 
treprostinil, and again at Week [ADDRESS_545176] has reached a stable dose of oral 
treprostinil.  Subjects in Cohort 2 and 3 will undergo PK blood sampling at Week 24 only. 
All blood samples should be drawn within a  ±[ADDRESS_545177].  
Appendix 15.5 contains a detailed description for the PK blood collection, processing, 
storage, and shipment of all samples.  
Baseline PK Assessment (Cohort 1 Only):  
At Baseline subject s in Cohort 1 will undergo an 8- hour PK assessment while receiving 
IV/SC Remodulin within seven days prior t o the first dose of oral treprostinil.  Blood 
samples will be obtained from each  subject at time 0 and the following subsequent t ime 
points:  4 and 8 hours after time 0 for a total of three  blood samples.  During the Baseline 
phase, time 0 should be at the same time of day that it is estimated the Week 24 morning oral 
treprostinil dose will occur (i.e., if the subject/caregiver anticipates the first daily dose of  oral 
treprostinil at Week  24 will be administered at 8 AM, time 0 should be 8 AM).

draws should be based off of time 0.  8 hours  16:00  
Week 24 PK Assessment (All Cohorts):  
At Week 24 all subjects (all cohorts) will undergo an [ADDRESS_545178] daily dose 
(morning dose) of oral treprostinil.  If a subject is on a QID dosing regimen, the Investigator 
may conduct the PK assessment based on the first daily dose (morning dose) or the second 
daily dose (midday dose) at their discretion.  The PK assessment dose of oral treprostinil will 
be taken in the clinic and should occur approximately 8 hours after the prior evening’s last 
oral treprostinil dose for subjects using the morning dose for the PK assessment.  When using 
the midday dose for the PK assessment, the midday dose of oral t reprostinil should occur 
approximately 4 to 6 hours after that day’s morning dose .   
Blood samples will be obtained from each subject at pre -dose (immediately prior [i.e., 
10 minutes ±5 minutes] to administration of the PK assessment  dose  of oral treprostinil ) and 
the following time points:  2, 4, 6, and 8 hours after the PK assessment  dose of oral 
treprostinil (all time points will be based off of the time the PK assessment  dose is 
administered).  No other doses of oral treprostinil should be taken during the PK sampling 
period if the subject is on a TID regimen.   The second daily dose  of oral treprostinil  (midday 
dose)  on a TID regimen will be taken in the clinic and after the final 8 -hour PK sample is 
collected.  Subjects on a QID oral treprostinil regime n will take th eir next  daily dose (midday 
dose or early evening dose  [PM #1 dose] based on timing of PK assessment dose) between 
the 4 and 6 hour time points of the PK sampling (±10 minutes).  The PK assessment dose of 
oral treprostinil must be observed in the clinic by [CONTACT_431040].  A

(Cohort  1 subjects only ) or tapered off oral treprostinil, as appropriate, and discontinued from 
the study:  
• Unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157194] a result of worsening PAH  
• Clinically significant worsening in PAH symptoms or signs, which the Investigator 
feels requires a change of current therapy.  
If two or more of the first five subjects in any cohort meet the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], the data will 
be reviewed by a Data Safety Mo nitoring Board  (DSMB) prior to enrolling additional subjects 
into that cohort.  
If any of these events happen after the first four weeks of the study, it is not required that a 
subject be removed from the study.  The Investigator will determine whether it i s safe for a 
subject to remain in the study.  
6 DRUGS AND DOSING (OR TREATMENT PROCEDURES)  
6.1 DRUG DOSAGE, ADMINIS TRATION AND SCHEDULE 
Oral treprostinil will  be provided as 0.125 mg (blue), 0.25 mg (green), 1 mg (yellow) or 2.5 
mg (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]) extended release tablets .  Subjects /caregivers  must be instructed to take the 
appropriate amount of 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg, 1 mg and/or 2.[ADDRESS_545206]’s lifestyle 
and schedule.      S tudy subjects should take their study drug at approximately  the same time 
each day . 
Tablets must be swallowed whole and not chewed  as this will result in inappropriate delivery 
of the active ingredient.  If the tablet is inadvertently damaged during administration, th e 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545207] /caregiver  should contact [CONTACT_431043].  
For subjects receiving oral treprostinil TID, dosing frequency may be adjusted  from TID to 
QID if clinically indicated , at the discretion of the Investigator .  For applicable subjects, it is 
recommended , but not required, to take the total daily dose during TID dosing, and divide the 
total daily dose into a QID regimen using the closest, or lower, tablet strength  as seen in the 
example table below .  Dose modifi cation s should always occur in accordance with 
Investigator judgment.

6.1.1 Cohort 1: IV/SC Remodulin to Oral Treprostinil Transition  
Once all entry criteria have been met and Baseline assessments completed, subjects should 
begin transition in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430976]/SC Remodulin to oral treprostinil with a goal for 
complete transition off of IV/SC Remodulin within f ive days of the start of the transition.  If 
possible, Day 5 (or final day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430993] 4 days) of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_430994]/SC Remodulin.  A cross titration 
will occur so that the dose of IV/SC Remodulin is  decreased as the dose of oral treprostinil is 
increased .  Once subjects have been transitioned off IV/SC Remodulin, the dose of oral 
treprostinil may continue to be titrated to the appropriate optimal dose for that subject 
throughout the rest of the study.  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  54 of 98 Dosing guidelines:  
• The following equation can be used to estimate a comparable total daily dose of oral 
treprostinil (in mg) using the subject’s dose of IV/SC Remodulin (in ng/kg/min) and 
weight (in kg):  
Oral treprostinil total daily dose (mg) = 0.0072 x Remodulin dose (ng/kg/min) x 
weight  
• IV/SC Remodulin should not be decreased more than 30 ng/kg/min within a 24 hour 
period  
• Oral trep rostinil should be increased in proportion to Remodulin decreases and the 
subject’s weight  
• IV/SC Remodulin doses should be adjusted (i.e ., decreased) at the same time oral 
treprostinil dose is increased

information throughout the study.  Compliance with oral treprostinil will be assessed at 
Week  3, 6, 12, and 24/Premature T ermination visits , as applicable.  At scheduled visits, 
subjects should be instructed to bring all ora l treprostinil to the investigational site.  
Upon return of oral treprostinil (study drug)  at Weeks 3, 6, 12, 24/Premature Termination, as 
applicable, the study coordinator or pharmacist must document the number of returned tablets

[ADDRESS_545240] may voluntarily withdraw  or be withdrawn from the study and/or oral treprostinil 
(study drug)  by [CONTACT_308782], but not limited to, the 
following:  
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_24300]  
• The subject wishes to with draw from further participation  
• A serious or life -threatening AE occurs or the Investigator considers that it is 
necessary to discontinue oral treprostinil (study drug)  to protect the safety of the 
subject  
• The subject deviated from the protocol  
• The subject’s behavior is likely to undermine the validity of his/her results  
• Subject is female and became pregnant during the course of the study  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545241].  If oral 
treprostinil (study drug)  has been administered, the Investigator should make every effort to 
perform all scheduled evaluations prior to discharge.  In the event that a subject discontinues 
oral treprostinil prematurely due to an AE, the subje ct will be followed until either the 
Investigator determines that the AE has resolved, it is no longer considered clinically 
significant, the subject is lost to further follow -up, or for [ADDRESS_545242] by [CONTACT_353579], the Investigator should issue a  written letter 
by [CONTACT_431047]/or caregiver  contact [CONTACT_3652].  If no 
response is received, the subject will be considered lost to follow -up.  The site will record the 
last date of contact [CONTACT_431048] . 
8.2 CRITERIA FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY  
The study may be stopped at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3755]/or Sponsor, 
continuation of the study represents a serious medical risk to the subjects.  This may include, 
but is not limited to, the presence of serious, life -threatening, or fatal AEs or AEs  that are 
unacceptable in nature, severity, or frequency.  The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue 
the study for any reason at any time.  
8.3 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINUING THE SITE 
The study may also be terminated at a given center if:  
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_308740]  
• The Sponsor elects to discontinue the study at the site  
• U.S. FDA  regulations are not observed 
• The protocol is repeatedly violated  
• Changes in personnel or facilities adversely affect performance of the study  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545243] , including any abnormal 
sign ( e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in the research,  whether or not it is related to the 
use of the oral treprostinil (study drug ). 
An AE may include : 
• An intercurrent illness, injury, or any other concomitant impairment of the subject’s 
health, as well as abnormal laboratory findings if  deemed to have clinical 
significance.  
• A worsening of an existing symptom or condition or post -treatment events that occur 
as a result of protocol -mandated procedures (e.g., exacerbation of a pre -existing 
illness following the start of the study or an in crease in frequency or intensity of a 
pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]) . 
Thus, no causal relationship with the study drug  is implied by [CONTACT_3794] "adverse 
event".  
An AE does not include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion) ; however, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an 
adverse event.  Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_391201](s) leading to these measures are not adverse events.  
• Day to day fluctuations of pre -existing disease or conditions present or detected at the 
start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431001] e surgery, social and/or convenience admissions). 
• The disease or disorder being studied or a sign or symptom associated with the 
disease or disorder unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  71 of 98 9.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Suspected advers e reaction means any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
oral treprostinil (study drug)  caused the AE.  For the purposes of safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the oral 
treprostinil and the AE , as described in Section  15.4. 
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Results in a medically important ev ent of reaction 
Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might ha ve caused 
death if more severe.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but might jeopardize the 
patien t or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431002].  Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of 
an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.

documents and on the appropriate e CRF page.  Information related to the AE such as onset 
and cessation date and times, intensity, seriousness, relationship to oral treprostinil ( study 
drug) , and outcome is also to be documented in the e CRF (see Appendix 15.4 for definitions).  
Where possible, AEs should be recorded using standard medical terminology.  The 
Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis based on the presenting s igns 
and symptoms.  If several signs or symptoms are clearly related to a medically -defined 
diagnosis or syndrome, the diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the e CRF page, not 
the individual signs and symptoms.  
9.3 FOLLOW UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs sho uld be followed until either resolution (or return to normal or baseline values), 
until they are judged by [CONTACT_80196], or for at least 
[ADDRESS_545245] to follow -up even if they are ongoing 
more than 30 days after completion of the final visit.  Supplemental measurements and/or 
evaluations may be necessary to investigate fully the nature and/or causality of an AE or SAE.  
This may include additional laboratory tests, diagnostic procedures, or consultation with other 
healthcare professionals.  The eCRF pages should be updated with any new or additional 
information as appropriate.  
If, at any time, the subject withdraws from the study and/or changes from study drug to 
commercially available Orenitram, any AEs/SAEs that occur on Orenitram (including 
product use errors, product quality problems, and therapeutic failures) will be reporte d 
following local post -marketing reporting requirements  or Continued Access Plan local 
reporting requirements (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) .  These events will not be i ncluded in the protocol 
analysis . 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension symptoms ( Section [IP_ADDRESS])  and PAH disease related events 
(Section  9.1.4) should only be recorded as an AE if the event is serious, new, or unusual with 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206

within 24  hours of awareness by [CONTACT_40743] (+ 1 919- 313-1297; 
[EMAIL_8226] ).  A completed SAE Notification Report form along with any 
relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_431003].  A follow -up SAE Notification Repor t form must be 
forwarded to the Global Drug Safety Department at United Therapeutics Corporation within 
[ADDRESS_545248] 
notify the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_431051] e -mail to Global Drug Safety at United 
Therapeutics Corporation ( + 1 919- 313-1297 or [EMAIL_8226] ).  The United 
Therapeutics Global Drug Safety Department will follow -up with the Investigator to ensure 
appropriate data are provided regarding the outcome of the pregnancy, and to ask the 
Investigator to update the Pregnancy Notification Form.  Pregnancy only becomes an 
AE/SAE if there is an abnormal outcome, a spon taneous abortion, an elective termination for 
medical reasons, or a congenital anomaly in the offspring.  
9.6 SAFETY REPORTS  
In accordance with national regulations, the Sponsor will notify the appropriate regulatory 
authority(ies), and all participating Inves tigators of any AE that is considered to be possibly 
attributable to oral treprostinil (study drug)  and is both serious and unexpected.  The 
Investigator must report these AEs to IRBs  in accordance with applicable national regulations 
and guidelines set fo rth by [CONTACT_1201].  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545249]’s eCRF to signify their approval 
of the data.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_431004]-sign an eCRF, if changes are 
made to a subject’s eCRF by [CONTACT_431052]/her signature.  The 
database will be final when all outstanding queries have been resolved and all data 
management quality assurance procedures are complete.  
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE  
This study is intended to provide descriptive data only.  A sample size of 40 subjects 
(25 transition [IV/SC Remodulin and inhaled] subjects and 15 de novo subjects) was selected 
for feasibility and to provide a reasonably large experience base with which to draw 
conclusions about the safety of the proposed protocol for (1) transition from mode rate to high 
doses of IV/SC  Remodulin to oral treprostinil, (2) transition from inhaled prostacyclin to oral 
treprostinil, and (3) initiation of oral treprostinil as add- on therapy in de novo prostacyclin  
subjects.  No formal sample size computation was performed with respect to the primary 
objective of evaluating safet y and tolerability as only descriptive reporting of safety data is 
planned.  The planned sample size of 10- [ADDRESS_545250] population with PAH. 
10.3 ANALYSIS PLAN  
No formal hypotheses will be tested.  Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the 
endpoints and baseline characteristics.  For all summaries, all available data will be presented 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545251] one dose of oral treprostinil will be included in the safety analysis population.  
10.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The safety and tolerability of transitioning subjects from IV/SC Remodulin to oral treprostinil 
(Cohort 1) or from inhaled prostacyclin (Cohort 2) will be based on the percentage of subjects 
successfully transitioning to oral treprostinil.  A successful transition is defined as a subject 
from Cohort 1 or 2 who is receiving oral treprostinil and no longer receiving IV/SC 
Remodulin or inhaled prostacyclin, respectively at Week 4 and clinically maintained on oral 
treprostinil treatment through Week 24.  A successful initiation of oral treprostinil (Cohort 3) 
will be defined as a subject who has been clinically maintained on oral treprostinil through 
Week 24. 
10.3.2 Secon dary Endpoint(s)  
Analysis of secondary endpoints (6MWD, Borg dyspnea score, functional class, symptoms of 
PAH, CPET, PedsQL and cMRI parameters) will be descriptive in nature.  The PedsQL 
questionnaire scores will be computed  in accordance with the established scoring instructions. 
Numeric endpoints for post -Baseline assessments will be compared to Baseline using the 
appropriate statistical test, and p- values will be calculated for descriptive purposes; no formal 
hypothesis testing is planned. 
Plasma samples wil l be analyzed for treprostinil using a validated bioanalytical plasma assay.  
Individual and mean treprostinil plasma concentration data and treprostinil pharmacokinetic 
parameters, such as peak observed plasma concentration (C max), time to peak plasma 
concentration (T max), area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC 0-inf), will be 
determined as able and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
10.3.3 Safety Analyses  
All subjects who receive oral treprostinil (study drug)  will be included in the safety 
population.  Statistical summaries of safety data will be descriptive and exploratory in nature, 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  78 of 98 focusing on the incidence of adverse experiences.  The safety data collected in this study will 
be presented in listings and summary tables.  
Treatment -emergent c hanges in vital signs, ECG recordings, incidence of treatment -emergent 
AEs, and treatment -emergent changes in clinical laboratory parameters (i.e., hematology, 
clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) and physical examination will be evaluated.   
All AEs will b e coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) dictionary.  The incidence of AEs within each cohort will be presented in 
summary tables overall and by [CONTACT_6657].  
Vital sign and clinical laboratory  data collected prior to dosing will serve as Baseline values 
for evaluation of data collected during the treatment period.  Summary statistics will be 
calculated for measured values at each time point assessed, as well as change from baseline 
values withi n each cohort. 
No inferential statistical analyses are planned for safety data.  
10.[ADDRESS_545252] enrolled in C ohort 1 and transitioned from IV/SC 
Remodulin, the safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_43599].  The IV/SC Remodulin dos e will 
be between 25- 75 ng/kg/min, inclusive, for the first five subjects enrolled in Cohort 1.  
Following the DSMB safety review, the dose range may be expanded to 25- 125 ng/kg/min, 
inclusive, for the remaining subjects.  
Additionally, if two or more of the first five subjects within a ny cohort meet the pre -specified 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_288594], the data from that cohort will be reviewed prior to enrolling additio nal 
subjects into that cohort.  
Analysis of pharmacokinetic samples may be performed, as warranted, to guide dosing. 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  [ADDRESS_545253], descriptive summaries will include number of 
observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum for continuous 
variables and n and percent for categorical variables.  For all continuous variable summaries, 
n, arithmetic mean, median, minimum, maximum, SD, % coefficient of variation (CV), and 
95% confidence interval (CI) for the arithmetic mean will be provided.  
Plasma concentration data and derived pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized and 
displayed in both tabular and graphical form.  Noncompartmental analysis of concentration 
time data will be performed using WinNonlin.  Comparative plots of individual concentration 
data will be produced separately for each cohort as well as summaries across subjects.

The Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designated member of his/her staff will probe each subject for 
any AEs that may have occurred.  The Investigator should always ask the same question whe n 
conducting the verbal probe in order to ensure uniformity between subjects.  The Investigator 
should ask:  
 “How are you doing (feeling)?”  
Based on the subject’s response to this question, the Investigator should ask additional 
questions relevant to the s pecific complaint such as:  
 “How severe is/was the symptom?” 
 “How often did the symptom occur?”  
 “How long did the symptom last?”  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all diagnostic and laboratory tests 
as they become available  and ascertain if there is a clinically significant change from baseline.  
If the results are determined to be a clinically significant change from baseline, this  should be 
reported as an AE.  The Investigator may repeat the diagnostic procedure or laborat ory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original tests.  When possible, a diagnosis 
associated with the abnormality should be used as the reported AE . 
Using provided definitions, the Investigator will then:  
(1) rate the intensity and seriousness of the AE,  
(2) estimate the causality of the AE to oral treprostinil (study drug ), and  
(3) note actions taken to counteract the AE.  
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  93 of 98 Definitions of Intensity, Seriousness, Causality, Action Taken, and Outcome  
INTENSITY  
An assessment of the relative intensity (severity) of an AE is based on the Investigator’s 
clinical judgment.  The maximum intensity encountered during the evaluation period should 
be checked. The assessment of intensity should be independent of the assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE.  
SERIOUSNESS  
A serious AE is one that represents an actual or potential significant hazard.  This includes, 
but is not limited to, an event that is fatal, life -threatening, permanently or severely disabling, 
requires or p rolongs inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is a congenital abnormality (offspring of 
subject) or is medically significant (important medical events that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious AE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3768]:  
• Routi ne treatm ent or monitoring of the study indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a routine RHC). 
• Treatment which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing condition not 
associated with any deterioration  in condition (e.g., pre -planned operation which does 
not lead to further complications etc.).  
• Treatment of an emergency, in an outpatient setting for an event not fulfilling any of 
the definitions of serious as given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_393026]. 
CA[LOCATION_003]LITY 
An estimate of causality between a specified AE and the study drug is made by [CONTACT_3786].  Several factors should be considered when determining causality.  These factors 
include temporal relationship and response to withdrawal or reintroduction of the study drug.   
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  94 of 98 Definitions of the causality categories are as follow s: 
• NOT RELATED  - there is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration 
(too early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship 
between another drug, or concurrent disease and the SAE ,  or any of the following:  
• An event that precedes the first administration of the study drug  
• An event for which  the cause is clearly related to an external event;  
• Temporal relationship  to study drug is atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]  
• Is readily explained  by [CONTACT_431057], duration, and resolution  
• An alternative explanation (concomitant drug, intercurrent illness) is likely.  
• POSSIBLE - there is a reasonable causal r elationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear - study drug administration was 
not modified in response to the SAE, or any of the following:  
• Has a reasonable temporal re lationship to study drug 
• The event has a plausible biological link to the activity of the study drug  
• Is unlikely to be related to an intercurrent illness or has an unexpected degree of 
severity, duration or complication  
• Unlikely due to an alternative illness or external event (e.g. surgical procedure, 
accident)  
• PROBABLE  - there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
SAE.  The event responds to dechallenge - the event resolves or improves with 
modification of study drug administration.  Rechallenge (the original study drug dose 
was not restarted) is not required or any of the following:  
• Has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug  
• The event has a plausible biological link to the activity of the study drug  
• Not readily explained by [CONTACT_3813]  
• Not re adily explained by [CONTACT_3814]  
• Improves on discontinuation of study drug  
• If study drug  had been discontinued, may recur on reintroduction of study drug 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  95 of 98 ACTION TAKEN  
STUDY DRUG DOSE MODIFICATION*  
• Dose Not Changed -  the dose or regimen of the study drug was not changed. 
• Drug Interrupted -  administration of the study drug was stopped temporarily . 
• Drug Withdrawn - administration of the study drug was stopped permanently and 
not restarted . 
• Unknown -  changes to the administration of the study drug cannot be determined. 
• Not Applicable  
*NOTE:  Only the last study drug action should be recorded in the eCRF.  For example, if the 
study drug is withdrawn and then the decision is made to restart, the dose modification of 
“Drug interrupted” should be reported on the  SAE form.  
OUTCOME  
• Fatal - The study subject died.  
• Not Recovered / Not Resolved -  The AE was ongoing at the time of death or at the 
time the subject was lost to follow up. 
• Recovered / Resolved - The AE resolved . 
• Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae - The AE is considered resolved however 
there is a residual sequelae.   Some events do not return to baseline, such as 
metastasis or progression of disease; however, once these events are determined by 
[CONTACT_431058], the Investigator may c onsider the event to 
be resolved or resolved with sequelae.  
• Recovering / Resolving -  The AE is improving but is not yet completely 
recovered /resolved.  
• Unknown -  The outcome of the AE cannot be determined.

Collection, Processing and Shipment of Plasma Specimens  
Cohort 1:  A total of  8 approximately 3 mL blood specimens (approximately 24 mL) fo r PK 
analysis will be collected from each subject during the study.  Pharmacokinetic samples will 
be collected at Baseline and Week 24. 
Cohorts 2 and 3: A total of 5  approximately 3 mL blood specimens (approximately 1 5 mL) 
for PK  analysis will be collected from each subject during the study.  Pharmacokinetic 
samples will be collected at Week 24 only.  
Pharmacokinetic Specimen Collecti on 
Collection may occur by [CONTACT_431059] a saline lock; the use of heparin is not  
permitted.  
Cohort 1:   The  Baseline PK  sampling wi ll begin with a time 0  sample and the following 
subsequent time points:  4 and 8 hours after time 0.  At Basel ine, time 0 should be at the same 
time of the day that it is estimated the Week 24  oral treprostinil (study drug) dose will occur.  
All Cohorts:   No oral treprostinil dose changes are allowed within five days of the Week [ADDRESS_545269] daily dose (morning dose) of oral 
treprostinil.  If a subject is on a QID dosing regimen, the Investigator may conduct the PK 
assessment based on the first daily dose (morning dose) or the second daily dose (midday 
dose) at their discretion.  The PK assessment dose of study drug at Week 24 should occur 
approximately 8 hours after the prior evening’s last dose of oral treprostinil for subjects using 
the morning dose for the PK assessment.  When using the midday dose for the PK assessment , 
the midday dose of study drug should occur 4 to 6 hours after  that d ay’s morning dose .  The 
Week 24 PK sampling will begin with a pre -dose sample (immediately prior [i.e., 10 minutes 
±5 minutes] to the administration of the PK assessment  oral treprostinil [study drug] dose), 
and the following subsequent time points:  2, 4,  6, and 8 hours after the PK assessment  dose 
United Therapeutics Corp. TDE -PH-206 
Version :  Amendment 2_FINAL_01Sep2016  Page  97 of 98 of study drug (all time points will be based off of the time the PK assessment  dose of study 
drug is administered).   
If the subject is on a TID regimen, no other doses of oral treprostinil should be taken during 
the PK  sampling period; subjects should take their  next dose of oral treprostinil (midday dose)  
after the fina l 8-hour PK  sample is collected.  
If the subject is on a QID regimen, the subject will take their next daily dose (midday dose or 
early evening [ PM #1]  based on timing of PK assessment dose) between the 4 and 6 hour time 
point s of the PK  sampling (± 10 minutes) with food, based on the subjects typi[INVESTIGATOR_431014].   
Samples should be drawn within a ± [ADDRESS_545270] the time and reason for late blood draws in the eCRF.  Hemolyzed blood samples may 
be redrawn.  Indicate hemolyzed sample in the eCRF.  
Specimen Processing  
• Collect approximately a [ADDRESS_545271] the specimen on ice.  
• Within 1 hour of collection, centrifuge the specimen at 4 ºC for 10- 15 minutes at 
3000 g.

Version 10; May 07, [ADDRESS_262057] being proposed?: Given the importance of inflammation as a predictor of 
cardiovascular mortality in ESRD21, 24, reductions in biochemical inflammatory markers have been 
proposed as critical target outcomes in this population25. Several anti-inflammator y strategies have been 
utilized in this direction assessing nutritional26 as well as pharmacological interventions23, 27, 28. Although 
the results of these trials hold promise, many invest igators recognized different sources of inflammation  
in these patients, which need to be resolved in order to achieve the most optimal responses21, 29. As 
expected, the inflammatory modulation requires concurrent therapy of the multiple comorbidities, which characterize this population
30, 31 32. The present multidisciplinary proposal is significant because 
it promises to:
1. Reduce inflammatory burden in ESRD through systematic and ongoing oral health and  
behavioral interventions treating or al infections within dialysis units.
2. Improve access to care and quality of life in ESRD as measured by [CONTACT_218166].
3. Facilitate care quality improvement and management  of ESRD patients as well as expand 
performance of dialysis units.
This proposal focuses on targeting chronic period ontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of biofilm 
etiology, which causes connective tissue and bone destruction and, consequently, leads to tooth loss1 33. 
Chronic periodontitis is associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis, adverse pregnancy outcomes, 
rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_59499]34, 35 36-38. 
Although recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_218139] a severe periodontitis pr evalence of ~8.5% in the 
general US population2, this prevalence increased up to ~40% in some racial groups with CKD3, 4, 9 5. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_218140]/NIDCR K23 Mentored 
Patient-Oriented Research Career Developme nt Award (K23DE0186 89), which has successfully 
achieved 4 major goals: 1) to assess the prevalence of periodontal infections in CKD, 2) to examine the 
impact of periodontitis on the systemic inflammatory st atus of CKD patients following oral interventions 
and 3) to produce pi[INVESTIGATOR_218141] 4) to develop multidisciplinary 
partnerships securing strong recruitment strategies and effective regulatory processes.
Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  (NHANES) III database, we 
demonstrated significantly higher periodontitis prevalence accentuated by [CONTACT_218167] 
(Table 1)5, which exceeds 50% in ESRD6, 39-42. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_218142] n as a critical public health 
problem (Healthy People 2020), disease awar eness in CKD/ESRD populations is low43. Therefore, oral  
health promotion as well as effective treatmen t and prevention with focus on improving systemic 
inflammation and oxidative stress should be come a priority in these populations.

4Why is the research needed?
Within the last decades, the high inflammatory burd en in ESRD has been att ributed to the “uremic 
puzzle” with pi[INVESTIGATOR_218143]20 contributing to cardiovascular  
(CVD) mortality. We now know that the complexity of the “uremic puzzle” extents past the Framingham  
CVD risk factors involving systemic inflammation an d oxidative stress as variables strongly associated 
with poor CVD outcomes in CKD20. Overwhelming evidence has indicated that the enzymatic activity of 
myeloperoxidase links oxidative stress and inflammat ion in uremia emphasizing the importance of both 
in the atherosclerotic process22. Consequently, research has focused on  identifying factors contributing 
to systemic inflammation and oxidative stress at differe nt levels. At an ethnic level, several culture- 
related dietary habits have been identified as  anti-inflammatory correlating with low CVD risk26. Dialysis 
related factors such as membrane bio- incompatibility, type of access, impure dialysate have also been 
linked to systemic inflammation53. At the patient level, additional comorbid factors including bacterial 
infections, volume overload, failed transplant and de pression have been implicated in the elevation of 
serum CRP 32 and were targeted in anti-inflammatory therapeutic efforts21, 32.
Table 2 : Logistic regression models confirming the impact of periodontitis extent and severity on inflammation in CKD
In the same context, the American Heart Association has recognized the independent association 
between periodontitis and systemic inflammation54 as expressed by [CONTACT_218169] 6 (I L-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP)55-57. Our group and others 
produced evidence supporting the contribution of pe riodontitis to inflammation in CKD as measured by 
[CONTACT_218170]7, 9, 11. As seen in Table 2 chronic periodontitis is associated with ~100% increase in the odds 
of elevated serum CRP levels in the parsimonio us regression model. Moreover, the impact of 
periodontitis on serum CRP levels has been shown to be significant  in ESRD with a dose-response 
association between hsCRP and periodontitis stages 58.
As confirmed by [CONTACT_218171]59, other infections have  
shown to result in increased levels of inflammatory  
mediators in dialysis patients and to consequently contribute to atherosclerosis process and increased mortality 
18, 48, 60. Therefore, the relationship between 
periodontitis and CKD is po tentially bi-directional in  
nature, with CKD/ESRD not only potentiating 
periodontitis incidence, but periodontitis likely contributing to sustained inflammation  and poor outcomes in CKD/ESRD. Thes e  observations led to 
interventional studies with a goal to assess the effect of oral periodontal therapy on inflammatory mediators as surrogate markers of CVD risk. Within the scope of the K award, we conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_218144], [CONTACT_218191], and studying the effect of periodontal therapy on systemic inflammation and
oxidative stress in ESRD patients with periodontitis (NCT 01094639). We recruited 16 dialysis patients, 
who were randomly assigned to two arms. One arm received a single course of periodontal therapy and
 
the other arm was untreated during the observat ion period. For both arms  oral examination and blood

Version 10; May 07, [ADDRESS_262058] with the 
following inclusion criteria: a) older than  21 years, b) having periodontitis 61, c) non-smoker, d) no  
vascular access infection within the last month, e)  no periodontal therapy within the last year. We  
quantified serum hsCRP (inflammatio n) and F2-isofurans (oxidative st ress) as primary outcomes. Using 
general linear modeling, we found that hsCRP (Fig. 2)
and F2-isofurans (Fig.3) were reduced following periodontal therapy as compared to the control group (Ioannidou & Himmelfarb, unpublished data),
 
although no statistically significant difference was observed due to the limited sample size. More specifically, the 40% reduction in hsCRP levels was 
found to be similar to th e hsCRP reduction observed 
following conversion from the central venous catheter 
to fistula18. These results are in agreement with other 
reports confirming a short-term (2-month follow-up) 
positive treatment effect on the inflammatory markers  
in ESRD15, 16, 62-66. However, only one long-term 
randomized controlled trial on periodontal treatment effect extended to 6-months in ESRD and revealed no
 
difference in inflammatory changes between the arms
15. In a critical appraisal of the above trial, the 
main study limitation was the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564], single periodontal therapy approach without any attempt for
 
maintenance, as confirmed by  [CONTACT_218172]. Clearly, that approa ch was not effective enough
to promote optimal oral hygiene, and prevent recurrent periodontitis and control systemic 
inflammation 67-69. In our model, the dialysis outpatient centers could serve as an archetype for  
continuous in center oral health maintenance as show n below in our approach and recruitment strategy. 
For anti-inflammatory strategies to be effective, they inclusively need to consider all comorbidities30, 31. 
Consequently, the scientific questi on in this proposal is: could systematic and repeated periodontal 
interventions modulate systemic inflammation in ESRD?
Innovation: The highly prevalent periodontal infection, al though recognized as a cause of persistent 
inflammation in ESRD6 and associated with increased CVD mortality risk8, 58, its treatment and  
prevention in a constant and systematic manner has never been studied. Cu rrently, only 11% of 
CKD/ESRD individuals have one dental visit a year43 due to low socioeconomic status and low oral  
health awareness. Therefore, well-designed intervent ional studies are essential for the development of 
systematic treatment and maintenance protocols in ESRD. As kidney transplant is considered highly preferred modality of renal replacement, infection-f ree oral environment is a major priority, relevant to 
the approximately 19% of dialysis patients receiving a kidney transplant within the first year of dialysis
70. 
The proposed study is innovative because it is the first study to:
● Assess the long-term effect of repeated oral he alth interventions on serial changes of systemic 
inflammatory and oxidative stress as well as nutritional biomarkers  in ESRD patients.
● Offer a global testing of our hypoth esis by [CONTACT_218173]-re ported outcomes as supported 
by [CONTACT_218174], Food and Drug Admin istration guidelines on clinical 
studies (FDA guidelines, 2009) and the NIH road map for re-engineering the Clinical Research 
Enterprise (2002).
● Establish treatment protocol safety data by [CONTACT_218175].
● Implement a systematic oral care model not in an academic center but in the urban setting of the 
selected dialysis units, embracing population ethnic and socioeconomic diversity.

3.Hypotheses, aims and objectives
Hypothesis:
Given the well-documented inflammatory and oxidativ e stress burden in ESRD and its implication 
to cardiovascular (CVD) mortality 19, current research focuses on anti-inflammatory nutritional and  
pharmacological strategies 20-23. Although results from these trials h old promise, different sources of 
inflammation such as untreated periodontitis have b een recognized in ESRD limiting the magnitude of 
the effect21. Therefore, untreated periodontitis may be a forgotten comorbidity. This proposal aims to 
assess the anti-inflammatory effect of repeated and re gular oral health interventions, which will target 
periodontitis in ESRD. We hypothesize that there is a difference in the response to repeated and  
ongoing vs. single periodontal interventions as measured by: a) patient- centered outcomes, b) 
inflammatory, oxidative stress and nut ritional biomarkers as well as c) clinical oral outcomes. This will 
be achieved by [CONTACT_218176]:Specific aim 1 : We aim to compare the difference ( Δ) in patient-centered as well as clinical oral
 
outcomes between ESRD subjects re ceiving repeated (Test group) an d the standard-of-care (Control) 
periodontal therapy. For this aim, we will measure and compare patient-centered outcome (Oral Health  
Impact Profile-14 survey) reflecting patient’s perspective on oral health at baseline and 6-months. The  
clinical oral outcomes will evaluate the clinical response and effectiveness of the intervention at each  
time point.
Specific aim 2: We aim to compare the difference (Δ) in outcomes of systemic inflammation (C- 
reactive protein, Interleukin 6), oxidative stress (F2-isoprostanes, and isof urans), and nutrition 
(albumin) in the repeated vs. stand ard-of-care periodontal therapy in ESRD at baseline and 6-months.  
To accomplish this, we will collect blood samples fr om all patients at each time point. Serial changes of  
the inflammatory and oxidative stress markers will also be evaluated during the observational period 
and correlated with clinical disease markers.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_218145]/CKD-perio dontitis interactions and has developed strong 
partnerships with several outpatient  dialysis units in two states, which will facilitate patient recruitment. 
With this study, we will change the paradigm of care in ESRD proposing a novel model of oral  
interventions. We aim to show that, as with any ot her therapeutic approaches, repeated (not epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]) 
oral interventions could be more effective in promoting oral health and controlling systemic 
inflammation in ESRD. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_218146]. If the feasibility of this model is 
established, then longitudinal studies will aim to determine the synergistic systematic treatment effect 
of multiple comorbidities including period ontitis on all cause and CVD mortality.
4.Study Design & Procedures
Screening Procedures and who will perform them: ESRD subjects will be screened at visit [ADDRESS_262060].
Recruitment Strategy: As a result of the K23 award,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_218147] a strong multidisciplinary 
research team that successfully partnered with seve ral dialysis outpatient  units in Connecticut and  
[LOCATION_005]. This resulted in a community-based network among the Principal Investigator, the study 
coordinator, calibrated dental providers, nephrologists, nurses, and dieticians in the units. Moreover,  
we have developed a recruitment strategy involving an active and close collaboration with the unit stakeholders (nephrologist, nurse manager and dietician) in order to achieve higher study acceptance 
rates 
71. Physical limitations and fatigue, which may prevent this population from independent everyday 
transportation,  have  been  identifi ed  as  major  barriers  for  resear ch  study  participation  in  thisIRB NUMBER : 16-111- 1
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 06 /07/2018
Version 10; May 07, [ADDRESS_262061]  developed a community-based model, which 
has been effective with the retention and adherence rates. Based on this model, we will utilize mobile 
dental units, which facilitate examinations and periodontal therapy in the dialysis units using the isolation rooms to secure privacy and confidentiality. We systematically review our recruitment and
 
retention rates as well as feedback from patients in the team’s monthly meetings.
ESRD patients will be recruited at the Dialysis Unit s of the University of Conne cticut Health Center, and  
the DCI Unit in Manchester, CT. The recruitment strategy includes study fliers posted in different 
locations including UCONN Health Ne phrology and Dental Clinics and Di alysis Outpatient Units as well 
as DCI Unit in Manchester, CT. Th e PI [INVESTIGATOR_218148]. Trivedi (UCONN He alth and DCI Units) as a Co- 
Investigator in the study. All recruitment strategies and material will be approved by [CONTACT_218177] (IRB). Once UCONN Health  IRB is approved, while DCI will follow a separate 
IRB process utilizing UCONN IRB approved consent forms.
Patient selection will be based upon administrative patient list review and/or study flyer. In case administrative list review is employed, medical record review will be performed by [CONTACT_218178]. The nephrologist/dialysis unit director will then review the proposed selection list base d on clinical judgment and the pre-screening criteria.
 
We have also developed recruitment tools (Pre-scr eening Form, study brochures ), which are practical 
and easy to implement in order to assist the nephrologist and dialysis personnel during the pre- screening process. Once the pre-screening process is completed, the ESRD subjects will contact [CONTACT_218179]. After an expl anation of the study, the overall risk/benefits 
analysis, written consent will be sought from each of  the participants. Following consent, patients will 
receive a brief oral exam to establish eligibility based on the Screening Form . Dental sessions will be 
scheduled based on patient choice but preferably prior dialysis session to minimize patient fatigue.
Our team has an extensive experience with the dent al management of ESRD patients. Our protocol has 
derived from a close collaboration be tween the dental and renal teams.
●Prior to entering the study and any oral interventio n, ESRD patient with recent complete blood count 
is cleared by [CONTACT_200480].
●Prior and during the dental procedures, vital signs are monitored as a standard of care in dialysis.
●Since several drug metabolism and elimination takes place in the kidney, and for protocol adhesion, only analgesics such as acetaminophen and anti -inflammatory drugs such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_218149] “realistically dosed”, resulting to either  a dose reduction or prolongation of the dosing 
interval. If any other anti-inflammatory medication is needed, the patient will be excluded from the study (as per exclusion criteria)
●There is no evidence-based recommendation on the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the dental management of ESRD patients due to the lack of data on the duration and effects of transient 
bacteremia post dental intervention. Our pr eliminary study, which was conducted without 
antibiotics, had in no adverse events to report. Trans ient bacteremia has been shown to resolve in less 
than 20min in systemically healthy in dividuals (Lockhart et al., 2008).  Antibiotic overutilization and
 
misuse result in selection of resistant microorganisms and reduced antibiotic efficacy. Therefore, in  
our study we plan to use antibiotics wisely only if  recommended by [CONTACT_218180]- 
risk patients.
Methods
Study design and Subject selection: The proposed study will be a two parallel arm feasibility clinical trial  
that will recruit [ADDRESS_262062] subjects with periodont itis in a model of computerized block randomization,  
which will facilitate recruitment in each outpatient  dialysis unit. Blocks will be determined as per 2x2x2  
a priori categorization of age, race and gender. M ore specifically, the participants in 2 dialysis units 
(UCONN Dialysis/ DCI and DCI Manc hester) will be randomly assigned to the study arms using a  
computer randomization program. As a result, once se quences are determined by [CONTACT_30165], they 
will be concealed in opaque envelops  and opened prior to the first recruitment in the unit. This study 
will include participants treated with dialysis [ADDRESS_262063] patients in recruitment sites, we estimated approximately 450 patients with  periodontitis. Individuals will be included in theIRB Review

Subject characteristics and justifications:
oAge: 21 years of age or older
oEthnicity: Please see NIH enrollment data in  the grant application
oGender: Same as above
oVulnerable Population NA
oOther characteristics - (e.g. vulnerable populations; primary language etc.): NA
Intervention: The Test arm will receive treatment and maintenance sessions. Briefly, treatment sessions 
will include oral hygiene behavioral  modification and scaling and r oot planning (removing the bacterial 
biofilm and calculus below th e gum line) in order to eliminate etiologic factors and control periodontal 
inflammation. More specifically, the behavioral interventions will include oral hygiene instructions with 
specific techniques of tooth brushing and flossing de monstrated on typodont. In order to standardize 
the oral hygiene session (intervent ion fidelity), the providers will be trained to follow specific oral  
hygiene guidelines with re-calibration on the prot ocol procedures every 3 months to maintain study 
quality control. Once the treatment sessions are completed, the patients will enter the maintenance phase and will be followed for 6 months. In this phase, the patients will receive systematic supportive periodontal treatment (tooth cleanings above the gum line with re-enforceme nt of oral hygiene). 
Outcomes will be assessed at 2-, 4-, and 6-months.Control: The Control arm will receive only a single se ssion of treatment without maintenance sessions 
(see visit Table in Human Subject Protection section). Outcomes will be assessed at 2-, 4-, and 6-months.
 
Dental Treatment Needs: Throughout the course of the study, additional dental needs for both Arms  
(Test and Control) will be addressed with immediat e referral to the Advanced General Dentistry 
Program at the UCONN Health or the subject’s own general dentist.Strategies to Improve Adherence : We systematically review our recruitment and retention rates as well 
as feedback from patients in the team’s bi-weekly meetings. For treatmen t fidelity, the study staff will be 
trained to follow an oral hygiene script and guidelines followed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-calibration on the protocol 
procedures every three months to maintain study quality control. The OHIP-14 will be filled during oral  
hygiene session in an interactive interview form following provider training on the questionnaire 
administration to control for treatment fidelity.

91)Inflammatory Markers (Primary Outcomes) and Ox idative Stress Markers (Secondary outcomes): 
We aim to measure serum CRP (pri mary outcome) as a biomarker of  inflammation as well as IL-6, F2  
isofurans and F2 isoprostanes as markers of oxidat ive stress linked to atherosclerosis and poor CVD in  
ESRD22. A single serum CRP elevated measure has been shown to pred ict poor outcomes and sudden 
death in ESRD75. Additional studies showed that IL-[ADDRESS_262064].20
2)Patient-centered outcome (Secondary outcome): Given the wide recognition of patient-centered 
outcome research by [CONTACT_218182] (AHRQ) and the NIH 77, the 
validated OHIP-14 (true outcome)  will evaluate patient’s perce ption of oral status change [ADDRESS_262065] patients 81. The oral health relate d quality of life will 
be assessed with the OHIP-14 questionnaire 82. The response codes for the items in this tool are based on  
a five-point scale, ranging from “never” to “all the time”.
3)Clinical Periodontal Paramete rs (Secondary Outcomes): The baseline full mouth periodontal 
examination will include missing teeth, probing de pth (PD), bleeding on pr obing (BOP), clinical 
attachment loss (CAL), and plaque score (PS) at six sites on all teeth. BOP is an indicator of gingival  
(gum) inflammation and presence of active disease 83. Periodontal parameters will be measured at 
baseline, at 2-, 4- and 6-mont hs. Changes in probing depth ( ΔPD) and BOP ( ΔBOP) will be considered 
as the clinical outcome of treatmen t effectiveness and clinical response.
4)Nutrition Biomarkers: Serum albumin levels have been wide ly associated with malnutrition and  
mortality in ESRD 84. We will use albumin levels less than 3.6g/dL as cutoff for malnutrition 85, 86. As 
serum albumin has been associated with poor oral  health status (Ioannidou et a. 2013), we will assess 
changes in these biomarkers as a result oral intervention.
5)Adverse Event Frequency (Secondary outcome): For this outcome, pain , swelling, number of 
analgesics used (continuous) and presence of or al ulcers (dichotomous) will be recorded. More 
specifically, pain and swelling will be measured by [CONTACT_119920] (10cm horizont al Visual Analogue Scale, 
VAS).
Study Procedures and who will perform them:
Pre-screen Phase:
The nephrologist will review the potential subject’s me dical record to determine patient eligibility based 
on the criteria of the Nephrologist Pre-screen Form questions. The nephrologist will present the study to 
the potential subject and provide DCRC study contact [CONTACT_82753]. If the potential subject is interested 
in participating, they will call the DCRC. At the time  of the phone call from the pre-screened potential 
subject, the DCRC study staff will read the telephone script and collect name [CONTACT_218190] 1.
Visit 1: ESRD subjects will be consented in the dia lysis outpatient units. Following the consent, the 
medical history will be reviewed and vital signs wi ll be tested. During the screening process, brief 
periodontal examination will be performed to clear the periodontal inclusion criteria.Visit 2 (Baseline): Full mouth periodontal examination will include: numbers of missing teeth, pocket 
depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque sc ore (PS), bleeding on probing (BOP). In the same 
visit the OHIP-14 will be contact[CONTACT_218183]. Blood  sample (6.5ml) will be 
collected for baseline inflammat ory, oxidative stress and nut ritional markers for both arms.
Visits 3-4 (Day 0): Full mouth scaling/root planning (Deep cleaning below the gum line) under local 
anesthesia will  be  performed  to  remove etiologic fa ctors  of  the  disease  in both  arms  in  one  or  2  
appointments. At the end of the visit, both gr oups will receive oral hygiene instructions.

assessment will be performed. Both arms will rece ive the OHIP-14. Blood samples (6.5ml) will be 
collected for inflammatory, oxidative stress and nutriti onal markers for both arms. At the end of the study 
both arms will receive supportive periodontal tr eatment including supragingival debridement and  
mechanical instrumentation (tooth cleaning) and oral hygiene reinfor cement. Any remaining pockets will 
be treated with limited deep cleaning with local anesthesia.
Power Analysis : For power analysis, we assumed a Type I error rate α=0.05 and a Type II error, β =0.20  
(1-β=0.80)[36]. Based on the preliminary data analysis of independent CRP changes, and after adjusting 
for time effect, we accepted a medium effect size (d = 0.67). Hence, within the pi[INVESTIGATOR_218150], we 
calculated a sample size of 28 per arm. Given a rep orted 30% attrition rate in ESRD research, we aim to 
enroll up to [ADDRESS_262067] estimate and power analysis of a future large trial.
Therefore the sample size targets 72 en rolled participants with a ceiling of 90.
Explain on what basis it is reasonable to assume that the sample size will be obtained: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_218151]. Therefore, we have an  
available pool of [ADDRESS_262068] and predictable recruitment.IRB Review

11Recruitment and Consent Procedures: Patient recruitment was initiated on November 7th, 2017 with 
expected enrollment completion in April 2019. The trial is currently recruiting patients at UCONN 
Dialysis/DCI and DCI Manchester. The recruitment strategy includes study fliers posted in different 
locations including UCONN Health Nephrology, Dental Clinics and Di alysis Outpatient Units. All 
recruitment strategies and material were approved by [CONTACT_218177] (IRB) and DCI  
ARO. Figure [ADDRESS_262069] review by [CONTACT_218184]’s pre-screening form. The nephrologist reviews the patient selection and,  
based on clinical judgment and the pre-screening c riteria makes the recommendation. We have also 
developed recruitment tools (pre- screening forms, study brochures), which are practical and easy to 
implement in order to assist the nephrologist and dialysis personnel during the pre-screening process. Once the pre-screening process is completed and the patient agrees to be approached, the study coordinator meets with the ESRD patient to present the study, the overall risk/benefits analysis, written consent is sought from each of the participants. The consent process may be extended to more than one meeting given the patient’s level of fatigue [37].
Randomization and Allocation: The study follows  a block randomization scheme. Blocks will be 
determined as per 2X2X2 a priori categorization of age, race and gender. More specifically, the 
participants in two dialysis units (UCONN Dialysis/DCI and DCI Manche ster) will be randomly assigned 
to the study arms using a computer randomization program supervised by [CONTACT_1758]’s biostatistician. 
Once sequences are determined, they remained conc ealed in opaque envelope s and opened prior to 
enrollment in the unit by [CONTACT_9137].Examiner calibration: The calibrated dental hygienis t practices under the supervision of the Principle 
Investigator (PI). Following the calibration proce ss, there was an agreemen t within ±1mm of 96%.
Blinding: At 6-month visit, the final assessment will be  conducted by [CONTACT_978], who will be blinded to the 
study arm.
Methods of Data Collection and Types of Data to be  collected (may refer to attached surveys/ forms etc.)  
Medical data collection: Once enrollment is completed, demographic, anthropometric, medical history 
data will be collected using a standardized data extrac tion form at baseline. The biochemical data will 
include serum albumin, dialysis adequacy (Kt/V), vitamin D levels. Potential confounders will include race, history and duration of diab etes, diabetic control, smoking hi story, history of CVD, body mass 
index (BMI), history of peripheral  arterial disease and comorbid conditions. Additionally, in order to 
assess the magnitude of comorbidities, we will use the Charlson Comorbidity Score, which has been 
validated in ESRD and found appropriate to assess comorbidity prognostic impact
74. Biochemical data 
will be examined at every study time point to assess medical changes.Periodontal Data: Full mouth periodontal examination will include: numbers of missing teeth, pocket 
depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), plaque score (PS), bleeding on pr obing (BOP). PS (O’Leary)  
is a dichotomous measure with the use of disclosing so lution at six sites of all teeth. Pocket depth (PD) is 
the distance from the gingival margin to the base of  the pocket is measured in mm. Bleeding on Probing  
(BOP) is scored after probing depth measurements are taken. Clinical attachment  level (CAL) represents 
the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the base of the pocket in mm. For all measures, six  
sites around each tooth will be examined: mesial-bucca l, buccal, distal-buccal, distal-lingual, lingual and  
mesial-lingual.
Blood Collection and Analyses: Blood samples will be drawn prior to dialysis session at each 
participating dialysis unit. Sample s will be centrifuged at 3000rpm for 15 minutes and then transported 
on ice. Samples will be coded and stored at -70°C. IL-6 and hsCRP levels will analyzed in dublicate by 
[CONTACT_218185] (Car millo, CA) and Diagnostic  Systems Laboratories  
(Webster, TX). Oxidative stress markers will be quantified by [CONTACT_218186] F2-  
isoprostane and isofuran concentrations with gas chromatography as described before 23. Serum 
albumin will be measured by [CONTACT_218187]  
([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).IRB Review

12Statistical methods: All analyses wi ll follow the intent-to-treat principle. Given an attrition of rate of 
approximately 30% in the dialysis population, missing da ta will likely be from different sources (e. g.,  
failure to complete questionnaire, study dropout, death). We will, therefore, utilize the multiple 
imputation algorithms of the IBM SPSS Missing Value s 22 software[39, 40] to impute missing data. Data 
will be screened as recommended[4 1]. Standard diagnostic proced ures will examine whether multivariate 
outliers exist, as well test for deviations from normality and linearity among dependent measures. When  
continuous measures are skewed, linear transformat ion will be attempted in order to preserve the 
inherent power of the continuous me tric[42]. Descriptive analysis for all four time points will be including 
continuous measures with means, medians and standard deviations. Given OHIP-14 responses are  
ordinal, we will calculate the responses  based on the “simple count”, sc ore frequencies as used before[43]  
and analyzed with non-parametric methods. Spear man correlation analysis will be used to test 
associations between clinical parameters and patient’s or al health perception. In order to assess the effect 
of the confounding factors on oral response, univar iate model will correlate PD and CAL changes with 
the baseline  parameters, demographic, socioecono mic status variables, as well as diabetic control,  
dialysis adequacy and vintage, vitamin D levels.
Exploratory univariate analysis and test statistics will be conducted to examine variable distribution. 
Outliers defined as more than two standard deviations  from the mean will be detected. All biomarker  
variables will be tested for normality and logarithmically transformed if not normal. All analyses will
include means and standard deviations for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. For skewed variables, analyses will show median and interquartile ranges. CRP and IL-6
 
changes ( ΔCRP and ΔIL6) will be the dependent variables for hypo thesis testing between the two arms.  
We will use a 3-level (time, subject, and cluster) hi erarchical linear mode ling technique[44] in the 
analysis of the data. The intercept (as a more robust in dicator of initial baseline  status) and slope (as an  
indicator for change, modeled as linear) are crea ted for each subject. Predictors of inflammatory  
response will be assessed at subject level as well as subject nested within arm/recruitment site level. 
Additional secondary analyses will assess changes in the nutritional markers. The HLM will isolate predictors of inflammatory and oxidative stress response based on clinical phenotype, medical 
confounders, and cluster data.
Retention efforts: Physical limitations and fatigue, which may prevent this population from independent 
everyday transportation, have been identified as major reasons for research study participation in this 
population [38]. Hence, to overcome these difficult ies, we have developed a community-based model, 
which has been effective with the retention and adhe rence rates. Based on this model, we will utilize a  
mobile dental unit that facilitates examinations and periodontal therapy in the isolation room of each 
hemodialysis unit. The isolation room secures privacy for both patient and provider. We systematically 
review our recruitment and retention rates as well as feedback from patients in the team’s monthly meetings.
DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN
We have a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan in plac e, which will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_1201].
 
Based on this plan, the data will be reviewed annua lly. Given that the clinical protocol procedures in the 
proposed study are standard of care procedures with minimal/slight increase over minimal risk, the 
individuals performing the safety monitoring will be the PI, the study coordinator, an institutional colleague, who is not involved in the study, and the IRB.
The data used for safety monitoring will be data related to:
1.Serious adverse events,
2.Dropout rates and reasons for the dropouts,
3.Enrollment numbers,
4.Analysis of outcome data and its relationsh ip to potential changes in study design,
5.Protocol deviations
6.Un-blinded dataIRB Review

13During the course of the study, a copy/summary of the monitor reports and/or minutes will be submitted 
to the IRB, Clinical Research Cent er (CRC) and NIH. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318] e valuate the adverse events and  
determine whether the adverse events affect the risk/ben efit ratio of the study and if modifications in the 
protocol and/or consent form are needed. In case of  adverse events, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_218152], CRC,  
and NIH.
Protection of Confidentiality: The study will be conducted under the supervision of the PI, the co- 
Investigators and the collaborators. Best medical practices will followed during all procedures. All dialysis 
units are staffed with qualified and licensed personnel prepared to address emergencies. Further,  
nephrologist/attending is present at the dialysis units to clear the patient’s medical status. During the course of the study, a copy/summary of the monito r reports and/or minutes will be submitted to the IRB,
 
Clinical Research Center (CRC) and NIH. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_218153]/benefit ratio of the study and if modifications in the protocol and/or  
consent form are needed. In case of adverse events , the PI [INVESTIGATOR_218154], CRC, and NIH. Study 
data will be maintained in a separate research record. All materials and data will be coded with number 
combinations. The code linking the study data to id entifiers will be in the PI’s computer protected by 
[CONTACT_101692]. All study records will be coded in a locked cabinet in a secure area accessible only to research 
staff. A copy of the consent will be placed in the d ialysis unit medical record. All electronic records (e.g.  
database, spreadsheets) will be password protected. Any computer hosting such files will have password
protection to prevent access by [CONTACT_191394]. Acce ss to study data will be restricted to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_218155]-Is as well as the study key personnel. Data that  will be shared with ot hers will be coded to 
confidentiality protection.
Study Management: At the study initiation meeting, a delegation of responsibilities was carried out 
according to which, each investigator, and study personnel agreed to their assigned roles. The study PI  
[INVESTIGATOR_218156]. Ro les were assigned as justified in the research grant  
proposal. At the end of the initiation meeting, a stud y flow sheet was developed with all study procedures 
and practices. The flow sheet follows the study clinical schema as presented above. The flow sheet guarantees that all study activities are completed in the specific time points as described in the research strategy and the endpoints and outcomes are reached.
The study coordinator has been in charge of the regula tory management of the study, which includes the 
development of the regulatory bind er with all essential documents. Th e regulatory binder includes study 
protocol, the study personnel human subject training log, the delegation of responsibilities form, the pre- 
screening and screening forms, consent forms, HIPAA forms, serious adverse events list, protocol deviation reports, and IRB approvals. The study subject chart contains all information about each study visit dated appropriately and precisely as well as a note declaring the procedures completed per visit. The 
pre-screening form is part of the chart. De-identifie d subjects that fail pre-screening are also maintained 
in a separate file. The study coordinator maintains a mas ter subject log list, where all visits of all subjects 
are securely listed. This list guarantees accur ate scheduling based on study time points.
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_218157]. Further, any protocol deviation is documented and reported. All laboratory
 
assessments are maintained in a log list with specimen numbers and dates. An important part of the study 
is the quality management plan, which ensures study quality and adherence to the protocol standards.  
To achieve this, we have established an extensive mo nitoring plan to secure the study design, and achieve 
the endpoints and outcomes. Weekly study team co mmunication and meetings are scheduled to prevent 
any misunderstandings or protocol gaps. The meetings help the team resolve problems and move to corrective actions at once before  they become an established pattern. Every three months, the study 
subject charts are audited internally. To ensure the presence of consent form, pre-screen and screening form, lab requests, data collection forms, missed appointments and notes. Further, the electronic data files and all data variables are crosschecked with the source original data. The subject ID will be also 
crosschecked. Missing data will be left blank. Merg ing files of laboratory and clinical variables will be 
performed carefully based on ID variable.IRB Review

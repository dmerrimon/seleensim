              5 1. STUDY SYNOPSIS 
 
1.1 Overview  
 This is a two -stage phase II clinical trial with the combined primary endpoints to determine the safety, 
feasibility and antitumor activity of adoptive transfer of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) genetically engineered to express the alpha and beta chains of a high affinity T cell receptor (TCR) 
specif ic for the HLA -A*0201- restricted MART -1 melanoma tumor antigen to patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic melanoma. This gene transfer will be affected by a retroviral vector pseudotyped 
with a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelope. The two transgenes genes are linked by a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_295347] 2A sequence. Their expression is driven by [CONTACT_757636] (LTR).  
 Patients with MART -1-positive locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who are HLA -A*0201 -positive, 
and HIV, hepatitis B and C seronegative, will receive a non- myeloablative but lymphocyte depleting 
chemotherapy conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and then receive 
the adoptive transfer of autologous PBMC transduced with the MSGV1- F5AfT2AB retroviral vector, 
which expresses a high affinity TCR for the MART -1 melanoma antigen (MART -1 F5 TCR). The cell 
dose will be up to [ADDRESS_1037186] three patients within this 
protocol (since Amendment 8) , prior to which , thawed cryopreserved cells were infused. Following 
adoptive cell transfer, patients will receive MART -126-35 peptide- pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines and 
low dose interlukin- 2 (IL-2) under Amendment [ADDRESS_1037187]. Stephen A. Rosenberg from the Surgery Branch, National 
Cancer Institute (NCI). The MART -1 F5 TCR is derived from the DMF5 tumor infiltrating lymphocyte 
(TIL) clone, and was selected from several MART -1-specific TCRs because of its high affinity and 
biological activity. This TCR delivered by [CONTACT_757637]/NCI. Both the NCI clinical trial and the trial at  UCLA are based on the same retrovirus 
expressing the MART -1 F5 TCR used to transduce whole PBMC and re -infused to patients after a non -
myeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen. Major differences between both 
clinical trials include the shorter ex vivo  expansion of TCR transduced PBMC, the use of MART -1
26-35 
peptide pulsed DC and the use of positron imaging tomography (PET) for non- invasive imaging of 
adoptively transferred TCR transgenic cells in the UCLA clinical trial.  
The primary endpoints will be safety, feasibility and objective tumor response. The phase II clinical trial 
design will have two treatment stages following a Simon optimal two- stage clinical phase II clinical trial 
design 
1. The clinical trial will have an initial stage w ith [ADDRESS_1037188] MART -1 F5 TCR -induced dose 
limiting toxicities (DLT), then further accrual will not be warranted. Feasibility will be also determined in the first stage, and if [ADDRESS_1037189] objective response 
criteria with a design to rule out a 10% response rate as the null hypothesis, and a 35% response rate as 
the alternative hypothesis. With this statistical design, if [ADDRESS_1037190] a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), which combined result in the objective response rate, the study will be declared positive.  
 Secondary study endpoints are transgenic T cell persistence in humans and their ability to home to 
MART -1 positive melanoma metastasis. Analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_757638] T cell persistence and by [CONTACT_105] -invasive metabolic imaging using PET scans.

1.1.1. Cell Dose Escalation within Amendment 6 after Meeting the Safety and Feasibility Criteria 
But Not Meeting the Initial Antitumor Criteria  
 
Under the initial protocol 8 patients were accrued to stage 1 of this clinical trial. The criteria for safety 
and feasibility were met, with no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and feasibly delivering the intended cell 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. However, the response rate was less  than required to meet the minimal antitumor activity of 
35% response rate, with less than [ADDRESS_1037191] protocol 
from UCLA was  assessed under  Amendment s 6 to 10. Dose escalation to up to 1010 cryopreserved cells 
was undertaken in 2 patients , and then the protocol was additionally modified to administer cells that had 
not undergone cryopreservation (Amendments 8 to 10) in three additional patients. However, two of 
these patients developed SAEs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_757573]. Thereafter, the total adoptively transferred cell dose was decreased back to a maximum of 10
9 cells and the regimen of  
administration of IL -2 was changed to LD IL -2 (Amendment 11).  
 1.2. Rationale and Hypothesis  
 
Rationale for TCR Transgenic Cell Adoptive Transfer Therapy. The adoptive transfer of large 
numbers of clonally -expanded antigen -specific T cells into patients with melanoma that have received a 
conditioning regimen to deplete endogenous lymphocytes (non -myeloablative but lymphodepleting), 
together with high doses of interleukin- 2 (IL-2), results in the highest rate of melanoma responses (50%) 
reported to date 
2,3. This approach provides a proof -of-principle for adoptive transfer immunotherapy for 
metastatic melanoma, but it is difficult to implement outside of pi[INVESTIGATOR_757574]. The ability to generate large numbers of tumor antigen -specific T cells 
by a single ex vivo manipulation consisting of the transduction of melanoma- specific TCR genes may 
result in a more broadly applicable approach for patients with melanoma. In this project we will test the 
hypothesis that the engineering of human PBMC to express a high affinity TCR specific for the human melanoma antigen MART- [ADDRESS_1037192] of patients, assessed by [CONTACT_757639] (see below), then enrollment to stage two w ill not be warranted. The protocol would need to be amended to 
meet the feasibility criteria before further enrollment. Antitumor activity is assessed in the overall phase 2 clinical trial, but the study will only proceed to enroll in stage two if a minimal antitumor activity level is evident in stage one (see below).  
 
 
 
 
MART -1 F5 TCR Protocol  01/10/2018   
 
              7 1.3 Study Objectives:  
 
Primary:  
 
• SAFETY. This TCR and retroviral vector at a cell dose up to [ADDRESS_1037193] been already in clinical 
testing within a reported phase 2 clinical trial at the Surgery Branch/NCI. We started with a maximum of up to [ADDRESS_1037194] 8 patients , we increas ed the dose to a maximum of up to 10
10 (Amendment 
6) which is still one log lower than the maximum cell dose within the NCI protocol. Therefore, 
there was  no need for a standard phase1 dose escalation clinical trial design. After enrolling 
two patients under this increased dose, we further changed to infusion of freshly harvested 
transgenic cells in place of cryopreserved cells, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_757575] 
1010 (Amendment 8). Two out of three patients enrolled under this regimen required 
intubation for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]. Thereby, we propose to decrease the dose to 109 freshly 
harvested MART -1 F5 TCR transgenic cells and change to low dose IL2 in this amendment 
(Amendment 11). Safety continues to be a major concern and a clinical endpoint of t his 
clinical trial. Therefore, the study is designed with an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_757576]. S afety will be determined in stage one, and if [ADDRESS_1037195] MART -1 
F5 TCR -induced DLT, then further accrual will not be warranted.  
 
• FEASIBILITY. This clinical trial intends to deliver two patient -specific cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], the TCR 
transgenic PBMC and MART -[ADDRESS_1037196] -infusion 
high dose IL-2 (up to Amendment 10), and then low dose IL- 2 (after Amendment 11) . This 
protocol has significant technical challenges, making feasibility a primary endpoint and 
requiring a clinical trial design with a feasibility early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. Therefore, feasibility will 
be determined in stage one, and if 3 out of 8 patients cannot receive the intended cellular 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_757577].   
 
• CLINICAL RESPONSE. The overall phase [ADDRESS_1037197] objective response criteria, which are defined 
as adding the rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) at restaging exams 
on day [ADDRESS_1037198] criteria for CR or PR will also be considered as having 
objective response on study. The clinical trial statistical design is aimed at ruling out a 10% 
response rate as the null hypothesis, and has a 35% response rate as the alternative 
hypothesis. The minimum hurdle to proceed from stage one to stage two of this clinical trial 
will be observing at least [ADDRESS_1037199] an objective 
response among 22 evaluable patients enrolled in the two stages of this phase II clinical trial.  
 Secondary:  
 
• MART -1 F5 TCR TRANSGENIC CELL PERSISTENCE. To determine the persistence of 
MART -1 F5 TCR -engineered PBMC in serial peripheral blood samples and in biopsies of 
accessible metastatic melanoma lesions.  
 
• IN VIVO  MOLECULAR IMAGING. To explore the use of PET -based imaging using the PET 
tracer [
18F]FDG with the goal of determining  if the adoptively transferred MART -1 F5 TCR -
MART -1 F5 TCR Protocol  01/10/[ADDRESS_1037200] be HLA- A*0201, have locally advanced (stage IIIc) or metastatic melanoma (stage IV) 
with no standard therapeutic options with a curative intent, that is MART -1-positive, age greater than or 
equal to 18, clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1, life expectancy greater than 3 months, and be seronegative for HIV, Hepatitis B and C (seropositive subjects would be more likely to have toxic effects 
from the conditioning chemotherapy or may not tolerate it). Study subjects should have accessible 
lesions amenable to outpatient tumor biopsies that still allow an adequate assessment of the primary 
endpoint of antitumor activity  and clinical response assessment.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1037201] two treatment stages, an initial one with 8 patients, followed by 
a second stage with 14 additional patients (for a total of 22 patients). All patients will receive the same combined therapy of: 1) a lymphodepleting preparative regimen, 2) autologous PBMC retrovirally -
transduced with a MART -1 F5 TCR, followed by 3) IL- 2 and 4) MART -1
26-35 peptide–pulsed DC.   
 
1.6 Study Duration:  
 
Total duration of the st udy is estimated to be approximately 18- [ADDRESS_1037202] PBMC. The manufacture of both transgenic T 
cells and DC will be started on the day of leukapheresis. Immediately after processing the PBMC, 
1.5x10
9 PBMC will be  put in activation media containing OKT3 (anti -CD3 antibody) and IL -[ADDRESS_1037203] day for later use.

4.1 Primary:

clinical experiences, including a completed and reported phase 2 clinical trial by [CONTACT_757640]/NCI 
7, and the second experience being the [ADDRESS_1037207] of F5 TCR transgenic 
cells after a lymphodepletion protocol with high dose IL- 2 and DC vaccination was well tolerated with 
no dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) developed in the first [ADDRESS_1037208] protocol from UCLA was  assessed in stage 
1 of the protocol described in Amendment 6. Dose escalation to up to 1010 cells was undertaken in the 
following 2  patients , and after that the protocol was additionally modified to administer cells that had 
not undergone cryopreservation (Amendment 8) in three additional patients. However,  two of these 
patients had serious adverse events (SAE) of respi[INVESTIGATOR_757573]. Therefore, the total adoptively transferred cell dose was decreased back to a maximum of 10
9 cells and the regimen 
of administration of IL -2 was changed t o LD IL -2 (Amendment 11).  
 Safety evaluations will continue into the second stage of the study and the same early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_757578]. Safety remains the priority in all phases and 
stage of the investigational studies.  
 
4.1.2 Feasibility  
 
This protocol attempts to administer two cell -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_757579] (GMP). Each cell therapy, the MART -[ADDRESS_1037209] stage, and if 3 out of 8 
patients cannot receive the intended cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or there is suboptimal TCR transgenic cell 
persistence in vivo , further accrual will not be warranted. The feasibility assessment will be based on:  
 i) Potential problems in the manufacturing of MART- 1 F5 TCR engineered PBMC or the MART -
1

ii) Suboptimal number of MART -[ADDRESS_1037210] objective response criteria. The rate of CR 
plus PR will be used to assess the primary endpoint of antitumor activity with a clinical trial design to 
rule out a 10% response rate as the null hypothesis, and 35% response rate as the alternative 
hypothesis. Response assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_757641] +90 after the TCR transgenic PBMC adoptive transfer.

 4.2.1 MART -1 F5 TCR Transgenic T Cell Persistence.  
 
The persistence of MART -1 F5 TC R-engineered cells will be determined by [CONTACT_757642] T cells with the MART -1 F5 TCR by [CONTACT_757643]. In addition and when technically feasible, samples from metastatic melanoma

15 sites will be biopsied and assessed for the presence of the MART -1 F5 transgenic cells by [CONTACT_4658], PCR 
and/or immune monitoring assays in non- adherent TIL.  
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1037211] serial PET molecular imaging using the tracer [
18F]FDG  to determine changes in the metabolic rate in secondary lymphoid organs and tumor 
metastasis. Accumulation of immune cells in secondary lymphoid organs and tumor lesions will result 
in an increase in glucose uptake and retention, which will result in an increase in the standardized 
uptake value (SUV) of [18F]FDG . The images obtained by [CONTACT_28760]- body PET will be matched with 
analysis of tumor biopsies to attempt to quantify the number of tumor- infiltrating MART -[ADDRESS_1037212] forms  of therapy. Five 
agents are approved by [CONTACT_941] U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of stage IV 
melanoma . The chemotherapy drugs dacarbazine (DTIC) and hydroxiurea, and the administration of 
high doses of IL- [ADDRESS_1037213] response rates below 
15%, and neither form of therapy has been shown to increase survival in a randomized trial. Two new 
agents have been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma based on a demonstrated 
impact on overall survival, the anti -CTLA4 antibody ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Yervoy) and the BRAF inhibitor 
vemurafenib (Zelboraf). I pi[INVESTIGATOR_757580] (in the range of 10%) 
that tend to be durable and have translated in to improved overall survival in two randomized clinical 
trials  10,11. Vemurafenib gives a high response rate in BRAF V600 mutant metastatic melanoma, but 
median duration of response is 6- 7 months 12,13. In a randomized clinical trial it improved overall 
survival compared to dacarbazine 14. 
 5.2 Rationale for Immune- based Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_757581].   
 
Progress in our understanding of how the immune system recognizes and kills cancer cells has led to 
the notion that high levels of circulating, tumor -antigen -specific T cells may be required for effective 
antitumor responses. Active immunotherapy with several forms of cancer vaccines has shown that antigen -specific T cells can be activated and occasionally lead to antitumor responses 
15,16. However, 
the circulating levels of antigen- specific T cells and tumor response rates are much lower than 
desirable 17. 
 
Adoptive transfer of clonally -expanded, tumor antigen- specific lymphocytes to lymphopenic hosts after 
nonmyeloablative conditioning chemotherapy has resulted in cell proliferation and persistent clonal 
repopulation 2. This approach has resulted in an objective response rate over 50% in patients with 
metastatic melanoma, that holds up in larger groups of patients 3. The major limitation for the broad 
clinical applicability of this approach is the requirement for large -scale ex vivo  lymphocyte culture 
expansion (up to 1011 cells) 2, which restricts this approach to a highly select group of patients. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1037214] tumor responses to immunotherapy involve the activation 
of tumor antigen- specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) 
18. These immune cells have a high 
affinity receptor, the TCR that specifically recognizes its ligand, a complex of MHC molecules with an 8 to 10 amino acid peptide that provides the antigen specificity. When the antigen specificity of T cell 
clones obtained from TIL was assessed, over 80% of them were restricted to the MART -1/Melan- A 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037215] immune mediated tumor regressions to 
MART -1-based immunotherapy that are extremely long lived, lasting years without relapses 4,5.  
 
5.4. Why Gene Therapy? 
 
The adoptive transfer of large numbers of antigen- specific T cell s leads to the highest percentage of 
tumor regressions reported in patients with melanoma, but this approach is only feasible in a minority 
of patient where TIL can be cloned and expanded from melanoma metastasis 2,3. Genetic engineering 
of T cells with optimal TCRs would make this approach more broadly applicable. There is no other approach that would allow generating large numbers of T cells with uniform specificity for melanoma 
tumor antigens with a short (less than one week) ex vivo  cell manipulation. Therefore, gene transfer 
techniques are the only approach that would allow testing this concept in human subjects, as supported by [CONTACT_757644] a published clinical trial at the Surgery Branch/NCI  
21.  
 5.[ADDRESS_1037216] been shown to expand dramatically (over three logs) after encounter with their cognate antigen in vivo  
24. Preliminary data in 
humans provides evidence that the same is true in patients with metastatic melanoma 21. 
 
5.6 Retroviral Vector -based Human Gene Medicine  
 
Retroviral -mediated gene transfer is an efficient means for the expression of transgene into actively 
dividing primary cells. Up to 50- 60% of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and T lymphocytes can be 
transduc ed if cells are non- specifically activated, usually using a cytokine cocktail for HSC and either 
immobilized anti -CD3 and anti -CD28 or cytokines for T cells 25-27.  
 
5.7 Safety and Regulatory Issues Regarding Retroviral -based Gene Transfer Approaches.   
 
Ten infants with X -linked severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) resulting from a mutation in the 
γc gene (a surface cytokine receptor) were successfully treated with bone marrow transplantation of 
autologous HSC genetically modified to express the missing gene using retroviral vectors. Two of the infants developed a T cell leukemia approximately [ADDRESS_1037217] received stem cells 
genetically modified with retroviral vectors  30, and the only cases of malignant transform ation are the 
two infants in the SCID study 28,29. Therefore, particularities of this study (the γc gene functioning as a 
first hit for leukemogenesis, a predilection for vector insertion near the LMO2 oncogene as second hit, 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
17 the baseline immune deficiency of the patients not being able to control transformed clones) seem to 
have played a major role in these two cases 33. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_1037218] surface 
expression of a functional transgenic MART -1 F5 TCR requires both proteins to pair, and in addition 
try to decrease the heterodimerization with other endogenous TCR chains. For example, a MART -1 
F5 TCR α chain, produced in excess of the MART -1 TCR β chain, may pair with an endogenous TCR 
β chain, resulting in the generation of TCR with specificity other than MART -1 
34. This problem has 
been circumvented by [CONTACT_757645][INVESTIGATOR_295347] -derived “self -cleaving” 2A- like sequences. Using this 
approach, Szymczak et al . [ADDRESS_1037219] efficiently generated multicistronic retroviral vectors (with efficient 
translation of at least 4 genes) to restore TCR expression in CD3- deficient mice.  
 The original description of the 2A self -cleaving peptides was done by [CONTACT_757646]. Andrews, U.K., who were working on the Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) and other pi[INVESTIGATOR_295347] 
36. The FMDV encores some of its proteins in a long single open reading frame 
(ORF) that is cleaved post -translationally by [CONTACT_757647]. At one position of this polyprotein there 
is a rapid co- translational self -processing due to the presence of an 18 amino acid peptide (termed 
2A) that directed its own separation from the growing polyprotein 36-38. The use of 2A- based vectors to 
express the two MART -[ADDRESS_1037220] sensitive imaging technology applicable to both preclinical and clinical studies. MicroPET scanners approach a spatial resolution of ~[ADDRESS_1037221] an 
intrinsic resolution of ~4 -5 mm3 39. Currently, PET imaging of metabolic activity is extensively used in 
cancer diagnosis, with more than 3 million PET scans administered in clinical centers worldwide in 
2006. A majority of these scans use the glucose analog 2-[18F]-fluoro -2-deoxy -d-glucose ([18F]FDG) to 
measure the rate of glycolysis, a metabolic process that is unregulated in the majority of cancers. 
[18F]FDG PET allows early detection and staging of cancer, as well as evaluation of therapeutic 
interventions. In addition to cancer, [18F]FDG also accumulates at sites of inflammation or active 
immune responses. Similar to malignant cells, T cells and other immune cells rapi[INVESTIGATOR_757582]. Increased [18F]FDG retention has been reported in several immune and 
inflammatory processes including autoimmune hepatitis, viral infections, systemic lupus 
erythematosus  and rheumatoid arthritis.  
 The concept of PET measurements of metabolic processes exemplified by [
18F]FDG has been applied 
to the development of PET imaging probes sensitive to the rate of DNA synthesis and cell 
proliferation. The prototype for these probes is 3’ -18fluorothymidine ([18F]FLT), a nucleoside analog 
developed by [CONTACT_757648] 40. The accumulation of [18F]FLT in prolifer ating cells reflects the 
enzymatic activity of thymidine kinase 1, a cytosolic deoxynucleoside kinase which catalyzes the 
transfer of a γ -phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate to the 5’ -OH group of thymidine. TK1 
expression is regulated during cell cycle: it starts increasing in late G1 cells, reaches a maximum in 
the S phase coinciding with DNA synthesis, and markedly decreases during mitosis.

18 5.10 MART -1 TCR-engineered T cell Experience at NCI Surgery Branch 
 
5.10.1 Use of Other TCRs in Humans.  The Surgery Branch/NCI has initiated two similar TCR gene 
transfer protocols using other TCRs, which as of the Fall of [ADDRESS_1037222] enrolled a total of 54 patients:  
 
i) NCI trial 04 -C-0251 (OBA# 0308- 599, IBC# RD -03-XII-01) has treated [ADDRESS_1037223] been four clinical responses (PR) observed during the 
trial, and two were long- term PRs (>12 months).  
 ii) NCI trial 07 -C-0175A (OBA# 0703- 840) has treated 20 patients using the same retroviral 
vector backbone and packaging cell line proposed in the current study. The protocol was feasible and overall safe, with major toxicities attributed to the F5 TCR transgenic cells being anterior uveitis in 55% of patients and hearing loss in 50% of patients  
7. Antitumor activity was 
demonstrated with 6 partial responses (PR) out of 20 patients (30%), with 3 of the responses being durable beyond 1 year  
7. 
 iii) NCI trial 07 -C-0003 (OBA#0602- 759, IBC # RD -06-II-10) has treated [ADDRESS_1037224] been no adverse events associated with these patient 
treatments that were attributed to the gene transfer therapy. There has been no clinical 
response observed to date.  
 
5.10.2 Clinical Use of the MART -1 F5 TCRs in Humans.  NCI trial 07 -C-0175A (OBA# 0703 -840) 
uses the same MART -[ADDRESS_1037225] the 
major similarities and differences between both clinical trials: 
 
i) Major similarities:  
 
- TCR: Both clinical trials use the same MART -[ADDRESS_1037226] affinity MART -1 TCR is a large screen at the Surgery Branch/NCI 7,41. 
- Retrovirus: Both clinical trials use the same retrovirus vector backbone, construct and 
master cell bank, and produced at the same facility, the Indiana University Vector 
Production Facility (IU VPF).  
- Target cells: Both experiences include the transduction of activated PBMC. Since a TCR can only be expressed and functional on the cell surface in cells that are CD3 positive, thi s 
allows the TCR engineering of both CD8+ CTL and CD4+ T helper cells. Therefore, CD4+ T cells acquire a TCR that redirects them to recognize antigen presented by [CONTACT_79906] I 
molecules.  
- Clinical trial design: Both are phase 2 clinical trials with primary e ndpoints of safety and 
antitumor activity.  
- Conditioning regimen: Both use the same non- myelodepleting but lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy conditioning regimen based on the administration of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to allow homeostatic proliferation of the adoptively transferred TCR transgenic cells.  
 ii) Major differences:  
 
- Rapid Expansion Protocol (REP): The F5 clinical trial at the Surgery Branch/NCI 
7 includ ed 
a 2-week ex vivo  expansion after TCR engineering of lymphocytes following the REP 
protocol described by [CONTACT_757649] 42. The clinical trial at UCLA will not include 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037227] transduction before re- infusing into patients.  
- Cell dose for adoptive transfer: Given that the UCLA study will not use REP, the target cell dose for adoptive transfer is one to two  log lower at UCLA than in the clinical trial 
conducted at the Surgery Branch/NCI  
7, where up to 1011 TCR transgenic cells were 
infused to patients.  
- Dendritic cell vaccination: Provision of antigen in the form of a vaccine is required in some 
animal models to support the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells, most 
notably with the pmel -1 adoptive transfer model 45,46. This is because exposure to antigen 
while undergoing homeostatic proliferation stimulates further T cell expansion 47,48. We 
propose to use MART -126-35 peptide- loaded GM -CSF/IL-4 differentiated DC, a vaccine that 
has resulted 2 durable complete responders out of 18 patients with metastatic melanoma 
treated, currently ongoing beyond 5 and 6 years, respectively 4,5. 
- PET imaging: We include molecular imaging using the standard [18F]FDG PET probe, 
which allows non- invasive imaging of a key feature of activated lymphocytes, their hig h 
uptake of glucose due to aerobic glycolysis.  
- Low dose IL- 2: The UCLA clinical trial initially  used high dose IL- [ADDRESS_1037228]. 
Steven A. Rosenberg from the Surgery  Branch/NCI. This high affinity TCR specific for the MART -127-35 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_757583] -A*0201 has been selected based on its high affinity for its antigen and 
because it confers high functionality when genetically engineered into CD3 positive cells . 
 The low response rate in the prior MART -1 TCR gene transfer protocol at the Surgery Branch/NCI 
[ADDRESS_1037229] A2+ MART -[ADDRESS_1037230] recognition of T2 cells pulsed with the native MART -1
27-35 peptide. This clone 
secreted 17,161pgm/ml of interferon gamma in an overnight co- culture assay compared to 
1,987pgm/ml secreted by [CONTACT_757650]4 clone used in prior trials. In addition, the recognition of the 
mel526 and the mel624 A2+ MART -1+ cell lines was also higher utilizing the DMF5 clone than the 
DMF4 clone (5806 and 10,865 pgm/ml compared to 1780 and 2397 pgm/ml). Neither clone had 
significant recognition of the control A2- MART -1+ mel 888 line 41,49,50. 
 Investigators at the Surgery Branch/NCI next cloned the genes encoding the alpha and beta chains of 
the TCR from many of these cloned TIL populations. The genes encoding these alpha and beta 
chains were then electroporated into the same activated donor CD8
+ PBMC. The DMF5 
electroporated TCR was again the most reactive TCR when assessed against the MART -1 peptide 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
20 pulsed onto T2 cells as well as to A2+ MART -1+ melanoma cell lines. The reactivity of the TCRs 
recapi[INVESTIGATOR_757584]. They next checked lysis by [CONTACT_757651] a 4- hour chromium release assay. Again the DMF5 TCR outperformed all of 
the other TCR and was approximately [ADDRESS_1037231] both the MART -1 
peptide as well as melanoma cell lines. Investigators at the Surgery Branch/NCI have developed a 
GMP quality retroviral vector encoding the alpha and beta chains of the MART -1 F5 TCR for use in an 
ongoing phase 2 clinical trial 
51.  
 6.2 Data Using the MART -1 F5 TCR Retroviral Vector (MSGV1- F5AfT2AB) in Human Subjects at 
the Surgery Branch/NCI  
 Investigators at the Surgery Branch led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steven A. Rosenberg have reported on [ADDRESS_1037232] of lymphocytes expressing the F5 TCR  
7. The Surgery Branch protocol differs 
with the UCLA protocol in that up to 1011 TCR transgenic cells were administered, that these cells are 
generated and infused fresh (without cryopreservation as at UCLA), and that no DC vaccine is 
included. The protocol was feasible and overall safe, with major toxicities attributed to the F5 TCR 
transgenic cells being anterior uveitis in 55% of patients and hearing loss in 50% of patients 7. 
Antitumor activity was demonstrated with 6 partial responses (PR) out of 20 patients (30%), with 3 of 
the responses being durable beyond 1 year 7.

7.3. Definition of Study Enrollment Date  
 
Enrollment will be considered the time when the eligibility criteria is being entered into the study eligibility form after the screening tests have been completed to declare if the patient is able or not 
able to be considered for this research.  
 
8.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
 This is a phase 2 study to determine the safety, feasibility and antitumor activity of retrovirus -
transduced T cell immunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma. The retrovirus vector encodes the MART -1 F5 alpha and beta TCR chains. The retrovirus vector MSGV1- F5AfT2AB will be 
used to transduce autologous PBMC. Infusions of a target minimum cell dose of 10
8 TCR transgenic 
cells will be performed at day 0. Subjects will be followed for laboratory and clinical adverse events, for evidence of replication competent retrovirus (RCR), and for survival of transduced T cells . The 
most intensive monitoring of research volunteers will be made over 24 months, but subjects will be followed for life.  
 Given the pi[INVESTIGATOR_31093], the multiple procedures involved and the use of two cell -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_757590]’ blood samples, the timeline of the study is aimed at defining 
their approximate administration to patients. In general, changes in the range of [ADDRESS_1037238] the study timeline to feasible procedures in the clinical study schedule.  
 
8.1 Baseline Screening Assessments  
 
Patients will be screened to determine whether they meet full eligibility criteria after the informed 
consent form (ICF) is signed. Standard of care medical history, pertinent laboratory data and 
significant medical problems of the patient will form the basis for proceeding to evaluate the candidate 
in more detail. Following signing of the ICF and enrollment into the study, the remainder of screening 
procedures and tests will be completed.  
 
An attempt will be made to complete all tests within [ADDRESS_1037239] repetition. Key tests will be repeated at the discretion of the treating physicians if older than 30 days.  
 Screening tests : 
 
• Office visit, vital signs and physical exam.   The physical exam will include weight, height, and vital 
signs.  Weight measurement will only be obtained at subsequent physical exams if clinically

from enrollment until the brain metastases are under control after neurosurgery or radiation 
therapy.  
• Collect blood for:

8.2. Initial Protocol Procedures 
 
• Ophthalmologic Exam. Patients will undergo a formal ophthalmologic exam by a qualified 
ophthalmologist. The minimally required procedures will be an ophthalmic history and a 
comprehensive ophthalmic examination.  
 
• Otological Exam. Patients will undergo a formal otological exam by a qualified 
otorhynolaryngologist. The minimally required procedures will be an otological history and a 
comprehensive otologic examination.  
 
• Tumor Biopsy.  A biopsy of a melanoma lesion accessible to outpatient sampling will be collected 
whenever feasible. A target minimum of 5 x 5 x 5 mm tumor tissue will be collected if feasible.   .  A 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
24 new biopsy may not be required if an acceptable biopsy  was performed within 60 days of prior to 
screening.  
 
• Baseline  [18F]FDG PET Scan. A baseline PET scan using [18F]FDG as tracer will be used to 
determine the background against which the assessment of MART -[ADDRESS_1037241] scan to minimize radiation exposure.  
 
• Cardiac Function Tests. An electrocardiogram (ECG) will record potential pre- existing 
conduction abnormalities for future comparison if needed. A MUGA  or echocardiogram will be 
performed to determine if the patient is fit to receive low dose IL- 2. A LVEF lower than 45% would 
preclude participation.  
 • Pregnancy Test.  All females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine 
Pregnancy Test  within [ADDRESS_1037242] 2 years are not considered to be of childbearing potential.  
 
• Central Venous Access Catheter.  A central venous access catheter (CVC) will be placed during 
the screening period or upon hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. This should ideally be a double lumen central 
catheter, but it may be a single lumen catheter at the discretion of the treating physicians. 
Examples may include double lumen Groshong or PI[INVESTIGATOR_757593].  
 
• Pulmonary Function Tests (PFT) : Tests to be performed in all patients , and if FEV
1/FVC< 70% 
of predicted patient will be excluded from participation.

or medical procedures that have been done to subject sinc e the prior visit.  
• Physical exam . 
• A catheter will be placed in a vein through which subject will receive liquids in preparation for the chemotherapy regimen.  
• Subject will have blood drawn to check health. Tests include complete blood counts; the ability o f 
blood to clot; blood chemistries. Most of these blood tests will be repeated daily or every other day during subject’s stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
• Subject will start to receive one or two drugs to prevent complications with infections, the antibiotic Bactrim t o decrease the risk of Pneumocistis carinii pneumonia (or PCP), and the drug ganciclovir 
to decrease the risk of cytomegalovirus (or CMV). Gancyclovir will only be given to subjects who  
have evidence of prior exposure to the CMV virus. Both of these drugs  will be stopped before 
administering the gene- modified MART -1 TCR CTLs, since both drugs would interfere with their 
function in the body.

8.5 Day 0: MART -1 F5 TCR PBMC Infusion  
 Premedication  
 Side effects  following T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea. For this reason, 
patients will receive pre- medication with:  
 
• Approximately one hour prior to the infusion, an i.v. infusion of Dextrose 5% -Normal Saline, 250 
ml/hr will begin and continue for 3 hours.  
• Briefly (approximately 10 minutes) prior to the infusion, acetaminophen 650 mg po, 25 mg diphenhydramine and 12 g mannitol will be administered i.v. These medications may be repeated every six hours as needed.  
• A course of non- steroid al anti -inflammatory medication may be prescribed if the patient continues 
to have fever not relieved by [CONTACT_58086].  
• It is recommended that patients not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone, at any time, except in the case of a life- threatening 
emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on T cell survival. If corticosteroids are required for an acute infusion reaction, an initial dose of hydrocortisone [ADDRESS_1037250]  will be transported to the in- patient unit on ice in a 
rigid-walled container with a tight fitting lid (i.e. Tupperware; Nalgene container etc.) and labeled with 
a biohazard label. A target minimum of 10

patients undergoing HSC transplantation.  
• Patients will be in a monitored bed during cell infusion, with vital signs recorded. 
• Sterile saline, acetaminophen and emergency drugs, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] [0.3 -0.5 mg (0.3- 0.5 ml 
of a 1:1000 solution), diphenhydramine (25- 50 mg i.v.), and methylprednisolone (30- 60 mg i.v.), 
should be readily available in the amount and formulation as per the standard treatment of a 
potential hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reaction 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
27 • If there is an adverse event (AE) characterized by [CONTACT_81428] -threatening hypoxia or hypotension, or any 
other infusion reaction qualifying as a DLT as described in section 11.1.1. 1, then further infusion of 
the TCR transgenic cells will be canceled and no other immune stimulating approaches, such as 
IL-2, or DC vaccines, will be administered under this protocol.  
 
Febrile Reaction  
 
In the event that a subject develops sepsis or systemic bacteriemia following PBMC infusion, appropriate cultures and medical management will be initiated. If a contaminated PBMC  product is 
suspected, the product will be retested for sterility using archived samples that are stored in the UCLA HGMP/JCCC GMP Suite.  
 
8.6 Days 1, 14 and 30: MART -1
26-35 Peptide Pulsed DC Administration

I) Temperature more than 103° C, unresponsive to medication  
 
Fevers During IL- [ADDRESS_1037252] UCLA practices for IL -2-based therapy. Meperidine (25- 50 mg) will be given intravenously if severe 
chills/rigors develop. Other supportive therapy will be given as required and may include 
acetaminophen (650 mg q4h), indomethacin (50- 75 mg q6h) and ranitidine (150 mg q12h). 
Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg/dose i.v. every 8 hours (or an equivalent antiemetic) may be administered for nausea or vomiting. Additional antiemetics may be administered as needed for nausea or vomiting. 
Antibiotic coverage for central venous catheters may be provided at the discretion of the treating physicians. These s ide effects are more commonly seen with high doses of IL- 2, not the low -doses 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018

longer period, that’s used in this study .  
 
Blood Collection for Immune Monitori ng Assays  
 
Collection of [ADDRESS_1037253] chemotherapy -induced pancytopenia and may be hemodynamically unstable after IL -2. These blood 
draws can be done +/ - [ADDRESS_1037254] routinely for cryopreservation/archiving 
and then as needed thereafter in case of an adverse event that warrants further collection of samples 
for cytokine/chemokine analyses.   
8.8 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757595]:  
 
• Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > 500/ µL. 
• Platelet count > 20,000/ µL.

• Liver function tests stable.  
• Not requiring daily blood product infusion.  
 
8.9 Days 20 to 40: MART -1 F5 TCR Cell Tracking After Infusion  
 
Between study days 20 and 40 (or when the treating physicians deem that the patient is stable 
enough to undergo these procedures), either as an inpatient or outpatient, the following will be 
repeated to attempt to detect the MART -1 F5 TCR transduced PBMC:  
 
• [
18F]FDG PET scan with an attenuated  restaging CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.  
• Tumor biopsy whenever feasible.  
• Leukapheresis and plasmapheresis: This will be a partial (5 liter) leukapheresis for PBMC collection and 100 ml of plasma.

• Systemic corticosteroids: Used in  case there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_757597] a DLT ( as described in 
section [IP_ADDRESS] ) that may be related to autoimmune or inflammatory reactions,  or cytokine storm . 
In this case, administration of  IL-2 and DC vaccines will not be continued.  
 
8.12 Days 75 to 90: Re -staging Exams and Procedures 
 
Patients will undergo restaging CT, PET and/or MRI scans of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis 
between study days [ADDRESS_1037256] intensive part of the study protocol.  
 
8.13 Day 90: Office Visit for Re -staging Evaluation  
 
On study day 90 patients will be evaluated for antitumor activity after undergoing re -staging exams 
and laboratory tests. Patient with SD, PR or CR will be offered to continue on protocol after discussion 
of the study results. Patients with PD will be offered to terminate participation. However, given the 
phenomenon of delayed responses with tumor immunotherapy approaches, the final decision to 
continue or not on study will be at the discretion of the treating physician and the patient, regardless of 
the tumor response assessment.  
 
8.14 Long -term Follow -up Plan  
 
Regardless if followed on- study or off -study, patients will be asked to comply with the following long

9.[ADDRESS_1037261] obtained from study patients will be transferred to the 
HGMP/JCCC GMP Suite, on the 14th floor of the Factor Building. PBMC will be isolated by [CONTACT_757661], and an aliquot of these cells will be cultured for 48 hours in the presence of anti -CD3 
(OKT3) and IL -2 in order to stimulate T -cell growth to prepare for viral vector transduction. PBMC will 
be transduced with a clinical grade retrovirus vector expressing MART -1 F5 TCR ( MSGV1 -F5AfT2AB) 
using retronectin- coated plates in two consecutive days and kept in culture for [ADDRESS_1037262] day for later use.  
 
 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037263] Description. The retroviral vector, MSGV1- F5AfT2AB, was generated at the Surgery 
Branch/NCI, and consists of 4,196 bps including the 5' LTR from the murine stem cell virus 
(promoter), packaging signal including the  splicing donor and splicing acceptor sites, alpha chain and 
beta chain genes of the anti -MART -1 F5 TCR from TIL clone DMF5 7,41, and murine stem cell virus 
3'LTR. The alpha and beta TCR chains are linked by a T2A pi[INVESTIGATOR_757598].  
Classification: Immunotherapeutic.  
Active Ingredient. This retroviral vector has two active transgenes, the alpha and beta chains of a 
high affinity TCR that jointly recognizes the MART -127-35 epi[INVESTIGATOR_757583] -A*0201.  
• MART -1 F5 TCR: This high affinity TCR pair specific for the melanoma antigen peptide MART -127-

126-35 peptide presented by [CONTACT_757662] -1 F5 TCR when expressed as a transgene in primary 
human T cells 7,41. 
Mode of Action: One functional complex will be generated by [CONTACT_757663]:

Manufacturing Information for the Clinical Grade Vector: The clinical grade MSGV1- F5AfT2AB 
was generated at the Indiana University Vector Production Facility (IU VPF). The retroviral vector supernatant (PG13/F5af2aB C162D1) was prepared and preserved following cGMP conditions at IU 
VPF. The physical titer was determined by [CONTACT_757664]’s certificate. The supernatant was stored upon the completion of production at least at – 70
o C at IU VPF. Upon 
shipment on dry ice, the supernatant is stored at –80o C at the HGMP/JCCC GMP suite. This facility is 
equipped with around- the-clock temperature monitoring. Supernatant is thawed and used for in vitro  
transduction of activated PBMC. There will be no re -use of the same unit of supernatant for different 
patients. The retroviral titer has been shown to be stable after immediate thawing and immediate administration (tissue culture wells previously coated with retronectin). Handling of the vector should 
follow the guidelines of Biosafety Lev el-2 (BSL -2).  
How Supplied:  The clinical grade vector is supplied by [CONTACT_757665] (SOP) for retroviral vector suspension, labeling and cryopreservation.  
Storage: Single use aliquots are stored in a viral bank establ ished in a dedicated –80
oC freezer with 
central, computerized monitoring system, with alarm and recording of all GMP storage systems located at the restricted access JCCC GMP Suite, 14
th floor of the Factor Building at UCLA.  
Stability:  Under the conditions  of continuous storage at – 80oC without freeze- thawing, it is expected 
that the retroviral vector is stable for at least 5 years. Aliquots of this vector will be recertified annually 
throughout the study period with selected assays for purity, identity and  potency.  
Dose and Schedule:  For ex vivo  use only.  
Route of Administration.  All use of this retrovirus vector is ex vivo , and no direct injection will be 
done in human subjects.  
Prior Human Experience. This same retrovirus vector expressing the MART -1 F5 TCR and similarly 
used to transduce human PBMC has already been administered to humans within a phase 2 clinical 
trial at the Surgery Branch/NCI 7. The prior human experience is as follows:  
• Retrovirus Vectors: Retroviral vectors have undergone extensive testing in humans . Their main 
safety caveat is the development of insertional mutagenesis, which seems to be a rare event and 
may be related to the expressed transgene and the immune competency of the host. Over [ADDRESS_1037266] received stem cells genetically modified with retroviral 
vectors, and the only cases of malignant transformation are the two infants in a clinical trial 
inserting the gammaC gene (a surface cytokine receptor) to HSC of infants with X -linked severe 
combined immune deficiency (SCID) 
28,29. 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
31 • MART -1 F5 TCR: The same MART -1 F5 TCR alpha and beta gene pair is being tested at the 
Surgery Branch/N.C.I. (Steven A. Rosenberg, P.I.) for its ability to redirect antigen specificity of 
human PBMC adoptively transferred to lymphopenic hosts in a protocol design similar to the one 
proposed herein  7. If we gain knowledge of the development of serious adverse events (SAE) 
related to the MART -1 TCR transgenic T cell administration, our protocol procedures and informed 
consent form will be modified accordingly.  
Reported Adverse Events and Potential Risks: The potential adverse events are related to the viral 
vector, transgenes and genetically modified cells, as discussed in the following section.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_1037267] Description. PBMC obtained from leukapheresis and activated for 48 hours with OKT3 (anti -
CD3 antibody) and IL -2, infected by [CONTACT_757666]1 -F5AfT2AB retroviral vector supernatant 
in two consecutive days, maintained in culture for 4 days from the start of transduction in IL -2. 
Aliquots of these cells will be used to fulfill the lot release criteria.  
Classification: Immunotherapeutic.  
Active Ingredient. As described for the retrovirus vector MSGV1- F5AfT2AB.  
Mode of Action: The genetically modified PBMC expressing a transgenic surface MART -1 F5 TCR will 
be expected to be redirected to the MART- 1 antigen expressed by [CONTACT_44688] -A2*0201 and MART- 1 positive 
melanoma cells. Recognition of the cognate antigen will result in the release of effector molecules from T cells, like the cytotoxic granules perforin and granzyme B, and activating cytokines like interferon-
gamma, IL -2 and TNF -alpha.  
Manufacturing Information: Genetically modified PBMC expressing transgenic MART- 1 F5 TCR will 
be manufactured by [CONTACT_757667]1 -F5AfT2AB .  
Storage: PBMC transgenic for MART -[ADDRESS_1037268] 
transduction and infused fresh. If cryopreserved, they will be stored in a centrally -monitored liquid 
nitrogen freezer in the JCCC GMP suite located on the 14
th floor of Factor Building, UCLA.  
Stability:  These genetic ally modified PBMC will be infused fresh . When stored in liquid nitrogen, 
PBMC are viable for over [ADDRESS_1037269] to freeze- thawing. Cells will 
be used within 6 months of manufacture. 
Dose and Schedule:  Administered once on day 0 of this protocol, receiving a minimum target cell 
dose of 108 and up to 109 PBMC transgenic for MART -1 F5 TCR.  
Administration: Transgenic cells will be transported from the GMP suite to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757599] -wrap, on ice i n a rigid- walled container with a tight fitting lid (i.e. Tupperware; 
Nalgene container etc.) labeled with a biohazard label. A detailed explanation for the change of PBMC 
protocol from Amendment 7 is provided at the end of the protocol in the Appendix: Amendment 8.  
Unused Transgenic Cells. Transgenic cells generated but not administered to patients will be 
cryopreserved and  banked for up to [ADDRESS_1037270] container that will be autoclaved before disposal.  
Prior Human Experience: As des cribed above, PBMC transduced with the same retrovirus vector 
MSGV1 -F5AfT2AB, is currently in clinical testing 
7. 
Reported Adverse Events and Potential Risks: Potential risks are derived from the viral vector, the 
transgenes it will express and the infusion of genetically modified cells:  
• Retroviral Vectors: There are two potential serious anticipated risks associated with retroviral 
vectors. One is related to its ability to randomly and permanently integrate in the genome of target cells, which may lead to altered expression of genes in these cells potentially inducing oncogenic 
changes. The second one is related to the possibility of its recombination and generation of 
replication competent virus that could potentially lead to a HIV -like disease.  
o Risk of Insertional Mutagenesis with Retroviral Vectors. The risks of insertional 
oncogenesis with integrating gene delivery vectors is likely a complex function of several 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
32 factors, related to the type of vector used, the promoter and other transcriptional control 
elements of the vector, the transgene per se , as well as properties of the target cells. 
Moloney Leukemia Virus (MLV) -based gamma -retroviral vectors have been shown to have 
a high predilection for insertion into the 5’ region of actively transcribed genes, which may increase the risks for trans -activation of transcription from the cellular gene promoter 
55. 
Genes that modulate cell proliferation, such as the gammaC gene used to treat X -linked 
SCID may provide one component of a proliferative signal that plays a cooperative role in 
cellular transformation with cellular genes involved in cellular proliferation, such as LMO -2, 
when activated by [CONTACT_757668] -activation 28. In contrast, effector proteins such as TCR 
would not, a priori , be expected to confer an unregulated proliferative stimulus, although 
they may play a role in clonal expansion upon encounter with the cognate antigen.  
o Risk of Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR) with Retroviral Vectors.  Another risk 
is that genetic recombination within components of the vector system could lead to the 
generation of RCR. This event would have the potential of generating infective retrovirus 
that may lead to oncogenesis or immune deficiency. Our patients will be screened at baseline to be HIV seronegative. Since there will be no wild type HIV virus present, the 
possibility of providing the missing genes for the generation of infective retrovirus in vivo  
would be lower than when retroviral vectors are administered to HIV positive subjects.  
• MART -1 TCR: The main potential toxicities from the transgenic alpha and beta MART -[ADDRESS_1037271] MART -1 positive cells  
7. 
This could result in disappearance of pi[INVESTIGATOR_757600], pi[INVESTIGATOR_757601], in the retina with the 
potential development of blindness, and in the inner ear resulting in vestibular problems. In 
particular, in the NCI Surgery Branch experience, anterior uveitis was noted in 55% of patients and hearing loss in 50% of patients receiving F5 TCR transgenic cells. These 
cases responded to local injection of corticosteroids  
7. These toxicities were not noted in 
the original UCLA experience with this F5 TCR with cell doses up to 109. With the F5 
infusion cell number going back down to 109, We will keep prospectively monitor ing 
ophthalmologic toxicity following standard eye exam evaluation for patients receiving tumor 
immunotherapy  56,57, and potential otological toxicities by [CONTACT_757669].  
o Autoimmune Toxicity from Mispairing of TCR Chains. The alpha and beta chains of the 
MAR T-1 TCR could undergo heterologous pairing with endogenous alpha and beta chains 
of TCR expressed by [CONTACT_757670] T cells, leading to misdirected T cells with newly acquired TCR specificities. These would be unpredictable and not subjected to the thymic selection process, potentially resulting in T cells with autoreactivities. If evidence of 
autoimmunity developed, patients would receive immune suppressive therapy as clinically 
indicated based on the severity of symptoms , using medications like corticoste roids, 
cyclosporin- A, mycophenolate mofetil, anti -TNF-alpha antibodies or anti -thymocite globulin 
(ATG) . 
• MART -[ADDRESS_1037272] serious would be 
infusion reactions leading to severe allergic reactions, or the triggering of a cytokine 
release syndrome. Therefore, the genetically modified cells will be re -infused in an 
inpatient setting, with continuous monitoring of vital signs and by [CONTACT_757671] -Oncology HSC unit.  
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037273] contaminated by [CONTACT_50904], fungus, mycoplasma or virus. With the goal of detecting 
potential contaminants, the genetically modified cells will undergo intensive lot release testing prior to infusion.
 
o Autoimmune Toxicity from Mispairing of TCRs. The chains of the MART -1 TCR could 
pair with chains of TCR previously expressed by [CONTACT_941] T cells, leading to T cells that could 
then attack normal organs inducing a condition similar to autoimmune diseases. If 
evidence of autoimmunity developed, patients would receive immune suppressive therapy as clinically indicated based on the severity of symptoms, using medications like 
corticosteroids, cyclosporin- A, mycophenolate mofetil, anti -TNF-alpha antibodies or anti -
thymocite globulin (ATG).  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1037274] Description:  MART -126-35 is an anchor -modified decamer derived from the immunodominant 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_757602] -characterized MART- 1 melanoma lineage antigen in the context of HLA -
A*0201 20,58-60. This HLA haplotype corresponds to greater than 30% of the general population in major 
ethnicities. This decamer anchor -modified peptide derived from the native MART -127-35 peptide with 
the amino- acid sequence ELAGIGILTV (MART -126-35) has more favorable HLA- A*[ADDRESS_1037275] with T cells specific for MART -127-35

9.2.2 MART -126-35 Peptide Pulsed Dendritic Cells (DC):  
 
Product Description:  Dendritic cells will be differentiated from autologous adherent PBMC in cultures 
containing GM -CSF and IL- 4. After one week, loosely -adherent cells are harvested and pulsed with the 
anchor -modified MART-1 26-35 peptide, and then prepared for i.d. administration to patients as f resh cells.  
Active Ingredient: The biologically active ingredient is the MART -126-35 peptide, which is presented by 
[CONTACT_44688]-A2*0201 complexes on the cell surface of DC together with costimulatory molecules and activating 
cytokines.  
Mode of Action: Dendritic cells are the central cells for initiating a cellular immune response. They 
are the most efficient cells for processing and presenting antigen in a MHC class I and II -restricted 
fashion. Antigenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_757603] a high level of cell surface costimulatory 
(B7.1, B7.2, CD40) molecule expression.  
Tissue Source: Autologous adherent PBMC differentiated in vitro in GM -CSF ( Genzyme ) and IL -4 
(Cell Genix  or the current supplier of clinical grade IL -4) to generate DC.  
Manufacturing Information: Dendritic cells are generated from PBMC obtained from a single, 
unmobilized leukapheresis procedure by [CONTACT_757673] 7 days in media containing 5% autologous 
heat-inactivated plasma, supplemented with GM -CSF and IL- 4. The in vitro  generation of DC at  the 
JCCC GMP Facility for MART -1 peptide DC -based clinical trials is covered by [CONTACT_757674] # 7122 and 
[ZIP_CODE] 4,5. The DC manufacture in the current study will be conducted following the same procedures.  
Storage: MART -126-35 peptide pulsed DC will not be stored; they will be administered fresh after lot 
release testing. During the time between peptide pulsing and injection to patients after lot release testing, the cells will be kept loaded in the syringe used for the injection in the final formulation, and 
kept at 4
oC or on ice in an ice bucket.  
Stability:   MART -126-35 peptide pulsed DC are stable and viable up to 24 hours from the time they are 
loaded onto a syringe for injection.  
Dose and Schedule:  A target cell number of 107 MART -126-35 peptide pulsed DC i.d. days 1, 14 and 
30. 
Route of Administration: Intradermal, close to a lymph node basin not known to be infiltrated by 
[CONTACT_453657].  
Prior Human Experience:  Our completed phase I/II clinical trial (IND #7122) 4,5, where patients with 
melanoma were treated with DC pulsed with the native MART -127-35 immunodominant peptide, has 
allowed us to gain ample experience in this cell -based immunization strategy. This experience has 
been incorporated to an ongoing clinical trial administering the DC pulsed with the anchor -modified 
MART -126-35 anchor -modified peptide together with the anti -CTLA4 antibody tremelimumab (formerly 
CP-675,206) manufactured by [CONTACT_3954]. (Groton- New London, CT) (IND # [ZIP_CODE]). We have 
optimized our laboratory technique to minimize the contamination risk and allow detection of any 
adventitious component in the vaccine before injection into patients. Pharmacokinetics of DC -based 
vaccines in humans have been conducted by [CONTACT_2312]. When DC are injected i.d.,  as proposed in the 
current trial, the cells can be detected in the draining lymph nodes, supposedly at the site where they 
are able to stimulate the host immune system 63,64. The pharmacodynamic activity of i.d. -injected DC 
can be demonstrated by [CONTACT_757675] -specific immune responses detected in PBMC 4,5.   
Reported Adverse Events and Potential Risks:  Several phase I/II clinical trials have been published 
where DC have been administered to human subjec ts 62,65. This has proven to be a generally safe 
treatment with significant activity in previously tr eated low grade lymphomas, metastatic melanomas, 
renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer and colon cancer, among other malignancies. A potential 
adverse event induced by [CONTACT_757676] a product 
contaminated by [CONTACT_757677]. In an attempt to avoid this event, DC will undergo strict lot release criteria 
of the final product before administration to human subjects, and the administration route has been 
chosen to minimize the possibility of systemic toxicities . Otherwise, in our experience of 63 patients (25 
with MART -127-35/DC, 22 with AdVMART1/DC and 16 with MART -126-35/DC and concomitant anti-
CTLA4 antibodies), we have not observed SAE attributable to the MART -1-expressing DC.

35 9.3 Interleukin- 2 (aldesleukin, Proleukin, recombinant human Interleukin 2)  
 
Description: Please refer to package insert for complete product Information. Human recombinant 
interleukin -2 is a highly purified protein with a molecular weight of approximately 15,300 daltons. It is a 
lymphoki ne produced by [CONTACT_757678] a genetically engineered E. coli strain 
containing an analog of the human interleukin- 2 gene.  
Mode of Action: Immunotherapeutic agent which stimulates T and NK cell responses.  
How Supplied: Interleukin- 2 (IL-2) is manufactured by [CONTACT_757679] .   
Formulation/Reconstitution: IL-2 is provided as single- use vials containing 22 million IU (~1.3 mg) 
IL-2 as a sterile, white to off -white lyophilized cake plus 50 mg mannitol and 0.18 mg sodium dodecyl 
sulfate, buffered with approximately 0.17 mg monobasic and 0.89 mg dibasic sodium phosphate to a 
pH of 7.5 (range 7.2 to 7.8). The vial is reconstituted with 1.2 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, 
and the resultant concentration is 18 million IU/ml or 1.1 mg/mL. Diluent should be directed against 
the side of the vial to avoid excess foaming. Swirl contents gently until completely dissolved. Do not 
shake. Since vials contain no preservative, reconstituted solution should be used within  24 hours.  
Storage:  Intact vials are  stored in the refrigerator (2o – 8oC) protected from light. Each vial bears an 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  
Dilution/Stability:  Reconstituted IL -2 should be further diluted with 50 mL of 5% Human Serum 
Albumin (HSA). The HSA should be added to the diluent prior to the addition of recombinant IL- 2. 
Dilutions of the reconstituted solution over a 1000- fold range (i.e., 1 mg/mL to 1 mcg/mL) are 
acceptable in either glass bottles or polyvinyl chloride bags. IL -2 is chemically stable for 48 hours at 
refrigerated and room te mperatures, 2o to 30oC. 
Dose and Schedule:  500,000 IU/m2 q12 hours for a maximum of 14 doses .  
Administration: The final dilution of IL- 2 will be given subcutaneously.  
Toxicities:  Expected toxicities of IL- [ADDRESS_1037278] label. Grade III toxicities common to IL-
2 include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, skin changes, anorexia, mucositis, dysphagia, or 
constitutional symptoms and laboratory changes.   
 9.4 Fludarabine  
 
Description: Please refer to package insert for complete product Information. Fludarabine phosphate 
is a synthetic purine nucleoside that differs from physiologic nucleosides in that the sugar moiety is arabinose instead of ribose or deoxyribose. Fludarabine is a purine antagonist antimetabolite.  
Mode of Action: Chemotherapy agent.  
How Supplied:  Fludarabine is supplied by [CONTACT_757680] a 50 mg vial as a fludarabine phosphate powder 
in the form of a white, lyophilized solid cake.  
Stability: Following reconstitution with 2 mL of sterile water for injection at a concentration of 25 
mg/ml, the solution has a pH of 7.7. The fludarabine powder is stable for at least 18 months at 2 -8
oC; 
when reconstituted, fludarabine is stable for at least 16 days at room temperature. Because no preservative is present, reconstituted fludarabine will typi[INVESTIGATOR_74844] 8 hours.  
Specialized references should be consulted for specific compatibility information. Fludarabine is 
dephosphorylated in serum, transported intracellularly and converted to the nucleotide fludarabine triphosphate; this 2 -fluoro -ara-ATP molecule is thought to be required for the drug’s cytotoxic effects. 
Fludarabine inhibits DNA polymerase, ribnucleotide reductase, DNA primase, and may interfere with chain elongation, and RNA and protein synthesis. Storage: Intact vials should be stored refrigerated (2 -8
oC). 
Dose and Schedule:  25 mg/m2/day for 4 days. The dose of fludarabine will be adjusted based on 
estimation of the creatinine clearance (CrCl). For CrCl 30- 70 the dose should be reduced by 20%, and 
for CrCl <30 – not g iven.  
Administration: Fludarabine is administered as an i.v. infusion in 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride, USP 
over 15 to 30 minutes. To prevent undue toxicity the dose will be based on body surface area (BSA), but will not exceed a dose calculated on surface areas based on body weights greater than 140% of the maximum ideal body weight per height and weight.

36 Toxicities: At doses of 25 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_1037279] is myelosuppression; 
however, thrombocytopenia is responsible for most cases of severe and life- threatening hematologic 
toxicity. Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia 
(CLL) treated with fludarabine. Hemolytic anemia has been reported after one or more courses of 
fludarabine with or without a prior history of a positive Coomb’s test; fatal hemolytic anemia has been 
reported. In addition, bone marrow fibrosis has been observed after fludarabine therapy. Other 
common adverse effects include malaise, fever, chills, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and 
weakness. Irreversible and potentially fatal central nervous system toxicity in the form of progressive encephalopathy, blindness, and coma is only rarely observed at the currently administered doses of 
fludarabine. More common neurologic side effects at the current doses of fludarabine include 
weakness, pain, malaise, fatigue, paresthesia, visual or hearing disturbances, and sleep disorders. 
Adverse respi[INVESTIGATOR_83864], dyspnea, allergic or idiopathic i nterstitial 
pneumonitis. Tumor lysis syndrome has been rarely observed in fludarabine treatment of CLL. Treatment on previous adoptive cell therapy protocols in the Surgery Branch/NCI have caused 
persistently low (below 200) CD4 counts, and one patient developed polyneuropathy manifested by [CONTACT_74916], and motor and sensory defects

9.5 Cyclophosphamide  
 Description: Please refer to package insert for complete product Information. Cyclophosphamide is a 
nitrogen mustard -derivative alkylating agent. Following conversion to active metabolites in the liver, 
cyclophosphamide functions as an alkyating agent; the drug also possesses potent 
immunosuppressive activity.  The serum half -life after i.v. administration ranges from 3 -12 hours; the 
drug and/or its metabolites can be detected in the serum for up to 72 hours after administration.   
Mode of Action:  Chemotherapy agent.  
How Supplied: Cyclophosphamide will be obtained from commercially available sources.  
Stability: Following reconstitution as directed with sterile water for injection, cyclophosphamide is 
stable for 24 hours at room temperature or 6 days when kept at 2 -8
0C.   
Dose and Schedule: 60 mg/kg/day x 2 days i.v.  
Administration:  It will be diluted in 250 ml D5W and infused i.v. over one hour. The dose will be 
based on the patient’s body weight, but to prevent undue toxicity, it will not exceed a dose greater 
than 140% of the maximum ideal body weight per height and weight.    
Toxicities: Hematologic toxicity occurring with cyclophosphamide usually includes leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, rash and alopecia occur, especially after high -
dose cyclophosphamide; diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, infertility, and mucosal and oral ulceration have been reported. Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis occurs in about 20% of patients; severity can range 
from microscopic hematuria to extensive cystitis with bladder fibrosis. Although the incidence of  
hemorrhagic cystitis associated with cyclophosphamide appears to be lower than that associated with 
ifosfamide, mesna (sodium 2- mercaptoethanesulfonate) has been used prophylactically as a 
uroprotective agent in patients receiving cyclophosphamide. Prophylactic mesna is not effective in preventing hemorrhagic cystitis in all patients. Patients who receive high dose cyclophosphamide may 
develop interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which can be fatal. Hyperuricemia due to rapid cellular destruction may occur, particularly in patients with hematologic malignancy. Hyperuricemia may be 
minimized by [CONTACT_74918], alkalinization of the urine, and/or administration of allopurinol. If 
allopurinol is administered, patients should be watched closely for cyclophosphamide toxicity (due to 
allopurinal induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes). At high doses, cyclophosphamide can result in 
a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion; hyponatremia with progressive weight gain without edema occurs. At  high doses, cyclophophamide can result in cardiotoxicity. 
Deaths have occurred from diffuse hemorrhagic myocardial necrosis and from a syndrome of acute myopericarditis; in such cases, congestive heart failure may occur within a few days of the first dose. 
Other consequences of cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity include arrhythmias, potentially irreversible 
cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis. Other reported adverse effects of cyclophosphamide include headache, dizziness, and myxedema; faintness, facial flushing, and diaphoresis have occurred 
following IV administration. Mesna (sodium 2- mercaptoethanesulphonate; given by [CONTACT_51215]) is a 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037280] with urotoxic metabolites of 
cyclophosphamide (acrolein and 4- hydroxycyclophosphamide) to decrease the incidence and severity 
of hemorrhagic cystitis.  
 
9.6 Laboratory Reagents 
 
9.6.1 OKT3. OKT3 ( Miltenyi Biotec or other supplier of clinical grade OKT3), is an anti -CD3 antibody 
used to activate T cells in vitro  by [CONTACT_757681]3 complex. In the current clinical trial, OKT3 will be 
strictly used ex vivo  for the activation of PBMC for retroviral transduction. A clinical grade OKT3 
(Miltenyi ) is a  therapeutic monoclonal antibody approved by [CONTACT_757682], including the heart, kidneys and liver. However, this antibody is currently not being produced 
by [CONTACT_757683]. When used in vivo , OKT3 antibodies eliminate CD3 positive 
lymphocytes which is beneficial to treat graft rejections. It can induce anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions, cytokine release syndrome and a variety of constitutional symptoms when administered 
systemically. The source of OKT3 antibody for the current studies is obtained with a certificate of analys is providing its manufacturing and product characterization. In addition, after aliquoting, the 
batches used within this study are further characterized by [CONTACT_294136]: Gram stain, fungal stain, bacterial culture, fungal culture, mycoplasma culture, endotoxin assay.  
 
9.6.2. Interleukin -2. The IL -2 used for in vitro  stimulation of PBMC will be the same as described for 
systemic IL -2 treatment in patients. All pertinent information is described in that section.  
 9.6.3 GM -CSF. Leukine
® (Genz yme)  is a recombinant granulocyte- macrophage colony -stimulating 
factor (rhu GM -CSF) approved by [CONTACT_757684]. When used in vivo , it can induce constitutional symptoms and bone pain.  
When used in vitro , it can sustain the differentiation of monocytes to DC. In the current clinical trial, 
GM-CSF will be strictly used ex vivo  for the generation of DC.  
 
9.6.4 Interleukin -4. Clinical grade recombinant human IL- 4 is purchased from Miltenyi Biotec  or the 
current supplier of clinical grade IL-4 . This cytokine has been previously tested systemically in human 
subjects 66, but has not been licensed by [CONTACT_757685]. When used in vitro , IL-4 increases the 
differentiation of monocytes to DC. This same cytokine source has been used in prior DC -based clinical 
trials at UCLA (IND # [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE])  and was safe and biologically  active when used for DC 
generation  67. 
 9.6.5. Retronectin. RetroNectin® (CH- 296) is purchased from  Clontech Laborator ies or the current 
supplier of clinical grade RetroNectin ®. RetroNectin® is a chimeric peptide of recombinant human 
fibronectin fragments produced in E. coli, consisting of three functional domains: a central cell -binding 
domain (type III repeat, 8- 10), heparin -binding domain II (type III repeat, 12- 14), and a CS1 site within 
the alternatively -spliced IIICS region. It is a 574 amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 63 kDa. 
When coated on the surface of containers such as culture dishes, petri dishes, flasks or bags, 
retronectin significantly enhances retrovirus -mediated gene transduction into mammalian cells. This 
enhancement is hypothetically due to co -localization of retroviral particles and target cells on the 
molecules of retronectin. Virus particles bind retronectin via interaction with heparin- binding domain II, 
and target cells bind mainly through the interaction of the cell surface integrin receptor VLA -4 with the 
fibronectin CS1 site. Additionally, cells may also bind through the interaction o f another fibronectin 
ligand (RGDS in repeat 10) within the central cell -binding domain with a corresponding integrin 
receptor VLA -5 on the cell surface.

Additional Optional Testing of TCR Transgenic Cells. The release tests will be used to determine 
whether the final cell product can be released for infusion (see Tables above). In addition, the cell 
product may undergo further characterization apart from the release testing. The vector -specific 
proviral copy number per cell may be determined.  We will perform additional testing for the number of 
vector copi[INVESTIGATOR_757605] [ADDRESS_1037293] may be further characterized for measurable transgene products (Table 5).

[IP_ADDRESS] Ocular Examinations.  
 
Since MART -1 positive pi[INVESTIGATOR_757608], careful evaluation of the 
eye will be conducted throughout the study period.  
 
Qualifications of the Examiners: The ophthalmologic evaluation will be performed by a qualified 
ophthalmologist with a faculty appointment at UCLA. The primary ophthalmologists performing these 
examinations will be the study co -investigators [CONTACT_111603] R. Straatsma, M.D., J.D., Professor of 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037314]. Tara McCannel, M.D., 
Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology.  
 
Procedures: The following will be the procedures performed in the comprehensive ophthalmologic 
visits at screening and post treatment Day 75- 90: ophthalmic history, comprehensive ophthalmic 
examination, psychophysical visual function assessment and fundus photography. If any abnormality 
is detected, subjects will undergo an additional fluorescein angiography and electrophysiological 
visual function assessment. For other ophthalmologic visits, the minimally required procedures will be an ophthalmic history and a comprehensive ophthalmic examination.  
 
Ocular DLTs:  Ocular DLTs consist of new ophthalmologic findings or subjective patient symptoms in 
comparison to the data obtained during screening. The new symptoms of concern include nyctalopia, 
loss of peripheral visual field, photopsias, new floaters, color desaturation, or blurry vision. On 
examination, several findings would consist of an ocular DLT. These include loss of greater than the 
equivalent of 1 line of visual acuity, reproducible decreases in visual field of greater than 3 MD deviation or new onset defined scotoma, depi[INVESTIGATOR_488620], 
appearance of subretinal fluid, or onset of uveitis.  
 
Procedures to follow if an ocular DLT is determined: Subjects with findings of an ocular DLT as 
defined above will receive either topi[INVESTIGATOR_757609] (100 mg qday for 5 days) as recommended by [CONTACT_1964], with repeated ophthalmologic assessment. If a favorable 
course is noted, then patients will be followed every week for one month, and monthly afterwards until 
complete resolution of the findings. If the patient does not have a favorable course after the initial 
prednisone treatment, then the patient will be admitted for intravenous corticosteroids therapy with the 
possibility of adding cyclosporin A, OKT3, micophenolate or other immune suppressant.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Otologic Examinations.  
 
Since MART -1 positive pi[INVESTIGATOR_757610], careful evaluation of the ear 
function will be conducted throughout the study period.  
 
Qualifications of the Examiners: The otologic visit will be performed by a qualified 
otorhinolaryngologist with a faculty appointment at UCLA. The primary otorhinolaryngologist 
performing these visits will be the study co- investigator [CONTACT_757726].  
 
Procedures: The following will be the procedures performed in the comprehensive ophthalmologic 
visits on day 1 and 75- 90: otologic history, comprehensive otologic examination. If any abnormality is 
detected, subjects will undergo additional targeted examinations.  
 
Otologic DLTs:  Otologic DLTs consist of new ophthalmologic findings or subjective patient s ymptoms 
in comparison to the data obtained on day 1 of the study protocol.  
 Procedures to follow if an otologic DLT is determined: Subjects with findings of an otologic DLT 
as defined above will receive either topi[INVESTIGATOR_757609] (100 mg qday for 5 days) as 
recommended by [CONTACT_757692], with repeated otologic assessment. If a favorable course 
is noted, then patients will be followed every week for one month, and monthly afterwards until 
complete resolution of the findings. If the pat ient does not have a favorable course after the initial 
prednisone treatment, then the patient will be admitted for intravenous corticosteroids therapy with the 
possibility of adding cyclosporin A, OKT3, micophenolate or other immune suppressant.  
 
11.1.2 Feasibility  
 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037315] has received the infusion of the MART -1 F5 TCR transgenic cells, an assessment of 
protocol feasibility will be done by [CONTACT_30967] (Table 9). The feasibility assessment will be 
based on: i) the number of MART -1 F5 TCR engineered cells that can be recovered from patients at 
pre-specified time points, and ii) potential problems in the manufacturing of MART -1 F5 TCR  
engineered cells and/or the MART -126-35 peptide–pulsed DC vaccines (Table 11).  
 
Table 11.  Criteria to Declare the Study Unfeasible.  
 
Parameter  Criteria for Unfeasibility  
Feasibility of generating MART -1 transgenic 
cells that meet the lot release criteria . 3 or more preparations not meeting the lot release 
criteria in stage 1.  
Feasibility of generating MART -126-35/DC that 
meet the lot release criteria.  3 or more preparations not meeting the lot release 
criteria in stage 1.  
 
11.1.3 Antitumor Activity  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Malignancy status 
 
Objective tumor responses are aimed at ruling out a 10% response rate as the null hypothesis, and 
35% response rate as the alternative hypothesis within a phase II two- stage clinical trial design. 
Therefore, if [ADDRESS_1037316] (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria 
68. Appropriate evaluations, including 
physical exam, pi[INVESTIGATOR_757611], will be evaluated at screening and then 
between study days [ADDRESS_1037317] tumor 
assessments at baseline and during the study follow up will be considered evaluable for tumor 
response.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Measurable and Non- measurable Lesions  
 
Measurements of all lesions should be recorded in metric units. All baseline evaluations must be 
performed as close as possible to the first day of study treatment. The same method of assessment 
and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline and during follow -up. 
a. Measurable Lesions:  
• Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥2.0 cm with conventional imaging techniques, ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_1037318] 
scanners with thinner slices.   
• Skin nodules that can be clearly documented by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler, to document the maximum diameter of the target lesion(s), regardless of their size.  
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
53 • If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology, or by [CONTACT_757693] [18F]FDG PET scan if the lesion is not 
easily accessible for tissue sampling.  
b. Non-measurable Lesions:  
• All other melanoma lesions: Previously irradiated lesions are non -measurable except in 
cases of documented progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Target and Non- Target Lesi ons 
 
Patients must have at least one measurable lesion at baseline to be included in the analysis of this endpoint. Baseline documentation of tumor sites may include imaging assessment of disease in the 
chest, abdomen and pelvis. A baseline imaging study o f the brain is required.  
a. Target Lesions:  
• Up to 10 total lesions, a maximum of 5 lesions per organ, that are representative of all 
involved organs may be selected and recorded as target lesions at baseline. Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of  their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). The sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum longest diameter. The baseline sum longest diameter will be used as 
reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the disease.  
• Since at least [ADDRESS_1037319] one of the baseline target lesions should not be completely excised throughout the study period. 
b. Non-Target Lesions:  
• All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- target lesions and 
recorded as non- target lesions at baseline. Measurement of non- target lesions at baseline 
is not requi red and should be recorded as “present.” Each non- target lesion should be 
documented as either present, absent or new in each subsequent evaluation.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Response Classifications  
 
The following RECIST criteria will be the primary method utilized in this study for the assessment and reporting of tumor response data:  
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all evidence of melanoma in target and non-
target lesions. CR must be confirmed by [CONTACT_74324] [ADDRESS_1037320] met to qualify as CR. This definition includes a 
pathological CR when hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_757612].  
• Partial  Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of 
target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD . Non -target lesions may persist provided 
there is no unequivocal progression in these lesions. PR must be confirmed by  [CONTACT_631485] [ADDRESS_1037321] met to qualify as PR;  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum LD of the target lesions from the smallest sum LD recorded since the beginning of therapy or the appearance of one or 
more new lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions; and  
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
54 • Stable Disease (SD): Measurements demonstrating neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for 
PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD after the start of treatment taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started. During this time, non- target lesions may persist 
provided there is no unequivocal progression in these lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Frequency of Tumor Measurements  
 
Tumo r assessments for response will be performed starting at the end of 3 months (Day 90) and 
every [ADDRESS_1037322] met to qualify as such response. Additional tumor measurements may be 
completed as needed.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment  of Response for In- Transit Metastasis  
 
In patients with in- transit metastasis only, at least one in- transit metastatic lesion should not be 
excised. If there is only one measurable lesion, biopsies should not interfere with the measurement of the largest diameter of the lesion. Response will be assessed as above, taking the measurement from 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_127318] a built -in ruler.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Response:  
 The duration of overall complete response will be measured from the time measurement criteria has 
been first met for CR until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented.  
 The duration of overall response will be measured from the time measurement criteria is met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to Disease Progression  
 
Defined as the length of time from the date of enrollment to the date of progressive disease first documented, death, or the start of secondary antitumor therapy, whichever occurs first.  Subjects lost 
to follow -up will be censored at their last available follow -up date.  
 
11.1.4 Definition of Study Failure Due to Failure of Meeting the Primary Study Endpoints.  
 Study failure according to safety and feasibility considerations is defined as follows:  
 
1) Unexpected SAEs that are related to the transduction process or research reagent and 
required that the study be stopped.  
2) [ADDRESS_1037323] stage with 8 patients.  
3) Considered to be an unfeasible approach as defined above.  
4) 1 or less patients with CR or PR among 8 patients in stage 1.  
5) 4 or less patients with CR or PR among 22 patients in the completed study combining patients in stage 1 and 2.

55 11.2 Secondary Study Endpoints:  
 
11.2.1 MART -1 TCR/sr39 Transgenic Cell Persistence  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Transgenic Cell Persistence.  
 
TCR and vector presence will be quantitated in PBMC samples, obtained before adoptive transfer and 
at 7, 14, 30, 45, 60, [ADDRESS_1037324] 2 years, and then every 6 to 12 months. Analysis will be performed 
both using immune monitoring and molecular techniques. Detection of surface expression of the 
MART -1 TCR transgenic protein will be analyzed both by [CONTACT_757694]. Molecular analysis of the persistence of cells bearing the MART -1 F5 
TCR cDNA will be done by [CONTACT_757695]. This testing will provide data to estimate the in vivo  survival of 
lymphocytes derived from the infused cells.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Long  Term Monitoring for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR).  
 
Analysis for detection of RCR by [CONTACT_757696]  
(NGVB) at the Indiana University Viral Production Facility (IU VPF) under the supervision of [CONTACT_757727] G. Cornetta. Samples taken from cells prior to infusion will be archived and blood samples 
obtained from study patients at [ADDRESS_1037325] cell administration will be tested. 
Blood samples will be archived annually thereafter if all previous testing has been negative.  
 If a patient dies or develops a neoplasm (other than melanoma recurrence) during this clinical trial, efforts will be made to assay a biopsy sample for RCR. If any post -treatment samples are positive, 
then the baseline final product will be tested for RCR. Further analysis of the RCR and more extensive patient follow -up will be undertaken, in consultation with the UCLA IRB, RAC and FDA.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Retroviral Insertion Sites in Long Term Persisting MA RT-1 F5 TCR Clones 
 
It is possible that expansion of specific T -cell clones will be observed as tumor reactive T cells 
proliferate in response to tumor antigens. Therefore, care will be taken to track T cell persistence both immunologically and molecularly. Blood samples for persistence of TCR gene transduced cells will be 
obtained at 3, 6, 12 months, and then annually thereafter. If any patient shows a high level of 
persistence of TCR gene transduced cells at month 6 (by [CONTACT_757697] -PCR using pri mers 
specific for vector sequences) the previously archived samples will be subjected to techniques that 
would allow the identification of clonality of persisting TCR gene transduced cells. Such techniques 
may include T cell cloning or LAM -PCR. Clonality a nalysis is available through NGVL 
69. 
 If a predominant or monoclonal T cell clone derived from TCR gene transduced cells is identified 
during the follow -up, the integration site and sequence will be identified and subsequently analyzed 
against the human genome database to determine whether the sequences are associated with any 
known human cancers. If a predominant integration site is observed, the T cell cloning or LAM -PCR 
test will be used at an interval of no more than three months after the first observation to see if the clone persists or is transient. In all instances where monoclonality is persistent and particularly in 
instances where there is expansion of the clone, regardless of whether or not the sequence is known to be associated with a known human cancer, the subject should be monitored closely for signs of 
malignancy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunological Monitoring.  
 Immunological monitoring will consist of quantifying T cells bearing surface MART -1 F5 TCR by 
[CONTACT_757655] -1
26-35 tetramer or dextramer analysis. The functionality of these cells will  be tested in ELISA 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
56 and/or multicytokine array assays , intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Immunological assays will be 
compared between 1) pre- infusion PBMC, 2) an aliquot of the engineered PBL at the time of infusion, 
3) cells recovered from patients’ peripheral blood after adoptive transfer.  
 
Our published definitions for a positive or negative immunological response using standardized MHC 
tetramer assays will be used for these two assays  70. These definitions are based on the assay 
performance specifications by [CONTACT_757698] a 95% confi dence level. For the other assays, differences of 1 fold will be considered indicative of true 
biologic differences.  
 Additional testing may be performed with other assays, for example intracellular phosphoprotein 
staining for signaling networks, multiplexed microfluidic and nanotechnology -based immune 
monitoring assays 
71,72.  
 
11.2.2 Evaluation of MART- 1 TCR Transgenic Cell Tumor Trafficking  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In Vivo Imaging  
 
The ability to non -invasively image T cell responses to cancer hinges upon the detection of metabolic 
changes related to TCR transgenic cell proliferation in vivo  detectable with PET probes.  
 
Patients will be injected with 200 MBq [18F]FDG at baseline and approximately 20- [ADDRESS_1037326] injection, a 
PET/CT scan covering the area from the base of the skull to  the upper abdomen will be acquired. 
Scans of the extremities will be performed in patients with metastatic lesions in the arms or legs. The CT scan will be performed in a “low dose mode” (110 kVp, 30 mAs anode current) resulting in an effective dose of less than 1.[ADDRESS_1037327] or PET scans and below the limits set by [CONTACT_757699] (http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_01/21cfr361_01.html).  
 Regional uptake of [
18F]FDG within metastatic tumor sites and secondary lymphoid organs will be 
quantified by [CONTACT_757700] (SUV) normalized to the body weight of the patient. As an internal quality control, SUVs will also be determined for several normal organs, such as muscle, liver and lungs. These measurements will allow us to identify technical problems in the SUV calculations, such as partially paravenous tracer administration 
74. An attempt will be made to have all imaging 
studies will be performed on the same PET/CT system in order to eliminate confounding effects of differences in scanner sensitivity, spatial resolution or image processing. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Biopsies 
 To correlate the [
18F]FDG signal with the numbers and functional phenotype o f MART -1 F5 TCR 
transgenic T cells accumulating at the tumor site, percutaneous or image -guided biopsies of tumor 
lesions between study days 20- 40, with allowed variability in this range, will be performed. The 
biopsies will be analyzed by H&E, IHC to quantify the numbers of T lymphocytes. If sufficient quantity 
of tissue is available, the study investigators will attempt to monitor the phenotype of the TIL obtained from tumor biopsy samples by [CONTACT_757701], multicolor flow cytometry (FACS), and 
other immune monitoring assays.  
 
12.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
12.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event or serious adverse drug reaction is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence at any dose that:  
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
57  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Progression of the malignancy under trial should not be reported as an adverse event. However, if the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the trial or within the safety -reporting period, then disease 
progression must be recorded as a Grade 5 serious adverse event.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, if it is determined that the event  may jeopardize the patient and 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as serious.  
 
SAE Reporting Period  
 
Events that meet the SAE definition will be reported within the following timelines based on the time of 
first knowledge of the SAE by a study investigator:  
 
• SAE other than resulting in unexpected death: 
o P.I.: Within 24 hours.  
o IRB, ISPRC, DSMB, IBC, NIH/RAC: Within 7 days.  
o FDA: Within 15 days.  
• Unexpected death:  
o P.I.: Within 24 hours.  
o IRB, ISPRC, DSMB, IBC, NIH/RAC: Within 24 hours.  
o FDA: Within 7 days.  
 
In general, any SAE will be reported as soon as it is known by [CONTACT_757702]. All SAE reports will  be managed through the UCLA SAE Compliance 
Officer, working under the JCCC Regulatory Affairs Office. Initial reports may be completed or 
amended with any new relevant additional information.  
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_757613]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_757614].  
 
12.2 Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  
 Abnormal Test Findings 
 The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an 
adverse event are as follows:   
• Test result  is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
58 • Test result leads to a change in trial schedule or discontinuation from the trial, significant 
additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy, and/or  
• Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_4687].  
 Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the above conditions, does not constitute 
an adverse event. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an adverse event.  
 12.3 Causality Assessment  
 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events (serious and non-
serious). An investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event. If the 
investigator’s final determination of causality is unknown and the investigator does  not know whether 
or not investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes. If the investigator's causality assessment is "unknown 
but not related to investigational product", this should be clearly documented on the study records. In 
addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with trial procedures, the 
investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as  appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements, 
if applicable.

Since melanoma is slightly more prevalent in males (2/3), we expect that approximately 30- 35% of the study population will be females.  
 
Most subjects referred to the UCLA Melanoma Program come from the UCLA Oncology Network, with over 50 offices throughout the Los Angeles County and Western US, including areas where there is a majority of subjects of Asian, Hispanic and African American descent. Cutaneous m alignant 
melanoma occurs less frequently among non -white populations than among whites. Data from the 
[LOCATION_004] Cancer Registry reveal that, between 1988 and 1993, 95.5% of subjects with melanoma in [LOCATION_004] were non -Hispanic whites, 3.5% were Hispanic,  0.5% Asian, and 0.5% non -Hispanic blacks 
75. The patients treated in previous melanoma clinical trials conducted over the past [ADDRESS_1037331] 5 years. 93% were white and 33% were female, which is in accordance with the incidence of melanoma in our population.

13.6 Informed Consent Procedure  
 
13.6.1 Informed Consent Form (I CF). This study must be conducted in compliance with UCLA IRB, 
IBC, ISPRC, the RAC and the FDA, and relevant informed consent regulations. The ICF must contain 
a language readily understood by [CONTACT_757705]. The original consent form, signed and 
dated by [CONTACT_23522], will be included in the patient’s UCLA medical chart. A copy of the signed ICF will be provided to the patient.  
 
There will be one consent form describing all of the study procedures, including the administration of 
genetically modified cells and the procedures for gene transfer. The rationale for including gene transfer and non- gene transfer procedures in the same consent form is that their separation would 
result in  unnecessary duplication of text and non- linear explanation of the study procedures.  
 
13.6.[ADDRESS_1037333]’s native language. Ample time will be allowed for discussions and clarification of the goals of the research project with the trial investigators. Potential subjects will be 
asked if they wish to participate and told that it is voluntary and refusal will not affect their relationship 
with their physician or the care given to them at UCLA. No coercion will be used.

 15.[ADDRESS_1037339] (DSMB)  
 
The Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) was constituted in January 2001. The DSMB membership consists of representatives of the Cancer Center 
clinical research community. The Director of the Cancer Center appoints members to a term of [ADDRESS_1037340] been filed since the previous meeting, are presented to the committee for review.  
 For all JCCC and TORI studies, where the JCCC DSMB has primarily oversight for AE review, all AEs 
occurring within these studies shall be reported to the JCCC DSMB in a timely manner consistent with 
the UCLA IRB time requirements [ten days, two days for a death] regardless of relationship or seriousness.  The JCCC Office of Regulatory Compliance (ORC) will review all submissions and staff 
will enter the information into the JCCC Clinical Trials database.  Reports are generated for full JCCC DSMB review of those SAEs that have some component of relatedness to the study drug and may, at 
the discretion of the JCCC compliance officers, include SAE reports that may be incorrectly assessed 
by [CONTACT_978]. For institutional trials, where the JCCC DSMB has primary DSMB review responsibility, the office will r equest that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_757623].  
 The DSMB reviews each Serious Adverse Event reported and determines whether or not protocol 
modifications are warranted to ensure patient safety. In this review, prior occurrences of similar 
toxicity with the therapy under study are taken into consideration, as well as the seriousness of the event and the likelihood that it was related to a study drug. The DSMB may recommend no changes 
to the study if the event is expected or related to other causes such as the patient’s underlying 
condition.  The DSMB may request an expert’s advice of other non- UCLA Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_757624].   The JCCC DSMB has the  authority 
to recommend to the UCLA IRB the immediate halt to the study (i.e., discontinuation of any further treatment of enrolled patients and discontinuation of enrollment of new patients) should there be any 
serious unexpected toxicity that warrants further investigation. JCCC DSMB correspondences are 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037341] be considered when assigning the 
Level of Risk category include:  
 1. A biostatistical design and appropriate procedures for proper data management so that the information collected can be properly validated.  
2. Appropriate Serious Adverse Event reporting procedures must be in place.  
3. The study duration must be appropriate and must be based on a realistic rate of enrollment.  
4. Data collection and data management must be adequate to verify and ensure subject  safety.  
 15.2.2 Assignment of risk. Assigning risk ensures that the data and safety monitoring is based on 
the level of risk (low, medium, or high) to ensure that the data and safety monitoring activities are appropriate.  Below are some of the criteria used to make a decision regarding the assignment of risk: 
 
• Expected duration of the study based upon the estimated rate of one.  
• Type of study population (e.g. , children, geriatric)  
• The procedures used in the trial are commensurate with the degree of risk.  
• Adequate data management systems in place and appropriate case report forms  
• Proper serious adverse event reporting procedures in place  
• Proper biostatistical design and data analysis procedures in place.  
 
15.3 Monitoring/Auditing Activities.   
 The compliance officer of the JCCC Office of Regulatory Compliance [ORC] will monitor the clinical 
records for all human subjects enrolled onto JCCC institutional trials overseen by [CONTACT_131010].  
The JCCC compliance officer will perform real time review of informed consent form processes and 
the meeting of all inclusion and exclusion criteria at study entry.  Active monitoring will offer the JCCC study teams prospective information that can be used to enhance the quality of research being 
performed contemporaneously.  Auditing is a review of historic performance of the research effort and 
is performed on case report forms, regulatory files and source documents to measure the quality of 
the research effort in a retrospective manner.    
 
15.[ADDRESS_1037342] in a 
patient (any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use 
of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical 
treatment or procedure).  Any clinical adverse event must be recorded on the case report form during the course of the study.  The investigator must evaluate and document the adverse event for severity, 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037343] be verifiably documented in the source (i.e., medical record or physician office chart).  
 When an adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to evaluate and record into 
the source documents, the nature of the symptom, prescribe the appropriate remedy and to report the 
event.  The adverse event must be reported to the sponsor, the IRB, FDA and any other appropriate 
agency (e.g., IBC and NIH for gene medicine trials.)  The assessment and reporting must occur in 
writing within 10 days, 48 hours for death.    
 
If the event is Serious and Unexpected, the event should be reported immediately (in writing within 
10 days, 48 hours for death) by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_757625], UCLA IRB, JCCC DSMB and to any appropriate agency; the NIH and the UCLA IBC for gene medicine trial; directly to 
the FDA if it is an institutional IND trial; and to the NCI if it is an NCI sponsored trial.  For institutional trials and for gene medicine trials, the JCCC ORC and Gene Medicine Compliance Officers will assist 
the investigator to ensure that all serious adverse events are properly documented and reported in 
accordance to federal and institutional requirements. 
 
All adverse events that occur in a research study overseen by [CONTACT_757714], regardless of relationship, expectedness, or seriousness.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_1037344] to protocol procedures, drug administration, laboratory data, safety data and efficacy ratings on the case report forms (CRF). The CRF may be a 
printed, optical or electronic document. All corrections on a CRF and on source documents must be 
made in a way that does not obscure the original entry. The correct data must be inserted, dated and 
initialed/authorized by [CONTACT_26271]. If the change is not obvious provide a reason. 
 16.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 This is a two -stage phase II clinical trial aimed at determining the safety, feasibility and antitumor 
activity of gene transfer using retrovirus MSGV1 -F5AfT2AB transduced PBMC. UCLA will be 
responsible for registering patients  and for maintaining a complete database of the study information 
excluding laboratory assay data. The clinical laboratory assay data will be obtained from source documents from the UCLA medical records (including both paper and electronic files and labora tory 
results) and transcribed into CRFs. A shadow chart may be kept with copi[INVESTIGATOR_757626] a locked room at the UCLA Clinical Research Unit or under direct control of the study P.I. Failure to 
complete the study due to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_757627]. This study is intended to provide data that might allow the 
investigators to conduct a preliminary assessment of safety and feasibility.  
 16.1 Sample Size Determination 
 The Simon optimal two- stage design
1 is used to determine the sample size, using the co -primary 
endpoint of response rate as the criterion for the clinical trial statistical design.  
 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
70 16.3 Efficacy Analysis 
 
The toxicities observed after each TCR transgenic cell infusion will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by [CONTACT_757715]) and nadir or maximum values for the laboratory measures, time of onset (i.e. course number), 
duration, and reversibility or outcome. Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and side 
effects by [CONTACT_58145]. Baseline information (e.g. the extent of prior therapy) and 
demographic information will be presented, as well, to describe the patients treated in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. All responses will be reported.  
 
16.4 Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_757572]- stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869].  
 
It is recognized that AEs can occur frequently in this population based on the underlying metastatic 
melanoma and these can be SAEs. The review of SAEs will form the basis for potential early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68660]. Only unexpected SAEs that are related to the transduction process/research reagent 
would define a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. The review of these adverse events, and any decision to prematurely 
stop subject enrollment, will be determined by [CONTACT_757716].  
 
Absolute stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_757628]:  
 1. Any death that is possibly related to the investigational agents namely MART -[ADDRESS_1037345] Transplant 
Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) can be excluded.  
 Premature termination of the clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_757629], RAC, IRB, the DSMB, or determination that there are problems in the 
cell product generation or the safety of their administration as descried in the assessment of primary study endpoints . Additionally, recruitment may be stopped for reasons of particularly low recruitment, 
protocol violations, or inadequate data recording.

Appendix: Summary of Protocol Amendments  
 Amendment 1  
 
Date: March 16, 2009  
 
Main protocol and consent modifications;  
 a) Protocol:  
 
While generating the forms to fill in the product lot release criteria we noted that the approved version of the study protocol did not specify which final product lot release tests should be 
received before administration of the cells to patients. The lot release criteria were detailed in 
Table 4 of the protocol, but both tests with immediate results and with delayed results were listed 
together. The key issues were the low likelihood of obtaining results of the copy number of viral insertions in the target cells, and the testing for replication competent retrovirus (RCR), which [CONTACT_757742], the FDA product reviewer for this IND, had asked to be done at the Indiana University Viral 
Production Facility (IU VPF) under the direction of [CONTACT_757743].  
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/[ADDRESS_1037350] been broken down into two tables in the amended version of the 
protocol dated 03/16/09. Table 4a (page 37) details the results that need to be in hand before the release of the TCR transgenic cells for patient administration. Table 4b (page 37 -38) details the 
results that may be available afterwards. After this table there is a specification of the plans to 
contact [CONTACT_757720].  
 
b) Consent Form:  
 
No changes.  
 
c) HS -1 Form:  
 
No changes.  
 Amendment 2  
 
Date: April 13, 2009  
 
Main protocol and consent modifications;  
 a) Protocol:  
 
- After discussion with the FDA reviewers in a series of teleconferences and email exchanges 
on April 7 and 8 (see attached minutes of these information exchanges), we deleted the 
requirement for quantitation of the number of copy inserts of retroviral vector in the final product. The FDA reviewers agreed with us that the quantitation of surface TCR expression in 
transduced cells was  a good quantitative assessment of transduction efficiency. In fact, the 
previously IRB approved protocol had this test listed twice, as lot release criteria and as optional additional testing in the TCR transduced cells.  
- We clarified the intent of the schedule of events as the intent to perform the protocol 
procedures on those days. However, since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_757632], we clarify in this second amendment that 
the dates are approxi mate.  
- The use of antiementics and prophylactic antifungals was updated to match the standard practice in the stem cell transplantation ward at UCLA.  
- The administration of MESNA was corrected to continuous intravenous infusion for 24 hours.  
 b) Consent Form : 
 
- We received the NIH Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC). Therefore, we added back the CoC language to the consent form.  
- We corrected a typographical error in page 7.  
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
76  
c) HS -1 Form:  
 
No changes.  
 
Amendment 3  
 Date: May 26, 2009  
 
Main protocol and consent modifications;  
 a) Protocol:  
 
- After new discussion with the FDA reviewers on April 27 (see attached minutes), we slightly 
modified our ex vivo culture plan after transduction to limit it to 4 days, which following the 
Guidance for Industry for Replication Competent Retrovirus (RCR) testing (November 2006) 
allows us to bank but not prospectively test for RCR in the final product. The FDA reviewers 
agreed with us that a reasonable plan would be to test samples from peripheral blood obtained 
at 3, [ADDRESS_1037351] 
sample if one of the patient -derived samples is positive for RCR. The proposed S+/L - assay is 
a one- month assay with high costs that would not be able to provide results in time for patient 
safety. Therefore, we discussed with the FDA and went onto amend our protocol following the Guidance for Industry plan for studies where gene- modified cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_757633] 4 days. This was included in Table 4b and Sections 10.1.9 and [IP_ADDRESS]. 
- The timing of sampling of blood of patients for RCR was modified to follow the Guidance for 
Industry document to samples at 3, 6 and 12 months, and stored samples annually thereafter (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
- The reporting of the results of t he mycoplasma PCR -based rapid test was changed, and we 
changed it in the protocol accordingly (Tables 4a and 10, and Section 10.2.10).  
- We deleted a 100 ml blood draw for immune monitoring analysis that was planned on day +[ADDRESS_1037352] two patients this blood draw provided very few lymphocytes since the blood draw happens at a time when the patient is pancytopenic. Analysis of these lymphocytes by 
[CONTACT_757721].  
- We added a note in the schedule of events (Section 2) and in the protocol description in Section 8.[ADDRESS_1037353] practices in J -Medicine (Section 8.3).  
- Minor typographical errors were corrected throughout and marked in tracking mode in one of 
the protocol copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
b) Informed Consent Form  
 
- Upon review of the ICF we noted that there was no good explanation of the amount and timing 
of blood draws for immune monitoring analysis. Therefore, we added a paragraph in Section [ADDRESS_1037354] for autopsy.  
 
MART -1 F5 TCR Prot ocol 01/10/2018                                             
 
77 c) HS -1 Form:  
 
- A new grant from our collaborator [CONTACT_757744] from the University  of Connecticut, with a 
UCLA subcontract, was added as funding source for this research project. 
- The timing of immune monitoring assays was added to the experimental procedures.  
- The tables of cell therapy lot release criteria were updated to match the tables included in the 
protocol after amendments 1, 2 and 3.  
 
Amendment 4  
 Date: July 16, 2009  
 Main protocol and consent modifications;  
 a) Protocol:  
 
- A new section (8.12.) was added to allow the administration of booster MART -1 peptide pulsed 
DC vaccinations  when the levels of MART -1-specific T cells would fall lower than 5% of total T 
lymphocytes. The schedule of events was included in the new section 2.1.  
- The requirement for paired tumor biopsies as inclusion criteria was changed to performing 
biopsies when felt feasible by [CONTACT_30967].  
- An appendix at the end of the protocol detailing the sequential protocol amendments was 
added.  
- Minor typographical errors were corrected throughout and marked in tracking mode in one of the protocol copi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
b) Informed Consent Form  
 
- The ICF was updated to include the administration of [ADDRESS_1037355] information for study investigators was updated. 
 
c) HS -1 Form:  
 
- A new grant from our collaborator [CONTACT_757745] from the [LOCATION_004] Institute of Technology, with a UCLA subcontract, was added as funding source for this research project.  
- The changes in the eligibility not strictly requiring paired tumor biopsies were included.  
- The addition of booster DC vaccinations was included.

Amendment 8  
 
Date: December 17, 2010 
 
Main protocol and consent modifications  
 
a) Protocol: The following is a description of the major changes in Amendment 8 and the reasoning 
behind them:  
 1. Four days of Fludarabine at 25 mg/m
2/day instead of 5 days:  
 
The available information based on the course, correlative studies and outcome of the SAE on patient F5- [ADDRESS_1037359] likely cause (see full description of the SAE). The most likely cause of a delayed marrow aplasia is fludarabine. Therefore, we have decreased the number of fludarabine doses at 25 mg/m

80 A potential adverse contributor to the marrow aplasia in patient F5 -10 is the 14 doses of IL- 2 that 
this patient received, which is higher than other patients treated in this protocol. The prior versions 
of the protocol included dosing IL -2 at 600,000 IU/kg every [ADDRESS_1037360] administered the 
same conditioning regimen followed by [CONTACT_455098]- 2 to over 200 patients, they feel that the 
dosing of IL- 2 may be an adverse contributor. In addition, review of the literature shows that higher 
doses of IL- 2 up to 15 (720,000 IU/kg, 8 hourly  for 5 days) lead to grade 3/4 toxicities whereas 
decreasing it to a maximum of 9 (720,000 IU/kg, 8 hourly for 3 days) results in fewer toxicities and 
still have the anti -tumor activities in conjunction with the adoptive cell transfer (ACT) 7,21. In fact, 
there was a trend wherein less doses of IL- 2 correlated with higher clinical responses. Therefore, 
we plan to cap the number of IL- 2 doses to a maximum of 9 doses.  
 3. Using freshly harvested F5 MART -1 TCR transgenic T cells:  
 
The major problem for patients treated within this protocol has been relapse of melanoma after an initial tumor response. Our ongoing experiments analyzing the functionality of the TCR transgenic 
cells recovered from patients demonstrate a progressive loss of ability to secrete multiple 
cytokines upon MART -[ADDRESS_1037361] performed by [CONTACT_757722]. Lili Yang and 
David Baltimore from the [LOCATION_004] Institute of Technology (Caltech) indicated that 
cryopreservation has a profound detrimental effect on the in vivo  long- term survival of the 
adoptively transferred T cells and their ability to have a secondary response to antigen exposure. 
We noted a similar effect within our clinical trial, since in patient F5 -[ADDRESS_1037362] prompted us to modify our protocol to avoid cryopreservation of the TCR 
transgenic cells administered to patients, which is included in Amendment 8.

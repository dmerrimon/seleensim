IRB # [ADDRESS_61698], will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_56543] 6 clinician and 5 patient enrollment variables. Rates of treatment and 
assessment completion will also be reported. Clinician adherence will be evaluated by [CONTACT_56544] 20% of treatment 
sessions according to a UP adherence checklist and reporting adherence rates within each condition. 
Study and Treatment Acceptability . Quantitative measures of study and treatment acceptability (e.g., 
the AFQ, Clinician and Patient Versions) will be assessed through the use of descriptive statistics. Qualitative 
analyses of clinician and patient perceptions of study and treatment protocols will be analyzed in conjunction 
with quantitative results (e.g., QUAL + QUAN121, 122). Qualitative analysts will review interview recordings and 
transcriptions, identifying and coding the primary issues raised by [CONTACT_56545] a grounded theory123, 
embedded in Willms, et al.’s124guidelines for coding: reaching consensus on coding assignment, identifying 
concordance among codes, and using the process of constant comparisons to generate a taxonomy of themes 
and identify their relationships to one another. This will have analysts: 1) review all transcripts to develop a broad 
understanding of the content and document initial impressions of topi[INVESTIGATOR_56539], defining the boundaries of 
specific codes125, 2) independently code empi[INVESTIGATOR_56540] a 
codebook, 3) discuss disagreements in code assignment/description (each test will be reviewed by [CONTACT_56546]), 4) compare reliability of assigning the same codes to identical text segments126, and 5) use the 
computer program NVivo  to examine the association between different a priori and emergent categories. 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_56541] (ordering and discontinuation). In addition to our primary aim of 
establishing the feasibility/acceptability of our personalization strategies and study design, we seek to determine 
whether a preliminary signal exists to support the notion that personalized sequencing and target-informed 
discontinuation can enhance treatment efficiency. First, to explore whether personalized sequencing leads to 
more efficient improvements in the core process addressed by [CONTACT_56547], we will use hierarchical linear mixed 
modeling (HLMM) to compare the average rate of change in clinical outcomes among the three UP sequencing 
conditions (UPS, UPP-CA, and UPP-CO). The primary outcome measure for aim is the distress aversion 
subscale from the MEAQ (MEAQ-DA), which has previously been used to demonstrate target engagement with 
the UP (see Preliminary Studies). Additionally, to examine whether core process engagement can serve as an 
early indicator of treatment response, prompting discontinuation, we will assess variability in MEAQ-DA levels at 
the second stage randomization (S5 assessment), along with the degree to which any patients randomized to 
discontinue demonstrate additional symptom improvement (using HAM-A ratings) in the absence of treatment 
such that they are responders by [CONTACT_941] W20 assessment. We will also explore whether patterns exist between S5 
MEAQ-DA scores and responder status for those that discontinued after session 6.  
Power Analyses. 
This proposal is designed as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_56542], as noted in the RFA, collect relevant data to inform the design 
(and increase the likelihood of obtaining meaningful results) in a subsequent well-powered trial. To do this, we 
are measuring potential mechanisms of change and exploring preliminary effect sizes and the variability of 
treatment effects. This will allow us (and future reviewers) to determine whether further testing is warranted.

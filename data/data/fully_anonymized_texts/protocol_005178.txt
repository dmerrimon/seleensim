TOLERANCE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES
(SLEEPDIABETES)
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_382707],  Ph.D  
Medical Investigator: Frank Greenway, M.D.
BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
Hypoxia in obese adipose tissue (AT) plays an important role in the development of 
whole-body insulin resistance by [CONTACT_593200]-
inflammatory cytokines (reviewed in [1]). Detrimental effects of hypoxia are also evident in the 
altered glucose  metabolism  induced  by [CONTACT_593201],  a condition characterized by [CONTACT_593202][INVESTIGATOR_1841]  [2, 3]. However, there  are conflicting reports about the effects of 
altitude hypoxia on insulin action and glucose uptake [4]. 
Short-duration (4 hours) of exposure to moderate  hypoxia has been  shown to improve 
transient insulin sensitivity in type-2 diabetics [5], and more  prolonged exposure  was shown to 
increase whole-body glucose turnover and utilization in healthy subjects [6]. Exposure to 
hypoxic environments  has also been  shown to increase both whole-body  glucose  fluxes in 
healthy males  and glucose  uptake in human and murine skeletal muscle [7]. Controlled  studies 
at altitude following acute exposure to hypoxia  during  exercise  have reported improved 
carbohydrate metabolism,  including increased  glucose oxidation, reduced fasting insulin and 
glucose, and higher  fluxes of glucose  [8]. In addition,  Cartee at al. reported enhanced insulin- 
independent translocation of glucose transporters by [CONTACT_593203]  [9]. Living at 
altitude in hypoxic conditions is associated with a lower  prevalence of impaired fasting glucose 
and type 2 diabetes,  as compared  to low altitude [10]. 
Exposure to hypoxia has also been advocated as a possible therapeutic  aid against 
obesity [11], hypoxia being  known to reduce energy intake  and to affect  protein  synthesis  [12]. A 
highly publicized  study showed  reduced  rates of obesity  at high altitude [13]. Moreover,  hypoxia  
has been shown  to be beneficial as a complement to exercise in healthy  non-obese [14], obese  
[15, 16] and athletes  [17-19] to improve skeletal muscle function. 
We have provided the first evidence that intermittent, nightly exposure to moderate 
hypoxia was beneficial in improving insulin sensitivity in healthy obese  patients and, therefore, 
lowers the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_593188] 2 diabetes  [20]. Benefits  included  reduced fasting glucose 
levels and improved whole-body (skeletal  muscle)  and hepatic insulin sensitivity. Whether such  
intermittent hypoxia  improves  glucose metabolism in people  with type 2 diabetes  is unknown.
Reasons for the Protocol  Modification  and its Safety Implications:
The safety aspects  and history of this protocol deserve further comment. It is important 
to the concept  of using a hypoxia  tent to treat diabetes  to use as a home treatment.  Although 
the degree of hypoxia generated by [CONTACT_593204] a safety concern to the FDA, there  was 
concern that safety would be compromised if the hypoxia of sleep apnea was added to the 
hypoxia of the tent. The initial  approach  to eliminating this safety  concern  in the study  was to

Approved 09/06/2017
PBRC# 2015-018
Page 2 of 16 Version Date: 8/21/17ensure that the participants did not have sleep apnea.  Although this is one way to eliminate the 
threat of sleep apnea-associated hypoxia, it has been very hard to identify these individuals.  
Another way to eliminate  sleep  apnea-associated  hypoxia is to treat the sleep  apnea  
with C-PAP, the standard way in which sleep apnea is treated. C-PAP is a continuous pressure 
administered by [CONTACT_593205]. The 
C-PAP essentially  draws  air from the surrounding  environment and creates  the pressure to keep 
the airway open  using  a fan. Therefore, the C-PAP machine  could  be put in the hypoxia tent 
with a cord extending  to a wall socket  outside the tent to power  the machine. In this way the C-
PAP would draw  in hypoxic air from the tent, but would  also insure that additional hypoxia would 
not occur  due to the C-PAP eliminating  the sleep apnea. 
Since it has been shown by [CONTACT_593206]. [24] that 86% of overweight  and obese  
diabetic subjects  have sleep apnea, we feel that, in addition to including subjects without sleep  
apnea, we should include patients with sleep apnea controlled on C-PAP. Both of these groups 
of patients will be protected from any additional  hypoxia associated with sleep apnea that would 
add to the safe hypoxia generated by [CONTACT_593207], but including the group with sleep apnea 
controlled on C-PAP  will allow us to enroll and complete the study  which has only enrolled one 
patient in over a year when limiting those studied to those  without sleep apnea.

RECRUITMENT
Potential participants will be recruited through the PBRC website, e-mails, flyer distribution, and 
word-of-mouth. Individuals will call or e-mail the Recruitment  Core at PBRC  and will undergo a 
phone screen to answer a series of yes or no questions regarding their age, gender, body 
weight and height, changes in body  weight during the last month,  presence  of disease, and 
smoking status. Eligible  individuals will be scheduled for their screening  visit at the PBRC 
Outpatient Clinic.

Page 4 of 16 Version Date: 8/21/17SCREENING
Participants will report to the PBRC clinic after a >10-h overnight fast. The screening  visit 
includes an explanation  of the purpose of the study, a description of the procedures and the 
reading and signing  of informed consent.  Volunteers will then complete a brief personal and 
family medical history. Height, weight,  waist and hip circumference, vital signs  (blood pressure, 
pulse, oral temperature) will be measured. Volunteers will then have an EKG. Subjects with a 
previous sleep apnea diagnosis must possess a C-PAP  device and must  agree to use the 
CPAP device during the nights spent in the tent; if no C-PAP  device is available for usage,  the 
subject will not be eligible to participate  in the study.  If subjects are considered  to be eligible up 
to this point, blood will be drawn for a complete blood count, blood chemistry (Chem15), and a 
hemoglobin A1-C as part of the draw . Subjects  who do not meet  the eligibility criteria will be 
immediately informed in person or by [CONTACT_648]. An interview with a trained  psychologist will 
identify potential barriers  to enrollment into the SLEEPDIABETES study and also barriers to 
have the hypoxia tent system  setup  at the participant’s home. Only subjects without a previous 
sleep apnea diagnosis  and who meet all eligibility  criteria will next undergo a two-step process 
to: (1) confirm the absence of sleep apnea (home sleep test, or HST), as well as (2) confirm  
these subjects without  a sleep apnea diagnosis exhibit safe oxygen  saturation  levels (monitored 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_593190], a certified sleep laboratory) while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_593191]. Subjects previously diagnosed with 
sleep apnea and who possess a C-PAP device  will not undergo  testing at the Louisiana Sleep 
Foundation.
(1) Home Sleep Test (HST): Subjects  without  a sleep apnea  diagnosis will first undergo  a home 
sleep test conducted by [CONTACT_593210]. John K. 
Schwab, MD, DABSM,  the chief medical director of the Foundation. Subjects will obtain the 
home sleep  test from [CONTACT_593223] and will be given instructions on how to wear  the device 
during a single  night  of sleep. The device will record  breathing rates  and oxygen  saturation 
levels throughout the single night of sleep. After  the single night sleep, subjects will be 
instructed to return the device to the Louisiana  Sleep Foundation where  [CONTACT_593223] will review 
the sleep data and identify the potential presence  of sleep apnea. If the presence of sleep 
apnea is detected, subjects will be immediately informed of their ineligibility to participate in the 
study. If a negative test for sleep apnea is concluded, subjects will next undergo  a monitored  
sleep study.
(2) Monitored Sleep Study:  Subjects who have a negative  test for sleep apnea following a HST 
will next undergo  a monitored night  of sleep under hypoxic conditions at the Louisiana Sleep 
Foundation. Subjects will arrive at the Louisiana Sleep Foundation on the evening  of their 
monitored sleep  study. A sleep technician will closely monitor  the subject’s oxyhemoglobin 
saturation throughout a single night of sleep under hypoxic conditions (2400 m altitude). 
Hypoxic conditions will be achieved via a hypoxic tent, as previously described and conducted 
at Pennington Biomedical  Research Center  [20]. Following the technician-monitored night of 
sleep, [CONTACT_593223]  will review the sleep data and provide  insight as to the subject’s ability  to 
participate in the study given expected oxyhemoglobin saturation levels at 2400 m. Subjects

Page 5 of 16 Version Date: 8/21/17who exhibit <78% oxyhemoglobin  saturations, or who display sleep data of safety concern to [CONTACT_593224], will be informed  of their ineligibility to participate in the study.  
If the HST and sleep center monitoring are within safe ranges for study participation  following 
evaluation by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Schwab, the participant will officially  be accepted  into the study  and will begin 
baseline testing (Day 0) within  weeks and in agreement with schedules. All subjects who have a 
known sleep apnea diagnosis, possess a C-PAP  device, and are agreeable to using the C-PAP  
device during the nights spent in the tent will be accepted into the study  as well.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
This study  includes outpatient  and in-home visits and will consist of three periods: 
1) Baseline measures  of glucose tolerance (OGTT) and body composition (DXA)
2) Intervention involving 14 night stays  in simulated altitude (hypoxic tent in home)  
3) Post-treatment (after 14 nights in hypoxia) measures of glucose tolerance
After screening, subjects will be asked  to maintain their usual diet and physical activity levels.  
Baseline: 
A 75-g OGTT will be performed. Body  composition will be measured  by [CONTACT_11324]. Fasting plasma 
fructosamine will also be collected  via blood draw. A urine  pregnancy test will be performed  on 
all females of child-bearing potential  prior to the DXA. 
Intervention: Nightly exposure  to hypoxia
Over the following 14 nights, participants  will sleep under  a tent simulating an altitude of 2400m  
(~7500 ft) for 7-[ADDRESS_782738] treatment measurements:
After the 7th night of hypoxic sleep, participants will come to the Pennington  Biomedical clinic to 
provide a fasting  blood sample  to measure glucose and insulin. We will also collect  information  
of the quality of their sleep under the hypoxic tent.
The morning of the 14th exposure  to hypoxia,  participants will come  to the Pennington 
Biomedical clinic facilities in a fasting state to perform a post intervention  assessment.  
Approximately 15 min after arrival, a 75-g OGTT will be performed. Fasting plasma  
fructosamine and hemoglobin A1-C will also be collected via blood draw.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES
Urine and blood.
At screening, 9.5ml of blood  will be collected for CBC, Chem15 panel,  and hemoglobin A1-C 
analysis. Urine will also be collected  at screening for urinalysis. Approximately 39.[ADDRESS_782739]-intervention for the OGTT, 
fructosamine, and hemoglobin A1-C analysis. Archives (~10 mL; serum and plasma) will be 
collected at baseline, mid-intervention, and post-intervention for future analysis.  Following the 
7th night spent in the hypoxic tent, ~2 ml of blood  will be drawn  for plasma  glucose  and insulin  
concentrations. A total of approximately  122.5 mL (approx. 8.5 Tbl.) of blood will be taken.
Vital signs
Vital signs  will be measured while the subject lying on a bed. Body temperature  (sublingual) will 
be measured using  an electronic thermometer  (Sure Temp  679, Welch Allyn) and blood 
pressure using a manometer  (Baumanometer.  W.A. Baum Co., Inc. [LOCATION_003]). Heart  rate will be 
measured by [CONTACT_593211] 60 seconds.  
Overnight exposure  to hypoxia (simulated altitude)
Pennington staff will visit the participant’s  home and setup the hypoxic tent system. This person 
will also instruct participants on how to use the equipment. Participants  will spend  14 
consecutive nights in the “altitude tent”, with the simulated altitude being  set at 2400m  over sea-
level. Hypoxia will be obtained by [CONTACT_593212] (Hypoxico 
Inc., NY). Briefly, ambient  air is filtered  and a small part of the oxygen removed before the 
modified air is flushed in the airtight  tent. Altitude is mimicked by [CONTACT_593213]. However the physiological stimulus is 
comparable and has been used in multiple studies involving different populations. This altitude  
corresponds approximately to the altitude of most mountain resorts and of Mexico City, one of

altitudes eliciting  a physiological response  to hypoxia, and has been  proven to be safe in obese 
patients during  a 1-week exposure  [11]. 
Oral glucose tolerance test  
Glucose tolerance will be assessed  using an oral [ADDRESS_782740] (OGTT).    
Subjects will be studied after an overnight fast. An intravenous  line will be placed  and one 
baseline sample  will be drawn at -5 minutes.  The subjects will then consume a 75 g glucose 
beverage within 5 minutes. Blood  samples will be collected at 30, 60, 90, and 120 to measure 
serum glucose,  insulin, and free fatty acid concentrations.  Whole  body insulin sensitivity will be 
calculated using the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (10,000/square root of [fasting glucose x 
fasting insulin] x [mean OGTT glucose  x mean  OGTT insulin]). We will also assess  insulin 
secretion as described by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. SE Kahn.  In brief, the early insulin response during the OGTT, 
also known as the insulinogenic index is calculated as the ratio of the change  in insulin to the 
change in glucose concentrations from 0 to 30 minutes.  The oral disposition index (DIo), a 
measure of b-cell function is calculated as [∆ insulin0-30min/∆ glucose0-30min] x 1/fasting 
insulin.  Complementary  to the glucose  response, we would also monitor  the changes in the 
blood FFAs  as a measure  of the adipose  tissue capability to suppress lipolysis in response to 
insulin.  So, it can be used as a marker  of insulin sensitivity in terms of adipose tissue.  We will 
calculate the insulin sensitivity index for blood FFAs  by [CONTACT_6388]:  ISI (ffa) = 2/(INSp  × FFAp) 
+ 1), where INSp and FFAp indicate insulinemic and blood FFA areas, respectively, of the 
person under study recorded during  the OGTT.
DXA scan
Dual X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans will be performed using the GE iDXA whole-body 
scanner to assess body  composition. The protocol requires  that participants  lie on a table  
wearing a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593192], while  the scanner emits low energy  X-
rays and a detector passes along  the body. The scan takes 10 minutes  and the radiation dose is 
less than 1 mrem, equal to about  12 hours of background radiation. Fat mass is calculated  from 
weight (kg) on a scale and % body fat and fat-free mass by [CONTACT_593214] (kg).
Sample size. This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_593193] 2 
diabetes. We therefore  did not perform a power  analysis.
Data analysis
Data will be expressed as mean +/- SE. Values before and after exposure to hypoxia will be 
compared using  the paired Student’s t test or a Wilcoxon rank signed test. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_593194], the results may be published as a short  communication depending on the 
potential changes in insulin sensitivity.
Data collection, storage  and confidentiality
All results will be kept in locked file cabinets  and restricted-access computers. All of these will 
be kept separate from records with names  and other  personal information. The only people  who

research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will be included that would 
reveal the identity  of these patients. Participants will be identified  by [CONTACT_593216]. Authorized  representatives of the National 
Institutes of Health  may need to review records of individual participants. As a result,  they may 
see their name; but they are bound by [CONTACT_593217]’ identity 
to others.
RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
The known risks, inconveniences or side effects involved in this study are the following:

EKG There are no risks associated with this test. There is a small 
possibility there may be some redness or irritation if you happen to 
be allergic to the adhesive  on the electrodes.  
Body composition by 
[CONTACT_593218].  The 
radiation dose  for this scan is equivalent to the radiation you are 
naturally exposed to in the environment in less than one day.  Scans 
will not be performed  on any subject who is pregnant, and all 
females should inform  the DXA technologist if there is any 
possibility that they are pregnant.    
Blood Draws Bruising, bleeding,  pain, infection. These will be minimized by [CONTACT_593219].
Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_593195] (simulated 
altitude ~ 2400m)Some patients may feel a slight  discomfort and feeling of 
claustrophobia while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_593196]. Participants will be 
free to exit the tent if they feel claustrophobic. There should  not be 
any risk associated to sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_593197] <2500m since: (1) 
those participants with diagnosed sleep apnea will wear a C-PAP  
device while sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_593198], 
and (2) those participants with suspected sleep apnea or 
participants that showcase unsafe  oxygen saturation levels during 
the single  night stay throughout testing  at the Louisiana Sleep 
Foundation will be excluded. Recent reviews suggest an 
acclimatization process for higher altitudes  [21, 22]. Acute altitude 
sickness may nonetheless be experienced by [CONTACT_593220],  
with symptoms as headache,  anorexia,  and nausea, which might 
however be transient [21]. High altitude pulmonary edema is very 
unlikely at such altitude, being  known  to occur at much higher 
altitudes and with exercise [23]. However,  we will exclude 
participants with high altitude sickness and monitor for altitude 
sickness by [CONTACT_593221]  (which usually 
happen in the first 6-24 hours) such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, insomnia, loss of appetite and dyspnea. 
Adverse events will be monitored  throughout the study, and 
participants with acute altitude sickness  will be withdrawn from the 
study. 
Risk Classification: The study  risk can be classified as moderate since we have already used 
this same paradigm in 8 participants  with obesity (see reference  #20) and we will exclude  all 
potential participants  with congestive heart failure, prior cardiovascular  events such  as stroke or 
myocardial infarction and those with diagnosed  sleep apnea  and lack a C-PAP  device to wear 
throughout the nights spent in the tent.

medical investigator of the study to minimize  potential risks and discomforts to study subjects. 
Research participants  will be immediately withdrawn from the study upon evidence  of any 
serious adverse  event.  
Eligible subjects without  a previous sleep apnea diagnosis will undergo  an extensive two-step 
sleep evaluation,  involving  a home  sleep  test as well as a monitored  sleep  test at the Louisiana 
Sleep Foundation, to identify the presence  of sleep apnea as well as closely  monitor  and 
evaluate oxyhemoglobin saturation levels during a single night sleep at [ADDRESS_782741] 
safety precautions  are taken. Only those subjects  who exemplify safe oxyhemoglobin saturation 
levels during both sleep evaluation tests will be allowed to enroll in the study.
Eligible subjects with previous  sleep apnea diagnosis who possess a C-PAP device will be 
required to use the C-PAP device throughout the nights  spent  in the tent. 
Adverse Event Reporting: Adverse event monitoring will occur at mid-intervention (Day  7) and 
post-intervention (Day  14) visits, and participants will be instructed to call the study coordinator  
([CONTACT_593225])  at the onset of any abnormal effects (headache, nausea, vomiting,  dizziness) 
between visits. 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan. Drs. Ravussin  and Greenway will be responsible for monitoring 
the data, assuring protocol compliance, and conducting safety  reviews  after completion  of the 
first participants and then every [ADDRESS_782742] will monitor 
adverse events and determine if they are attributed to the study  procedures.  If any of those 
adverse events are suspected to be related to study procedures, they will be immediately 
reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_72616].  
Such study has already been  conducted in 8 participants with obesity and identified  a 20% 
improvement in insulin sensitivity.
Potential Benefits: There is no direct benefit to the volunteers but knowledge may be gained 
that will benefit others. Participants  will, however,  receive some information about their health. 
Payment for Participation: If participant completes  all 14 days of the study,  they will receive 
$350 for the time spent  in the clinic. Conversely, if the participant  completes the mid-intervention 
visit (Day 7) but does not complete the post-intervention visit (Day 14), the participant will 
receive $175. And finally, if the participant enrolls in the study but does not complete the mid-
intervention visit (Day 7) or beyond,  the participant will receive  $50. This compensation is in line 
with all the other studies  conducted at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center and will be 
mailed within 4 weeks  of study completion.
Financial Obligations of the Subjects: None

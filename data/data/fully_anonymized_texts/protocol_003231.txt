1.1 Study Objectives
The current proposal aims to establish proof-of-concept that neural cue-reactivity can serve as an early, 
objective marker of electronic cigarette (ECIG) addictive potential. Further, this proposal will examine 
the effect of flavor and nicotine concentration on the addictive potential of ECIGs to aid research 
informing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) flavor regulations and smoking cessation.
The specific aims of the study are: 
Aim 1: Determine if smokers and e-cigarette users have pre-conditioned neural cue-reactivity to tobacco 
or fruit-flavored ECIG odors. 
 
Aim 2: Examine the effect of flavor and nicotine on ECIG odor cue-reactivity after conditioning.  
Aim 3: Determine if strawberry vanilla flavor results in stronger cue-reactivity than tobacco flavor.  
Hypothesis: We expect the group assigned to the 18 mg/ml strawberry vanilla flavor to show larger 
increases in neural cue-reactivity to their assigned odor than the 18 mg/ml tobacco flavor group.
1.2 Primary Study Endpoints
The primary study endpoint is odor cue-reactivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be 
used to measure neural cue-reactivity to the ECIG odors presented in the study.
1.[ADDRESS_1077951] use behaviors.8
Compulsive drug-seeking behavior is known to be driven by [CONTACT_783817].9 A neurobehavioral process that occurs across substances of 
abuse is the development of conditioned reactivity to drug cues.10 Drug cues alone can elicit craving, 
drug-seeking behavior, and relapse.10 11 Cue-reactivity is mediated by [CONTACT_783818].12-14 Physiological cue-reactivity has been found to develop after 
only 11 pairings between environmental cues and smoking.15 Using functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI), our group was the first to show evidence of neural reactivity to visual ECIG images 
among regular ECIG users.[ADDRESS_1077952] the 
potential to significantly enhance ECIG cue conditioning.16 17

Page 5 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) 2.[ADDRESS_1077953]. Foulds and The Penn State Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (TCORS) team conducted a survey 
of over 6,[ADDRESS_1077954] participants used e-liquids with nicotine concentrations between 13 and 18 
mg/ml and dependence increased with the level of nicotine concentration.18 Many participants reported 
that they switched from cig-a-like devices to advanced devices that deliver more nicotine and offer a 
variety of flavor options.19 ECIG users’ top-rated flavors fell into 3 categories; tobacco, dessert/sweets, 
and fruit.[ADDRESS_1077955] and executive control networks.20 Surprisingly, neural connectivity 
changes were not influenced by [CONTACT_783819], which varied widely 
with participants’ personal devices.20 21 This finding supports our hypothesis that other conditioned 
features of ECIG use influence neuroadaptations.
The Penn State Center for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Research (CNMRR) has pi[INVESTIGATOR_783807]. [CONTACT_783845] and his colleagues have shown that the neural olfaction sensory 
system overlaps with limbic and prefrontal regions involved in associative learning, including the 
hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC).[ADDRESS_1077956] proposes to use the olfactometer (Emerging Tech 
Trans  inc), a commercially available MRI device developed by [CONTACT_783820].

This method can inform FDA regulations on the abuse liability of new flavored tobacco products and 
provide an early neuromarker of success for smokers attempting to switch from cigarettes to ECIGs.

requirement. [Complete Section 5.5]
 
5.2 Obtaining Informed Consent 
5.2.1 Timing and Location of Consent 
Screening portion: Subjects will have the screening portion of the study explained to them in 
detail over a phone call. They will have the opportunity to ask any questions and then will be 
asked to give their verbal consent to take part in the screening portion.
Randomization/MRI portion: When participants attend their remote screening visit, they will have the 
study explained to them in detail, and be given a long form consent form to look over before their in-
person MRI visit. They will have the opportunity to ask questions at both visits and then will be asked to 
sign their consent form at the in-person visit. .
5.2.2 Coercion or Undue Influence during Consent 
Once potential study volunteers are identified, they will be given information about the study 
and offered the opportunity to participate.  The researchers obtaining consent will be instructed 
to clearly indicate that the participant’s enrolling in the trial is purely voluntary and the 
researchers will not offer comments about whether they believe the participant should enroll in 
the study or not.  Given the number of contacts and visits involved in the study protocol, the 
compensation provided to the participant is modest.
5.3 Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent 
5.3.1 Indicate which of the following conditions applies to this research:
  The research presents no more that minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no 
procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context.
OR
  The only record linking the subject and the research would be the consent document and the 
principal risk would be potential harm resulting from a breach of confidentiality. Each subject 
will be asked whether the subject wants documentation linking the subject with the research, 
and the subject’s wishes will govern. (Note: This condition is not applicable for FDA-regulated 
research. If this category is chosen, include copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a consent form and /or parental 
permission form for participants who want written documentation linking them to the 
research.)
OR
  If the subjects or legally authorized representatives are members of a distinct cultural group 
or community in which signing forms is not the norm, that the research presents no more 
than minimal risk of harm to subjects and provided there is an appropriate alternative 
mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained.  ( Note: This condition is not 
applicable for FDA-regulated research.) 
Describe the alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained:

Page 10 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) Participants who are interested in the study will be asked to consent to allow the researcher to 
pre-screen them for the study over the phone and/or Zoom by [CONTACT_783827] (eligible or ineligible).  Participants will be asked if this information can be 
retained so that the study team will know reasons that participants are not eligible for the 
study.
5.3.2 Indicate what materials, if any, will be used to inform potential subjects about the research 
(e.g., a letter accompanying a questionnaire, verbal script, implied consent form, or summary 
explanation of the research)

7.[ADDRESS_1077966], participants will be directed to complete a short survey (online or over the 
phone) to determine eligibility for the study as part of the call routing screen protocol #2213 
(Screener 1). If their information indicates potential eligibility, they will be contact[CONTACT_783828] 2 (a longer and more in-depth screening for the specific study) which 
is completed over the phone. Once the participant is determined eligible from Screener 2, 
remote screening visit will be scheduled where participants will complete the Visit Screener to 
determine final eligibility. 
7.2.2 Final Screening Visit  - Remote Visit
A Penn State Health Zoom meeting link will be emailed to participant for the previously 
scheduled time along with a PDF copy of the long form written consent. 
Participants who meet preliminary eligibility criteria on the phone screen (Screener 2) will 
complete more in-depth screening measures on their smoking, substance use, medical, and 
psychiatric history via interview and computerized questionnaires via Zoom. Additionally, a CCQ 
(Clinical COPD Questionnaire, 10 items) will be administered to allow the pulmonologist on the 
study team to review changes in health status to lung function, degree of dyspnoea and (change 
in) functional capacity. This will be administered at all study visits. Participants will then 
complete the B-SIT test At the conclusion of the visit, eligible participants will be instructed to 
abstain from using any tobacco products for [ADDRESS_1077967]. All participants

Page 14 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) 7.2.3 Randomization/Pre-Conditioning fMRI Visit (Day 0) – In Person/Remote
Participants will sign their long form written consent at this visit prior to any further study 
procedures.
Exhaled breath CO (eCO) will be measured at the start of the visit. A urine sample will also be 
collected and tested for cotinine using the NICCheck cotinine test and pregnancy if participants 
are of child bearing potential. Eligible participants will then be randomized to one of the four 
conditions and asked to complete the baseline assessments. This includes the standardized 
smell test (B-Sit), adverse events assessment and computerized questionnaires of cigarette use, 
cigarette dependence, liking, and withdrawal as indicated in Table 1. Some of the measures can 
be done remotely via Zoom, others will need to be completed in person. The remote 
assessments will be conducted via a Zoom session within 3 days following the scheduled in-
Person MRI. The remote visit will only occur after written consent has been obtained. This is 
being done to limit the amount of face-to-face time during study visits.
Then, participants will complete the fMRI odor cue-reactivity task in the MRI scanner lasting 
approximately 45 minutes. During the scan, participants will be administered four flavors in 
separate 4 minutes blocks for eight runs. The flavors will be delivered to the participant’s 
nostrils via tubing from the olfactometer machine. The release of the flavors will be timed with 
participants’ natural rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_783811]. At the end of this visit 
participants will be given the ECIG device and 4-week supply of their randomly assigned flavor 
cartridges (approximately 2 cartridges/day) and instructed on how to use the device. 
Participants will be instructed to take at least [ADDRESS_1077968] 
conventional cigarette smoking. The participant will be instructed to bring back all used and 
unused cartomizers to the study center. ECIG puffs per day and cigarettes per day will be 
recorded on a daily log. Participants will receive a daily REDCap survey link via text message 
using the Twilio service. Participants will be instructed on how to complete the survey and will 
be provided with a paper log to tally their cigarette use throughout the day. Participants who 
are unable or unwilling to receive study text messages will track their cigarette use on the paper 
log only.
7.2.4 Conditioning Phase Check-in Visit (Day 14 ± 7 days) - Remote
Participants will take part in a remote visit via Zoom to report their ECIG use and cigarettes per 
day (CPD) (collected in the daily logs. Participants will complete the measures outlined in Table 
1. Participants will complete an adverse events assessment and discuss challenges to using their 
e- cig daily and study staff will assist in problem solving barriers to compliance. At the end of the 
visit participants will be instructed to remain abstinent from all tobacco products including their 
ECIG for [ADDRESS_1077969]-Conditioning fMRI Visit (Day 28 ± 7 days) – In Person/Remote
Participants will attend a final visit to complete biomeasures, computerized surveys, the adverse 
events assessment, and the same fMRI tasks as the baseline MRI visit as indicated in Table 1. 
Some of the measures can be done remotely via Zoom, others will need to be completed in 
person. The remote assessments will be conducted via a Zoom session ± 3 days of the scheduled 
in-Person MRI. This is being done to limit the amount of face-to-face time during study visits. 
eCO will be measured and urine will be collected for cotinine and pregnancy tests. At the end of 
the visit, participants will be debriefed and counseled on smoking cessation. All participants will 
be given a copy of the Surgeon General’s booklet ‘How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease’ (SEE 
ATTACHMENT: Surgeon General’s Booklet).

7.2.6 Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse events (AE) will be monitored at every study visit after Visit 1. This will be done by 
[CONTACT_783829]. If the participant 
indicates a new or worsening symptom, an adverse event form will be completed. This form will 
document the date of AE report, the start and end date of the symptom, a description of the AE, 
the outcome, the severity, and the action taken to resolve the symptom. Finally, it will be 
determined by [CONTACT_783830]. 
7.2.7 Appointment Reminders 
Phone call reminders will be used throughout the study to remind participants of their visit 
(approximately two days prior). Also, screening visit confirmation and directions will be 
STUDY00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 16 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) emailed/mailed to the participant prior to Visit 1. (SEE ATTACHMENT: First Appointment 
Reminder and Appointment Phone Call Text). 
7.2.8 Daily Dairies for ECIG and Cigarette Use
Prior to randomization, participants will be asked to track the number of cigarettes smoked per 
day using a paper daily diary. They will also receive a daily REDCap survey link via text message 
(through Twilio) to enter their cigarette usage. During the 4-week ECIG conditioning period, 
participants will be required to record their ECIG use (in puffs per day) and the number of 
cigarettes smoked. A paper-based daily diary designed for data collection of each product type 
will be used. Participants will also continue reporting their use via REDCap survey links each 
evening. Research assistants will review the data entered by [CONTACT_783831]. If participants did not complete the survey online, the researcher will ask the 
participant at each visit their ECIG and cigarette use. The diary will be used as a memory aid for 
the participant. (SEE ATTACHMENT: Cigarette Pack Daily Dairy and E-cigarette and Cig Daily 
Diary) 
7.2.9 MRI Scan Details 
The 45-minute MRI scan will begin with a 10-minute T1-weighted high resolution anatomical 
scan and a 5-minute resting state scan, followed by [CONTACT_783832]-reactivity functional task. Scans 
will be conducted on a Siemens 3T Prisma-Fit scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, 
[LOCATION_013]) equipped with a 64-Channel head coil. Functional images will be collected through 
T2*-weighted interleaved ascending multiband EPI [INVESTIGATOR_783812] 2.85 x 2.85 x 4mm resolution 
and slice thickness (TR=600ms, TE=30 ms) with a field of view of 230mm, 80x80 matrix size, and 
50° flip angle.
7.2.10 Flavor-Cue Reactivity Details
The olfactometer (ETT, inc: http://www.emergingtechtrans.com) will be used to deliver the e-
liquid odors to the nose during a respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]-triggered event-related fMRI cue-reactivity task. 
The tobacco and strawberry vanilla  e-liquid flavors, as well as two common control scents, 
Lavender and PEA (phenyl ethyl alcohol; that smells like rose), will be delivered in randomized 
order during 4-minute blocks over [ADDRESS_1077970] 5 weeks but no more than 8 weeks and will 
attend 2 in-person clinic visits at the study center. The randomization/pre-conditioning visit (Visit 2), 
remote check in (Visit 3) and post-conditioning visit (Visit 4), will happen within a [ADDRESS_1077971] Article(s) (Study Drug(s) and/or Study Device(s))
7.4.1 Description
The ECIG used will be the EGO ECIG. Previous work has shown that the EGO ECIG was capable of 
delivering nicotine to its users.26 This ECIG is made up of 2 parts, a battery and a cartomizer. The 
cartomizer contains the heating element and the liquid. The liquid used in the cartomizer will 
contain either 0 mg/ml or 18 mg/ml of nicotine and be either tobacco or strawberry vanilla 
STUDY00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 17 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) flavor. The nicotine concentration in the liquid and the flavor will be determined by [CONTACT_597703]. The cartomizers will be filled with liquid by [CONTACT_783833].
7.4.2 Treatment Regimen
Participants will be randomized to one of four conditions: 
Tobacco flavor ECIG (18 mg/ml nicotine concentration)
Tobacco flavor ECIG (0mg/ml nicotine concentration)
Strawberry Vanilla  flavor ECIG (18 mg/ml nicotine concentration)
Strawberry Vanilla  flavor ECIG (0mg/ml nicotine concentration)
Participants will be instructed to use their ECIG for at least [ADDRESS_1077972] to Treatment Groups
Blocked randomization stratified across gender and matched for age will be accomplished with a
1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1077973] Article
The study ECIGs will be received by [CONTACT_783834]. Unblinded staff will appropriately 
package the cartomizers and ECIG parts into packs/kits for the participants. The kits will be 
assigned numbers and the participants will be randomly assigned the kit number at the 
randomization visit (Visit 2). The blinded research assistant will not be involved in the packing 
and labelling of the kits. The blinded research assistant will be told what participant is assigned 
to which kit, which will maintain the blind.
7.4.6 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return 
[IP_ADDRESS] Receipt of Test Article 
The ECIG will be purchased online in its standard packaging and shipped to 
Penn State. Empty cartomizers also will be purchased online. The ECIG liquid 
will be purchased from reputable online ECIG liquid vendors.
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage
All study products (ECIG batteries, cartomizers, liquid) and components will 
be stored in a locked closet away from light, heat, and moisture.
[IP_ADDRESS] Preparation and Dispensing
The unblinded study staff will be responsible for filling the cartomizers with 
the appropriate nicotine concentration (0mg/ml or 18 mg/ml) and flavor 
(tobacco or strawberry vanilla)in a biological safety cabinet. Filled 
cartomizers will be stored in bottles/bags with child-proof caps. Once filled, 
unblinded staff will then put cartomizer-containing bottle into ECIG kits 
STUDY00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 18 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) labelled with unique identifiers in order to track bottles and maintain 
blinding. Unblinded staff will appropriately package kits for the participants. 
At the randomization visit (Visit 2), participants will be randomly assigned a 
Randomization ID that matches a kit number. The blinded research 
assistants will not be involved in the packing and labelling of the kits. The 
blinded research assistant will be told what participant is assigned to which 
Randomization ID, which will maintain the blind.
[IP_ADDRESS] Return or Destruction of the Test Article
Participants will be permitted to keep their ECIG device at the end of the 
study.  Participants will be required to return all used and unused 
cartomizers to the research assistant at each clinic visit using provided 
containers/bags. Participants will not keep unused cartomizers at the end of 
the study. If a participant is withdrawn for medical reasons (CVD event), 
they will be asked to return their device/cartomizers via a pre-paid envelope 
to the study center.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medications will be collected regularly throughout the trial to 
serve as covariates during analysis and to monitor participant health 
conditions.  Medications related to certain medical conditions that are 
exclusions to the study, such as COPD and current heart conditions, will 
serve to alert the study staff of the presence of these conditions during 
screening.

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL) software pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]. Blood 
oxygen level dependent (BOLD) activation during the tobacco, strawberry vanilla, and rose flavors will be 
modeled using a double-gamma hemodynamic response function, contrasted to one another, and 
merged across the two runs for each participant. To create images that capture changes from baseline 
to post-conditioning, a difference z- statistic image will be calculated by [CONTACT_783836]-conditioning image. The lavender odor is an experimental control condition that 
encourages participants to maintain attention and task engagement during the MRI scan. It is not part of 
the endpoints of the study.
STUDY00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 19 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) Aim 1: Determine if smokers and ECIG users have pre-conditioned neural cue-reactivity to tobacco or 
strawberry-vanilla ECIG odors. One- sample t-test will be conducted on the contrast of tobacco > 
strawberry vanilla, tobacco > rose, strawberry vanilla > rose to identify anatomical brain regions where 
tobacco elicits greater neural activation over strawberry vanilla and rose odors and strawberry vanilla 
elicits greater activation over rose odors. We expect tobacco odor to elicit greater activation in the 
ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior insula, and OFC than the strawberry vanilla and rose for 
combustible cigarette smokers and tobacco-flavored e-cigarette users. We expect strawberry-vanilla 
odor to elicit greater activation in ventral striatum, amygdala, anterior insula, and OFC than tobacco and 
rose for fruit-flavored e-cigarette users.
Aim 2: Examine the effect of flavor and nicotine on ECIG odor cue-reactivity after conditioning. Two- 
sample t-test will be conducted in FSL for the strawberry vanilla>rose and tobacco>rose odor difference 
score z- statistic images comparing the [ADDRESS_1077976] will be conducted to compare the tobacco>rose and strawberry vanilla>rose odor difference score 
z-statistic image separately for each 18 mg/ml ECIG flavor group. These t-tests will identify anatomical 
regions with significant effects of nicotine level and assigned vs. unassigned flavor over time. We expect 
that BOLD activity in regions implicated in smoking cue-reactivity will increase more over the 
conditioning phase for the 18 mg nicotine  group compared to the 0mg nicotine group and for odors 
from the assigned vs. unassigned flavor.
Aim 3: Determine if strawberry vanilla results in stronger cue-reactivity than tobacco flavor. A two-
sample t-test will be conducted for the assigned flavor (strawberry vanilla or tobacco) > control rose 
difference score z- statistic images comparing the flavor groups. These t-tests will identify anatomical 
regions with significant flavor group (tobacco vs. strawberry vanilla) by [CONTACT_5586] (baseline to post-
randomization) interaction effects on each odor image. For this analysis, only the 18 mg/ml nicotine 
content flavor groups will be included.
Exploratory Behavioral Aim: Determine if changes in flavor cue-reactivity are associated with changes 
in ECIG satisfaction, liking, craving, and dependence. One-sample t-tests will assess for anatomical 
regions where BOLD changes in odor cue-reactivity are correlated with changes in behavioral measures 
of e- cig satisfaction, craving, and dependence collected at the 2-week check-in and post-randomization 
visit, and changes in ECIG liking collected at the baseline and post-randomization visits.

history will be reviewed by [CONTACT_5984], and based on eligibility criteria, any questionable medical 
histories will be brought to the attention of the medical monitor for final inclusion determination prior 
to randomization. In a similar manner, contraindications for the treatment products and vital signs will 
be checked by [CONTACT_783837]. The medical monitor will be available via phone for any 
consultations as necessary.
Participants will be under medical supervision while in the study (i.e., by [CONTACT_7195]) and seen 
on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_783838]. The medical monitor will 
assess all adverse events and will be available for consultation over the phone for urgent matters. 
Otherwise, the PIs and/or the medical monitor will meet weekly with the study staff to review patient’s 
progress and their experiences with the study products, including any adverse events. 
9.2 Data that are reviewed

9.[ADDRESS_1077978] safety. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the medical monitor will meet weekly with the study staff to review participants’ progress and 
their experiences with the study products, including any adverse events. For more urgent and/or serious 
adverse events, the medical monitor will be available for consultation by [CONTACT_648]. The medical monitor 
will then make any needed medical recommendations and a determination regarding whether the 
participant is able to continue with the study. Study pulmonologist will review and provide expertise 
related to CCQ data and all pulmonary AEs.  
9.6 Frequency of review of cumulative data
All of the data from the study (including adverse events) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_777220], 
including the PI [INVESTIGATOR_523248], on a regular basis to review patients’ progress and their 
experiences in the study.
9.[ADDRESS_1077979] (or nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test) will be used to examine the changes in 
the outcome measures (CPD, CO, subjective measures) from the baseline. 
9.8 Suspension of research
Due to the low risk of the intervention, it is unlikely that there will be a need to suspend the research.  
However, should the medical monitor identify any issues after reviewing the data, they can develop 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_288872], and the recommendations will be followed.
10.0 Risks
10.1 ECIG use: 
oThere may be some unknown risks related to the use of ECIGs though these risks are not 
considered to be greater than risks associated with conventional cigarette use. 
oThe most common side effects associated with using an ECIG are changes in taste, dehydration, 
mucus in throat/sinus, dry mouth, dry cough, throat irritation, mouth irritation, sore throat, 
mouth ulcers, dizziness, headache, and nausea.
oThere are reports that some people who use e-cigarettes have experienced seizures, with most 
involving youth or young adult users.  Participants with a history of seizures or take medications 
to prevent seizures will be excluded from the study.
oThere have been some reports of serious lung illnesses among those who used e-cigarettes, and 
even some cases of death as a result (not all causes of death have been identified).  The 
investigations being conducted by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC) and the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have found that the majority of people experiencing these 
STUDY00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 21 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) illnesses were using e-cigarette products that contained tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or 
products that were bought off the street or from other illicit channels and so it is important that 
participants avoid such products.  The e-cigarette products used in this study do not contain THC 
and were bought from manufacturers where quality testing and control is performed.  
Nonetheless, participants will be advised to call their doctor immediately if they experience 
cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or fever after using their e-
cigarette.  Participants will be told to only use the e-cigarette and liquid pods (cartridges) given to 
them by [CONTACT_783839] e-cigarette or use other liquids with the e-
cigarette device.
oIf stored improperly (in pocket or where the ECIG device can turn on accidently), overheating of 
the device may occur, which presents a minor burn risk. 
oElectronic cigarette liquid contains vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol and flavorings. 
Participants with known allergies to these substances will be excluded in the study. The most 
common reported allergic reaction to these substances is contact [CONTACT_8748].
10.2 Nicotine addiction: Participants may be given a study product that contains nicotine, which is an 
addictive substance. The amount of nicotine they receive from this product depends on what product 
they are given and how they use it. 
10.3 Nicotine withdrawal symptoms:  Smoking fewer conventional cigarettes may result in nicotine 
withdrawal symptoms (e.g. irritability, anxiety, restlessness, depressed mood, increased appetite, 
fatigue, difficulty concentrating).  These symptoms will be monitored bi-weekly.
10.4 New development of pregnant or want to become pregnant:  Nicotine, either from cigarettes or 
from the study product (ECIG), is known to be harmful to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_18081]. If you are 
pregnant or become pregnant, cigarettes and the study product (ECIG) may cause problems to your 
unborn baby. Women who are pregnant or are nursing a child may not participate in this research study.  
Females capable of becoming pregnant will be administered a pregnancy test prior to beginning the 
research.  Participants must agree to take reasonable and necessary precautions against becoming 
pregnant during the period of the investigation.  The investigator will discuss appropriate precautions 
with participants.
10.5 MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) Risks: MRI does not involve radiation and there are no 
known long-term risks of MRI. Participants will be assessed for MRI safety at the screening visit and 
again at the scan visit before entering the scanner. We will be assessing for potential MRI hazards 
like metal fragments in the body or metal implanted devices that could shift during scanning. 
Participants will be instructed to remove all metal from their body and clothing before entering the 
scanning room. The major discomforts of fMRI scanning include lying still in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] a 
sustained period of time and hearing loud tappi[INVESTIGATOR_783813].  Participants may 
be uncomfortable inside the MRI scanner, especially if they do not like to be in closed spaces 
(“claustrophobia”). In between scanning sequences, participants will be able to talk with the MRI 
staff through a speaker system. At any time, the participant can choose to stop the scan by 
[CONTACT_687731] a “panic” button.
10.6 Loss of confidentiality:  There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if information is obtained by 
[CONTACT_127774].  Precautions will be taken to prevent this including direct 
coding of data in REDCap.
10.7 Randomization in clinical trials:  Participants will be assigned to a research intervention by 
[CONTACT_3364].  The research intervention they receive may prove to have more side effects than the other 
research intervention(s).
10.8 Incidental Finding:  None of the tests carried out in this study are intended to provide diagnoses 
for clinical purposes, but participants will be alerted to findings that should be discussed with a 
healthcare provider (such as high blood pressure or MRI findings). The MRI scans done during this 
study are NOT designed to detect or evaluate any medical condition. They are intended solely for 
research purposes. The investigators for this project are not trained to perform medical diagnosis, 
STUDY00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 22 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) and the scans to be performed in the study are not optimized to find abnormalities. On occasion, a 
member of the research team may notice a finding on a scan that seems abnormal. When a finding 
is noticed, one of the investigators may consult a physician specialist, such as a radiologist or 
neurologist, as to whether the finding merits further investigation. If the specialist recommends 
further follow-up, the investigator or another member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_100925] 48 hours (via a phone call) of the recommendation and suggest that the 
participant contact [CONTACT_783840]-up. To facilitate follow-up care, the 
participant will be given a copy of the images via a letter if the subject would like one. Being told 
about a finding may cause the participant anxiety as well as suggest the need for additional tests 
and financial costs. Medical insurance may be affected whether or not the finding is ultimately 
proved to be of clinical significance. Costs for clinical follow-up will not be covered in the cost of 
research. Participants will be told that their decision as to whether to proceed with further 
examination or treatment is their own.
10.9 Questionnaires:  It is possible that some of the questions in the questionnaires may make 
participants uncomfortable.  They will be instructed that they are free to skip any questions that 
make them uncomfortable.
[ADDRESS_1077980] Payment and/or Travel Reimbursements
Participants will be compensated $40 for completing visit questionnaires and procedures, and $20 for 
completing the MRI scan. In addition, participants will receive a bonus of $20 for returning all e-cig supplies at 
Visit 4. The total possible compensation for completing all study procedures and returning study supplies is 
$220. Participants will be compensated via gift cards. 
[ADDRESS_1077981]. Participants and/or insurance companies 
will not be responsible for costs related to study procedures and tests.
14.6 Compensation for research-related injury
It is the policy of the institution to provide neither financial compensation nor free medical treatment 
for research-related injury. In the event of injury resulting from this research, medical treatment is 
STUDY00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 23 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) available but will be provided at the usual charge. Costs for the treatment of research-related injuries 
will be charged to subjects or their insurance carriers.  
15 Resources Available 
15.5 Facilities and locations
The CNMRR building will be utilized for all in person participant visits. Penn State Health Zoom will be 
used for all remote visits.
15.6 Feasibility of recruiting the required number of subjects

Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 25 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) For drug studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:
Adverse event Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related
Adverse reaction Any adverse event caused by a drug
Suspected adverse 
reactionAny adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than “adverse reaction”.
Reasonable possibility.  For the purpose of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.
Serious adverse 
event or Serious 
suspected adverse 
reactionSerious adverse event or Serious suspected adverse reaction: An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption 
of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
Life-threatening 
adverse event or 
life-threatening 
suspected adverse 
reactionAn adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator (i.e., the study site 
principal investigator) or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or research 
subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.
Unexpected 
adverse event or 
Unexpected 
suspected adverse 
reaction.  An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if 
it is not listed in the investigator brochure, general investigational plan, clinical 
protocol, or elsewhere in the current IND application; or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been previously observed and/or specified.
For device studies, incorporate the following definitions into the below responses, as written:
Unanticipated 
adverse device 
effectAny serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem 
or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or IDE application (including a supplementary plan 
or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.
18.6 Recording of Adverse Events
Research subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse events at study visits.
All adverse events (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings observed or reported to study 
team believed to be associated with the study drug(s) or device(s) will be followed until the event (or its 
sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.
An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse event if one or more of the following criteria are 
met:
The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_783841]00011837
Approval: 11/20/2024
Page 26 of 29 (V.01/21/2019) The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or medical/surgical intervention; 
including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy
NOTE: Simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does not 
constitute an adverse event.
The test finding leads to a change in study drug dosing or discontinuation of subject participation in 
the clinical research study
The test finding is considered an adverse event by [CONTACT_093]. 
18.[ADDRESS_1077984] findings to 
determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if there is a 
reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257](s) or device(s); and 3) if the 
adverse event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event.
If the investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
study drug(s) or device(s)”, the adverse event will be classified as associated with the use of the study 
drug(s) or device(s) for reporting purposes.  If the investigator’s final determination of causality is 
“unknown but not related to the study drug(s) or device(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the 
determination will be documented in the respective subject’s case history.

(1) unexpected; and (2) probably related to the research procedures. Harms (adverse events) will be 
submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB policies and procedures.
18.10 Unblinding Procedures
If an adverse event requires that the participant be unblinded, the unblinded study personnel will be 
able to provide that information as needed. This will be reported appropriately along with the adverse 
event in accordance with the safety monitoring plan. Otherwise, participants will not be unblinded to 
their assigned study condition.

[IP_ADDRESS] Quality Assurance and Quality Control
Responsibility for data quality and study conduct lies with the Principal Investigator. [CONTACT_783846] 
will oversee that the study is executed in compliance with the protocol, IRB policies and Good 
Clinical Practice.  
Data will be collected from participants and coded directly by [CONTACT_783842] (participant entered data) or through REDCap data entry forms (researcher entered data).  
The codes that link the name [CONTACT_783844]. Any paper forms (i.e., consent) will be securely transported to the PI’s data entry 
center.  Any additional data that is generated will be stored electronically on the PHS server in 
password protected files.
Study data will be managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is a 
secure web application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing user-
friendly web-based case report forms, real-time data entry validation (e.g., for data types and 
range checks), audit trails, and a de-identified data export mechanism to common statistical 
packages (e.g., SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S-Plus). The system was developed by a multi-institutional 
consortium which includes The Pennsylvania State University and was initiated at Vanderbilt 
University. The database is hosted at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center and College of 
Medicine data center, which will be used as a central location for data processing and 
management. REDCap data collection projects rely on a thorough study-specific data dictionary 
defined in an iterative self-documenting process by [CONTACT_59881]. This 
iterative development and testing process results in a well-planned data collection strategy for 
individual studies. 
REDCap is HIPAA compliant. Data are stored on a secure server; data in REDCap are encrypted; 
access to the database requires authentication (a unique username [CONTACT_2383]); data are 
accessed based on the individual’s role on the project; every interaction with the data is logged, 
creating an audit trail.
Random data entry checks will be implemented regularly to identify problems with data entry.  
Data quality tools included in REDCap will be utilized to identify incorrect data types, out of 
range data and outliers.  In addition, electronic edit checks, and random internal quality and 
assurance checking will be performed manually. Data quality will be monitored by [CONTACT_783843]. If necessary, re-training of researchers will be 
conducted.
The responsibility for data quality and study conduct lies with the PI.

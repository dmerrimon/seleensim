Hysterectomy is the most common surgical procedure in the [LOCATION_002], with over 600,[ADDRESS_808239], there are still some postoperative 
comp laints that are relatively common, and can impair quality of life.  One of them is postoperative 
vaginal bleeding.  Although this can be a sign of a more serious problem such as vaginal  cuff dehiscence, 
the grand majority of times it is related to granulat ion tissue  in the vaginal cuff  that although may be 
self-limiting, can be bothersome and concerning to patients . Not only does this bleeding impair quality 
of life, but it’s one of the most common reasons for emergency room visits after surgery.   Multiple 
studies have shown that postoperative vaginal bleeding and return to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_609630]. 4,5      
Anecdotally, bleeding originates from granulati on tissue at the angles  of the closure, although 
there hasn’t been any studies specifically investigating  this.  A common approach to laparoscopic cuff 
closure involves a running barbed suture, with or without separate closure of the  lateral  angles .6,[ADDRESS_808240] also evaluated vaginal cuff bleeding as a secondary 
outcome, but this was recorded as  he presenc e of bleeding at 3 months after surgery.  The closure 
technique in this study was a running non -barbed suture, without independent suturing  of the angles. 
Although a running suture placed laparoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_609631], the tension at the corners  may be less than at the center  when using 
barbed suture , hence potentially increasing the risk of bleeding.  Furthermore, the second angle may be 
more difficult to access when the remainder of the cuff i s re-approximated.   
We propose prospectively evaluating if adding separate sutures to the angles  of the vaginal cuff 
before running barbed suture reduces the incidence of patient’s perception of bleeding after surgery.   
Primary Objectives:  
Determine if cl osing angles  of vaginal cuff separately during laparoscopic hysterectomy decreases 
incidence of vaginal bleeding after surgery.  
Secondary objectives:

 Determine if there is a difference  in patient satisfaction after surgery by [CONTACT_609635] -36 
questionnaire  
Determine if this technique changes the rate of vaginal cuff complications (cellulitis, dehiscence, vaginal 
cuff hematoma, and abscess)  
Evaluate the difference in operative time between techniques for this portion of the procedure.  
 
Hypothesi s 
Performing a separate closure of the vaginal cuff angles  after hysterectomy will decrease incidence of 
postoperative bleeding  
 
Inclusion Criteria -  
 Pre-menopausal patients scheduled to undergo hysterectomy via laparoscopic /robotic  approach 
for benign indications (Ages [ADDRESS_808241] year).   
 
Exclusion Criteria - 
 Patient’s that incur in an intraoperative bowel or urologic injury during the hysterectomy that 
requires repair.  If injury oc curs after randomization (during vaginal cuff closure), this will be 
recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_1758]’s safety officer  
 Patients scheduled to undergo a concomitant vaginal procedure (Mid -urethral sling, 
anterior/posterior repair)  
 Patients scheduled to undergo pelvic floor repair (utero -sacral ligament suspension)  
 Patients with known preoperative malignancy  
 Patients in which a total hysterectomy is not completed  
 
Sample Size  
Sample size was calculated for primary outcome. Based on our experience when angles are not 
secured separately, incidence of at least mild spotting ranges around 20%.  We expect the intervention 
to decrease this to an incidence of 5%,  In order to detect the expected change with a significance level 
of 5% and a power of 80%, a sample of 154 patients is required (77 per group) using Kelsey’s formula.  
Methods  
Participants will be enrolled based on eligibility criteria.  They will be consented to participate in 
the office during their preoperative visit.  Baseline demographic data collect ed will include Age, BMI, 
Diabetes status, HgbA1c within the last 3 months if available, and daily steroid use.  Subjects will be 
allocated on a 1:1 ratio via block randomization in blocks of 4.  Assignment will be performed after 
completion of hysterectom y, before cuff closure, via a pre -generated sequential masked randomized

corresponds to “Control group”, the surgeon will re -approximate the cuff in  a standard fashion, using a 
running -barbed suture (2 -0 V-LOC 90 with tapered nee dle), starting at the right apex, moving towards 
the left, and then back -tracking once to further reinforce the closure.  If the allocation corresponds to 
“Api[INVESTIGATOR_609632]”, surgeon will use [ADDRESS_808243] figure of 8  
sutures on both (left and right) apexes.  Knot tying technique (intra -corporeal vs extracorporeal) will be 
up to surgeon preference.   After this is completed, barbed suture will be used to re -approximate the 
remainder of the vaginal cuff from right to lef t, backtracking once at the end for reinforcement.  Time 
when vaginal cuff closure starts and ends will be noted.  Surgeon will also examine vaginal introitus at 
the end of the case, noting any lacerations.  
After the surgery, a survey will be filled out by  [CONTACT_96193] (See A NNEX 1).   
Immediate postoperative care and discharge criteria will be performed per unit guidelines.  All 
patients are instructed to abstain from heavy lifting (more than 30 lbs) and vaginal penetrative sex for 6 
weeks.  
When pa tients arrive for their postoperative visit (10 -20 days after surgery), a member of the 
research team who is blinded to allocation will give out a short survey before the patient meets the 
physician (SEE ANNEX 2). Remainder of visit will occur in a routine  fashion.  
Between 90 -114 days after surgery, patients will be called by a member of the research team 
and given a survey regarding bleeding and quality of life (See ANNEX 3 and SF -36 survey9-11).   
A retrospective chart review will also be performed 3 months after enrollment to evaluate for 
any postoperative visits to the emergency depart ment / re -admissions / re -operations / infections.   
 
Data Handling  
A master key will be generated during randomization.  It will contain patient initials and medical 
record number, and a unique code.  Only the primary investigator will have access to this  master key  
which will be kept in an encrypted secure computer at [LOCATION_007] Tech.     
A separate de -identified  secure  database  (Redcap)  using the unique  code as index will be used 
for collection of data points.  The baseline demographic data  will transferred directly into the de -
identified database after randomization. All collection forms /surveys will be destroyed after data is 
transferred into electronic database .  Using the master key, we will perform a retrospective chart review 
to complete fi nal data points (pathology results, return to ER, re -admissions, re -operations).   
 
 
Data Analysis  
 
Version: 0 9/15 /2021  
Page 4 of 9 
 All data analysis will be carried out in SPSS version 24 (IBM, Armonk, NY, [LOCATION_003]).  Continuous 
baseline demographic variables: (age, BMI, operating time and ut erine weight) will be compared using t -
student, and Chi square for categorical variables (steroid use, diabetes).  Postoperative bleeding will first 
be evaluated as a binary categorical value, and compared using Chi Square. Inter -quartile ranges/t -
student and logistic regression will be utilized to compare SF-[ADDRESS_808244] the data collection phase to 
span approximately 72 weeks (Taking into account the [ADDRESS_808245] patient enrolled).   Data analysis will span an additional 12 weeks.  
 
Strength/Innovation  
Postoperative vaginal bleeding is one of the most common complaints after hysterectomy, and 
its nega tive impact on patient satisfaction has been demonstrated.  Furthermore, if these symptoms 
prompt phone -calls to the office, nurse -visits, or a trip to the emergency department, valuable health -
care resources are utilized.  Although the technique of closin g apexes separately is considered a 
standard variation, its impact on outcomes has never been evaluated in a controlled prospective 
fashion , where standardized surveys are given to patients to determine impact .  The results from this 
trial will help surgeo ns determine the best technique for re -approximating the vaginal cuff after 
hysterectomy.  
 
Limitations  
The main confounding factors when comparing surgical techniques are difference in operating 
style between surgeons and baseline surgical characteristics (large uteri that may require more 
dissection and tissue manipulation, etc.).  To control for this we are only recruiting patients from [ADDRESS_808246]-hoc analysis will 
also be made specifically stratifying the data based on these characteristics.

 Risks  / Safety  
There are no known risks associated to either method of vaginal cuff clos ure.  Both are common 
variations that have been utilized throughout the country for several years.  We are attempting to 
determine if one of the two methods has a higher risk of postoperative bleeding. To date, this has not 
been answered.  We will have an assigned safety monitor that will perform an interim analysis of the 
cohort after every 20 subjects are enrolled .  If the experimental arm demonstrates an increase of 
greater than 10% in visits to the emergency -room related to post -operative complaints, or  an increase in 
unexpected complications (wound infection, wound dehiscence, etc.), the study will be halted.   
There is also the potential risk of accidental disclosure of the health informati on that will be 
collected.  To mitigate this, all stored data w ill be de -identified in a secure server using TTUHSC 
approved software (Red -Cap) that  can only be accessed by [CONTACT_8362].  
 
Benefits  
This study will answer the question on whether including api[INVESTIGATOR_609633] a reduced 
incidence of  postoperative bleeding.  
 
Costs  
Both methods of vaginal -cuff closure are routinely performed, albeit in an uncontrolled fashion, 
hence the cost of hysterectomies will not differ when compared to patients not undergoing a research 
protocol. In general, we e xpect that closing the apexes will add approximately 5 minutes of operating 
time. This will be measured during the study.  The polyglactin suture is already routinely opened during 
hysterectomy cases.  Research staff salaries are supported by [CONTACT_609636].

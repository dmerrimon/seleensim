Page 2Document History
Document Version Date Summary of Changes and Rationale
Amendment 2 09 November 2018 1. Removed multiple clinical and laboratory 
assessments beyond Week 16 (Schedule of Activities).
Rationale: To remove unnecessary 
assessments beyond Week 16, based on emerging safety, PD and PK data, and which will not provide information crucial for defining the overall safety signal for PF-06835375.
2. Decreased frequency of visits and visit 
assessments for subjects who remain in the study beyond 52 weeks (Schedule of Activities).
Rationale: To remove unnecessary study 
assessments (including samples) which will not be informative due to a lack of disease activity requirements for entry and emerging data Reduction of study visits beyond Week 52 will maintain an appropriate level of follow up for safety at given the emerging safety profile of PF-06835375 and theestablished safety signal from B-cell depleting agents.
3. Added complement lab for SLE subjects at 
Screening (Schedule of Activities).
Rationale: To align with SLICC and 
 lab requirements.
4. Removed follow up due to immunogenicity
related AE (Schedule of Activities, Sections 3.1, 3.5, 6.2).
Rationale: To align with frequency of 
immunogenicity testing while retaining the option for additional visits if needed for safety.
5. Added a requirement of sentinel dosing in

Page 3PartB in specific circumstances .
Rationale: To align Part A and B for safety 
monitoring at a given dose. 
6.Allowed independent dose escalation in 
Part A and Part B, provided SC is used in 
Part B (Section 3.3).
Rationale: To dose escalate SC cohorts 
based on safety, tolerability, PK and PD 
(Bcell counts) from previous SC cohorts due 
to potential dif ferences in bioavailability 
between IV and SC administration . 
7.Changed dose escalation criterion to require 
detectable B cells for a minimum of 
2consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart, 
starting at Week 12(Section 3.4).
Rationale: To align dose escalation criterion 
with the end -of-study discharge criteria . 
This rationale is based on emerging saf ety, 
PK and PD profile of PF -06835375 and 
clinical experience with approved B cell 
depleting agents, including that for rituximab 
(redosing occurs with undetectable B -cell 
counts) .
8.Clarified lymphopenia criterion in individual 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_892182] t o pre -dose 
abnormalities (Section 3.4.3) .
Rationale: To appropriately consider 
pre-dose lymphopenia (common in SLE), 
subjects with Grade 1 or 2 pre -dose 
lymphophenia (CTCAE v4.0) and [ADDRESS_1249617] 
this met individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_107160].
9.Removed requirement for “stable or 
increasing” B-cell counts for end of 
study /subject discharge for subjects who 
have Bcell counts above lower limit of 
normal ( LLN; 80cells/ l) at Week 16 visit 
(Section 3.5).
PF-06835375 
C1131001
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 09 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 4Rationale: Remove unnecessary and 
additional study visits after B-cell LLN has been reached.  The natural fluctuations of B-cell counts obviate the need for additional visits once the LLN threshold has been met.
10. Revised timing for end of study/subject 
discharge after Week 16 by [CONTACT_37228] B cells to reach new stable or increasing detectable level for minimum of two consecutive visits starting at Week 20 (Section 3.5).
Rationale: To harmonize end-of-study 
discharge criteria with follow up commitment based on revised dose-escalation criteria.
11. Removed text applicable only for studies 
using a Medical Device (Sections 8.2.3).
Rationale: To remove text not applicable for 
this study since medical device is not used.
12. Administrative clarifications (Sections 3.1, 
3.4.1, 4.4.1, 7.1.1).
Rationale: To provide minor clarifications.
Amendment 1 16 February 2018 1. Changed screening window from 30 days to 
45 days (Schedule of Activities).
Rationale: To increase screening window 
given sizable number and complex nature of screening labs and required turnaround time.
 
 
3. Changed scheduled limited physical exam to 
[ADDRESS_1249618]-dose, provided no new ongoing AEs or safety concerns (Schedule of Activities).CCI
PF-06835375

Page 5Rationale: To improve study feasibility at 
sites.
4. Clarified window for assessments post-dose 
(Schedule of Activities).
Rationale: To incorporate protocol 
administrative letter.
5. Clarified criteria used to determine SLE and 
RA diagnosis and sample collection in case of combined diagnoses (Schedule of Activities, Sections 7.6.2 and 7.6.3).
Rationale: To clarify criteria used for RA 
and SLE diagnosis used for assessments in Schedule of Activities and blood sample collection regimen.
6. Changed JC virus sample collection to one 
sample (Schedule of Activities, Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.14).
Rationale: To update based on availability of 
JC virus test.
7. Removed bioavailability from PD endpoints 
(Sections 2 and 9.3.2).
Rationale: To remove an endpoint which may 
not be calculated accurately given the uncertainty in doses and high number of cohorts.
8. Modified PK endpoints (Section 2) to align 
with Tables 5 and 6 (Section 9.3.2);  
 
Rationale: To harmonize protocol sections 
and to include only key PK endpoints as secondary.
9. Clarified time point for secondary endpoint 
of depletion of B and cTfh cells (Section 2).CCI

Page 6Ratio nale: To clarify specific time for 
evaluating B and cTfh cell depletion.
10.Removed a requirement for two RA or SL E 
subjects per each cohort in Part B 
(Sections 3.1and 4.3).
Rationale: To allow for faster enrollment, 
given that this is primarily safety and 
tolerability study.
11.Clarified that sponsor may  elect to add more 
subjects into cohorts for any  reason, 
including but not limited to a greater than 
expected PD effect (Section 3.1).
Rationale: To clarify sponsor may elect a 
higher number of subjects per coho rt for any 
reason but thetotal number of subjects 
enrolled in study will be up to a total of 
approximately [ADDRESS_1249619] four 
subjects (Section 3.2).
Rationale: To clarify sent inel dosing.
13.Clarified that sentinel dosing is required only  
when a given dose level is administered for 
the first time in Part A and not required in 
PartB(Section s3.1 and 3.2).
Rationale: To clarify sentinel dosing 
requirement s.
14.Clarified a minimum num ber of subjects per 
cohort , required to proceed with dose 
escalation (Section 3.4.1).
Rationale: To have sufficient data to 
determine whether dose escalation is 
appropriate.
15.Clarified dose escalation stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_892183] (Section 3.4.2 ).
PF-06835375 
C1131001
Final Protocol Amendment 2, 09 November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 7Rationale: To clarify that if any dose cohort 
is repeated, this additional cohort will be considered a separate cohort for the purpose of dose escalation stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. 
16. Clarified criteria for end of study 
(Section 3.5).
Rationale: To clarify that only one criterion 
is needed to be met for end of study.
17. Clarified restrictions on investigational 
biologics, which are biosimilars (Exclusion criterion #2, Section 4.2).
Rationale: To allow an appropriate time 
frame since dosing with biosimilars.
 
 
Rationale: To harmonize entry criteria 
during the entire study. 
19. Clarified exclusion criterion 7 (Section 4.2).
Rationale: To incorporate protocol 
administrative letter.
20. Clarified TB exclusion criteria 
(Criterion #12, Section 4.2).
Rationale: To clarify that subjects with 
current or past history of active TB or inadequately treated latent TB (or where documentation of treatment is not available) are not eligible. 
21. Clarified when re-screening and repeating 
screening assessments is permitted (Section 6.1 and Schedule of Activities).
Rationale: To clarify procedures for 
repeating screening assessments and CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_1249620] 
(Section 6.1and Schedule of Activities).
Rationale: To ensure implementation of 
sentinel dosing and to ensure screen ing of an 
appropriate number of subjects in each 
cohort.
23.Allowed extension of screening window by  
5days contingent on sponsor approval for 
scheduling or logistics reasons (Section 6.1). 
Rationale: To avoid unnecessary 
re-screening procedures. 
24.Increased blood volume in Part A and 
clarified blood volume s are approximate 
(Section 7.7).
Rationale: To update blood volume due to 
added Day 57 blood samples to clarify that 
blood volumes are approximate given 
additional blood samples may be taken 
eg,for safety assessments or to repeat 
screening procedures (if appropriate ).
25.Changed assessments during earl y 
termination visit to harmonize with the rest 
of the protocol (Section 6.3).

Page 30PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Background and Rationale
PF-06835375 is a humanized, afucos yl immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody  against C -X-C 
chemokine receptor t ype5 (CXCR5), a surface receptor that is expressed on B cells, bona
fidefollicular T helper (Tfh ) cells, and circulating follicular T helper -like (cTfh) cells.a
PF-06835375 is currently in development for the treatment of s ystemic lupus ery thematosus 
(SLE).  However, there is potential utility  for targeting CXCR5 for the treatment of sy stemic 
autoimm une diseases more broadl y.  Therefore, other diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), remain under consideration given their shared underly ing pathophy siology  of aberrant 
humoral immune responses involving B cells and Tfh cells.
CXCR5 is expressed by B cells, bona fide Tfh cells, and cTfh cells and, mediates their 
trafficking to and participation in germinal center ( GC) immune responses.1GCs, a critical 
component of the humoral immune response, are sites where antigen -activated B cells 
undergo somatic h ypermutation and immunoglobulin ( Ig) class switching of the antibodies 
they produce .  Bona fide Tfh cells provide instructive signals to aid this process, which 
culminates in the production of affinity -matured antibodies. Humoral “memory ” of the GC 
immune response is maintained by  [CONTACT_7419] -lived plasma cells, which sustain antibod y levels, 
and by  [CONTACT_85801]  B cells, which , upon re -challenge with antigen, trigger secondary  GC 
immune responses with cognate help from memory  Tfh cells that lead to the production of 
more high -affinity  plasma cells .[ADDRESS_1249658] mechanisms of action: (1) depletion of CXCR5 -positive cells through 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity  (ADCC), and (2) antagonism of C-X- C Motif 
Chemokine L igand 13 ( CXCL 13)-dependent signaling.  By [CONTACT_892208], cells that escape killing may  still be inhibited from trafficking to and 
participating in GC immune responses . As such, theworking hypothesis is that by  [CONTACT_892209]5 through a combination of depletion and antagonism, PF- [ADDRESS_1249659] in human (FIH) stud y is to evaluate the safet y, tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacod ynamics (PD) of PF -06835375.  In particular, PD 
characterization will include assessment of magnitude and duration of CXCR5 -positive cell 
                                                
aBona fide Tfh cells are located w ithin lymphoid organs (ie, spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s 
patches, and mucosa -associated lymphoid tissue ).  cTfh cells are located in the peripheral blood.

PF-06835375-mediated depletion of CXCR5-positive cells offers the potential for clinical evaluation in a population of seropositive autoimmune subjects.  Consequently, a mixed population of seropositive SLE or RA subjects will be enrolled into this study.
Objectives and Endpoints
Primary Objective: Primary Endpoints: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and 
multiple ascending intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous 
(SC) doses of PF-06835375 in subjects with SLE and

treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) and withdrawals 
due to TEAE.
• Incidence of abnormal chemistry, hematology, and 
urinalysis laboratory findings through the end of 
study.
• Abnormal and clinically relevant changes in vital 
signs and electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters.
• Incidence of infections.
Secondary Objectives: Secondary Endpoints: 
• To evaluate the effect of PF-06835375 on depletion of 
circulating CXCR5 positive B cells and cTfh cells 
over time in subjects with SLE and RA.• Change from baseline in the number of circulating 
CXCR5 positive B cells and cTfh cells on Day 29 
single dose of PF-06835375 and at Week 8 following 
multiple doses of PF-06835375.
• To characterize pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of 
PF-06835375 in subjects with SLE and RA.• Serum PF-06835375 PK parameters after single and 
multiple doses:
• Single Ascending Dose Phase: C max, Tmax, 
AUC inf, AUC last.
• Multiple Ascending Dose Phase:
• First Dose: C max, Tmax, AUC tau.
• Multiple Dose: C max, Tmax, AUC last, 
AUC tau, Cminand observed accumulation 
ratio (R ac), peak-to-trough ratio (PTR).
• To evaluate immunogenicity of PF-06835375 in 
subjects with SLE and RA.• Incidence of development of anti-drug antibodies

Study Design
This is a Phase 1, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, sponsor open, placebo-controlled, 
single and multiple dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PF-06835375 in subjects with seropositive SLEor RA.  Both intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes of administration will be tested. 
This study will include two parts: Part A, consisting of approximately eight single ascending 
dose (SAD) cohorts, and Part B, consisting of approximately 6 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts.  Cohorts in Part A will be initiated sequentially.  Subjects in Part B will receive two doses of investigational product, first dose on Day 1 and second dose on Day 29, and will be enrolled concurrently with Part A following the completion of the initial cohorts in Part A (See Section 3.3 ).  Subjects who are randomized in Part A will not be eligible to 
participate in Part B of this study.
This study will enroll up to a total of approximately 112 subjects at approximately 10 sites.  
Individual subjects are expected to stay in the study approximately 6-12 months (including screening), contingent on meeting criteria described for the end of study (See Section 3.5 ).  
Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.  A replacement subject will receive the same treatment as the withdrawn subject.
Both SLE and RA subjects will be enrolled into this study.  Minimum disease activity 
(ie, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000, , or Disease Activity Score 28, DAS28) cutoffs is not required for entry as inclusion criteria. All subjects CCI

Page 33in both Part A and B will be followed for a minimum of 16 weeks prior to being able to 
qualify for study completion based on the cellular recovery (See Section 3.5 ).
It is at the sponsor’s discretion to dose escalate (See Section 3.4.1 ), to repeat the same dose, 
or to test a lower dose based on emerging data. 
Throughout the study, B cell counts obtained from CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments) certified central lab will be used for clinical decision making (inclusion/exclusion criteria, dose escalation, initiation of Part B and for the end of study criteria).

and by  [CONTACT_892211],which , upon re -challenge with antigen, trigger secondary  GC 
immune responses with cognate help from memory  Tfh cells that lead to the production of 
more high -affinity  plasma cells.2  cTfh cells are thought to differentiate into bona fide Tfh 
cells upon re -encountering antigen to support these memory  responses ,as well .3
Importantly , the generation of autoreactive B cells respon ding to self -antigen can arise from 
GCreactions , with undesired consequences.  Indeed, numerous chronic, s ystemic 
autoimmune diseases, such as SLE, RA, my ositis, Sjögren’s s yndrome, anti-neutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody  (ANCA )-associated vasculitis and scl eroderma, show evidence of 
autoreactive humoral responses.  In addition, increased frequencies of cTfh cells have been 
detected in the peripheral blood of patients with many  of these autoimmune diseases
compared to healthy  controls ,including both SL E and RA, the levels of which often correlate 
with autoantibody  titers and/or disease severity .4,5Taken together , these data highlight 
CXCR5 -positive cells ( ie,Bcells, Tfh cells, and cTfh cells) as potential therapeutic targets 
for multiple systemic autoimmune diseases.
                                                
aBona fide Tfh cells are located w ithin lymphoid organs (ie, spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s 
patches, and mucosa -associated lymphoid tissue ).  cTfh cells are located in the peripheral blood.

PF-[ADDRESS_1249662] mechanisms of action: (1) depletion of CXCR5 -positive cells through 
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity  (ADCC), and (2) antagonism of 
CXCL 13-dependent signaling.  By[CONTACT_892212], cells that 
escape killing may  still be inhibited from trafficking to and participating in GC immune 
responses .  As such, the working hypothesis is that by  [CONTACT_892213]5 through a 
combination of depletion and antagonism, PF -[ADDRESS_1249663] in human ( FIH)study  is to evaluate the safety, tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacod ynamics (PD) of PF -06835375.  In particular, PD
characterization will include assessment of magnitude and duration of CXCR5 -positive cell 
depletion andrecovery .  Inhibition of the humoral immune response svia
PF-06835375 -mediated depletion of CXCR5- positive cells offers the potential for clinical 
evalu ation in a population of seropositive autoimmune subjects .  Consequently , a mixed 
population of seropositive SLE or RA subjects will be enrolled into this study .
1.2.2. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
Systemic Lupus Ery thematosus (SL E) is a chronic sy stemic autoimmu nedisease thatcan 
affect virtually  any organ, including the skin, joints, kidney s, lungs and central or peripheral 
nervous s ystem.  Immunologic abnormalities, especiall y the loss of tolerance and production 
of anti -nuclear antibodies (ANA), are a promine nt feature of SLE.6The clinical course of 
SLE is variable and characterized by  [CONTACT_519420].  Women, especially  
in their childbearing years, are affected more frequently  than men.  SL E ismore prevalent in 
certain racial and ethnic groups ,such as African -American s,Asians, and Hispanics.   The 
prevalence of SL E ranges from approximately  40cases per 100,000 persons among Northern 
Europeans to more than 200 per 100,000 persons among African -American s.7
Available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_892184], rarely induce lasting remissions,
and are associated with significant side effects ( eg,cytopenias, increased infection and 
malignancy risk, hemorrhagic cy stitis, and bone marrow suppression). Furthermore, 
although a central role for B and/or Tcells in SL E pathogenesis has long been recognized, 
existing biologics targeting either B cells (eg, rituximab [Rituxan], belimumab [Benly sta]) 
or Tcells alone (eg, abatacept [Orencia]) have demonstrated modest or minimal clinical 
benefit . Belimumab is approved for the treatment of autoantibody -positive active SLE.[ADDRESS_1249664] on SL E disease flares.  There remains amajor unmet need for safer and /ormore 
effective t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_892185] a long -lasting remission in SL E.

Page 371.2.3. Rheumatoid Arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive, systemic autoimmune disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_892214], anemia, and bone loss. Rheumatoid arthritis has a prevalence of 0.5% to 1.0% and a peak incidence between 
[ADDRESS_1249665] RA patients show
seropositivity for RA-associated autoantibodies, such as anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies
(ACPA) or rheumatoid factor (RF), which may contribute to the chronic inflammation of the
synovium and subsequent joint damage that are hallmarks of RA disease pathology.11  In 
addition, approximately 30% of RA patients show formation of ectopic lymphoid organs in
inflamed synovia, which appears to correlate with enhanced autoantibody production and
disease severity.12
There are multiple approved therapeutic options for managing the pain and slowing the 
progression of RA, but none are curative.  Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the standard treatments for RA; conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), such as methotrexate, are used either alone or in combination with newer 
biologic DMARDs.  Use of biologic DMARDs, most commonly tumor necrosis factor- α
(TNFα) inhibitors, is indicated when symptoms are not adequately controlled with 
csDMARDs.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_892186], there remain significant numbers of patients who do not achieve remission or indeed adequate reduction in disease activity.

Page 381.2.5. Noncl inical P harmacokinetics
Single -dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and repeat- dose toxicokinetics (TK) were evaluated in 
cynomolgus monkey s following intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) dosing of 
PF-06835375.   The bioavailability  of PF -06835375 after subcutaneous administration was 
estimated to be greater than 50%.   After single IV dosing in cy nomolgus monkey s, the PK of 
PF-06835375 were characterized by a low clearance (CL), and a low volume of distribution 
(Vss), consistent with the PK profile for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_892187] n IgG1 monoclonal antibody  (mAb).  
There were no apparent sex -related differences in sy stemic exposure (as assessed by  [CONTACT_892216] [C max] and area under the concentration -time curve from 
zero to 168 hours [AUC 168])following dosing o nce every  2weeks at 5 (IV), 20 (SC) or 
200(IV) mg/kg.  Systemic exposure was higher after repeat dosing and increased in a 
dose-proportional manner .  The overall incidence of anti -drug antibod y (ADA) induction was 
14% (4 of 28 animals) across dose groups , and serum concentrations on Study  Day 43 were 
generall y lower in ADA -positive animals compared to ADA- negative animals.
1.2.6. Nonclinical Safety
Administration of PF -06835375 once every  two weeks by  [CONTACT_892217] 
2months in cy nomolgus monkey s resulted in dose -independent depletion (maximum 
pharmacology  reached at the lowest dose) of total B cellsand cTfh/Tfh cells in the peripheral 
blood and spleen, and was associated with decreases in total ly mphocy te and white blood cell 
counts and decr eased lymphoid follicular cellularity  in the spleen, l ymph nodes and 
gut-associated l ymphoid tissue for the dose range tested (5 -200 mg/kg/dose).  These changes 
were nonadverse , partially  to full y reversible, and consistent with the expected pharmacology  
of PF-06835375.  PF -06835375 did elicit cy tokine release in the in vitro soluble and solid 
phase cy tokine release assay  using human whole blood or p eripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs ), however, cy tokine release was not detected in the repeat -dose toxicity  studies in 
cynomolgus monkey s.  At a SC dose of 20 mg/kg/dose, there were no local injection site 
reactions.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity  studies have not been conducted, but 
there were no findings in male and female reproductive tissues e valuated in the repeat- dose 
toxicity  studies.  The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL )was 200 mg/kg/dose IV, the 
highest dose tested, which was associated with sy stemic exposure of 5220 g/mL (C max) and 
438,000 g•h/mL  (AUC 168). 
Additional informati on for PF-06835375 may be found in the single reference safet y 
document (SRSD), which for this study  is the current Investigator’s Brochure.
1.3.Dose Rationale
The doses being proposed for this study  are based on data from in vivo nonclinical 
pharmacology andtoxicolog ystudies.  A model -based approach was adopted to characterize 
the relationship between dose, PF-06835375 concentrations, and modulation of Bcell and 
cTfh cells in the serum of cy nomolgus monkey s.  Based on the PK profiles of PF -06835375 
in cynomolgus monkey s, theexposure in humans is expected to be similar to that of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_33390]1 antibod y.13Therefore ,a two-compartment PK model was used to simulate 
PF-06835375 serum concentrations following diffe rent doses in humans.

Page 39Published monkey  and human PK/PD data forSBI-087,aa B cell depleting therapeutic , was 
used to translate B cell depletion parameters for PF -06835375 from monkey  to human.14,15
Specificall y, SBI-087 B cell depletion parameters in monkey  and human were obtained by 
[CONTACT_892218]-087 PK/PD data using the same model that was developed 
for PF -06835375.14,15A comparison of the B cell depletion parameters forSBI-[ADDRESS_1249668] corresponding B cell depletion 
parameters in human.  Unlike B cells, no human data were available for cTfh cell depletion ;
therefore translation of cTfh cell depletion was assumed to be similar to that for B cells.  
Using baseline B and cTfh cell counts in SL E patients and predicted human celldepletion 
parameters, B cell and cTfh cell depletion kinetics following PF -06835375 administration in 
humans were simulated.15
Using a human equivale nt dose ( HED ) approach, the maximum recommended starting dose 
is 6.5 mg/kg (assuming a safet y factor of 10) .  The proposed starting dose for this study  is 
0.03 mg IV (~0.4 g/kg) , which is predicted to result in ~50% depletion of B cells relative to 
baseli ne.  Relative to 1/10thof exposures at monkey NOAEL, the proposed starting dose 
provides a safet y margin of 42, 800fold for C maxand 60 ,100fold for average observed 
concentration (Cav).  Based on HED approach the safet y margin for proposed starting dose 
for a 70 kg individual is 150,500 fold (HED = 64.5 mg/kg).  For the highest planned dose of 
100mg IV, the safety  margins are 13 fold for Cmaxand 18.1 fold for C avrelative to 1/10thof 
exposures at monkey  NOAEL . 
The predicted efficacious dose of PF-06835375 is 10 -30mgIVmultiple -dose regimen (dose 
on Day 1 and Day 29), and is based on the assumption that B cells in blood need to be 
depleted to 1cells/L for ~8weeks for clinical efficacy .  The PK/PD model may  under 
predict the efficacious dose as it relies on data from another B cell depleting agent 
(ie,SBI-087) and the efficacious dose criteri ononly focuses on B cell depletion; the effects 
of PF -06835375 on cTfh and bona fide Tfh cells may  lead to a lower efficacious dose range.   
PF-06835375 serum concentrations following the final (second) dose of 10-30 mg IV 
multi- dose regimen (dose on D ay1 and D ay29) were estimated as noted above and the 
predicted C maxwas 4.78-15.08 g/mL  and the predicted Cav(calculated as AUC tau/28) was 
1.36-4.06 g/mL.  Re lative to 1/10thof exposures at monkey NOAEL, the predicted 
efficacious dose provides a safet y margin of 34.6- 109 fold for Cmaxand 64.3 -192 fold for C av.
In the multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase, the second dose will be given [ADDRESS_1249669] dose.  This dosing interval was selected based on PK/PD modeling and with 
consideration for repeat dosing in future multiple dose studies.  Considering the dosing 
interval for the multiple dose phase of this study  (4weeks) will be different from the Good

Based on the available nonclinical data, the risks and potential benefits for PF-[ADDRESS_1249671] higher prevalence in females and hence the trial objectives cannot be 
met without inclusion of women of childbearing potential (WoCBP).  Nonclinical data to date ( Section 1.2.6 ) have not identified any risk to reproductive organs in sexually mature 
cynomolgus monkeys, the pharmacologically relevant species.  Given that an enhanced pre- and postnatal development study (ePPND) will be conducted later in development, this protocol that allows enrollment of WoCBP has stringent requirements to mitigate unintended exposures (pregnancy testing and use of contraceptives; see Section 4.4.1 ).

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting in death has occurred with B cell depleting agents (most notably rituximab given the extensive use in multiple diseases), and has also been observed in SLE and RA subjects receiving immunosuppressive agents. Investigators should consider PML in any patient with new onset of or changes in pre-existing neurological signs or symptoms (See Section 7.1.14 ).  The
role of the Tfh subset of T cells in human immunity has yet to be established, and may contribute to the effective control of acute and chronic pathogens.  Although no serious or opportunistic infections were observed in pre-clinical toxicity studies in non-human primates, subjects will be closely monitored throughout the study for signs/symptoms of infections.  While appropriate risk mitigation has been incorporated into the study, possible risks will be communicated to study participants in the informed consent document.

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Study Overview
This is a Phase 1, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, sponsor open, placebo-controlled, 
single and multiple dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of PF-06835375 in subjects with seropositive SLEor RA.  Both IV and SC routes of administration will be tested.
This study will include two parts: Part A, consisting of approximately eight single ascending 
dose (SAD) cohorts, and Part B, consisting of approximately 6 multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts. Fewer cohorts may be included in each part at Sponsor’s discretion. Cohorts in Part A will be initiated sequentially. Subjects in Part B will receive two doses of investigational product (first dose on Day 1 and second dose on Day 29), and will be enrolled concurrently with Part A following the completion of the initial cohorts in Part A (See Section 3.3 ).  Subjects who are randomized in Part A will not be eligible to participate in 
Part B of this study.C

Page 45This study will enroll up to a total of a pproximately 112 s ubjects at approximately 10 sites. 
The study includes a Screening visit to assess eligibility and subsequent visits for a minimum 
of 16 weeks.  Subjects who meet the end of study criteria (See Section 3.5 ) will have one 
follow-up phone call visit which will represent the end of study visit. Subjects, who do not meet the criteria to leave the study at Week 16, will continue with clinic visits every four weeks until Week 52 and then every 12 weeks until they meet these criteria.  Overall, 
subjects are expected to stay in the study approximately 6-12 months (including screening).  Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.  A replacement subject will receive the same treatment as the withdrawn subject.
Both SLE and RA subjects will be enrolled into this study. Minimum disease activity 
(ie, or DAS28 cutoffs) is not required for entry as inclusion criteria.  All subjects in both Part A and B will be followed for a minimum of 16 weeks prior to being able to qualify for study completion based on the cellular recovery (See Section 3.5 ).
It is at the sponsor’s discretion to dose escalate (See Section 3.4.1 ), to repeat the same dose,
or to test a lower dose based on emerging data. 
 
  
 
Throughout the study, B cell counts obtained from a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments) certified central lab will be used for clinical decision making (inclusion/exclusion criteria, dose escalation, initiation of Part B and for the end of study criteria). CCICCI

Page 473.2.Sentinel Dosing 
In view of the mechanism of action (B cell and cTfh cell depletion), the interval between 
sentinel subjects and the remainder of the cohort is proposed to mitigate any  unanticipated 
acute safet y risks (ie,infusion/injection site reactions) . Sentinel dosing will be employ ed as 
follows: 
In Part A, for Cohorts A1-A4 (with 4subjects planned ), subjects will be dosed IV at 
least [ADDRESS_1249675] on 
placebo in these cohorts may  be enrolled in an y sequence.  The sponsor medical 
monitor will communicate with investigator(s) from each site after dosing of each 
subject (and prior to dosing of the next subject) in order to determine whether it is 
safe to proceed with continued dosing within a cohort . 
If the sponsor decides to increase the number of subjects in these A1 -A4cohor ts, the 
sentinel dosing will apply  only to the first four subjects as described in the paragraph 
above. After the sponsor medical monitor determines it is safe to proceed, the 
remaining subjects can be enrolled and dosed simultaneously .
In Part A, for coh orts A5-A8 (with more than 4 subjects planned) , the first two 
subjects dosed IV will include one PF-[ADDRESS_1249676] two subjects. These additional 
subjects within acohort may  be enrolled and dosed simultaneously .  The 
determination to proceed with dosing of additional subjects will be made by[CONTACT_892221] r medical monitor and 
investigator (s)from sites which enrolled sentinel subjects.
In Part B, for all SC cohorts , sentinel dosing for the first two subjects (as described 
for Cohort A5-A8 above) will only  be employ ed if a given SC dose level (or higher) 
was not previousl y tested in Part A using the IV route of administration. For 
example, if Cohort A4 (single 1mg IV dose )has not been tested, sentinel dosing will 
be used in C ohort B2 (twoSC doses of 1 mg). If safet y and tolerability profile is 
acceptable in two subjects after the first of two dose s, dosing of additional subjects 
can occur [ADDRESS_1249677] been depleted 
to approximately 10cells/ l.  B cell counts obtained from CLIA (Clinical Laboratory  
Improvement Amendments) certified central lab will be us edfor this determination. 
The decision to progress to Part B will be made at a dose escalation meeting follow ingthe 
review of the available data on safety /tolerability , PK and PD from Part A (See Section 3.4).   
The first dose in Part B will be administered via SC route. When progressing to Part B, this 
dose escalation meeting will also include a review of available safet y data at the same 
IVdose level in Part A.  In addition, the next IV dose cohort in Part A will be dosed prior to 
dosing the first dose level in Part B.
3.4. D ose Escalation and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]
3.4.1. Dose Escalation
The decision to progress to the next higher dose in Parts A and B will be made following the
review of available safety /tolerabilit y, PK and PD data for the preceding dose levels (in a 
respective Part) and after the sponsor (Medical Monitor, Clinical Pharmacologist and Study  
Statistician at a minimum) andinvestigators (with active subjects or subjects enrolled in the 
dose l evel under review ) determine that it is safe to proceed to the next dose level.
Once PartB has been initiated, dosing in subsequent cohorts in Part B may  occur either via 
SC or I V routes . Specific criteria for dose escalation in Part B are provided belo w:
SC route of administration in Part B: dose escalation in SC cohorts in Part B may  
occur independent of IV cohorts in PartA.
IV route of administration in Part B: dose escalation in Part B will only  occur after 
subjects have been dosed wih a three -foldhigher IV dose in Part A.  For example, 
dosing in B2 (two 1 mg IV doses) may  commence after dosing in Cohort A5 (single 
3mg IV dose) occurred. 
If the decision has been made to dose escalate, i t is at sponsor’s discretion whether to 
proceed with dose escalation. It is alsoat sponsor’s discretion whether to repeat the same 
dose or to test a lower dose based on emerging data.  The d ose escalation meeting will review
infusion and injection site reactions , and thesponsor will provide guidance to I nvestigat ors 
on management of injection/infusion reactions in the subsequent cohort , including the need 
for pre -medication with corticosteroids . 
Review of ongoing safety data will continue after dose escalation has either been completed 
or stopped and subjects rem ain active in the stud y.  These meetings will include a similar 
group as the dose escalation meetings, and will be scheduled every  three months at a 
minimum.

For cohorts with [ADDRESS_1249678] . 
Sponsor medical monitor and investigators who enrolled subjects in a given cohort
have reviewed all ava ilable safet ydata for dosed subjects, including :
minimum of 2weeks of safet y and tolerability data after the last study  drug dose , 
AND
minimum [ADDRESS_1249679] study  drug dose .
In Part A, for cohorts A1- A4 (with 4 subjects planned), [ADDRESS_1249680] -dose in the study . In Part A, for Cohorts A5-A8 and B1- B5 (with

The m ajority  of subject sdosed with PF -06835375 in a given cohort ha vea detectable 
Bcell count (obtained from the CL IA certified central lab ; LLOQ = 1 B cell per L 
of blood) for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1249682] 2 weeks apart, starting at 
Week 12. Subjects, who reach detectable B cell counts and withdraw from the s tudy 
earlier, will be considered as having met this criterion. Subjects who withdraw from 
the study  prior to reaching a detectable Bcell count will not be counted in the cohort 
size(this will be limite d to [ADDRESS_1249683] per cohort of 4 or 2 subjects per cohort of 8). 
Investigators will have access only to de -identified B -cell count data to remain 
blinded .
The s ponsor and majority  of investigators with active subjects and/ or subjects
enrolled in the dose level under review (includes only  subjects who received I P) agree
to proceed to the next dose level based on the overall safet y profile .  For the purpose 
of defining the majorit y of investigators, onl y one investigator from each site will be 
counted. 
3.4.2. Dose Escalation Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_892192].   Dose escalation willbe stopped if it is determined that the limits of safety  
and/or tolerability have been reached based on the criteria described in this section .  This
decision will be made after a discussion takes place between the sponsor study  team and the 
investigator.  The sponsor study  team may  not overrule the investigator’s decision to stop 
dose escalation.  If dose escalation is stopped because of an y of these criteria, additional 
cohorts may  receive the same or lower doses of the investigational product.

If a confirmed or probable case of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  is 
observed, the sponsor will hold dosing for all subjects until the benefit risk 
assessment of PF -06835375 is re-evaluated by [CONTACT_456] (See Section 7.1.14 ).  If
the sponsor concludes the benefit risk assessment is favorable, investigators will be 
consulted on whether to proceed as described in this section.
If, at an y dose level, the mean exposure for the treatment group reaches or exceeds 
the exposure stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_892190] C avof 261 g/mL, OR , based on the observed data, the

exceed PK stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].
If any dose cohort is repeated, this additional cohort will be consider ed a separate cohort for 
the purpose of this dose escalation stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].
To determine whether any of the above criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_892193],
the sponsor will convene a dose review team meeting between the sponsor ( includ ingat

determine relatedness to investigational product may be considered. 
Ifany of the above criteria is considered to have been met as determined by [CONTACT_892222] a unanimous decision cannot be reached : 
No further doses should be administered at this dose and no dose escalation will
proceed.

contraception consistently and correctl y for the duration o f this study .  In addition, based on 
contraception use recommendations from other similar agents that deplete B -cells, the 
sponsor strongl y recommends that all subjects , who leave study , should use highl y effective 
contraception for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1249694] of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm 
that the subject has been instructed in its consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated

addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the 
selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the 
subject or the partner.
Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the following:
1. Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject or 
male subject’s female partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the 
entire study  and has been using that hor monal contraceptive for an adequate period of 
time to ensure effectiveness. 
2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD). 
3.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the postvasectomy  ejaculate.
4.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_892197] 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently  refraining from all 
heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study  
treatments) may  obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual 
lifesty le of the subject.

5. STUDY TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmoni sation ( ICH)
guidelines ,investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference /comparator in a clinical trial, 
including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or 
packaged) in a way  different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved 
indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).
For this study , the investigational product is PF -06835375 or placebo.
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive 
response technology  (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web based response [I WR]).  The unblinded 
dispensing personnel will be required to enter or select information including but not limit ed 
to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the subject number.  
The unblinded dispenser will then be provided with a randomization number, treatment 
assignment, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigati onal product is 
being supplied via the IRT system.  The IRT system will provide a confirmation report 
containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number 
assigned.  The confirmation report must be retained by  [CONTACT_892229]. 
The study  specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact [CONTACT_110275]. 
PF-[ADDRESS_1249695] blindin g of investigators, 
investigators will not be able to access potentially unblinding data (e g,individual B -cell 
counts) , unless needed for safet y.
At the initiation of the study , the investigator site will be instructed on the method for 
breaking the blind .  The method will be an electronic process.  Blinding codes should be 
broken only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment code is 
absolutely  essential for further management of the subject. Investigators are encouraged to 
discuss with the sponsor’s medical monitor if they believe that unblinding is necessary . 
When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully  documented and entered on the 
case report form (CRF) .
5.3.Subject Compliance
All doses of investigational product w ill be administered by  [CONTACT_110443].
5.4.Investigational and Non -Investigational Product Supplies
Clinical Trial supplies will be shipped to the study sites by  [CONTACT_128651]  
(GCS), Worldwide Research and Development (WRD), and will include a Drug Shipment 
and Proof of Receipt form.  This form will be completed, filed, and the shipment confirmed 
as directed on the bottom of the Drug Shipment and Proof of Receipt form.  The Investigator 
shall ta ke responsibility  for and take all steps to maintain appropriate records and ensure 
appropriate suppl y, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of investigational product in 
accordance with the protocol and an y applicable laws and regulations.

Manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. PF-06835375 or Placebo Administration
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Intravenous Administration
Blinded IV PF-[ADDRESS_1249699] 2 hours after the completion of 
the infusion.  This will allow immediate administration of any IV medication deemed necessary by [CONTACT_892230]-related reaction.
[IP_ADDRESS].1.1. Infusion Durations
Blinded IV PF-06835375 or placebo will be administered as an IV infusion at the 
investigative site or clinic using a calibrated infusion pump according to IP manual.  The 
total infusion time will be 120 minutes ±
±10 minutes, unless a different time is needed to 
manage symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_110413].  In such a case, the entire duration of study 
drug infusion should not exceed ~4 hours unless a different time is communicated to the site by [CONTACT_456] (See Section [IP_ADDRESS].1.2 ).  Once the infusion has completed, all subjects will 
be monitored according to the Schedule of Activities .  Refer to the IP manual for specific 
instructions for administration.
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2. Infusion Discontinuation
The following rules should be followed by [CONTACT_892231]:
•If a subject experiences symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_110412], the study drug 
administration should be discontinued immediately and permanently. 
•If a subject experiences symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_110413] (eg, lightheadedness, 
nausea, chills, fever), the study drug infusion should be slowed down or stopped. 
•If symptoms are resolved within 1 hour after the stop of infusion, the infusion can be 
restarted at the discretion of the investigator.  If symptoms return, then the study drug 
administration should be discontinued immediately and permanently. 
The entire duration of study drug infusion, from the initial start of infusion to the completion 
of infusion, should not exceed 4 hours unless a different time is communicated to the site by [CONTACT_456].
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Subcutaneous Administration
Blinded subcutaneous (SC) PF-06835375 or placebo will be administered at the investigative 
site or clinic. In Part B (MAD), the planned route of administration will be SC, however safety, tolerability, PK and PD data from the Part A (SAD) will be assessed prior to initiating Part B to determine route of administration.  Please refer to the IP manual for specific instructions.
The preferred body location of the SC injections is in the abdomen.  If abdominal injections 
are not possible, arm or thigh locations may also be used.  If an arm is used for the SC injection, the opposite arm should be used for the blood sample collections for PK analyses.

PF-[ADDRESS_1249700] be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room-temperature products).  This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study.  Even for continuous-monitoring systems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available.  The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non-working days upon return to normal operations.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularly inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. 
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to [COMPANY_007] upon 
discovery. The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documented and reported to [COMPANY_007]. 
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until [COMPANY_007] provides permission to use the investigational product.  It will not be considered a protocol deviation if [COMPANY_007] approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion.  Use of the investigational product prior to [COMPANY_007] approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report 
for each excursion will be provided to the site.
Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where 
the products are briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not considered excursions.

the product.CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_1249701] supplies.  All investigational products will be 
accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record.
5.5.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies 
The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of un used investigational 
product (eg , at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the 
investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable 
environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any  special instructions provided by  
[CONTACT_4618] ,and all destruction must be adequatel y documented.
5.6.Concomitant Treatment(s)
Subjects should abstain from initiating new treatments during the stud y, except for the 
treatment of adverse events and continued use of those medications as described in
Appendix 3.  Limited use of non-prescription medications that a re not believed to affect 
subject safet yor the overall results of the study  is permitted based on Investigator’s 
discretion .
All concomitant treatments taken during the study  must be recorded with indication, daily  
dose, and start and stop dates of admini stration.  All subjects will be questioned about 
concomitant treatment at each clinic visit .
Treatments taken within [ADDRESS_1249702] will be pre -treated with 1000 mg oral acetaminophen and an oral 
antihistamine (eg, 25mg of oral diphenhydramine).
Based on emerging safety /tolerabilit y data, additional pre-treatment may be necessary to 
manage infusion or injection reactions , including administration of oral or IV corticosteroids. 
Specific instructions for pre -medication will be communi cated by [CONTACT_892232] (both at dose escalation review meeting s and 
periodicall y during the study as needed) .

PF-[ADDRESS_1249703]-infusion/Injection
Based on discretion of the investigator, subjects may receive additional acetaminophen at 
4 hours and 8 hours after administration of IP based on clinical symptoms. 
In addition, subjects may be given anti-histamines, anti-pyretics and/or corticosteroids based 
on investigator’s discretion to manage infusion and injection reactions, particularly in the higher dose cohorts.  If none of these steps are successful in appropriately managing infusion reactions as determined by [CONTACT_093], the investigator should consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_892198].
Specific instructions for post-infusion/injection medication will be communicated by [CONTACT_892233], both at dose escalation review meetings and periodically during the study as needed.
5.6.3. Guidance for Investigators 
Subjects who have been dosed and who experience an increase in disease activity (ie flare)
should receive medication as needed based on the discretion of the Investigator.  The subject should continue to be followed as per Schedule of Activities .  If the subject requires 
medications inconsistent with the guidance in Appendix [ADDRESS_1249704]’s increase in SLE or RA disease activity in Part B after the first dose of IP but prior to the second dose of IP, the second dose of IP should not be administered.  The subject should continue to be followed as per Schedule of Activities (See Section 3.4.3 ).
6. STUDY PROCEDURES
Visits should occur when scheduled, within the time window indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities .  Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any 
protocol-specific procedures. 
Where possible the following order of activities (if applicable to a given visit) should be 
followed during the clinic visits:
1. The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).2. Vital signs.3. Physical exam.4. Clinical scales (eg, , ACR/EULAR, SLICC, ).

6.1. Screening
For screening procedures, see Schedule of Activities section.  Screening assessments may be 
repeated within the allowed screening visit window, provided this was approved by [CONTACT_107106]. An approval is not needed when repeating 1) ECGs to rule out improper lead (see Section 7.1.8 ) or 2) Interferon gamma release assay
once only after an indeterminate result (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
If a subject has been screen-failed, this subject may be re-screened one time, provided this 
was approved by [CONTACT_107106]. All screening assessments must be repeated during re-screening, with the exception of chest X-ray, HIV, Hepatitis and TB testing, which do not have to be repeated, provided re-screening is done within [ADDRESS_1249705] has any clinically significant, study related abnormalities at the conclusion of a 
scheduled inpatient portion of the study (or at the end of outpatient Day 29 for Part B), it is at the investigator’s discretion to ask the subject to remain in the clinical unit until it is safe for outpatient follow up.  The investigator must promptly notify the sponsor clinician or medical monitor.  If the subject is unable or unwilling to remain in the clinical unit, the investigator 
should make every effort to arrange follow up evaluations at appropriate intervals.
The study includes a Screening visit to assess eligibility and subsequent visits for a minimum 
of 16 weeks.  Subjects who meet the end of study criteria (See Section 3.5 ) will have one 
follow-up phone call visit which will represent the end of study visit (unless additional follow up is needed for safety reasons or) Subjects, who do not meet the criteria to leave the study at Week 16, will continue with clinic visits every four weeks until Week [ADDRESS_1249706] Withdrawal
Withdrawal of conse nt:
Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study  treatment will remain in the study  and 
must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow- up procedures. The only  
exception to this is when a subject specificall y withdraws consent for an y further contact 
[CONTACT_310799].
Subjects should notify  the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from 
future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in 
detail in the medical records by  [CONTACT_093], as to whether the withdrawal is only from 
further receipt of investigational product or also from study  procedures and/or posttreatment 
study  follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status 
(whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly  available information 
should be used to determine vital status only  as appropriatel y directed in accordance with 
local law.
Lost to f ollow-up: 
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing
status. This includes follow- up with persons authorized by  [CONTACT_74084]. Lost 
tofollow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_53981] y to reach the subject after a minimum of 2documented 
phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as lack of response b y the subject to 1registered mail 
letter. All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is 
determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally  permissible methods to obtain 
the date and cause of death. If the investigator’s use of a third- party representative to assist 
in the follow -up portion of the study  has been included in the subject’s informed consent, 
then the investigator may use a s ponsor -retained third -party representative to assist site staff 
with obtaining the subject’s contact [CONTACT_310800] -up portion of the study . The site staff and representati ve will consult 
publicly  available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order to obtain 
updated contact [CONTACT_3031]. If, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow- up, then 
the last -known- alive date as determined by  [CONTACT_310801]’s medical records.
Subjects may withdraw from the study  at any  time at their own request, or they  may  be 
withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see al so the 
Withdrawal From the Study  Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the 
inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol -required schedule of study  visits or 
procedures at a given study  site.

PF-[ADDRESS_1249707]’s medical record.  In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs).
If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.
Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the sponsor.  A 
replacement subject will receive the same treatment as the withdrawn subject.
The early termination visit only applies to subjects who are randomized, receive at least one 
dose of study drug and then are prematurely withdrawn from the study.  Subject should return to the clinic for final safety assessments to be scheduled as early as practically feasible following the decision to withdraw from the study.  At the early termination visit, every effort must be made to complete as many the following assessments:
•Limited physical examination.
•Sitting single blood pressure, temperature and pulse rate measurements.
•Supi[INVESTIGATOR_490224] 12-lead ECG measurement.
•Blood and urine specimens for safety laboratory (hematology, chemistry and 
urinalysis).
•Urine pregnancy test for female of childbearing potential.
•Collect blood samples for viral surveillance,  
, immunogenicity (ADA, neutralizing 
antibodies (NAb) and pharmacokinetic analysis.
7. ASSESSMENTS
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol-required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the subject. When a protocol-required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that

7.1.2. Pregnancy Testing
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with 
sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed according to Schedule of Activities . 
A negative pregnancy test result is required before the subject may receive the study 
treatments.  Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected).  Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by [CONTACT_110453] (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by [CONTACT_427]. 
Urine pregnancy tests must be sensitive to at least 25 mIU/mL and will be conducted with the 
test kit provided by [CONTACT_892234].  Subjects who have missed a menstrual period or who show an indeterminate C

CCI
CCI

PF-[ADDRESS_1249711] may  not further progress in the stud y until pregnancy is 
ruled out using further diagnostic testing (eg, a negative quantitative serum pregnancy  test 
conducted at a certified laborato ry).
In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from 
administration of investigational product but may remain in the study . 
7.1.3. Physical Exam inations
Physical examinations may  be conducted by  a ph ysician, trained ph ysician's assistant, or 
nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation.  A full ph ysical examination 
will include head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, neck, throat , skin, heart and lung examinations, 
lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological s ystems.  The limited or 
abbreviated ph ysical examination will be focused on general appearance, the respi[INVESTIGATOR_31000] s ystems, and subject -reported s ymptoms.
For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution is used and must be 
placed on a stable, flat surface. Subjects must remove shoes, bulky  layers of clothing, and 
jackets s othat only  light clothing remains.  They  must also remove the contents of their 
pockets and remain still during measurement of weight. 
Complete and brief physical examinations will be performed time points as described in 
Schedules of Activities .
7.1.4. Vital Signs
Sitting blood pressure ( BP), pulse rate , and temperature will be measured after approximately  
[ADDRESS_1249712]’s arm supported at the level of the 
heart, and recorded to the nearest mmHg.  It is preferred that the same arm (preferabl y the 
dominant arm) be used throughout the stud y. 
The same properl y sized and calibrated Blood Pressure (BP) cuff, will be used to measure BP 
each time.  The use of automated devices for measuring BP and pulse rate is acceptable, 
although, when done manually, pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at 
least 30 seconds.   When the timing of th ese measurements coincides with a blood collection, 
BP and PR should be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood collection.
It is preferred that bod y temperature be measured orally .A second acceptable method is 
temporal (forehead). Same method must be used consistently  throughout the study for the 
same subject .  No eating, drinking, or smoking is allowed for [ADDRESS_1249713] is eligible for
the study .  The following will be collected at Screening: c omplete medical history , SLE /RA
disease history  (including disease duration, extent of disease, a nd prior treatments), 
cardiovascular disease history , venous thromboembolic event history , alcohol and tobacco 
use history .
If the status of a subject’s medical history  is in doubt or infor mation pertaining to a critical 
variable is conflicting, every reasonable step to secure proper documentation of correct 
medical status should be attempted.   Documentation of the medical and m edication histories 
over the protocol defined time periods should be availabl e for sponsor review during the 
source data verificat ionprocess.  Questions about prior medic ations or eligibility  should be 
directed to the sponsor Clinician or Medical Monitor.
7.1.6. Height and Weight
Height and weight will be measured without the subject wearing shoes.  Height and weight 
will be measured up to one decimal place and recorded in the source document at the 
baseline visit. 
Height will be measured only at Screening.  Weight will be assessed at time sindicated in the 
Schedules of Activities .
7.1.7. Chest X -Ray
Subject must have a ch est X -ray (posterior -anterior and lateral views) taken at Screening or 
within [ADDRESS_1249714] 
10 minutes in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_110415]. 
ECGs will be collected in triplicate in Part A on Day s1 and 2, in Part B on Day s1, 2 and 29.  
Single ECGs will be collected at all other times .  Triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be obtained 
approximately  2to 4minutes apart ; the average of the triplicate ECG measurements 
collected pre -dose on Day [ADDRESS_1249715]’s baseline QTc value.
The Day 1ECG values will serve as each subject’s baseline values.  To ensure safety  of the 
subjects, a qualified individual (inve stigator or sub -investigator) at the investigator site will 
make comparisons to baseline measurements.  If the QTc interval is increased by  45msec 
from the baseline, or an absolute QTc value is 500msec for an y scheduled ECG, then 
2additional ECGs will be collected, approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart, to confirm the 

PF-06835375 
C1131001
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 09November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 74original measurement.  If either of the QTc values from these repeated ECGs remains above 
the threshold value ( ie, is 45msec from the baseline , or is 500msec), then a single ECG 
must be repeated at least hourly  until QTc values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the 
threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement.
If QTc values remain 500msec (or 45msec from the baseline) for greater than 4 hours (or 
sooner ,at the discretion of the investigator) ,or QTc intervals get progressively  longer, the 
subject should be referred to a cardiologist for consultation . 
In some cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG a bnormality .  It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings.  If a machine -read QTc 
value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may  not be necessary  if a 
qualified medical prov ider’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the 
acceptable range.
7.1.9. Hepatitis B and C Screening
At Screening, all subjects will be tested for hepa titisB surface antigen (H epBsAg), 
hepatitis B core antibod y (HepBcAb) and hepatitis C virus ant ibody  (HCV Ab).  Subjects 
who are H epBsAg or H epBcAb positive will not be enrolled in the stud y.  Subjects who are 
positive for HCV Ab will be reflex -tested for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) 
andif negative may  be considered for enrollment i nto this study ; subjects positive for HCV 
RNA will not be enrolled into this study .
7.1.10. Tuberculosis Screening and Monitoring
[IP_ADDRESS]. Interferon Gamma Release Assay Tuberculin Test
Subjects should be screened for tuberculosis ( TB)using an Interferon gamma release ass ay 
(IGRA) per local guideline s.  IGRA will be tested during S creening.  QuantiFERON-TB 
Gold In-tube test (QFT- G)will be used .  Site personnel should follow the processing and 
analyses steps based on the assay  chosen.  Ensure incubation steps are followed as 
appropriate.  Documentation of IGRA product used and the test result must be in the 
subject’s source documentation.
If the results of the IGRA are indeterminate, the test may  be repeated once without sponsor 
approval .
Refer to lab manual for any  addit ional processing information and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Additional Measures for Tuberculosis (TB) Monitoring
Additional testing for TB will take place as specified in Schedule of Activities.  The 
following measures will be followed to ensure the continued safet y of subjects and to further 
mitigate the risk of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection:

of TB (during all clinic visits) , such as chest pain, di fficulty  breathing, wheezing, 
fever, cough, excessive sweating (especiall y at night), l ymphadenopathy , 
hepatosplenomegal y, new fatigue, anorexia or new unplanned weight loss.  Subjects 
with these sy mptoms should be carefull y evaluated to determine if these symptoms 
are due to SLE /RA, TB, or other unrelated cause.  Referrals to infectious disease 
and/or pulmonology  specialists should be considered on an individual basis.  The 
sponsor medical monitor should be immediately  notified and may  evaluate these 
cases in consultation with infectious disease and/or pulmonology  specialists.
If a subject converts from a negative to positive TB test during the stud y, they are to 
be thoroughly  evaluated .  The sponsor medical monitor should be notified as soon as 
possible.  Evaluations should include, and may  not be limited, to a history , 
completion phy sical examination, repeat TB testing, and imaging, as appropriate.  
Referrals to an infectious disease and/or pulmonology  specialists are to be considered 
on an individual basi s.  Such subjects are not to receive additional investigational 
product until the details have been discussed with the sponsor.  Sponsor will evaluate 
these cases in consultation with infectious disease and/or pulmonology  specialists. 
If it is confirmed t hat a subject has developed latent or active TB during the study  
based upon the above evaluations, the subject should not receive further doses of 
investigational product, and should be treated with standard antim ycobacterial 
therap y.  Investigators should consider such an event as medicall y important and 
report the event as an SAE in accordance with the process described in Section 8. 
If the results of the IGRA test are indeterminate at an y time in the study , the test 
should be repeated, and if a negative test result is obtained, the subject may remain in 
the study  and continue treatment.  Subjects with a repeat indeterminate IGRA test 
result should be seen b y an infectious disease and/or pulmonary  specialist .  The 
sponsor medical monitor should be immediately  notified and may  evaluate these 
cases in consultation with infectious disease and/or pulmonology  specialists.
7.1.11. Monitoring for Infections
Subjects will be monitored for development of any  infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) at 
each visit .  Infections will be classified as either treated or non -treated infections.  All treated 
infections occurring during the stud y require identification of the causative organism, if 
feasible, whether b y culture, antigen assay , serology , etc. (as appropriate) and the results 
(eg,any identified organisms or absence of growth) recorded in the CRF.
Treated infections are infections that:
Require antimicrobial therap y by [CONTACT_110454]; 
Requi re an y surgical intervention (eg, incision and drainage).

PF-[ADDRESS_1249716] ,who experiences an infection associated with SAE should not receive further 
dose(s)of investigational product .  Furthermore, a subject, who requires oral or parenteral 
antimicrobial ther apy (with the exception of mild vulvovaginal /urogenital infections), should 
only be administered further dose(s) of investigational product after consultation with 
sponsor clinician or medical monitor. 
A serious infection should be reported as a SAE and s hould be listed as the reason for 
discontinuation in the CRF.  All serious infections occurring during the study  should undergo 
appropriate laboratory investigations, including culture, and the results (eg, any  identified 
organisms or absence of growth) should be recorded in the CRF.
7.1.12. Infusion Site Reactions 
Subjects will be continuously  monitored for infusion site reactions from the start of drug 
administration until the end of infusion and then at time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities.  Infusion site reactions may  be monitored bey ond the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Activities based on investigator’s assessment. 
Infusion reactions may  include but are not limited to : rash, flushing, hy potension,
tachy cardia, throat irritation or discomfort, difficulty swallowing, fever, chills .  Any signs or 
symptoms related to either an infusion or injection site reaction (s)should be treated 
according to the investigator’s standard of care and repor ted as adverse events.   See 
Appendix 7for details regarding the grading of adverse events arising from infusion
reactions.  Infusion reactions will be categorized according to the following definitions:
1.Acute: From start of infusion to 2 hours after the infusion.  I nfusion reaction AEs that 
occur during this time period be further classified as follows:
a.Serious: I nfusion reactions that meet the criteria of an SAE. 
b.Dose interrupted: Associated with temporary  or permanent interruption and/or 
modification in dose.
c.Infusion reaction AEs based on investigator’s judgment.
2.Immediate: 2 hours after the infusion to 24 hours after initiation of treatment.   
Infusion reaction AEs that occur during this time period can be fu rther classified as 
follows:
a.Serious: I nfusion reactions that meet the criteria of an SAE. 
b.Infusion reaction AEs based on investigator’s judgment.
3.Late (delay ed): 2 days to 14 days after initiation of treatment :
a.Serious: I nfusion reactions that meet the c riteria of an SAE. 
b.Infusion reaction AEs based on investigator’s judgment.

PF-[ADDRESS_1249717].   All infusion reactions that are 
considered SAEs should be reported as specified in Section 8.2.3 .
7.1.13. Injection Site Reaction s
Subjects w ill be monitored continuously  for injection site reactions (ISR) for 30 minutes 
following stud y drug administration and then at time points indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities.  Injection site reactions may  be monitored bey ond the time points indicated in the 
Schedule of Activities based on investigator’s assessment. 
An ISR is a relativel y common adverse event (AE) that develops following administration of 
subcutaneous/intramuscular injectable therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. ISR may include but are not limited to: 
erythema, induration, ecchy mosis, pain, and pruritus.  Any  signs or s ymptoms related to 
injection site reaction (s)should be treated according to the investigator’s standard of care and 
reported as adverse events.   ISRs may  be immediate or delay ed.  The reaction to 
subcutaneous injections is varied and usually  occurs immediately  following an injection 
and/or up to 2 days later. Injection site reactions (which are generall y delayed or prolonged) 
need to be clearl y differentiated from sy mptoms associated with the technique of 
administering subcutaneous injections (eg, local trauma due to the injection).   An ISR may  
not be visible in [ADDRESS_1249718] should be instructed to look for ISR sy mptoms 
(itching, redness, swelling, pain or skin ulceration) and report when the reaction occurred and 
describe it in detail.   ISR will be graded for intensity  as described in Appendix 8.
For the purposes of data collection, onl y reactions that begin within the first 4 hours and are 
persistent following an injection and/or occur more than or equal to 4 hours following an 
injection will be collected and the appropriate CRF form will be completed.  The time period 
was selected as l ocal reactions that are caused by  [CONTACT_892235]. 
The examiner will indicate for each injection site reaction (s)the presence or absence of 
pre-defined s ymptoms such as itching, redness, swelling, pain or ulcerati on. Bruising and/or 
bleeding at the injection site will be recorded as adverse events associated with the injection 
procedure, not as an ISR. Resolution of an I SR will mean that, in the judgment of the 
examiner, the defined features (itching, pain, redness, swelling, ulceration) have resolved.  
Secondary  changes, eg, hy perpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], may  be recorded as an adverse event but will not 
influence the assessment of resolution of ISR.
7.1.14. JC Virus (JCV) Monitoring and Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy
(PM L)
PML  is an opportunistic infection of the brain caused by  [CONTACT_60850] (JCV) in 
immunosuppressed subjects, and has been observed in subjects receiving B -cell depleting 
agents, including rituximab , as well as with other immunosuppressive agents.  Investig ators 
should consider a diagnosis of PML  in subjects who present with new- onset neurological 
manifestations, such as gait disturbances, memory loss, cognitive disorders, or visual 

PF-[ADDRESS_1249719] a fatal outcome.
Any suspected case of PML  should be reported as an SAE.  If a confirmed or probable case 
of PML  is observed in this or other ongoing PF-06835375 studies, the sponsor will hold 
dosing fo r all subjects until the benefit risk assessment of PF-06835375 is re -evaluated by [CONTACT_103] .
7.1.15. Viral Surveillance
Blood sample s for possible anal ysis of cy tomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), 
herpes simplex virus ty pe1& 2(HSV -1, HSV -2) and v aricella -zoster virus (VZV) will be 
collected according to the times outlined in the Schedule of Activities .  Details regarding the 
collection, processing, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_892199] .
Note: Due to delayed reporting times for these assays, the results might not be available 
along with the other study tests. 
In addition to time points specified, a blood sample for viral surveillance sample may  also be 
taken at the time of an AE, as cli nicall y appropriate. 
7.1.16. Suspected Herpetiform Rash 
For an y occurrence of a suspected herpetiform rash (eg, herpes simplex and herpes zoster), 
specimens for viral DNA anal ysis will be obtained: A swab of the affected area will be 
collected for confirmation; a blood sample for viral surveillance will be collected for the 
analysis of viral load.   Details for these collections will be provided in the laboratory  manual.
7.1.17. Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior
The Columbia S uicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS) is an interview based rating scale to 
systematically  assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior .19  Versions are available for 
“Lifetime” and “ Since Last V isit”.  The “ Lifetime ” evaluation is done at scre ening, and 
“Since Last V isit” is done at all other time points.
The C -SSRS should be collected at times specified in the Schedule of Activities section of 
this protocol by  [CONTACT_892236].  The C- SSRS can also be 
administered at an y time in the study  at the discretion of the investigator based on any  
reasonable concern. 

PF-[ADDRESS_1249720] be evaluated by  a 
clinician/mental health professional (MHP) skilled in the evaluation of suicidality  in the 
subjects by  [CONTACT_892237] (eg, psy chiatrist, licensed clinical p sychologist) 
who will determine if it is safe for the subject to participate/continue in the trial.  Specific 
criteria that indicate a need for such an assessment are:
Suicidal ideation associated with actual intent and/or plan in the past year; (a “YES” 
answer to C -SSRS questions 4 “some intent to act without specific plan” or 
5“specific plan and intent”).
Previous history  of suicide behaviors in the past 10 years (a “YES” answer to any  of 
the suicidal behavior items of the C- SSRS with the behavior occurr ing in the past 
10years).
The presence of an y current major psychiatric disorder that is not explicitly permitted 
in the inclusion/exclusion criteria and in the investigator’s judgment would interfere 
with study  participation .
Any lifetime history  of seri ous or recurrent suicidal behavior.   [Non -suicidal 
self-injurious behavior is not a trigger for a risk assessment unless in the 
investigator’s judgment it is indicated].
In the investigators judgment a risk assessment or exclusion is warranted.
A written c opy of the risk assessment should be included in the subject's source 
documentation.
Other possible suicidality adverse events or other clinical observations may , based on the 
judgment of the investigator, also trigger a risk assessment and require a narra tive.
Suicidality  adverse events or other clinical observations may , based on the judgment of the 
investigator and clinician/MHP, also trigger a risk assessment and a narrati ve using 
information from the C -SSRS, and available information, prior to screenin g and baseline 
information, and the clinician/MHP assessment.  When there is a positive response to an y 
question on the C-SSRS, the investigator should determine whether an adverse event has 
occurred.

8. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING
8.1. Requirements
The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safety events on the CRF and for 
reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety.  These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. 
Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form to [COMPANY_007] Safety Within [ADDRESS_1249728] under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether 
associated with an AE), 
except occupational 
exposureExposure during pregnancy, 
exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of whether associated with an AE)
All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following paragraphs.
Events listed in the table above that require reporting to [COMPANY_007] Safety on the CT SAE Report 
Form within [ADDRESS_1249729] be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available event information.  This time frame also applies to additional new (follow-up) information on previously forwarded reports.  In the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event CCI

PF-06835375 
C1131001
Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 09November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 89within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the 
event.
For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to 
determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE 
(see the Serious Adverse Events section below).  In addition, the investigator may  be 
requested b y [COMPANY_007] Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion.  
This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF .  In general, this will include 
a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of 
the case and independent determination of possible causalit y.  An y information relevant to 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided.  I n the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_007] Safety .  An y pertinent additional i nformation must be reported on the CT SAE 
Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory  data) are to 
be sent to [COMPANY_007] Safet y ONLY upon request.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is 
determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by [CONTACT_74094].  To assist 
in the determination of case seriousness, further information may  be requested from the 
investigator to provide clarity  and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study .
8.1.1. Additional Details On Recording Adverse Events on the CRF
All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t 
should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE informa tion is not the 
same as the AE page of the CRF.  When the same data are collected, the forms must be 
completed in a consistent manner.  AEs should be recorded using concise medical 
terminology  and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report 
Form for reporting of SAE information.
8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  
reported b y the stud y subject.  In addition, each study subject will be quest ioned about the 
occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner.
8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject 
Withdrawal section)
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes,
according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. 
When a subject withdraws from the study  because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on
the CRF and reported, as appropr iate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the 
Requirements section above.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 908.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information
The time period for actively  eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection 
period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which 
is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study  (ie, before undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including and 
including a minimum of 90calendar day s after the last admin istration of the investigational 
product.  For subjects who are in the study  beyond 90calendar day s after the last 
administration of the investigational product (expected for most subjects), the end of study  
visit will be used as a minimum cut -off.
For su bjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure 
status is determined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting SAEs to [COMPANY_007] Safety
All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  on the CT SAE Repo rt Form.
SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational 
product must be reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety .
Follow up by  [CONTACT_74095] a level acceptable to the investiga tor, and 
[COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF
During the active collection period, both non- serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the 
CRF.
Follow -up by  [CONTACT_892238] a level acceptable to the investigator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment .
8.1.5. Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and 
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such 
an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements ,if applicable.  An 
investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility  that the i nvestigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts 
(evidence ) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided.  If the 
investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then 
theevent will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as 
defined b y the sponsor.  If the investig ator's causality  assessment is “ unknown but not 
related” to investigational product, this should be clearly documented on stud y records. 
PF-[ADDRESS_1249730] SAE Report Form and in 
accordance with the SAE reporting requirements.
8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out 
in accordance with applicable loc al regulations.
8.2.Definitions
8.2.1. Adverse Events
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or 
medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment 
or usage.  Examples of AEs include , but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant signs and sy mptoms;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , AEs may  includ e signs and s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse; 
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeeding;
Medication error;

Final Protocol Amendment 2 , 09November 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 92Occupational exposure.
8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings
Abnormal objec tive test findings should be recorded as AEs when any  of the following 
conditions are met: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
recording as an AE.
8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adve rse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Or that is considered to be:
An important medical event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.

8.2.4. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4589] (even less than 24 hours) in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31009] , or any  prolongation of an existing admission.  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not ne cessaril y constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];

Page 94Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures.  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject .
Diagnostic and t herapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as SAEs.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE.  For example, an acute 
appendici tis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE 
requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy  should be recorded as treatment of the 
AE.
8.3.Severity Assessment
If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use t he adjectives MILD, 
MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the AE.  For purposes of 
consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent wi th subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interfe res significantly  with 
the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.4.Special Situations
8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_007] 
Safety  by [CONTACT_74096], and will be handled as SAEs in 
the safet y database. 
8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver i njury  (as determined by  [CONTACT_20023]) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt 
are termed “adaptors.”  In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more 
serious potential outcome.  The se subjects fail to adapt and therefore are "susceptible" to 
progressive and serious liver injury , commonly  referred to as drug -induced liver injury  
(DILI).  Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of 
normal ( ×ULN) s hould be monitored more frequently  to determine if they are an “adaptor” 
or are “susceptible.”
In the majority  of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (> 2 ×ULN) by  [CONTACT_74097].  The increase in TBili ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated 
above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample).  
PF-[ADDRESS_1249731]/ALT values might have 
decreased.  This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI.  Therefore, abnormal 
elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below 
are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be 
considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury 
have been excluded.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s 
indiv idual baseline values and underl ying conditions.  Subjects who present with the 
following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) 
cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory  values:
Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who 
subsequently  present with AST OR AL T values >3 × ULN AND a TBili value 
>2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value 
<2×ULN or not available;
For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the 
following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, 
depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline:
Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal r ange: AST or ALT 
values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is 
smaller).
Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from 
baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 ×ULN 
(whichever is smaller).
Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed 
individually  based on clinical judgment; any  case where uncertainty  remains as to whether it 
represents a potential Hy’s law case should be revi ewed with the sponsor. 
The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within [ADDRESS_1249732] and AL T and TBili, laboratory  tests should 
include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl 
transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile 
acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels.  
Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an 
anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, fo r further contemporaneous 
analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology .  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y 
itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over- the-counter medications) ,

travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history  
of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be 
collected.  Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging 
(eg, biliary  tract) may  be warranted. 
All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria of AST/AL T and 
TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no 
other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found.  Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) 
cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespe ctive of availability of all the results of the 
investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.
A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of 
reasonable investigations have been received and h ave excluded an alternative etiology .
8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and 
Occupational Exposure
Exposure to the investigational product under study  during pregnancy  or breastfeeding and 
occupational exposure are r eportable to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of investigator 
awareness.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant e ither while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product;
An e xample of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatm ent or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s 
treatment w ith the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to 
[COMPANY_007] Safety  on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of 
whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information 
regard ing environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject 
reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_31061][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) to [COMPANY_007] Safety  using the EDP supplemental form.  This must be done irres pective 
of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.  The

Page 97information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for 
information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] Safet y of the outcome as a 
follow -up to t he initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural 
integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the 
reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically  possible, the structural 
integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by [CONTACT_4692] (unless 
pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are 
reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for a n SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedure s for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported to [COMPANY_007] Safet y as SAEs 
follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1249733].
Additional information re garding the EDP may  be requested by  [CONTACT_456].  Further 
follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on 
preterm infants to identify developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal exposure, the 
investigator will prov ide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form 
to deliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source documents that the 
subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his 
partner.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Exposure During Breastfeeding
Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of 
an associated SAE, to [COMPANY_007] Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the 
CT SAE Report Form.  An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a [COMPANY_007] 
drug specifically  approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in 
accord with authorized use.  However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such 
a drug’s administrat ion, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding.

Page [IP_ADDRESS]. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct c ontact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE.
An occupational exposure is reported to [COMPANY_007] Safety  within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated
SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the 
information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed CT SAE Report 
Form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.4.4. Medication Errors
Other exposures t o the investigational product under study  may  occur in clinical trial settings, 
such as medication errors .

[IP_ADDRESS]. Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result from the administration or consumption of the investigational 
product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage stren gth. 
Medication errors include :
Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product .
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
The admini stration of an incorrect dosage.
Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication 
error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page.
In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be n otified immediately .
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if 
applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the

9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study 
is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by [CONTACT_456].  The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.
The final analysis will be conducted when all subjects have completed all study visits.  In 
addition, unblinded data will be analyzed when all subjects have completed the Week [ADDRESS_1249735] prior to the enrollment of the optional cohort. 
9.1. Sample Size Determination
The sample size was primarily based on the clinical consideration to provide sufficient safety 
and tolerability data.  In addition, the need to obtain PK/PD data and minimize number of RA/SLE subjects exposed to PF-[ADDRESS_1249736].
9.3.2. Derivation of Pharmacokinetic Parameters
PK parameters for PF-06835375 following single and multiple dose administration will be 
derived from the concentration-time profiles by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis as described inTable 5 and Table 6 .  Additional PK analyses may be performed if deemed appropriate.  The 
PK parameters will be calculated using actual time and summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_892239].  Details of the analysis will be provided in the SAP.CCI

9.6. Safety Analysis
Adverse events, ECGs, blood pressure, pulse rate, oral temperature, continuous cardiac 
monitoring, and safety laboratory data will be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study to evaluate the safety of subjects.  Any clinical laboratory, ECG, vital sign abnormalities of potential clinical concern will be described.  Safety data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively, where appropriate.
Immunogenicity (ADA, NAb) results will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_892240].  Subject level immune response will also be summarized by [CONTACT_32024].  Effect of positive ADA and neutralizing immune response on safety, PD and PK may be assessed, if appropriate.
Incidence of viral infections or change in baseline of viral loads (CMV, VZV, EBV,and 
HSV-1/2) if they occur, will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].
Medical history and physical examination and neurologic examination information, as 
applicable, collected during the course of the study will be considered source data and will not be required to be reported, unless otherwise noted.  However, any untoward findings identified on physical and/or neurologic examinations conducted during the active collection period will be captured as an adverse event, if those findings meet the definition of an adverse event. Data collected at Screening that are used for inclusion/exclusion criteria, such 
as laboratory data, ECGs and vital signs will be considered source data, and will not be 
required to be reported, unless otherwise noted.  Demographic data collected at Screening will be reported.

Page 103The number (%) of subjects with max imum post dose QTc values and maximum increases 
from baseline in the following categories will be tabulated b y treatment: 
Table 7. Safety QTc
Borderline (msec) Prolonged (m sec)
Absolute Value 450 -<480 480
Absolute Change 30-<60 60
In addition, the number of subjects with corrected and uncorrected QT values 500 msec will 
be summarized.
If more than one ECG is collected at a nominal time after dose administration (for example, 
triplicate ECGs), the mean of the replicate meas urements will be used to represent a single 
observation at that time point.  I f any  of the three individual ECG tracings has a QTc value 
500 msec, but the mean of the triplicates is not 500msec, the data from the subject’s 
individual tracing will be des cribed in a safet y section of the CSR in order to place the 
500msec value in appropriate clinical context.  However, values from individual tracings 
within triplicate measurements that are 500 msec will not be included in the categorical 
analysis unless the average from the triplicate measurements is also  500msec.  Changes 
from baseline will be defined as the change between postdose QTc value and the average of 
the pre -dose triplicate values on Day 1.  The average of the pre -dose triplicate QTc values on 
Day [ADDRESS_1249739]’s baseline QTc value. Standard algorithms and reporting 
formats will be applied.
In addition, an attempt may be made to explore and characterize the relationship between 
serum concentration and appropriatel y corrected QT interval length .  The results from this 
analysis will be reported separately  from CSR.
9.7. Interim Analysis
No formal interim anal ysis will be conducted for this study .  However, as this is a 
sponsor -open stud y,the sponsor may  conduct unblinded reviews of the data during the 
course of the stud y for the purpose of safet y assessment, facilitating dose -escalation 
decisions, facilitating PK/PD modeling, and/or to support clinical development. 
9.8.Data Monitoring Committee 
This study  will not use a data monitoring committee.  Ongoing safet y reviews in support of 
dose escalation and during the stud y will be conducted by  [CONTACT_892241] 3.4.
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that 
the protocol and Good Clinical Practices ( GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded o n CRFs areaccurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 

PF-[ADDRESS_1249740] and/or after stud y completion, t he investigator site may  be subject to 
review b y the IRB/EC , and/or to quality  assurance audits performed by  [CONTACT_4618], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
The investigator(s) will notify  [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its 
agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection.  The investigator site and 
investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y 
data and th e subject's medical records.  The investigator will promptl y provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_74040].  Before response submission to the regulatory 
authorities, the investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity to review 
and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process .
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in th is study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or ap propriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y,and laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (so urce 
documents) and ensuring th at they  are accurate, authentic /original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring ,and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff me mber to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs aretrue. Any correcti ons to entries made in the CRFs or source 
documents must be dated, initialed ,and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_153833].  In these 
cases , data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
PF-[ADDRESS_1249741] Retention
To enable evaluations and/or inspections/ audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfize r, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent documents, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safet y reporting forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to the IC H guidelines , according to local 
regulations, or as specified in the c linical study agreement (CSA) , whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618]. 
Investigator records must be kep t for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1249742] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg,recruit ment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator f ile.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated pr ior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Stud y
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organ izations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for G ood Clinical Practice , and the Declaration of 
Helsinki .
PF-[ADDRESS_1249743]’s numerical code to his or her actual id entity .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will 
maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of subjects’ personal data consistent 
with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document sand an y subject recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including 
applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent document s used during the informed consent process and an y subject 
recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_4618], approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC
before use , and available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  subject ,is fully  informed about the nature and 
objectives of the stud y and possible risks associated with participation. 
The investigat or, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each subject before any  study -specific activity  is performe d. The investigator 
will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document .
12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and S erious B reaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
regulatory authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any  new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational 
product, [COMPANY_007] should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform [COMPANY_007] immediately  of any  urgent safet y measures 
taken b y the investigator to protect the study  subjects against any  immediate hazard, and of 
any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of.
13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL
13.1. End of Trial in a Member State

interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment .  Categories of joint 
distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on 
the pattern of joint involvement.
¶“Large joints” refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles.
#“Small joints” refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, 
thumb interphalangeal joints, and w rists.
**In this category, at least [ADDRESS_1249757] be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional 
small joints, as well as other j oints not specifically listed elsewhere (eg, temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular, etc.).
†† Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to
IU values that are higher than the ULN but 3times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high -positive refers to IU values that are >[ADDRESS_1249758] for the laboratory and assay.  Where rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result

antibodies or other biological agents).   Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and generally reso lve 
completely within 24 hrs of completion of infusion.   Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever); 
Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness of breath); Fatigue (asthenia, letha rgy, malaise); Headache; 
Hypertension; Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; Rash/desquamation; Rigors/chills; Sweating (diaph oresis); 
Tachycardia; Tumor pain (onset or exacerbation of tumor pain due to treatment); Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); Vomiting.

61. OBJECTIVES
1.1 Study Design
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an advanced radiation therapy modality 
that involves the delivery of ablative individual doses of radiation to tumors in various extracranial sites with high precision and in a shorter amount of time than with traditional radiation. The precision used in SBRT minimizes the radiation dose received by a volume of the normal surrounding organs and tissues, thus limiting radiation toxicity (1-4).
SBRT has emerged as a standard therapy for medically inoperable patients with 
peripherally located stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (5-9). Recently, a number of studies have explored the benefits of metastasis-directed SBRT in low metastatic burden or oligometastatic stage IV NSCLC. These studies have shown that SBRT can achieve high rates of local control of treated lesion (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 70-90%) in  patients with limited pulmonary, hepatic, adrenal, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_158308] (4-7, 10-26). It has been hypothesized that maximum cytoreduction through local control of metastases will result in longer progression free survival (PFS) and better outcomes in patients with low burden metastatic NSCLC (14).
Oncogene-driven cancers represent a unique subset of NSCLC that responds well to targeted 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (27). These include NSCLC with activating mutations in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_738831] (EGFR) and EML4-ALK or ROS1 translocations. The initial TKI response is typi[INVESTIGATOR_19353] a prolonged PFS in oncogene-driven cancers (7-13 months) compared to the general population of NSCLC, and is better than expected with conventional chemotherapy (~3-4 months) (28-32). Recent data demonstrate even longer median PFS times for newer TKIs, such as ~[ADDRESS_1009488] EGFR-mutant NSCLC (32a), and a range of PFS times for different ALK-directed TKIs, with at least ~18-[ADDRESS_1009489]-line alectinib (32b,c). Oncogene-driven NSCLC therefore represents a potentially ideal patient population for consolidative SBRT as TKI are effective in eliminating micrometastatic disease, and may convert patients whose disease extent is too large at diagnosis to candidates with low metastatic burden that could be targeted with SBRT. Furthermore, consolidative SBRT to residual metastases following TKI therapy may eradicate cell clones with acquired TKI resistance which is a major clinical challenge in the management of this patient population (33-36). 
Therefore, SBRT to residual sites of originally present cancer (“original sites”) will not only 
decrease the frequency of failure in these sites, but it also hypothesized to decrease the probability of hematogenous spread from persistent original disease to anatomical sites that were not originally involved by [CONTACT_67380] (“distant sites”) . However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_738832], there are no published prospective clinical trials of SBRT for stage IV NSCLC, and more specifically in patients with oncogene-driven NSCLC (14-16). 
SBRT can be delivered using either photons or protons. The main benefit of protons over 
photons is the absence of exit dose and avoidance of a low-dose bath in the patient. This

7offers the opportunity for highly conformal (i.e., precise) dose distributions while 
simultaneously irradiating less normal tissue (37-39). High dose conformality is achieved through the use of a lower number of beams (2-3) compared to photon-based SBRT (~6-11), which leads to a reduction of the integral dose of radiation delivered to patients (39). In a setting where multiple metastatic sites are to be treated, the use of proton SBRT may therefore be advantageous (37-39).
We hypothesize that an SBRT regimen that integrates proton radiation for treatment of 
sites of residual disease following initiation of targeted TKI treatment will decrease the frequency of distant failures as first site of failure in stage IV oncogene-driven NSCLC patients from 40% to 20% by [ADDRESS_1009490] site of 
failure associated with a treatment regimen of a targeted TKI and consolidative SBRT in patients with stage IV oncogene-driven NSCLC.

82. BACKGROUND
2.1 Study Agent(s)
Proton Beam Radiation
There have been unprecedented efforts in radiation oncology to develop sophisticated, 
conformal techniques in order to improve the outcome for cancer patients. The aim of these new techniques is to concentrate the radiation dose distribution more completely on the disease target, thereby [CONTACT_738857]. To this end, there are an increasing number of centers in the [LOCATION_002] seeking to take advantage of the superior physical characteristics of proton beam radiation.
The basis for the advantages of proton beam radiation lies in the physical laws that 
determine the absorption of energy in tissues exposed to photon or proton beams. In a specific tissue, photons are absorbed exponentially whereas protons have a finite range dependent upon the initial proton energy. Therefore, the depth dose characteristics of the two beams are qualitatively different (Figure 1A). 
Protons lose their energy in tissue mostly by [CONTACT_416780]; however, a small fraction of energy is transferred through nuclear collisions. The energy loss per unit path length is relatively small and constant as the proton traverses the tissue until near the end of the proton range where the residual energy is lost over a short distance (approximately 0.7 cm in width at 80% of the maximum dose) and the proton comes to rest, resulting in a distinctive sharp rise in the tissue absorbed

Note the lack of exit dose with protons allowing sparing of distal normal tissue structures. The proton Bragg peak is spread out (SOBP), so that the entire tumor is encompassed by [CONTACT_738858]. (B) Isodose distributions for a 70 year-old man with extremely poor lung function and oxygen dependence of 6 L NC. The 1.5 cm lung cancer was encompassed by [CONTACT_738859] (RAO) and posterior oblique (RPO) beams. Only 5% of the right lung was exposed to a dose of 20 Gy or more while the left lung received zero dose.

9dose (energy absorbed per unit mass) - known as the Bragg peak. In physical terms, the 
magnitude of the transfer of energy to tissue per unit path length traversed by [CONTACT_407298]. The low dose region between the entrance and the Bragg peak is called the plateau of the dose distribution and the dose there is 30-40% of the maximum dose. The Bragg peak is too narrow in extent to irradiate any but the smallest of targets, ablation of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_317964]. For the irradiation of larger targets/tumors the beam energy is modulated - several beams of closely spaced energies (ranges) are superimposed to create a region of uniform dose over the depth of the target. These extended regions of uniform dose are called "spread-out Bragg peak" (SOBP) (39). 
The main benefit of proton therapy over photon beam radiotherapy is the absence of exit 
dose, which offers the opportunity for highly conformal (i.e., precise) dose distributions, while simultaneously irradiating less normal tissue. This technology therefore reduces irradiation to normal tissue, while permitting dose escalation to levels not achievable with standard techniques (39). Of note, high dose conformality can be commonly achieved through the use of only 2-3 protons beams, compared to multiple beams required for photon-based radiation therapy, which leads to a reduction of radiation exposure to healthy normal tissues. This principle is illustrated in Figure 1B, in which the use of 2 proton beams achieved high precision dose delivery to a small peripheral lung tumor while achieving maximum lung sparing in a patient with extremely poor lung function. Due to their evident superiority, protons are being increasingly used in a variety of disease sites with excellent clinical outcomes reported to date (reviewed in (39)). 
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
Early-Stage NSCLCIn recent years, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as a highly 
promising treatment for medically inoperable patients with early-stage NSCLC (reviewed in (5, 7-9, 17, 40-45)). SBRT is a specialized type of radiation therapy that pi[INVESTIGATOR_738833] “ablative” doses of radiation directly on the cancer in a shorter amount of time than traditional radiation. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 45-[ADDRESS_1009491] from the target is critical. The practice of SBRT, therefore, requires a high level of confidence in the accuracy of the entire treatment delivery process. In SBRT, confidence in this accuracy is accomplished by [CONTACT_738860], simulation, treatment planning, and delivery technologies into all phases of the treatment process (2, 7, 43, 46). Reported treatment outcomes have been excellent, with 3-year local failure rates of ~10%, regional failure rates of < 10%, cause-specific survival rates of > 80%, and overall survival rates at 3 years of > 50% (3, 5, 6, 17, 44). 
Stage IV Cancer
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/[ADDRESS_1009492] been conducted to explore the benefits of using SBRT in the 
treatment of metastatic disease (11, 12, 15, 16, 18-26, 47-49). Published studies of metastasis-directed SBRT can be divided into three types. First, studies in which various types of primary tumors or a range of metastatic locations are treated. Second, studies in which a single metastatic site is treated, such as the lungs or liver. Third, studies in which investigators focus on one histological type. To date, phase I and II data have been published for hepatic, pulmonary, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], adrenal and multiple-organ metastatic sites (11-13, 15, 16, 18-26, 49). Tables 1 and 2 show an overview of published case series in patients with oligometastases (defined for the purpose of this study as 1-5 metastases) (15, 16, 21, 22, 25, 26, 49-66). Although the studies reviewed are heterogeneous in terms of site, primary histology, and dose, control rates for treated metastases are generally around 80%. 
At present, there exist no standardized SBRT techniques and dosing schemes for patients 
with metastatic disease. This is because metastases vary in volume, location within an organ and proximity to surrounding organs that have various tolerances to radiotherapy. Most studies published to date using various radiation dosing schemes have resulted in high rates of tumor control across many different organs (Tables 1 and 2). Even large-volume metastases (>5 cm diameter) have been shown to be well-controlled using SBRT with minimal toxicity (11, 12, 18, 22, 44). A study of patients with large-volume metastases treated with SBRT found that 50 Gy in 5 Gy fractions or three fractions of 12–16 Gy could be delivered safely and effectively with 87% treated-metastasis control (67). Taken together, the results of SBRT for multiple-organ metastases are similar to those reporting on surgical removal of single-organ metastases. However, unlike patients selected for surgical metastatectomy, these series include patients medically unfit for surgery or patients who have technically unresectable tumors. Thus, these data include patient populations previously unable to receive effective metastasis-directed therapy (68). 
Pulmonary and Hepatic Metastases
The lung is the most widely studied organ for the delivery of SBRT to metastases because 
the imaging characteristics of pulmonary metastases enable direct targeting via integrated imaging on radiotherapy devices or indirect targeting with fiducial markers. Both prospective single-dose and dose-escalation studies have demonstrated high rates of treated-metastasis control (89–96%) with promising 2 -year survival rates (38–39%, 
Table 1) (15, 16, 21, 49-52). Another commonly investigated target organ for SBRT for 
metastases is the liver. SBRT for hepatic metastases is a challenging process for radiotherapy planning and delivery because defining the anatomical extent of the metastases often requires diagnostic MRI fusion and incorporation of respi[INVESTIGATOR_360867] (18, 21, 69, 70). Phase I and II studies based on fixed doses, dose escalation and normal tissue complication probabilities have demonstrated high rates of treated-metastasis control (71–92%) as shown in Table 1. The long-term liver function remains normal in treated patients without hepatic insufficiency prior to SBRT, as long as standard radiation dose constraints are observed (16, 18, 21, 70).

demonstrated favorable treated-metastasis control rates (86–90%) for patients without spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]-cord compression (Table 1). Doses varied but in most studies were delivered in one to five fractions, often 16–20 Gy in one fraction or 27 Gy in three fractions. Similar to intracranial SRS, spi[INVESTIGATOR_738834].

Multiple Organ Metastases
The largest series of mixed oligometastatic disease is that of Milano and colleagues (22). 
The investigators recruited 121 patients with ≤[ADDRESS_1009494] was a non-malignant pleural and pericardial effusion, and no higher-grade adverse effects occurred. The 2-year and 4-year treated metastasis control rates were 77% and 74%, respectively, and the 4-year overall survival was 59%. Salama and colleagues (59) performed a dose-escalation trial in 61 patients with 113 metastases. Initially, patients were given 24 Gy in three fractions, which was increased sequentially to 48 Gy in three fractions. For those who received 24 Gy in three fractions, control of the treated metastases was poor at 45.7%, whereas in the four patients given 48 Gy in three fractions, 100% control was achieved.

14In general, the toxicity of SBRT is mild to moderate.  The proportion of patients with 
grade 3 acute or late adverse effects is less than 10%, and in many studies no grade 3 toxicity was recorded (3, 11, 15, 16, 55).
The simultaneous delivery of SBRT to multiple targets in multiple organs can be much 
more complicated than treating a single metastasis in a single organ. The entrance and exit dose contributions from the 5–13 (or more) radiation beams required to tightly conform the radiation dose around each tumor site must be considered (37-39). Although this planning is not particularly difficult if the metastases have wide anatomical distances between them, treating metastases in close proximity to each other, particularly when organ motion must be accounted for, can be complex (71). Thus, in the clinical settings described above, there is a need to explore the use of alternative dose/fractionation schemes and SBRT modalities. Proton beam radiation has not only the potential for normal tissue sparing that cannot be achieved with conformal photon techniques but also allows for treating multiple target sites and escalation of dose to levels that cannot be safely achieved with photons (37, 39). To date, there are no published studies on the use of proton beam SBRT in the management of oligometastatic disease. 
Overall, these data suggest that SBRT can be an effective metastasis-directed therapy for 
patients with metastatic cancer. Similar to surgery, SBRT, when delivered to all known metastases, can result in long-term disease control (11). Further studies are needed to comprehensively integrate this therapy. Moreover, determining an optimal patient population for metastasis-directed SBRT is important as these treatments are resource-intensive, labor-intensive, and are associated with treatment-related toxicity.

the [LOCATION_002]. An estimated 226,160 new cases were diagnosed, and 160,340 Americans were expected to die from lung cancer in 2012, accounting for approximately 28% of all cancer deaths (72, 73). About 87% of lung cancers are non-small cell in histology. About 35-40% of patients with NSCLC present with metastatic, stage IV disease. These patients are treated with cytotoxic, immunomodulatory, or targeted biological therapeutics, with the goals of limiting the progression of cancer and improving overall survival (74-76). 
Although radiotherapy has been an integral treatment for patients with metastatic cancer 
over the past century, it is usually reserved for palliation of pain, dyspnea, bleeding, or neurological deficits among other indications. Definitive local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_738836]-stage primary NSCLC (6, 7, 9, 45). In the metastatic setting, however, local therapi[INVESTIGATOR_738837] (68).

6/26/[ADDRESS_1009496] to monitor the number of individual metastatic sites and the 
number of organs involved in patients with advanced NSCLC who had been treated with chemotherapy (77). Of these patients, 50% had disease limited to the primary tumor and three or fewer metastatic lesions. In addition, 50% patients had stable or progressive disease in initially involved sites with no development of new metastatic lesions. Importantly, following first line chemotherapy, up to 64% of patients who develop disease progression did so in either the primary tumor or original sites of metastases. These observations support the clinical state of ‘oligometastasis’, elucidated by [CONTACT_738861], who hypothesized that local control of oligometastasis could improve systemic control, progression free survival (PFS), and consequently prolong overall survival (OS) in a subset of patients (78, 79). Theoretically, if radical intervention (i.e., SBRT) could be delivered during an oligometastatic phase, the intervention could directly delay local disease progression in these patients (14, 80). 
Few studies have evaluated the benefits of SBRT in the treatment of oligometastatic 
disease in stage IV NSCLC only. The most prominent study was reported by [CONTACT_738862]. (64) who evaluated 22 stage IV NSCLC patients who received SBRT for the control of 62 individual lesions (median size 2.7cm) within the brain, lung, bone, liver, adrenal, lymph nodes, spleen, and muscle. The median dose and fraction dose to extracranial lesions were 50 and 5 Gy. Median OS and PFS were 22.7 and 7.6 months, respectively. The 18-month local control, distant control, OS, and PFS rates were 66.1%, 31.7%, 52.9%, and 28.0%, respectively. Results of this study and others demonstrate that SBRT to oligometastatic NSCLC provides durable local control of treated lesions and may provide long-term PFS in some patients (51, 59, 61, 65). What remains to be identified is the ideal population of stage IV NSCLC patients who are most likely to achieve prolonged disease free survival with SBRT.
Oncogene-driven NSCLC
Mutations and/or chromosomal rearrangements resulting in oncogene activation are 
responsible for the oncogenicity of a subset of NSCLC. These include activating mutations of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, in addition to chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the activation of the anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK), and the c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1) receptor tyrosine kinase.  
EGFR mutations are the second most common oncogene mutations found in NSCLC, 
occurring in ~10% of all tumors. Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC respond well to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as erlotinib or afatinib. This has established EGFR mutations as a biomarker for TKI responsiveness (27, 32, 33, 81). Clinically, the use of EGFR TKI in EGFR-mutant patients is associated with an often dramatic response rate in ~70% of cases, compared to 20-30% response seen with the use of conventional chemotherapy. Importantly, EGFR TKI therapy prolongs the median PFS of EGFR mutant patients to 9-[ADDRESS_1009497]/second generation inhibitors such as erlotinib and afatinib and about [ADDRESS_1009498]-line therapy. In addition, 
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/[ADDRESS_1009499] line treatment in the management of stage IV EGFR-mutant NSCLC (29, 31, 32, 82)(32a). 
ALK chromosomal rearrangements are found in approximately 5% of NSCLC and define 
a distinct molecular subtype of lung cancer (33, 83, 84). Crizotinib is an oral small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor which targets ALK, and ROS1 tyrosine kinases (85-88). Recently, a phase 3 trial comparing conventional chemotherapy to crizotinib in ALK positive advanced NSCLC reported response rates of 65% with crizotinib, compared to 20% with chemotherapy. Importantly, the median PFS was 7.7 months in patients treated with crizotinib and only 3.0 months in the chemotherapy group (89). Additional TKIs have become available in the past few years with subsequent prolongation of PFS, including alectinib which in first line therapy has a median PFS of at least 18-20 months (32b,c). These results and others have established the role of several TKIs in the systemic management of ALK positive advanced NSCLC patients. 
ROS1 rearrangements occur in 1-2% of NSCLC and they represent another unique 
molecular subset of lung cancers (83, 90, 91). Crizotinib has also been shown to be effective in inhibiting the ROS1 tyrosine kinase thus providing anti-tumoral activity in 
ROS1 positive cancers. The preliminary results of a phase I trial of crizotinib 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in patients with advanced NSCLC harboring ROS1 gene 
rearrangement, were presented at ASCO and ESMO 2012 and demonstrated promising 
results with an objective response rate of 57% and a disease control rate of 80% after 2 
months (Shaw et al, unpublished).
An important challenge to the success of TKI therapy is the development of drug 
resistance. Disease progression while on TKI therapy is thought to result from the growth of resistant clones that most commonly arise within sites of persistent disease (primary and metastatic) (34-36, 92-95). Of significance, failure to eradicate persistent disease has been associated with an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_738838] (96). This highlights the importance of optimizing local disease control in order to lower the rate of distant failures and achieve prolonged PFS (96-98). SBRT is effective in controlling localized metastatic disease (80) and can potentially eliminate residual TKI-resistant clones, thereby [CONTACT_738863] (Figure 2A). Therefore, the adjuvant use of SBRT for local control of residual disease in original sites following TKI therapy may extend PFS and OS of oncogene-driven stage IV NSCLC patients. 
Of interest, there is room for potential synergy between SBRT and TKI in the 
management of metastatic oncogene-drive NSCLC. Effective targeted therapy against oncogene-driven NSCLC can eradicate micrometastatic disease and reduce metastatic lesions to a limited number that becomes amenable to aggressive local therapy with SBRT. Furthermore, according to the Norton–Simon hypothesis, the effectiveness of systemic agents is proportional to the growth rate of the tumor and the fastest tumor growth rates occur when tumors are not bulky (99, 100). Therefore, if aggressive local therapy (SBRT) can

6/26/[ADDRESS_1009500] reported results on stage IV oncogene-driven (EGFR-mutant) NSCLC patients treated with metastasis-directed SBRT and TKI (Table 2). Weickhardt et al. (62) retrospectively 
investigated the benefits of SBRT/SRS, whole brain radiation therapy, and palliative radiation therapy in 10 EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients deemed suitable for local therapy to central nervous system and/or limited systemic metastasis with continued treatment with erlotinib. Patients were only treated with SBRT upon disease progression and this was associated with more than 6 months of additional disease control. Yu et al. (63) treated 18 oligometastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who had developed acquired resistance to EGFR TKI with elective local therapy. Only 1 patient was treated with SBRT (to the lung) in this series. However, local therapy in these patients was associated with median time to progression of 10 months and a median survival time of 41 months. Wang et al. (66) treated 14 NSCLC patients (not limited to EGFR-mutant disease) with disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy with gefitinib and SBRT directed at progressive metastatic disease. Treatment was well tolerated. The 1-year local control and OS rates were 83.9% and 69.6%, respectively, and the median PFS and OS times were [ADDRESS_1009501] differently
The patterns of disease failure following TKI treatment in oncogene-driven NSCLC 
patients is poorly described in the literature. In review of a cohort of 47 patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR TKI at the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], we defined progression in sites of original disease (primary and metastatic sites) as "original sites failure" (OF) and the development of new metastases outside areas that originally contained disease as "distant failures" (DF) (Sequist et al., unpublished) (Figure 2). The cumulative frequency of OF only as the first site of recurrence was 39%, DF only was 13%, and concurrent DF and OF was 28%, observed at [ADDRESS_1009502]/second-generation EGFR TKIs. This pattern of failure is consistent with other reports on the general population of NSCLC progressing after chemotherapy.
2.3 Rationale
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/[ADDRESS_1009503] shown that SBRT can achieve high rates of treated-metastasis control for patients with limited pulmonary, hepatic, adrenal, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_158308] (11, 15, 16, 18, 53, 58). Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is used for the treatment of intracranial metastases (101). 
SBRT is generally well tolerated and associated with a low risk of severe toxicity. The 
use of metastasis-directed SBRT was shown to improve disease-free survival in selected NSCLC patients with low burden metastatic disease (64). However, the ideal population of stage IV NSCLC patients who are most likely to achieve prolonged disease free survival with SBRT remain to be identified.
Targeted therapy against oncogene-driven NSCLC may eradicate micrometastatic disease 
and reduce metastatic lesions to a limited number that becomes amenable to aggressive local therapy. Furthermore, SBRT can downsize the primary tumor and metastatic sites making the remaining tumor cells more sensitive to targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In addition, SBRT to residual disease following TKI therapy may eradicate drug resistant clones that give rise to TKI resistant disease and eventual treatment failure in original and new, distant sites of disease. As such, oncogene-driven NSCLC represents a potentially ideal patient population for consolidative SBRT aimed at decreasing the probability of distant spread by [CONTACT_738864]. 
In summary, we hypothesize that persistent tumor in sites of original disease can give 
rise to distant metastases and that localized SBRT to residual, active sites of original disease may reduce the incidence of  DF occurring concurrently or in close temporal sequence with OF (96-98). The local control rate of metastases treated by [CONTACT_738865] 80% (11, 15, 16, 26, 70, 80). Therefore, based on our own and literature data and assuming that EGFR-mutant NSCLC will behave similarly as other oncogene-driven NSCLC, we hypothesize that we can reduce the frequency of patients with concomitant OF and DF by 20%. This will lower the frequency of all DF (with or without concomitant OF) from 40% to 20% (Figure 2). The frequency of patients with DF with or without OF as site of first failure will be assessed at 12 months after initiation of SBRT, which will be approximately 18 months after initiation of TKI (to be comparable with our historical data, see Section 2.2).
Reported studies of combined therapy with EGFR TKI and SBRT in stage IV NSCLC 
patients showed improved disease control and disease-free survival with the addition of SBRT (62, 63, 66).  These studies however only used SBRT to treat metastases at time of progression. To our knowledge, the proposed study will be the first to prospectively assess the impact of consolidative SBRT (to sites of residual, non-progressive primary and/or oligometastatic disease) in stage IV EGFR-mutant and other oncogene-driven NSCLC patients undergoing TKI therapy. It will also be the first study to utilize proton beam SBRT in the treatment of metastatic lung cancer. Furthermore, the study may improve the outcome of a subgroup of metastatic oncogene-driven NSCLC patients and may identify oligometastatic oncogene-driven NSCLC as an ideal population for consolidative SBRT.

as well as dose modifications are described in Section 6 (Expected Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modification). No investigational or commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_345863]’s malignancy.
This is a phase II prospective trial of 30 patients to establish the efficacy and safety of 
integrating consolidative SBRT into the management of Stage IV oncogene-driven NSCLC with low-burden metastatic disease. Proton beam radiation will be administered in the Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy Center (FHBPTC) at MGH. Linear-accelerator-based SBRT with photons, if needed, will be administered in the MGH Clark Center for Radiation Oncology. SBRT will be delivered as once-daily treatments over 1-[ADDRESS_1009522] with/without abdomen with IV contrast (unless medically contraindicated) will be obtained as per standard of care within 2 months of study enrollment to determine the extent of disease (including spi[INVESTIGATOR_158444]) and aid in radiation planning. Brain MRI with gadolinium, or head CT scan with IV contrast will be required within [ADDRESS_1009523] of care within 2 months of study enrollment. 
SBRT-eligible sites are limited to lungs, liver, adrenals, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (limits outlined in Table 
3). A total number of 5 targets outside the brain and excluding the lung primary is recommended. Patients with newly diagnosed brain metastases (1-4 lesions), may be treated with standard-of-care SRS.

5.2 SBRT Planning and Treatment
5.2.1 Simulation and Treatment Planning
[IP_ADDRESS] Simulation: All simulations will be performed according to standard 
institutional practice for the different anatomical sites of this protocol (Lung, Liver, Adrenals, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). This may include placement of fiducials markers prior to simulation to guide precise radiation delivery to tumor

6/26/[ADDRESS_1009525]-of-care for stereotactic and stereotactic-like treatments (109-111).
[IP_ADDRESS] Delineation of tumor target volumes and organs at risk (OAR): Gross tumor 
and OAR for each anatomical site will be contoured according to standard institutional practice. For each anatomical site, 2 or more of the target lesions can be irradiated concurrently at the discretion of the treating physician.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment planning: Passively or actively scanned proton beam radiation 
should be used for all anatomical sites unless for a given subject the use of conformal photon techniques (3D conformal, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or volumetric arc) is judged superior by [CONTACT_1963], or unless there would be undue delay of treatment due to resource availability. Treatment planning will be performed according to standard institutional practice for each anatomical site. SBRT planning will vary among patients with multiple metastases based on the size, geometry and location of these metastases. When metastases are widely separated in the body (for example, one in the upper lobe of the lung and another in the adrenal gland) little overlap can be expected and each may be planned independently of each other. However, in other cases, such as concurrent lung tumor and thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_424381], careful consideration should be given to the avoidance of beam overlap.
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Prescription and Fractionation:
- The optimal dose and fractionation for each anatomical site will be dictated 
by [CONTACT_738869], and thus will vary between subjects according to institutional practice and standard-of-care (112)..
- Depending on size and location, it is recommended that the tumor target be 
covered by [CONTACT_738870] 3.

5.2.2 Treatment delivery
[IP_ADDRESS] Location: All treatments will be delivered at the Francis H. Burr Proton Treatment 
Center or the Clark Center for Radiation Oncology at MGH.
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Start: Following enrollment, radiation treatment should be initiated at 
the earliest possible time as per standard-of-care, which in most cases is expected to be within 4 weeks though a longer interval is acceptable. Because of the need to assess TKI response it is unlikely that treatments will start within 4-5 months of TKI treatment. For participants enrolling at the end of the 6-month TKI window for traditional drugs such as erlotinib, afatainib, or crizotinib, treatment will likely commence > 6 months after TKI start. Taken together, it is anticipated that radiation treatments will commence on average by 6 months (in most cases, between 5 and 7 months), so that primary endpoint assessment at 12 months after SBRT start will be comparable to historical outcomes at 18 months after TKI start (see 14.1 Primary Endpoint). For the same reason, participants who are on TKIs associated with longer PFS times, such as osimertinib, treatment should occur within about 12 months of TKI treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Timing: Treatments may be given on subsequent days with approximately 24 
hours inter-fraction interval. A more protracted course is allowed also. Treatments may commence on any day of the week. Treatments may be delivered with 1-3 isocenters per session at the treating physician’s discretion. However, only one anatomical site should be treated at a given time. For treatment of any two anatomical sites, the minimum and maximum interval between the last treatment of the previously anatomical site and the first treatment of the next anatomical site should be [ADDRESS_1009531] day of SBRT delivery until final day of SBRT delivery for all anatomical sites 
to be treated should not exceed 4 months. 
[IP_ADDRESS] On rare occasion, proton beam radiation becomes unavailable due to technical 
problems. Photon-based SBRT may be used as a back-up only if the duration of proton unavailability would make the overall treatment time for a given site treatment extend beyond 14 elapsed days (counted from day of the first to the last fraction for a given anatomical site). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Quality Assurance:  All SBRT treatment plans will be reviewed for QA per the 
standard Department of Radiation Oncology practices for all patients treated.

27Eligible subjects will be on specific TKI treatments corresponding to their driver 
mutation. TKI will be held on days when patients are receiving SBRT. 
5.4 Duration of Therapy
Treatments may be given on subsequent days with approximately 24 hour interfraction 
interval or spread out over 2 weeks. Missed treatments due to technical problems, patient factors, or other factors will be added at the end of the treatment course. It is recommended that the overall duration of each treatment course (per anatomical site) should not exceed [ADDRESS_1009532] and manage acute side effects that patients may experience. 
Treatments may be discontinued for any of the following events:
•Development of additional sites of metastasis during the 4-month SBRT 
course.
•Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
•Unacceptable adverse event(s),
•Participant decides to withdraw from the study, or
•General or specific changes in the participant's condition render the participant 
unacceptable for further treatment in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_80021] 
5.5 Duration of Follow Up
Participants will be followed for 2 years after the completion of treatment. 
Participants removed from study treatment for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.
Follow up assessments will include physical examinations, toxicity and adverse event 
assessment, and imaging tests, as described in Section 9. If needed, participants will be assessed and managed for any treatment related acute toxicity 6 weeks after completion of SBRT. Participants will be evaluated clinically and radiographically for tumor progression and assessed and managed, if necessary, for any SBRT-related late toxicity every 3 months. It is unlikely that many patients with metastatic NSCLC will be alive beyond 2-3 years. Participants distant to MGH will be encouraged to follow up at the treating center, or send medical records and imaging studies obtained locally at the specified follow-up times.

6.2 Toxicity Management
No side effects specific to proton SBRT, as compared to photon SBRT which is in routine 
clinical use, are expected.
No serious acute side effects are expected during the short course of treatment. In the 
unlikely event of any grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity, there will be a treatment break until the toxicity resolves to grade 2 or less.
No specific therapy exists for radiation-induced fatigue. Mild to moderate dermatitis, 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_11730] 3-4 weeks after radiation, may be managed with an alcohol-free emollient such as Aquaphor® or hydrocortisone ointment as needed. Pneumonitis should be managed per standard clinical practice, including a trial of antibiotic, prednisone [ADDRESS_1009536] institutional practice for each anatomical site.
6.3 Dose Modifications/Delays
Any grade 3 or 4 acute toxicity, related to radiation therapy, will result in a treatment 
break until it resolves to grade 2 or less. If a treatment break of > 14 days is needed, the patient will be removed from study.

8.[ADDRESS_1009537]-of-care fiducials placement for guiding stereotactic radiation treatments (109-111). There exists strong scientific rationale for studying the response of oncogene-addicted tumors to TKI before drug resistance and clinical progression occur. 
Currently, it is standard-of-care to re-biopsy a progressive primary tumor or metastasis to 
determine the mechanism of acquired TKI resistance and guide selection of next-line treatment (113). The identification of T790M resistance mechanism in EGFR-mutated NSCLC which can be targeted by [CONTACT_238957]-generation TKI, is an example of this approach. However, treatment of TKI resistance remains challenging: Resistance mechanisms may be unknown or cannot be currently targeted, more than one resistance mechanism may occur in an individual, or resistance to third-generation TKI will develop (114-116). The vast majority of current research efforts are being directed at targeting tumors with acquired resistance to TKI. In contrast, opportunities to prevent the emergence of resistance remain vastly understudied. Tumor cells that survive inhibition of the oncogenic kinase may persist in a drug-tolerant state for some time and ultimately give rise to clones with acquired TKI resistance (117). This “persister” state has remained underappreciated as a potential therapeutic opportunity even though the stress responses to shutting down the driving oncogene likely create multiple survival dependencies. 
The purpose of obtaining a research biopsy before clinical progression therefore is to identify 
novel therapeutic targets, which may benefit future patients. A potential benefit to the participant undergoing a biopsy is that evolving resistance mechanisms, such as T790M, may be identified prior to progression, which could inform treatment selection at the time of recurrence after protocol SBRT (i.e, obviating the need for a separate re-biopsy at time of clinical progression).
Tumor tissues for the analysis of TKI persisters will be obtained at the time of fiducials 
placement for SBRT, which will typi[INVESTIGATOR_175640] a transcutaneous CT-guided approach. As fiducial placement will occur in or nearby [CONTACT_7879], there will be the opportunity to obtain a needle biopsy from adjacent tumor. This will be done through the established needle access site and will not require an additional transcutaneous pass. No increase in bleeding risk is anticipated as fiducials will be placed away from pulmonary vessels. The length of the procedure will be minimally prolonged (by ~10 minutes), which poses no more than a minimal additional risk to the subject. In our own and published experience, combined fiducials placement and needle biopsy do not have a complication rate higher than either procedure alone (118, 119).
Expected toxicities for needle biopsy/fiducials placement are:

-Entry of air into vessels and causing serious harm to organs such as brain or heart (air embolism)
Tumor biopsies will be fixed, frozen or cultured, and analyzed in the Engelman and Willers 
Laboratories at the MGH using an array of cellular, molecular, and other assays. These studies may include the generation of cell lines and xenografts. For complete analysis, samples may need to be sent to outside institutions such as the Broad Institute for genomic analysis and the National Institute of Standards and Technology for detection of oxidative DNA damage. Appropriate steps will be followed to protect health information. Collectively, these studies have the ultimate goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets to delay or prevent acquired TKI resistance.

Imaging will be obtained as per standard of care within [ADDRESS_1009541] of care within 2 months of study enrollment and at the discretion of the treating physician.
K. Tumor measurements are not required for every scan in follow up. Tumor measurements will be 
conducted when changes are visible to assess for tumor response and progression. For study data purposes, any scan reporting progression, as well as the scan immediately prior to that scan, will be assessed as described in Section 10 below. 
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/[ADDRESS_1009542]– Solid Tumors
Tumor response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (103). Changes in the diameter (one-dimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria. Additional definitions beyond the RECIST guidelines are incorporated to define local lung primary and metastasis control (LC) following SBRT. Local response and control of lung tumors are often difficult to define due to radiographic radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis. Furthermore, the development of mass-like consolidation after lung SBRT has been reported (104, 105), further complicating the assessment of local control. In addition, RECIST assessments will not apply to the development of brain metastases and are limited for spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278].  
10.1.1 Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity: All participants who receive at least one fraction of 
SBRT will be evaluable for toxicity fr om the time of their first treatment.
Evaluable for objective response: Only those participants who have 
measurable residual disease in response to TKI therapy, have completed their 
prescribed SBRT course, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These participants will have their response 
classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Participants who exhibit objective disease progression in targeted sites of residual disease or die prior to completion of SBRT will also be considered evaluable. However, patients that develop new sites of metastasis prior to the end of their SBRT course will be disqualified from the study).
As detailed below, for the purpose of this protocol, we will use the following 
definitions:
1. Original sites = extent of disease at presentation before TKI was started
1a. Original sites that persist after start of TKI and that will be treated by [CONTACT_572495] 
= target lesions
1b. Original sites in which there has been a complete response during TKI 
treatment = non-target lesions
Failure in these sites will be classified as OF.
2. Distant sites = new sites of distant metastases distinct from original sites 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_738844] = non-target lesions.
Failure in these sites will be classified as DF.
10.1.2 Disease Parameters
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/2018
37Measurable disease: 
Measurable disease is the presence of at least one (1) lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter >=10 mm using conventional techniques (CT, MRI) . Measurable lesions must be at least [ADDRESS_1009543] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
Patients enrolled to this protocol will have stage IV NSCLC (Ant T, any N, and M1) NSCLC. At time of treatment, they should have stable residual primary/metastatic disease in no more than 4 extra-cranial anatomical sites within the lung (primary and metastatic), liver, adrenals, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
Non-measurable disease: 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <[ADDRESS_1009544] scan), are considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses identified by [CONTACT_297019], and cystic lesions are all considered non-measurable. 
Non-measurable disease may occur as disease progression (nodal or distant) after 
completion of SBRT, but should not be present prior to therapy.
Target lesion:
The primary lung tumor in addition to the metastatic tumor sites treated with SBRT 
should be identified as the target lesions, and recorded and measured at baseline 
and with each follow-up imaging evaluation. Target lesions for the specified organs will be limited to 3 lesions in the lung (primary and 2 metastatic targets), 4 in the liver, 2 in the adrenal and 2 in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Table 3). The longest diameter (LD) for the target lesions will be calculated from the pre-study CT scan obtained at time of study enrollment, following initial response to TKI and prior to initiating SBRT. This will be reported as the baseline LD. If there is appreciable interval growth of the target lesion seen at the time of CT planning for SBRT, this will be used as the new baseline LD. The baseline LD will be used as a reference by [CONTACT_14218]. 
For follow-up assessment, diagnostic CT scans performed using a <5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm taken as part of scheduled protocol follow-up are preferred as the method of evaluation for response of lung, liver and adrenal lesions. MRI scans will be performed for the follow up evaluation of response in treated spi[INVESTIGATOR_738845].
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/[ADDRESS_1009545], additional assessments, such as PET/CT scanning and/or biopsy should be considered as per standard clinical practice.
Non-target lesions: 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis, as well 
as truly non-measurable lesions, which include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, lymphangitic involvement of lung, abdominal masses identified by [CONTACT_297019]. 
More specifically, the definition of non-target lesions also applies to sites of 
original disease (diagnosed at presentation, before TKI therapy initiation), which following response to TKI become non-measurable disease and therefore are not targeted with SBRT. Such lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline and at each follow-up. Disease progression in this specific type of non-target lesions will be taken into consideration for the evaluation of local failure and original site failure (defined below)
.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1009546]: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_738846] a [ADDRESS_1009547] should be used unless there is a medical contraindication or the patient refuses.
FDG PET and PET/CT: The acquis ition of FDG PET and FDG PET/CT scans 
should follow the NCI Guidelines for using FDG PET as an indicator of therapeutic 
response (106). Patients should avoid strenuous exercise and be on a low carbohydrate diet for [ADDRESS_1009548] serum glucose of less than 200 mg/dL at the time of FDG injection. A 10-20 mCi dose of FDG should be injected for typi[INVESTIGATOR_738847]. For longitudinal studies with multiple scans, particular

Cytology, Histology: Biopsy confirmation may be sought, as clinically indicated, 
to document local recurrence or disease progression elsewhere.MRI: Spi[INVESTIGATOR_738848], unless medically contra-
indicated or the participant refuses. MRI with gadolinium may be used for the assessment of liver metastasis not well visualized on CT scans.
Special consideration will be used for the evaluation of bone lesions, based on the 
following:
•Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_87416].
•Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
10.1.4 Response Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions
Primary and metastatic lung target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of the target lesion on CT 
image evaluation.Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the LD of the target 
lesion, taking as reference the baseline LD. 
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR/PR 
above nor sufficient increase to qualify for LE below, taking as 
reference the smallest LD since the treatment started.
Local Enlargement (LE): At least a 20% increase in the LD of target 
lesion, taking as reference the smallest LD recorded since the treatment 
started; based on CT image evalu ation. Local re sponse and control of 
lung tumors are often difficult to define due to radiographic radiation pneumonitis and fibrosis. Therefore, if the criteria for LE are met, the patient may undergo a PET scan imaging or a direct biopsy of the targeted 
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC

40tumor if clinically indicated. This information may be used for a 
determination as to whether original site failure (OF) exists as defined below.
Local Control (LC): The absence of LE in a target lesion treated with 
SBRT.
Metastatic liver/adrenal target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of the target lesion on CT 
image evaluation.Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the LD of the target 
lesion, taking as reference the baseline LD; ideally, this determination will 
be made based on CT image evaluation.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR/PR 
above nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD below, taking as 
reference the smallest LD since the treatment started.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
largest diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Local Control (LC): The absence of PD in SBRT treated target lesions.
Metastatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_738849] 3-month intervals in the first 2 years are recommended. Disease will be evaluated as:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of the target lesion on MRI 
image evaluation.
Responsive Disease: At least a 30% decrease in the LD of the target 
lesion, taking as reference the baseline LD. Evaluation will be made 
based on MRI scans.
Stable Disease: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for CR/PR above 
nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD below, taking as reference the 
baseline LD.

41Progressive Disease/Local Failure: At least a 10% increase in the sum of 
the largest diameters of target lesion seen on each of 2 consecutive MRI 
scans, taking as reference the baseline LD. 
Marginal Failure: the appearance of new lesions within one vertebral 
body space above or below the PTVLocal Control: the absence of progressive disease and/or marginal 
failure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Definition of New Lesion: The finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging 
modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (ex: new bone lesions may be healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size, etc.), follow-up evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions. All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions 
(new lesions must be > slice thickness) and/or unequivocal progression 
of existing non-target lesions and /or overall level of substantial worsening that merits change of therapy. A useful test that can be applied when assessing non-targets for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease.
Unknown (UN): Assessment of non-target lesions cannot be made due to 
insufficient or unevaluable data. In this case, a concise explanation must 
be given.

10.1.6 Progression-Free Survival
Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of TKI 
therapy to time of ob jective progressive disease. 
10.1.[ADDRESS_1009550] Failure:
Progression will be divided into two categories: Original sites failure (OF) and 
distant failure (DF) (with and without concomitant OF). Death will also be regarded as a progression event.
Original Sites Failure (OF): 
Refers to both target and non-target lesions (Table 4).
Target lesions: OF is defined as evidence of progressive disease (PD) (as 
defined above) within the primary and/or individual metastatic target 
lesions treated with SBRT. For primary lung lesions, PET-positive or biopsy-confirmed marginal failures within 2 cm of the gross target volume (GTV), will be counted as OF. The EORTC criteria for post-treatment PET evaluation may be used as a basis for evaluation in cases more difficult to assign as to whether the uptake is pathologic for cancer recurrence vs. inflammation (107).
Non-Target lesions: OF is defined as evidence of progressive disease (PD) 
in metastatic sites that were diagnosed at presentation, prior to TKI 
therapy, but deemed non-target lesions (defined above), and therefore were not treated with SBRT. 
Distant failure (DF): This is defined as the radiographic appearance of a new 
metastatic lesion having a dimension of at least 1 cm, in a site that was not 
identified at disease presentation prior to initiating TKI therapy (Table 4). For primary lung lesions, intra-thoracic failure at least [ADDRESS_1009551] clinical practice, for example to determine mechanisms of resistance to TKI.

4511. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
11.1 Definitions
11.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only 
if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests. 
An AE of Special Interest includes hepatic injury defined by [CONTACT_738873] (measured in the same blood draw sample): for patients with normal AST/ALT and bilirubin at baseline, an elevation of AST and/or ALT above > [ADDRESS_1009553] combined with an elevation of bilirubin above > [ADDRESS_1009554]. Patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up appropriately.
11.1.2 Serious adverse event (SAE)
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that: 
•Results in death
•Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at immediate 
risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.
•Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at 
least a 24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is 
defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
•Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
•Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical 
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/2018
46intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
•routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated 
with any deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures
•elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not 
worsen
•emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious 
criteria outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission
•respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]
11.1.3 Severity of adverse events
The severity of the AE should be classified and recorded according to the    
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0
11.1.4 Expectedness
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.' 
[IP_ADDRESS] Expected adverse event
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of study treatment (SBRT). For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected when it appears in 
the current adverse event list or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated 
with the study treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected adverse event
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected 
when it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided 
in the current adverse event list or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
11.1.5 Attribution
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event 
and the study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/2018
47•Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
•Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
•Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment. 
•Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.
•Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.

The descriptions and grading scales found in the CTEP Active Version of the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. The CTEP Active Version of the CTCAE is identified and located on the CTEP website at:
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTEP Active Version 
of CTCAE.
11.3 Reporting Requirements
For multi-site trials where a DF/HCC investigator is serving as the principal investigator, 
each participating investigator is required to abide by [CONTACT_102841]/HCC. The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, local safety reporting requirements, and reporting requirements of the principal investigator. 
Each investigative site will be responsible to report SAEs that occur at that institution to 
their respective IRB. It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report serious adverse events to the study sponsor and/or others as described below. 
11.4 Reporting to the Study Sponsor
11.4.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/[ADDRESS_1009556] be reported to the DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_141752]. This includes events meeting the criteria outlined in Section 11.1.2, as well as the following:
•Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) events that are unexpected and at 
least possibly related/associated with the intervention.
•All Grade 4 (life-threatening or disabling) events that are unexpected or not 
specifically listed in the protocol as not requiring reporting.
•All Grade 5 (fatal) events while the participant is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial OR when the event occurs within [ADDRESS_1009557] study intervention. 
Note: If the participant is in long term follow up, report the death at the time 
of continuing review. 
Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC 
Overall Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_1009558] awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_756], email or facsimile to:
Henning Willers, MD, PI
[INVESTIGATOR_36113]. 617-726-5184Fax. [EMAIL_14102]
Within the following 24-[ADDRESS_1009559] provide 
follow-up information on the serious adverse event. Follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how the event was treated, and whether the participant will continue or discontinue study participation.

SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/[ADDRESS_1009566] phase II study of SBRT in 30 patients with low burden metastatic oncogene-driven NSCLC. 
We hypothesize that persistent tumor in sites of original disease can give rise to distant 
metastases and that localized SBRT to persistent sites of original disease may reduce the incidence of  DF occurring concurrently or in close temporal sequence with OF. The local control rate of metastases treated by [CONTACT_738865] ~80%. We, therefore, hypothesize that we can reduce the frequency of combined OF and DF by ~20%, thereby [CONTACT_738874] (with or without OF) as first site of failure from ~40% to 20% (see also Figure 2).
14.1 Study Design/Endpoints
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of SBRT on the frequency of 
patients with DF (with or without concurrent OF) in oncogene-driven NSCLC patients with residual oligometastatic disease at 12 months after initiation of SBRT, which on average will correspond to 18-24 months since TKI induction therapy.  
Secondary Endpoints 
1) To describe toxicities of treatment using CTCAE v4.0.
2) To determine median PFS time3) To analyze the pattern of original and distant site failures (OF and DF)4) To determine 2-year local control rate of treated lesions5) To determine median overall survival time and 2-year overall survival rate
14.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate
The target sample size will be 30 patients. We anticipate a very low drop out rate (<5%) 
since the target population will mainly consist of healthy patients who are relatively young and non-smokers, and death of non-cancer causes or loss to follow-up would be very unlikely. If we were to observe DF with or without concomitant OF in 8 or fewer of the 30 patients at their 12-month evaluation, 87% power is achieved to detect a 20% reduction in the rate of DF with concomitant OF, which would therefore drop from an 
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/2018
55overall frequency of 40% DF (based on results from a review of EGFR-mutant NSCLC 
patients treated with TKI at MGH) to the hypothesized 20%. The decision rule is associated with 9% probability of accepting the efficacy of adjuvant SBRT if the underlying rate of DF were unchanged from 40%. As noted above, we do not anticipate that any subjects will have died of non-cancer-related causes (i.e., without any failure) before the primary study endpoint, 12 months after SBRT, is reached. We acknowledge that any deaths of other causes will reduce the statistical power. Lastly, any subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_738850] (see section 5.5) will be removed from the study and replaced, i.e., will not count towards the target sample size of 30 patients.
At MGH, about 50-60 patients with EGFR/ALK/ROS positive NSCLC are started on 
selective TKI per year, per a recent re-review of clinical practice data. Data from us and other recent reports have indicated that 10-20% of such patients may be eligible for consolidation SBRT, and in our review of patients in our practice we currently estimate that about 9 patients per year are eligible for SBRT. Assuming a ~80% accrual rate from all eligible patients we now expect to accrue 7 participants per year (adjusted from a previous estimate of 10 subjects per year). We estimate that it will take an additional [ADDRESS_1009567] clinical care for patients receiving TKI or other systemic therapy but intervals of 3 months for two years is recommended. Upon each follow-up visit, patients will be assessed for disease control and treatment toxicity.

14.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
14.4.1 Adverse events
Subjects will be tabulated by [CONTACT_738875]. The frequency of any 
adverse events, as well as Grade 2-5 adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_3989] v4.0 criteria. Frequencies of acute toxicities as well as crude and actuarial rates of late normal tissue reactions (> 90 days after completion of radiation) will be calculated.
14.4.[ADDRESS_1009568] 
criteria as detailed in Section 10.1. Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from documented start of TKI therapy to time of objective progressive disease. Death will also be regarded as a progression event. For the calculation of PFS times, the Kaplan-Meier estimate will be reported with 95% confidence intervals using Greenwood’s formula.
14.4.3 Assessment of pattern of failures
Progression will be divided into two categories: Original sites failure (OF) and 
distant failure (DF) (with and without concomitant OF). Crude frequencies and actuarial rates of original sites failure (OF) (primary or metastatic sites) as the first site of failure, as defined in Section 10.1, as well as crude frequencies and actuarial rates of distant failures (DF) as the first site of failure (with or without concomitant OF) will be calculated. OF is defined as disease progression in sites (primary and/or metastatic) that were present at diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC, prior to TKI initiation (includes both target and non-target lesions). DF are defined as development of new sites of metastases outside areas that originally contained disease. The diagnosis of OF with concomitant DF requires the detection of new sites of disease on the same follow up scan diagnosing progression in sites of 
SBRT for oncogene-driven NSCLC
6/26/2018
57original disease (primary and metastatic sites). Original site and distant failures will 
be considered as individual events in the calculation of PFS. 
14.4.4 Local control of irradiated lesions
Local control (LC) is defined by [CONTACT_738876]. The duration of LC is defined as the time period between the completion of SBRT to the time of objective progressive disease. 
14.4.5 Overall survival
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the duration of time from the start of 
documented TKI therapy to time of death. For the calculation of OS times, the Kaplan-Meier estimate will be reported with 95% confidence intervals using Greenwood’s formula
14.[ADDRESS_1009569] dose of 
radiation.  
14.5.2 Evaluation of response
Patients who received SBRT will be evaluated for response to treatment. Each 
participant should be assigned one of the following categories (based on the definitions of treatment outcome defined in Section 10.1):
1) Alive without evidence of OF or DF, 
2) Alive with OF as first failure only,3) Alive with DF (with or without concurrent OF) as first failure only, 5) Early death from malignancy, 6) Early death from toxicity, 7) Early death from other cause, 8) Unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).
By [CONTACT_480], category 8 usually designates the “unknown” status of 
any type of data in a clinical database.

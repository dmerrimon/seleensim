Context :   
Reach Out and Read (ROR) has become a standard evidence- based primary care practice to 
support early literacy development of young at -risk children. It utilizes board books which are 
distributed at pediatric well visits along with literacy promotion and reading modeling by 
[CONTACT_153997]. However, digital reading utilizing e- books and apps for reading on electronic 
devices has become popularized. We would like to address  the important question of whether 
digital reading with e -books is as effective as reading with standard board  books on early 
development. For this 18- month investigation, we propose to recruit 100 parent -infant dyads  
from 3 CHOP primary care pediatric practices (Indian Valley , Cobbs Creek  and Roxborough). 
Healthy infants at least five months  of age who are Medicaid eligible and whose parents have 
access to smart phones and other mobile digital devices at those practices would be recruited and 
randomized 1: 1 to early literacy promotion using either 1) standard early reader  board  books or 
2) digital electronic early reader book s (e-book s). Books would be distributed at 3 time points to 
coincide with well visits up to 1 3 months of age. Outcomes corresponding t o reading behaviors 
(quantity and quality of joint reading) would be measured a pproximately [ADDRESS_584561] book. 
Parent and child behaviors during the reading task will be coded and analyzed for differences 
across book type.   
 Objectives :  
1) To test the effects of digital versus standard literacy promotion on early development 
using a randomized controlled trial design . 
2) To explore the reading practices and reading activities  among children and their 
parents when comparing the use of e -books  to traditional board books . 
3) To identify themes regarding dialogical reading behaviors among parents 
participating in the Video Sub -study.  
Study Design:  
A randomized controlled trial will be conducted comparing digital versus standard literacy. 
Participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_457536] 1) 
standard  early reader board books or 2) digital electronic early reader  e-books . Randomization 
sequences will be developed by [CONTACT_457537] g computer -generated random 
numbers prior to enrollment and will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes. Randomization will 
ensure equivalence between groups on measured and unmeasured characteristics and is 
[ADDRESS_584562] bias in study design.  A total of 40 participants 
will be recruited between 9 and 12 month s of age  for the videotaped interaction  and interview .  
Setting/Participants : 
In the randomized control trial, we  will recruit  and consent  one hundred eligible parent -infant 
dyads, with the infant being  between [ADDRESS_584563] Medicaid insurance coverage, access  to one of the three CHOP Care Network 
practices (Cobbs Creek, Roxborough and Indian Valley)  for this 18- month trial. The video sub -
study will recruit up to [ADDRESS_584564] Medicaid insurance coverage, access to a digital device, 
and present to one of the three CHOP Care Network practices (Cobbs Creek, Roxborough and 
Indian Valley).  
Study Interventions and Measures :  
In this intervention,  parent -infant dyads randomized to the digital arm will receive 
developmentally appropriate e -books . Those randomized to the standard arm will receive 
developmentally appropriate board books . Participants will receive either the e- book or board 
book for their 6, 9 and 12 month well visit s. The developmentally appropriate books selected for 
each of the 3 well visits are as follows: [CONTACT_457558]’ Hop on Pop  for the 6 month well visit, Sa ndra 
Boynton’s Barnyard Dance  for the 9 month well  visit, and Margaret Wise’ Goodnight Moon  for 
the [ADDRESS_584565] measures  of demographics (child age, sex, race/ethnicity, maternal age, 
family structure, m aternal education level, and family  income category), maternal adversity (9 
ACE questions), maternal health literacy (SAHL), and maternal depressive symptoms (EPDS) at 
basel ine. About  [ADDRESS_584566] measures of reading activity (StimQ  and ERPQ ). Roughly 1 month after the 
infant  has, or is age eligible for , their 12 month well visit, the infant will receive a deve lopmental 
assessment (BSID -III), along with additional measures of reading activity (StimQ, ERPQ ). They 
will additionally complete the paper -based DialogPR -I at this visit. A video recorded reading 
task will be obtained for  up to 40 participants. These participants  will be asked preliminary 
questions about their reading practices at home at the time of the video session .

   1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
Children who receive Medicaid  are more likely to be at increased risk for language and cognitive 
delays. Such delays can lead to poor school readiness and disparities in educational outcomes 
when compared to children from middle and upper income strata. Reach Out and Read (ROR), a 
national program which promot es parent -child reading activities for children 6 months through 5 
years of age at pediatric well child visits, has been shown to improve at -risk children’s 
expressive and receptive language development. However, children who participate in ROR still 
demon strate language outcomes that are below national averages. It is  not clear whether digital 
literacy promotion, i.e. promotion of parent -child reading with the use of e -books , is as effective 
as standard literacy promotion and if it could improve poor urban  children’s language and 
cognitive outcomes.  
The disparities  that continue to exist among language development despi[INVESTIGATOR_457529]. While it 
has been demonst rated that reading to infants is imperative for appropriate language 
development, the differences between reading to children in an e -book format versus a standard 
board book format have not been explored. In a growing digital age access to e- books is ever  
present and investigating potential differences in early liter acy outcomes is beneficial for 
families and pediatricians.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_584567] or Intervention  
The intervention will be an adapted version of the Reach Out and Read (ROR) Program, a 
national program that  promotes parent -child reading activities for children [ADDRESS_584568] with the parent to 
ascertain whether or not they encountered issues with the apps functioning , rem inders to 
schedule and/or attend upcoming well visits,  and for some  parents, an interview and  video 
recorded reading task with their infant .  
1.[ADDRESS_584569] language development.4,5 Differences between 
poor and advantaged children in language processing skills and vocabulary are evident by 18 
months of age.6 These delays contribute to social and emotional problems and result in poor 
educational and functional outcomes.7 Lifetime costs for individuals with developmental 
disabilities including language deficits has been estimate d to exceed $[ADDRESS_584570] shown 
beneficial effects on reading activity and language outcomes.14-16 These effects translate into an 
increase of 1 day/week of parent -child reading activity, a 4 -fold increased likelihood of reporting 
reading  to their child,  and a 4 to 9 point increase in expressive and receptive language scores 
respectively (a 3 -6 month  advance in language) [ADDRESS_584571] grown in popularity. They come in a number of 
formats including Nooks, Kindles, and iPads as well as a number of digital apps that are used on 
smart phones and tablets. They permit children to follow along wit h stories, activate games and 
sounds, and listen to music. Their popularity may be related to parental beliefs that e -books help 
promote child intellectual development.18 However, a recent study examining reading behaviors 
and comprehension among children using e -books found that e -books were associated with fewer 
dialogic lang uage behaviors and lower reading comprehension compared to traditional books.19 
However, the study was limited by [CONTACT_457538] -aged 
children, so it isn’t clear that the findings are generalizable to younger children  from low -income 
households.  
1.4 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable Chil dren’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5765] 45 CFR 46. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].

   The investigators will perform the study in accordance with th is protocol, will obtain consent and 
assent, and will report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance 
with The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66939]. Collection, recor ding, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure the 
privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  
[ADDRESS_584572]  books in a literacy promotion intervention.  
Specific Aim 1: To determine the comparative effectiveness  of digital literacy  promotion to 
standard literacy promotion on  early development among  young Medicaid eligible  children in the 
Philadelphia metropolitan area.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
Specific Aim 2: To explore the reading  behaviors and reading activities among children  and their 
parents  when comparing the use of e -books to standard  board books.  
Specific Aim 3: To identify themes regarding dialogical reading behaviors among parents 
participating in the Video Sub -study.  
Specific Aim 4: To explore the impact of digital literacy on healthcare utilization  
[ADDRESS_584573] literacy promotion using a randomized 
controlled trial design . One-hundred e ligible parent -child dyads, with infants between 5 and 7  
months of age , who present  to one of the three CHOP Care Network practices (Cobbs Creek, 
Roxborough and Indian Valley)  will be recruited and consented to participate in this 18- month 
long study. Participants  will be stratified by [CONTACT_457539] 1) standard early reader board books or 2) digital electronic early reader e -
books . Randomization sequences will be developed by [CONTACT_457540] -generated 
random numbers prior to study enrollment and will be placed in  sealed opaque envelopes.

Hop on Pop for the 6 month well visit, Sandra Boynton’s Barnyard Dance  for the 9 month well 
visit, and Marga ret Wise’ Goodnight Moon for the [ADDRESS_584576] literacy promotion.   The HER will be reviewed 
for children in both arms to count the number of well child vi sits and examine their vaccination 
history.  
We anticipate collecting this data in conjunction with well child visits. In our experience, low -
income families can be difficult to reach for study visits, even with appropriate study incentives. 
By [CONTACT_457541] 6, 9, and 12 month  well child visits  timeframes , we can 
increase the probability of families attending both the well visits (to receive the Reach Out and 
Read Program materials) and the study visits (to collect measures of reading activity and 
development). In a previous st udy of 2100 children enrolled in a study of developmental 
screening, we were able to achieve a >90% follow -up rate by [CONTACT_457542]. In addition, our research staff can check the clinic schedule to ensure families 
have made timely well child visit appointments and then make reminder calls to families prior to 
these visits to encourage parents to attend. Study visits will be held at a location that is preferred 
[ADDRESS_584577] convenient for the parent, including but not limite d to: the  clinic , a separate CHOP -
based facility, the  Temple Infant and Child Lab, or another location based on availability and 
parent preference.  
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_584578] as well as from 
external sources (see Section 8.4). Dyads enrolled in the randomized control trial  who agreed to 
participate in the sub -study at the time of their initial con sent, and who are in the control 
(Traditional board book) arm, will be approached by [CONTACT_65859] , or the method of 
communication that they prefer,  immediately following the  time that they become age- eligible 
for their  9-month well visit . Participants me eting eligibility criteria and recruited external to the 
randomized control trial will be approached for participation at clinic appointments at one of the 
study sites. Participants will be continuously recruited until either the enrollment goal ( 40 dyads)  
is reached  or until saturation of themes is achieved for this qualitative sub -study . Sessions , 
lasting approximately [ADDRESS_584579] convenient 
for the parent, including but not limited to: the  clinic , a separate CHOP -based facility, the  
Temple Infant and Child Lab, or another location based on availability and parent preference.  
For participants recruited from the larger study, n o additional demographic data will be 
collected, as it will be accessed from t he previously reported data . Participants recruited 
externally for the sub- study will complete the demographic and screening questionnaires that 
were previously collected by [CONTACT_457543]. These externally 
recruited particip ants will not participate in or be consented for participation in the larger 
randomized control trial.  
On the day of the video sub -study session, all parents (regardless of whether or not they were 
recruited from within or external to the main RCT) will first be instructed to read a book with 
their child. This reading task will be video recorded by a member of the study staff. Parents will 
be asked to read to their child in the same manner that they had learned from their provider 
during their well -child check as part of Reach Out and Read . Parents will be receiving this 
instruction on dialogic reading, regardless of study arm, as part of the larger study. The selected 
book will be  Sandra Boynton’s Barnyard Dance , which is  the same book that the parti cipants 
recruited from the main RCT study will have received for their  9-month well visit. All 
participants will read the same book with electronic books provided on a tablet device. 
Participants will be randomized on the order they read the types of books  (print book, basic e -
book and enhanced e -book) .  
Following the video -recorded reading tasks, all parents will participate in a 20- minute, semi -
structured, audio -recorded interview with a member of the study staff. An interview guide will 
be developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_457530]. In the interview, 
12 
   
  
   parents will be asked their behavior s (frequency, duration, style) and perceptions on reading to 
their infant  and whether this would vary based on using print books and electr onic books . All 
participants will be asked the same questions .  
 
3.1.3  Screening Phase  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Randomized Control Trial  
About 16% of the children seen at CHOP Primary Care Roxborough , 21% of those seen at 
CHOP Primary Care Indian Valley  and 50% of those seen at CHOP Cob bs Creek  have Medicaid. 
Children will be  eligible to participate in this study if they were born ≥35 weeks estimated 
gestational age, without neurodevelopmental disabilities or congenital malformations, with 
Medicaid insurance (proxy measure for poverty), and at least 4 months of age  at the time of 
enrollment. Children who are born premature <[ADDRESS_584580] congenital malformations are at increased risk of language delays and 
will be excluded.  In addition, we will exclude families who do not speak English or Spanish , as 
the main measures of reading activity (StimQ , Appendix 5) and language development ( Bayley 
Scales of Infant Development -III, Appendix 7)  are only available in English and Spanish.  
Potential subjects will be identified at the time of their four month well child visit using the 
electronic health record (EHR). The pediatrician or nurse overseeing the wellness visit will 
receive a notification to inquire whether the parent -child dyad would be interested in 
participating in the study. If the parent indicat es interest,  one of our research staff will be in 
contact [CONTACT_457544], and arrange to meet with the parent -child dyad at a time 
before their  [ADDRESS_584581] consented to participate, they will complete a demographic 
questionnaire (Appe ndix 1), questionnaires about adverse childhood experiences (Appendix 2) 
and health literacy (Appendix 3) , and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depre ssion Scale (EPDS) 
(Appendix 4).  
13 
   
  
   [IP_ADDRESS]  Video Sub- study  
Children will be eligible to participate in this sub -study if they were born ≥35 weeks estimated 
gestational age, without neurodevelopmental disabilities or congenital malformations, with 
Medicaid insurance (proxy measure for poverty), and , for participants being recruited externally,  
at least 9 months and 0 days and no m ore than 12  months and 0 days at the time of enrollment. 
As in the randomized control trial, children who are born premature <[ADDRESS_584582] congenital malformations  will be excluded, as they  
are at incr eased risk of language delays.  In addition, we will exclude families who do not speak 
English for this sub -study , as resources are not available in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_457531].  
Potential subjects will be identified fro m 1) participants in the randomized control trial that 
previously consented to participate in the sub -study , were randomized into the control group 
(traditional board book arm), and are age- eligible for  their 9 month well visit, and 2) eligible 
patients recruited from the Cobbs Creek clinic who are [ADDRESS_584583] consented to participate, they will complete a 
demographic questionnaire (Appendix 1), questionnaires about adverse childhood experiences 
(Appendix 2) and health literacy (Appendix 3), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 
(EPDS) (Appendix 4). They will also schedule the parent and child for a study visit at that time if 
the parent is able. Parents who are unable to be scheduled for participation at that time will be 
contact[CONTACT_457545].  
3.1.4  Randomized Controlled Trial Treatment Phase (start of the study 
intervention)  
Once recruited  and enrolled , the parent -child dyads w ill be randomized into either the digital or 
standard literacy arm. Parent -infant dyads randomized to the digital literacy arm will receive the 
digital e -book version of  [CONTACT_457558]’ Hop on Pop for the 6 month well visit, Sandra Boynton’s 
Barnyard Dance  for the 9 month well visit, and Margaret Wise’ Goodnight Moon for the [ADDRESS_584584]. Seuss’ Hop on Pop 
for the 6 month well visit, Sandra Boynton’s Barnyard Dance  for th e 9 month well visit, and 
Margaret Wise’ Goodnight Moon for the [ADDRESS_584585] of care at these 3 clinics . 
To prevent contamination in which pediatric clinicians inadvertently provide books and 
instruction on reading activity to the different arms of the study, a n automated alert will appear 
on the screen of the eligible child’s EHR  at each well visit with a re minder to the health 
professional. This will ensure that books and reading instructions are consistent with their  
assigned study arm . Phone call or text message r eminders will be used  throughout the course of 
the study. The initial reminder  will be made within the first  week  to participants in the digital 
literacy arm to  verify that the participant w as able to download the e- book  if this was not already 
confirmed during the initial visit . Another reminder will be sent out about 1 month after the  
infant has, or is age -eligible for, their   6, 9 and 12 month well visit, either to remind the 
participant to complete the emailed REDCap survey , or for other study -related reminders.   
Children in both study arms will be followed every 3 to 4 months until  they are between 12 and 
18 months, 30 days . Parents  will complete study measures consisting of demographic 
characteristics, postpartum depression symptoms, health literacy, and adverse childhood 
experiences at the initial study visit. P arents  will complet e measures of reading activity at 
baseline, and via the REDCap survey sent by [CONTACT_6968] , or completed  in person, about 1 month after 
the infant  has, or is age -eligible for , their 6, 9 and 12 month well visits . Differences in reading 
activities and language out comes will be assessed between groups using intention -to-treat 
analysis.  
 
Parents of children who are participating in the study will be informed of the results of their 
BSID -III testing  in writing  and/or by [CONTACT_648] . Those whose child scores  less than 1.[ADDRESS_584586] 
deviations below the mean will  be informed that their child 's development is within the average 
range. Parents whose child  scores 1.[ADDRESS_584587] deviations or greater below the mean will be 
informed that their child is exhibiting dela ys in an area of their  development. In addition, we will 
recommend  that the parent inform their  child's clinician of the  result s. 
3.1.5  Video Sub -Study Treatment Phase (start of the study intervention)  
Parents and their infant who are enrolled to participate in the video recorded task will be 
observed during an unstructured reading task, using both an e -book and a standard book, in a 
pre-scheduled visit, outside of their primary care visits. They will not receive any additional 
instruction at this visit. Parents will also participate in a brief, semi -structured interview 
following the reading task.  
3.2 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding  
Participants  will be stratified by [CONTACT_457536] 1) 
standard early reader board books or 2) digital electronic early reader e -books . Randomization 
sequences will be developed by [CONTACT_457540] -generated random numbers prior 
15 
   
  
   to study enrollment and will be placed in sealed opaque envelopes , assigning participants to one 
of the two treatment arms .  
Participants in the video sub- study will also be randomized to determine the order in which they 
are asked to read the three versions of the selected book (print, basic e- book, enhanced e -book). 
As with the larger trial, r andomization sequences will be developed by [CONTACT_457546] -generated random numbers prior to study enrollment and will be placed in sealed 
opaque envelopes , assigning participants to receive one of the six possible orders of the three 
book ty pes. 
3.[ADDRESS_584588] will be approximately 7 months  
following enrollment . The study duration for the video sub -study will be one day of 
participation.  
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The randomized control trial  will be conducted at  three CHOP Care Network Practices: 1) 
Roxborough, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , 2) Indian Valley located in Soud erton, 
Pennsylvania  and 3) Cobbs Creek, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . These sites have  been 
individually recruited to participate (see PeRC letter of support ) and ha ve agreed to participate.  
Recruitment for the randomized control trial will stop w hen approximately 100 subjects ( 100 
dyads of parent and infant) are enrolled.  Recruitment for the video -taped component will stop 
when approximately  [ADDRESS_584589] completed the video and interview task.

● Recruit and consent eligible parent -child dyads at or before child’s 6 month well visit . 
● Randomize parent -child dyads  into intervention and control groups . 
● Collect baseline demographic, parent adversity, and  parent  mental health information . 
17 
   
  
    
4.2 Study Treatment Phase  
● Implement an E HR alert to remind clinicians which arm (digital or standard) the  
patients  are in  at time of well visits  at 6, 9 and 12 months . 
● Provide developmentally appropriate standard books or e -books and a bookmark to 
clinicians to give to participants  at 6, 9, and 12 month well visits.  
● Parents will complete measu res of reading activity (StimQ and ERPQ) via REDCap  
survey sent to their email about 1 month subsequent to the time the child  has, or  is age -
eligible for , their  6 and 9 month  well visit s. 
● Phone calls  and/or text messages will be made to all participants throughout the study 
to remind them to schedule and/o r attend well visit , and for other study -related 
reminders.  
● Selected parents will complete a videotaped reading task at a scheduled time 
convenient to the participant and after the participant  becomes age- eligible for their  9 
month  well visit. For parents  enrolled external to the larger randomized control trial, 
this will be the only study visit completed by [CONTACT_263752] . These participants will 
complete the study related questionnaires, including the demographic questionnaire, 
the ACE, SAHL, EPDS, S timQ and ERPQ, at the time of th is study visit.  Participants 
enrolled in the sub- study (either within the RCT or externally) will additionally 
complete the paper -based DialogPR -I at the time of their video sub -study visit.  
● Contact [CONTACT_457547], or  is age -eligible for , the 12 month well visit to 
schedule the second study visit.  
● At the second study visit, about 1 month after the child has, or is age -eligible for , the 
12 month well visit, parents will complete measure s of reading activity ( StimQ ,ERPQ  
and DialogPR -I) in addition to a measure concerning depressive symptoms (EPDS), 
and their child will receive a developmental assessment (BSID -III) administered by [CONTACT_10748]’s Early Childhood Assessor .

   5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS  
5.1 Screenin g and Monitoring Evaluations and Measurements 
5.1.1 Parental  Adversity (ACE)  
The 9 ACE questions query adults as to their exposure to 9 different adverse childhood 
experiences (economic hardship, domestic violence, parent mental health, discrimination, parent 
substance abuse, divorce, parent death, parent incarceration, and neighborhood violence) and are 
contained in the 2011 -12 National Survey of Children’s Health, a nationally representative 
telephone survey.  
5.1.2 Parental  Health Literacy (SAHL)  
The Short Assessmen t of Health Literacy (SAHL) is a validated measure of health literacy for 
English - and Spanish -speaking populations.  
5.1.3 Parental  Depressive Symptoms (EPDS ) 
The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a validated 10 -item scale for postpartum 
depression  symptoms with scores ≥9 having a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 43% for 
major or minor depression.  
5.1.4 Reading Activity (StimQ)  
The StimQ is an office measure of cognitive stimulation at home available in Spanish and 
English, and the Read subscale of t he StimQ contains questions on the frequency of parent -child 
reading activity and the number and variety of books at home.24 Psychometric analysis of the 
StimQ shows high internal consistency (Cronbach’s Alpha=0.89) and test -retest reliability 
(r=0.84) and moderate correlation with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (r=0.52, 
p<0.001).  
5.1.5 Reading Practices (ERPQ)  
A series of questions designed by [CONTACT_457548] a better understanding of the reading 
practices between parents and their babies . 
5.1.6 Language Development (BSID -III) 
The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Third Edition (BSID -III) is a validated, examiner -
administered assessment of cognitive, language, and motor development. It is designed for 
children 1 to 42 months of age.  
5.1.7 Dialogic Reading P ractices  (DialogPR -Infant ) 
The DialogPR -I is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_457532], expanding upon the DialogPR, previously validated in 
children 3- 4 years old. This series of parent self -report questions assesses parent self -reported 
dialogic reading practices. This Infant subscale is modified from  the main , validated  scale to 
19 
   
  
   incorporate non -verbal parent/child dialogic reading interactions, and will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_457533], either at the second study visit , or at their video sub -study  visit, whichever 
comes first .  
5.1.[ADDRESS_584590] text messages will be sent out to participants throughout the study. These text messages 
include an initial text message to welcome participants to the study, as well as text message 
reminders of upcoming well -child visits, to complete the emailed surveys, to download the e -
book (digital arm participants only), and to schedule the final study visit. A dditionally, text 
messages will be sent out to subjects who consented to participate in the videotape sub -study ,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
reminding them of their study visit.  
5.1.10  Audio -recording and V ideotapi[INVESTIGATOR_457534] -infant dyads recruited into the vid eotape sub -study will participate in a video recorded 
reading exercise and a brief, audio -recorded semi -structured interview. Parents will be 
videotaped while reading a print book and two versions (basic and enhanced) of an electronic 
book with their infant. As part of this exercise, parents will  also be audio recorded while 
participating in a semi -structured one -on-one interview with a study team member.  Videotaped 
book readings will be analyzed without transcription. Interview audio recordings will be 
transcribed by [CONTACT_271937] ( http://www.adatranscription.com/ ). Audio recordings will be 
de-identified  and sent via their secure server , and subsequent transcripts will be saved on a 
secure server accessed  only b y members of the study team.  
 
6 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for the randomized control trial will be the BSID -III scores at the  second 
study visit when the child is between 1 2 and 18 months, 30 days  of age.  
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Seco ndary endpoint s will be t he difference in StimQ scores , and  the information about reading 
practices and activities from the ERPQ,  collected approximately 1 month after the infant has, or 
is age -eligible for , their 6, 9, and 12 month  well visits for the randomized control trial , the 
DialogPR -I collected between 9 and 18 months, 30 days , as well as themes derived from the 
transcripts of the  video and audio -recordings  in the Video Sub- study. The Video Sub -study is 
contributing to the ma in study’s exploration of dialogic reading behaviors when comparing e -
[ADDRESS_584591] of digital literacy on healthcare utilization, the EHR will 
be reviewed to identify a  subjects’ number of well visits and their vaccination history.   
 
To determine whether parent  adversity, health literacy, and/or parent  mental health modify the 
effects of digital versus standard literacy  on language development, we will develop similar 
regression models using longitudinal data methods, but we will also fit interaction terms between 
study group and ACE score (≥4), SAHL (high or low) and EPDS score (> 10). To determine if 
parent -child reading activity mediates the association of intervention group assignment and 
language development, we will use mediation analysis with separate models regressing group 
assignment on language development, parent -child reading activity on group assignment, and 
group assignment on language development adjusted for  parent -child reading activity.  
 
Assuming a  mean cognitive subscale  on the BSID -III of 96, a  power of 0. 70, an alpha of 0.05, 
and a clinically significant difference of 7.5 points on the BSID -III between groups, we estimate 
that we will need to recruit a total sample size of 1 00 eligible children ( 50 in each group) to 
participate in the main RCT study  (Figure 1) . To attain thematic saturation in the Video Sub -
study, we will recruit up to 40 participants 9- 12 months of age. These 40 participants may be 
recruited external to the main study if we are unable to recruit up to 40 from the 100 enrolled in 
the main study in a timely fashion. All analyses will be conducted using Stata Statistical 
Software, version 13 (College Station , TX).

   7 SAFETY  MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. The m ain risks are  
disclosure of private health information (PHI)  and study responses and discomfort with 
answering sensitive questions concerning childhood trauma or depressive symptoms . 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs  are not expected. If any 
unanticipated pro blems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during 
the course of this study ( including SAEs ) they  will be reported to the IRB in accordance with 
CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that a re not 
serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or 
other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review. We will query 
participants concerning any disclosures of PHI at each study vi sit. We will only query 
participants once concerning childhood trauma at the baseline visit and twice concerning 
depressive symptoms at the baseline and second (final) study visit.  
[ADDRESS_584592] ID number will be kept separate from data forms 
(electronic and paper). The master list will be kept using password -protecte d files. These files 
will be encrypted and maintained on the CHOP secure server to ensure security.  Participants’ 
information will be stored in the REDCap database and configured to export data without PHI. 
All de -identified records will be retained forever.  De-identified data will be shared with the study 
sponsor. Stored data and patient identifiers will be kept for 6 years subsequent to the study 
completion, and possibly longer if required by [CONTACT_456].  
Any paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_457535]’s ID code and will be 
kept in the department of General Pediatrics at The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684].  
 All audio and video  recordings will be destroyed within three years of data analysis completion.  
[ADDRESS_584593] obtaining IRB approval. The 
research staff will obtain a data use agreement between the provi der (the PI) of the data and any 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (PHI limited to 
dates and zip codes).  
8.[ADDRESS_584594] monitoring of data and 
safety twice annually .  
8.3.2 Risk Assessment  
There is minimal risk for harm to the participant s in this study. Some information collected from 
the study participants on the study assessments is sensitive information and may cause the 
subjects discomfort , e.g. questions concerning childhood trauma or depressive symptoms . This 
could include assessment  of caregiver’s suicidal ideations and a screening of caregiver ’s suicide 
risk in primary care flow. The results of the  screener will be reviewed soon after completion  (See 
Appendix 4).  [CONTACT_457559], PhD, is a co -investigator and child -psychologist who has 
expertise in early child development and measurement. She will serve as the licensed 
psychologist to contact [CONTACT_457549].  This risk is considered 
minimal and no more than what is normally associated with being in a  physician’s or mental 
health practitioner’s office. Furthermore, families incur a risk of disclosure of private health 
information to individuals not connected with this study. This could occur through inadvertent 
disclosure of PHI by [CONTACT_3647]. This  risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_457550] a 
separate place than study information.  
 
Unique identifiers will be created for each subject in the stu dy. Any paper forms used will be 
stored in a locked file cabinet. REDCap will be used to store the data. A master list containing 
[ADDRESS_584595] ID number will be kept separate from data forms (electronic and paper). The 
master list will be kept using pas sword -protected files. These files will be encrypted and 
maintained on the CHOP secure server to ensure security. Participants’ information will be 
stored in the REDCap database and configured to export data without PHI. All de -identified 
records will be r etained forever. De-identified data will be shared with the study sponsor.  
8.3.3 Potential Benefits of Trial Participation  
Parents or guardians of the participants in either arm  may not benefit from the digital literacy 
promotion intervention. Parents and their  children may benefit from initiating parent -child 
reading activity earlier with the potential for improved language development.  Information from 
this study could be used to generate generalizable knowledge to reshape the views on digital 
literacy initiat ives, the ROR program and provide information for other early literacy campaigns 
such as Philadelphia’s Read! By 4th and the Great Start Collaborative’s  Early to Read 
Campaign. If results from this study favor the digital book  arm, then administrators of t he ROR 
program and other local and national literacy campaigns can encourage the distribution of 
developmentally appropriate e -books in conjunction with standard books. Nationally , pediatric 
clinicians may benefit by [CONTACT_457551] a difference in effectiveness of  
language development  in children who are read to by [CONTACT_457552]. 
This may have an impact in environments where access to books may be limited by [CONTACT_457553], 
geographical, or time constraints  on parents . Locally, pediatric clinicians could benefit by [CONTACT_457554]’s ROR program expanded to additional areas in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. 
Information from this study can be used by [CONTACT_457555].  
8.3.[ADDRESS_584596] an EHR r ecruitment prompt sent only to potentially eligible children with 
Medicaid at their 4 month well visit at the CHOP Primary Care Roxborough, PA , CHOP Primary 
Care Cobbs Creek  and CHOP Primary Care Indian Valley. Parents who are conceivably 
interested in par ticipating will be contact[CONTACT_136501]. Research staff will briefly explain 
the study procedures , guided by [CONTACT_271959] . This 
includes reading the inclusion criteria to the potential participant, and askin g whether or not this 
individual is interested in participating.  Research staff will then  schedule a time to meet with the 
parent in person . This will happen at a time before their infant’s [ADDRESS_584597], may be approached in person  before or at the time of their 6 month 
well visit. These potentially eligible participants will be screened, consented and enrolled into 
the study prior to the child’s time with the provider.  
We may  also hang recruitment flyers in the hallways at both cli nics giving information about the 
study and contact [CONTACT_457556] . 
8.4.[ADDRESS_584598] . Study staff will screen and consent these participants in person 
prior to the child’s time with the provider.  
8.5 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization  
Following the screening via review of the medical record, eligibility for study participation will 
be explained, either in person or via phone. During the research staff visit subsequent to the 
screening  process , written informed consent will be completed . Research staff will discuss the 
study aims, procedures, risks and benefits, alternatives to participation, and confidentiality 
protocols with the parent . Research staff will speak to the parent  about the voluntary nature of 
participation and provide the pote ntial subject with the opportunity to ask questions about the 
study and its risks and benefits. Parents who consent to participate and who give parental 
permission for the child’s participation, will sign two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1076] : one 
will b e kept for study purposes and the other will be provided to the consenting parent. I n order 
to give parental permission for the child to participate, the consenting mother must be at least [ADDRESS_584599] only (Parent who does not speak English is part of the Exclusion criteria for eligibility 
25 
   
  
   to participate in the Video Sub -study ;see section [IP_ADDRESS]) either in person or via phone by a 
Bilingual member of the study team. When it is time to consent the participant, an interpreter 
will be present and will carry out the Spanish Short Form Consent process with the Spanish -
speaking subject.  
Participants  in the randomized control trial who agree to participate in the video  sub-study  will 
provide their consent by [CONTACT_457557] a section of the consent form for the randomized control trial. 
Participants recruited for the video sub -study who are enrolled external to the larger trial will 
complete a consent form at the time of enrollment. This consent will be for participation limited 
to the video sub -study.  Study staff will follow the procedures outlined above to consent 
participants into this sub -study. Of note, non- English speaking participants will not be enrolled 
in the sub- study (see exclusion criteria), as it is infeasible at this time to conduct and analyze 
these qualitative data in languages other than English.  
 
8.6 Payment to Subjects/Families  
8.6.1 Payment s to parent for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation)  
All participants  will be paid up to $70 total for their participation. They will receive $ 20 upon 
completion of the i nitial study visit. They will then receive $ 5 upon completion of  each of the 
two surveys emailed to them . At the second (final) study visit,  they will receive $ 40. All 
payments will be made in the form of pre -paid, CHOP -issued debit cards.   
Participants recruited to participate in the video -taped reading task will receive an additiona l $[ADDRESS_584600] at the completion of the visit.   
8.6.2 Gifts  
Participants  will receive  three books over the course of the study, one for  each well visit ( 6 
months, 9 months and 12 months ).  All parents  will receive a small  non-monetary  gift of a Reach 
Out and Read tote bag filled with [ADDRESS_584601] a summary of the 
results of the study on the Policylab website ( http://policylab.chop.edu/  ) and tweet the results to 
our Policylab twitter follow ers. This latter group is a diverse group of individuals from policy, 
advocacy, government, and clinical fields. We will also prepare an Evidence- to-Action (ETA) 
policy brief, which attempts to capture the policy implications of the study findings. ETA briefs, 
which are developed at Policylab, are mailed and/or emailed to policymakers and child health 
advocates on our distribution list.

Date:  7/8/[ADDRESS_563322] identified as novel, putative adipokines . The remaining fraction 
of the blood, which contains blood cells, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_134772] (FACS) to determine the number of specific cell types, including endothelial progenitor cells.  This analysis will determine how exercise affects the number of specific cell types in the blood that can regulate metabolic health.  
We have identified two S
pecific Aims: 
Specific Aim 1.  To deter
mine if exercise training causes beiging of scWAT in human subjects.  
These studies will be done in lean, healthy -obese, and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. 
Specific Aim 2.  To determine if exercise training alters the metabolic phenotype of scWAT from 
human subjects.  This will include studies of mitochondrial function and glucose and fatty acid 
metabolism in scWAT.   
Due to additional funding, we ar
e now able to explore subaims to Aims 1 and 2, by [CONTACT_355113]. The subaim for Specific Aim 1 will determine if exercise training causes differences in scWAT beiging in male vs. female subjects. The subaim for Specific Aim 2 will determine if exercise training alters the metabolic phenotype of scWAT in male subjects differently compared to female subjects. 
2.STUDY DESIGN:
Subjects 
In this section, we will provide the study design in terms of subject recruitment, exclusion criteria, visit details, exercise training program, and sample collection.   
There will be two exercise training regimens.  The first training regimen will determine the 
effects of moderate intensity endurance exercise training on scWAT in lean, healthy  overweight/obese, 
and overweight/obese subjects with type 2 diabetes (MIT study group).  The second training regimen will determine the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIT ) in lean subjects (HIT study group).  For 
both studies , the visit details, acute exercise experiments, and sample collection will be  similar so they 
are described together.   
Subjects.  For the MIT s
tudy, there will be three groups  of subjects: 1) 28 lean subjects ; 2) 28 
overweight or obese subjects without type 2 diabetes ; and 3) [ADDRESS_563323] been cleared for regular exercise.  All subjects will be 
sedentary according to American College of Sports Medicine’s guidelines (6).  Enrollment HbA1c

subjects with type 2 diabetes.  BMI will be between ≥20±0.1 and < 27 kg/m2 for lean subjects , ≥27 and 
≤37±0.1 kg/m2 for obese/overweight subjects, and ≥25±0.1 and ≤37±0.1kg/m2 for subjects with type 2 
diabetes. Additional exclusion criteria will include: current smoker, type 1 diabetes, severe complications  of 
diabetes, heart or lung disease, acute infection, current dieting or weight loss efforts, pregnancy, known history of HIV/AIDS, cancer, biochemical evidence of renal or hepatic dysfunction, neurological disease, recent blood donation, clinical history of stroke, severe hypertension (systolic >160 mmHg or diastolic >90 mmHg), history of keloid formation, and inability to exercise at 50% of predicted heart rate reserve at baseline. Participants taking beta-blockers , thiazolidinediones , a basal -bolus insulin regimen, 
or who screen positive for the American Heart Association’s contraindications to exercise testing will be excluded (7).  Subjects  will be asked to maintain a constant diet and extracurricular activities during the 
study.

Testing Visit 1.  Subjects will arrive between [ADDRESS_563325] be explained to the participant in detail and consent forms 
will be signed (see below). Subjects will be asked in anticipation of this visit to hold their medication the 
morning of the visit (this is the same for any visit requiring fasting). The participant’s medical history, 
blood pressure, height, weight, and BMI (weight in kilograms divided by  [CONTACT_55739]) will 
be obtained. An estimate of body composition will be obtained by [CONTACT_746] a DXA  body composition 
analysis (only for lean and overweight/obese subjects in the MIT training group). Briefly, the Hologi c 
DXA system will be used, which provides images for assessment of bone density, and body fat 
composition. Images will be obtained by [CONTACT_443011]. Pregnant women are excluded 
from the study. Participants must not have had any radiographic barium studies within the past week, as this will be seen in the digestive track and interfere with the measurement of bone densitometry. Any metallic implants or previous fractures are not a contraindication for the scan, but will be annotated

standardized dietary recall will be performed. Next, a resting metabolic rate (RMR ) will be measured 
using the metabolic cart that will also be used in Visit [ADDRESS_563328] (OGTT) will be performed For 
the OGTT, baseline serum glucose and insulin measurements will be obtained. Participants will then be given a 75g-oral glucose solution to drink and serum glucose and insulin measurements will be obtained through an IV catheter at 15, 30, 60, [ADDRESS_563329]. Participants 
without a previous history of type 2 diabetes mellitus will be excluded from the study if their blood glucose rises ≥140mg/dl at [ADDRESS_563330] will be notified if they are eligible to participate in the study. This usually occurs later that day. 
Summary of procedures during Joslin Visit 1:

Testing Visit 2.  Subjects will report between [ADDRESS_563331] eight hours.  
Subjects will withhold their AM diabetes  medications until after the biopsy has been taken. Participants 
will then undergo a subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy procedure ( (8) and as described below)  
 Similar procedures will be followed for each participant. There has been 
extensive experience with this procedure at the Joslin Diabetes Center .  Briefly, the peri-umbilical 
area will be anesthetized and the biopsy will be obtained with the Coleman Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_443000], using the Miller Medical 60cc Monoject syringe with Toomey or Luer Lock  tip, with a

-Wearable activity tracker and heart rate monitor instructions
Testing Visit 3b: 
For the enrolled subjects with type 2 diabetes, we are interested in the effects of an exercise bout on 
reductions in blood glucose. For this group of subjects, we ask subjects to perform a 45min aerobic  
exercise session, prior to starting the exercise training protocol.  
For testing visit 3b, subjects will be given a standardized drink  to be taken at home at 7AM, and report 
to the CRC around 10AM. Subjects can start the visit with a finger stick blood glucose between 100-
200mg/dl. An IV catheter will be placed and baseline plasma and serum samples will be collected. Subjects will exercise on the treadmill for 45 mins at approximately 75% of VO
2peak  as determined 
during Visit 3. For the determination of blood glucose, the YSI machine will be used. Blood samples will 
be collected through an IV catheter at baseline, [ADDRESS_563335] 2hr after exercise [3]. The study visits will be concluded after the last blood sample 
is taken.  Blood glucose will be measured at the indicated time points. Hypoglycemia will be treated per established protocols if blood glucose decreases <70mg/dl. If a subject reports hypoglycemic symptoms, blood glucose will directly be measured. 
Testing Visit 4. During week 5, subjects  in groups 1-3 will undergo a submaximal exercise bout for 45 
min at the heart rate target corresponding to approximately 75% of VO 2peak.  Blood draws will be 
obtained before, immediately after, and after [ADDRESS_563336] for this visit, but will be given a standardizeddrink . Subjects in group 4 will undergo 
a regular HIT exercise session. Two lactate measurements will be obtained at the beginning and at the 
end of this visit with the same procedure as outlined under Visit 3.  
Testing Visit 5.  This visit will be identical to Visit 3, except it will occur during week 10 of training.  

Form Revised March 2003   CHS #: 2016-33 
  Date:  7/8/[ADDRESS_563337] compared to baseline. Submaximal exercise capacity will 
be recorded, as well as time to achieve target heart rate [see below for details of VO 2 testing]. To 
assess the effects of acute exercise, laboratory studies will be obtained [ADDRESS_563338] with a standardized blood draw as described 
above. Lactate measurements will be obtained at baseline and at VO
2 peak as outlined under Visit 3. 
Blood samples will either be sent directly to the lab for  further analysis of the specified laboratory tests 
or will be further processed for storage.   Summary of Procedures during Joslin Visit 5: -VO
[ADDRESS_563339] training session. Similar to Visit 2, a 
repeat biopsy  during visit 6 may be offered if limited sample is obtained. 
 Summary of procedures during Joslin Visit 6: 
-Subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy  
 
Testing Visit 7.  Subjects will arrive after an overnight fast of at least [ADDRESS_563340] 5-15 minutes of the 20 minute measurement will be used for the analyses to obtain the resting metabolic rate. Body composition with DXA will again be performed as described above; the 
study team may opt to instead perform this assessment at Visit [ADDRESS_563341] will be repeated prior to the DXA Exam for female subjects; if a positive result is found, this assessment will not be performed.  After this measurement, a n IV catheter will again be placed and 
a standard 2h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) will be performed with serum glucose and insulin 
measurements as described above. At the baseline blood draw of the OGTT, blood samples will be 
collected for assessment of kidney function, liver function, HbA1c, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_443001]. After completion of the OGTT, the study has completed and subjects will return the activity tracker. 
Summary of procedures during Joslin Visit 7: - Laboratory studies  
- Resting metabolic rate (RMR ) measurement 
- Body composition analysis  
- Oral glucose tolerance test 
 
MIT Exercise Training Program.  Subjects will participate in a supervised aerobic Moderate Intensity Training (MIT) program for 10 weeks.  Based on the true VO
2 peak obtained during Joslin visit 3, a 
target heart rate range [heart rate with range of about 10 beats per minute] will be calculated, that 
corresponds with 70-75% of VO 2 peak  using the heart rate reserve formula. This will be used as a 
target heart rate for the aerobic portion of participants’ exercise regimen during the subsequent training period of [ADDRESS_563342].  Subjects will exercise on a treadmill  or other aerobic equipment.  Initially, subjects will 
exercise 20-30min per day (as tolerated) at approximately 40-50% VO
2peak 3 days per week.  The 
duration, intensity and frequency of exercise will gradually increase with the goal to reach 45-60min of exercise per day, 4 times per week by [CONTACT_5875] 4, at an intensity of approximately  70-75% of VO
2peak 
based on target heart rate determined by [CONTACT_443012] 2peak testing. Participants will be wearing the 
wearable activity trackers and heart rate monitors and will be reminded how to use them.  For this MIT 
Exercise Training Program, from the start of the study, subjects will be encouraged to complete up to 

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #: 2016-33 
Date:  7/8/[ADDRESS_563343], to target 70-75% of VO [ADDRESS_563344]’s diabetes regimen can be made as needed.  Participants will be reimbursed for parking if they decide to exercise at Joslin, up to four times per week. Participants will be instructed to log their 
physical activity on their wearable activity trackers and exercise logs will be monitored remotely . 
Participants may be contact[CONTACT_443013] a decrease in activity is noted. The staff at Joslin Diabetes Center is highly trained to work  with type [ADDRESS_563345] 120 mg/dL before 
beginning exercise. For patients on oral medications alone, blood glucose must be at least 90 mg/dL 
before beginning exercise. Patients will be given juice and a snack to help raise blood glucose if it is 
below the required value, and study staff will re -check patients’  blood sugar every [ADDRESS_563346] will also explain 1) ways to gauge appropriate 
exercise intensity, 2) the importance of hydration, and 3) the need to report symptoms of hypotension to their clinician or study physician. During exercise, participants will rate exercise intensity using B org 
Ratings of Perceived Exertion. 
HIT Exercise Training Pr
ogram.  Ten lean subjects will be randomized to a high-intensity interval 
(HIT) training program, which will be outlined to the subjects.  The total number of HI efforts each session will increase over the 10-week training period. For the initial two interval sessions, HIT training 
will consist of 4 x 30s all -out cycling efforts (HI) with 4min of recovery (LI; 15-25% PPO) between HI 
efforts.  For the 3rd and 4th training sessions, [ADDRESS_563347] will perform 6 x 30s HI efforts.  Each exercise bout will start with 5 sec of acceleration with light resistance to the maximal cadence followed by a sudden increase in resistance (starting at 100% of peak power output from VO2 assessment and adjusted as necessary) and 
continued with maximal effort cycling for 30s.  The HIT Exercise Training Program will be performed at 
Joslin three times/week without an ‘at home’ component. If illness or travel prevents attending any of the required exercise sessions, the missed time will be made up at the latter half of the 10-week period. 
For both the MIT and HIT exerc
ise training program, subjects  may perform the exercise training session at 
Joslin both during normal business hours (8am -5pm) and outside normal business hours in coordination 
with the exercise physiologist. O utside regular business hours, emergency medical assistance at Joslin 
may not be readily available and subjects  may need to proceed to the ER in case medical assistance is 
needed.  
Activity Assessments:  To confirm that participants are sedentary  pre-intervention, we will assess their 
physical activity by [CONTACT_443014] 1. Participants will 
be considered sedentary according to the most current guidelines  of the American College of Sports 

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #: 2016-33 
Date:  7/8/2020 
Medicine if they meet the following criteria: sedentary lifestyle is defined as  not participating in at least 
30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity (estimated at 40-60% VO 2 reserve ) on at least three 
days of the week for at least 3 months  (9). Self-reported data regarding their level of activity from the 
pre-screening will be used to determine eligibility. 
VO 2 Peak T esting: At Joslin Visit [ADDRESS_563348] a resting electrocardiogram ( ECG ) performed by [CONTACT_443015], unless this has already been obtained during Visit 2, in which case a repeat resting ECG would not be needed. During the VO
[ADDRESS_563349], rating of perceived exertion, 
and heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored. The American Heart Association’s  
Contraindications for the VO 2 testing (10) are also exclusion criteria for the study (see Appendix). 
We will use a ParvoMedics Metabolic Measuring system  (http://www.parvo.com/trueone-2400/), 
which also monitors heart rate. Participants will be also be monitored with an electrocardiogram and blood pressure cuff every 2 minutes. Participants will rate exercise intensity using Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion every 2 minutes during the assessment (see Appendix for Borg scale). 
Prior to VO
[ADDRESS_563350] 
130 mg/dL before beginning exercise. For participants on oral medications alone, blood glucose must be at least 100 mg/dL before beginning exercise. These criteria have been used in Why  WAIT and are 
more conservative than those recommended by [CONTACT_25986] (9). Participants will be given juice and a snack to help raise blood glucose if it is below the required value, and study staff will re-check participants’ blood sugar every 15 minutes until it is above the required 
value. 
We will utilize a cycle ramp style protocol, which has been used extensively in at-risk 
populations. The procedure involves monitoring inhaled and exhaled oxygen concentration using a face mask while steadily increasing speed and grade on a treadmill every 2 minutes (see Appendix for 
modified Bruce protocol). The modified Bruce protocol is identical to the Bruce protocol but it starts at a lower intensity and increases intensity more gradually, so it is better suited for sedentary individuals. 
VO
2 testing will terminate upon volitional exhaustion or if any of the criteria described in the American 
College of Sports Medicine’s (9) indications for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_443002], including the 
following:  
1)drop in blood press
ure of ≥10 mmHg from baseline blood pressure despi[INVESTIGATOR_443003], when accompanied by [CONTACT_443016];
2)moderate to severe angina;
3)increasing nervous system symptoms (e.g. ataxia, dizziness, or near syncope);
4)signs of poor perfusion (cyanosis or pallor);
5)technical difficulties monitoring the ECG or systolic blood pressure;
6)subject’s desire to stop;
7)sustained ventricular tachycardia;
8)ST elevation (≥1.0 mm) in leads without diagnostic Q -waves (other than V 1 or aVR).

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #: 2016-33 
Date:  7/8/[ADDRESS_563351] will be 
stopped. The participant will be assessed by [CONTACT_5989]; a history and physical examination 
will be performed and a 12-lead ECG will be obtained. Depending on the clinical situation, the participant will be either referred to the emergency room, and/or the participant’s primary care physician 
will be notified. The study physician will be present during the VO
2 peak testing.  
 At the fifth week, adherence to the exercise training regimen will be measured by [CONTACT_443017]. Also, data from the wearable activity trackers will be monitored throughout the study period through an online account, which will be set up at the time the wearable activity tracker will be 
provided (Joslin Visit 2). Participants will be contact[CONTACT_443018] 
a decrease in the logged exercise activity.  
Adipose tissue biopsies 
Participants will undergo a subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy procedure during Joslin Visit 2 and Visit 6 . For this procedure, participants will be properly positioned on an examination table. Prior to the 
biopsy a resting ECG  (only during Visit 2, not Visit 6) will be obtained to ensure that there are no rhythm 
abnormalities or ST-T segment changes. The peri -umbilical area will be disinfected with betadine. 
Subsequently, the area will be anesthetized with a 1% lidocaine injection without epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]. As needed, EMLA crème may be applied prior to the start of the procedure, but this will be cleaned at the time of disinfecti on. Up to 5-10ml of 1% lidocaine may be used to ensure proper analgesia. After the 
peri-umbilical area has been disinfected and anesthetized, subsequently, a subcutaneous adipose 
tissue biopsy will be obtained with the Coleman Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_443004] 60cc Monoject Toomey and B -D Luer lock syringe. The needle will slowly be inserted 
into the subcutaneous adipose tissue at a 45 degree angle. If needed, an incision of a few millimeters 
may be made with a #11 blade. The needle will then be inserted and kept at a <[ADDRESS_563352] pi[INVESTIGATOR_443005]. This will then be sent to the histology core at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC ) for analysis.  Samples will be 
prepared for H&E staining and up to 10 slides per sample will be prepared for immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry will be performed to evaluate for markers of white adipose tissue browning. The remainder of the obtained adipose tissue will be processed by [CONTACT_443019]. The sample will then be prepared for mRNA and protein analysis.  
Gene expressi
on changes : In order better understand the effects of exercise training on subjects, we 
propose future investigation of changes in individual genes at the mRNA level by [CONTACT_443020]. The Joslin Diabetes Center’s Genetics Core has been successful in performing these analyses on human subcutaneous adipose tissue. We would ask subjects consent to store the remainder of the subcutaneous adipose tissue and blood for further genetics testing, once consent has 
been obtained. Subjects may also opt out for this part of the study. No extra procedure will be involved.

5.POSSIBLE BENEFITS:
The overall risks to subjects for this study are minimal, and the scientific information to be gathered 
may be of considerable importance. There is currently very little information regarding the effects of exercise training on adipose tissue browning in subjects  with obesity  and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, 
the effects of exercise training on novel adipokines are  also unknown. Understanding novel 
mechanisms that improve glucose homeostasis in obesity and type 2 diabetes is essential  given the 
increasing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes and these adipokines may lead to novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_443006] 2 diabetes. Therefore, the benefits of this study appear to outweigh the risks by a considerable degree. 

Form Revised March 2003   CHS #: 2016-33 
  Date:  7/8/2020 
6. POSSIBLE RISKS:  
 
Risks Associated with Exercise:  There are risks associated with the exercise intervention. Although 
all participants will be carefully screened and cleared for exercise, there is still a remote possibility of 
adverse events such as  abnormal blood pressure, fainting, dizziness, arrhythmia, and in very rare 
instances heart attack or stroke. There also exists the risk of bodily injury including injuries to muscles, 
ligaments, tendons, and joints. To minimize the risk of an adverse event, all participants will be pre-screened by a physician prior to participation. All participants must be cleared for exercise before they 
begin the intervention. Further, an assessment of physical fitness will be performed upon study enrollment, and the exercise intervention will be tailored to each participant’s fitness level. Partici pants 
will exercise to percentages of heart rate reserve that are proven to be safe. In case of an emergency, arrangements for further emergent care will be made. Another risk associated with exercise is the risk of hypogly cemia. During sessions at the Jos lin Diabetes Center, blood glucose measurements will be 
taken to prevent hypoglycemia. Prior to each exercise session, participants will be asked to check their  
blood sugar with a finger stick to ensure that it is at a safe level for exercise. For patients  on insulin or 
insulin combined with oral medications, blood glucose must be at least 110 mg/dL before beginning 
exercise. For patients on oral medications alone, blood glucose must be at least 90 mg/dL before 
beginning exercise. For the VO
2peak testing, higher blood glucose targets of 130 mg/dl and 110mg/dl 
respectively will be used. Patients will be given juice and a snack to help raise blood glucose if it is 
below the required value, and study staff will re -check patients’  blood sugar every 15 minutes until it is 
above the required value. 
 
Risks Associated with VO 2 peak testing: It is possible that this test could cause heart abnormalities 
(such  as irregularities of the heartbeat, lack of oxygen to the heart), dizziness or weakness. Every effort 
will be made to minimize these risks. Participants will be pre-screened for evidence of heart disease 
prior to study enrollment. They will also undergo a complete history and examination by [CONTACT_443024], as well as an ECG before the treadmill test. If any abnormalities are detected that 
would put participants at risk during the treadmill test, they  will not be allowed to perform the test or 
participate in the study. During this test, if participants experience 1) any uncomfortable symptoms, 2) 
abnormalities on the ECG monitor suggesting that a heart abnormality is occurring, or 3) significant changes in  blood pressure, the test will be stopped immediately and the information will be sent to the participant’s  physician (see addendum and above for a list of contraindications to VO
2 testing). A 
physician will be present in the fitness room during this procedure. Essential equipment and medical 
supplies are immediately available if there are any unexpected problems.  The treadmill test will be 
performed with standardized methods  and will be monitored by [CONTACT_201273]. This exercise test 
may cause muscle soreness for 2-3 days. The risks of carefully monitored exercise tests are very low, 
but do rarely include non-fatal complications requiring immediate medical treatment (in less than 1 out 
of 10,000 tests), abnormal heartbeats requiring immediate treatment (rare, less than 1 out of 30,000 tests), or death (in less than 1 out of 150,000 tests). 
  
Risks of Use of Glucose: The major risk of infusing glucose is hyperglycemia. The participant may 
feel thirsty. The participant should be able to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_443007] g lucose they are given in this study  
during the oral glucose tolerance test.  
 
Risks Associated with Blood Draws and Intravenous Catheterizat ion: The total amount of blood 
drawn during the study is  approximately 450 ml (or 30 tbs.). This  is about less than the amount that is 
taken when blood is donated and should not pose any risk. Participants  will be asked not to donate 
blood for at least [ADDRESS_563359] occurred in about 1-2% of the participants  studied and resolve with local

Date:  7/8/[ADDRESS_563360] not resolved within 2 days after the application of heat, the 
participant will be instructed to return to the clinic for evaluation and further treatment as indicated. 
Risks Associated with Adipose Tissue Biopsies:   During the study, adipose tissue biopsies will be 
obtained. Participants may experience mild pain, swelling, soreness  or bruising after the procedure. 
Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine will be used. Participants may take acetaminophen after the 
procedure if required. There is a potential risk for infection. In order to avoid this, sterile procedures will 
be used. The area will be cleaned with betadine and sterile gloves and needles will be used. A small hematoma can collect under the skin where the needle was inserted. In order to minimize this, the 
periumbilical area will be selected and any areas with visible veins will be avoided. Also, pressure will be applied after the procedure.  
Risks of DXA Exam :
 The DXA exam uses a small amount of X -ray radiation, so there is a very slight 
risk of radiation exposure. The radiation exposure is comparable to what a participant would get if he/she were in the sunshine for 3 hours or if he/she took a flight from [LOCATION_004] to [LOCATION_001]. 
7.CONSENT PROCEDURES:
Joslin patients w
ill be contact[CONTACT_443025] a telephone call from a study 
research assistant. If they are interested, they will be asked to come in to the Joslin for a more complete explanation of this study at which time, written informed consent will be obtained. The study risks and benefits will be explained as will each of the study procedures . Patients answering an ad will 
be screened by [CONTACT_443026]. 
A detailed descri
ption of the consent procedures appear below: 
Written informed cons
ent will be obtained from each subject at entry into the study. Informed consent is 
obtained by [CONTACT_38733]: 
•Subject reviews the study consent form.
•PI [INVESTIGATOR_5768] -investigators meet with the subject to review the consent form, confirm subject’s
understanding, and answer questions
•Once the investigator or co-investigator is convinced that the subject verbally demonstrates
understanding and agrees to the process, the consent form is signed in the presence of awitness. Individuals authorized to obtain written consent are the principal investigator, co-inves tigators, and assigned research staff specifically designated by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_443008].
8.RECRUITMENT / SOURCE OF SUBJECTS:
Current Josli
n patients who meet study criteria may be contact[CONTACT_443027], and flyers will  also b e 
placed around the Longwood Medical Area neighborhood and inside the Joslin  Diabetes Center. To 
recruit non-Joslin patients and participants  without diabetes , the use of online social media and job 
recruitment websites (i.e. Facebook, Craigslist, university job websites, etc.)  will help identify potential 
participants. Additionally, we will be using the company Trialfacts to help recruit participants  for the 
study, which uses recruitment websites including Facebook,  Instagram and targeted ads on websites.  
The website for [LOCATION_011] University’s online job application can be found here:

Form Revised March 2003 CHS #: 2016-33 
Date:  7/8/[ADDRESS_563361] regarding the study will also be 
placed at appropriate and approved buildings and academic institutions around the Longwood Medical Area. Examples of these buildings would include: Karp Research Building at [LOCATION_011] Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Simmons University, and the Longwood Galleria. I f these methods do not identify enough 
potential participants , an ad will be placed in a local newspaper. Some eligible participants have 
already been identified by [CONTACT_443028]. 
We will enr
oll 38 lean participants, 28 overweight/obese participants  and [ADDRESS_563362] 85% and 95% retention rates, respectively. Since the intervention is relatively short, the retention 
should be quite high. To further encourage retention, we will compensate participants  for their time 
spent attending assessment appointments and exercising, and they will receive the exercise program free of charge. We will also provide participants  with parking in the Harvard/Longwood Medical area. 
Patients wil
l be recruited through referrals from the Joslin Clinic and other Harvard-affiliated clinical 
practices in the [LOCATION_011] Metropolitan area, advertisements in the Joslin Newsletter and newsletters of the Diabetes Associations of [LOCATION_005], Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, extensive mailings to Joslin mailing lists, and advertisements in local newspapers. No demographic group will be intentionally 
excluded and minorities will be encouraged to apply. Given the gender breakdown of the Joslin 
Diabetes Center, we anticipate that about 50% of the sample will be women. Approximately 60% of the 22,000+ patients treated at the Joslin Clinic have type 2 diabetes . 
9.RIGHTS AND PRIVACY:
In addition to the procedures
 for protecting and minimizing potential risk, we will maintain the 
confidentiality of all the participants  by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_443009], stored in locked facilities at the Joslin 
Diabetes Center’s Integrative Physiology and Metabolism  laboratory . Data will be maintained using an 
ID number only. Subject names and ID numbers will be kept separately. The key to subject names and 
ID numbers will also be kept in a different locked area of the laboratory  to limit access to information 
about specific participants . Deidentified participant data may b e shared with other researchers , after 
permission of local institutional review  boards, and without disclosure of protected health information.

10. OMIT PROCEDURES / LEAVE STUDY:
At any time, subj
ects will be free t o leave the study. If during the study course they decide to 
omit particular procedures, they will be free to leave the study without bias to their clinical care or any 
information about their own study results. 
11. INCENTIVES / REMUNERATION:
Joslin Vis
its 1-7 will take about 4-5 hours each to complete (including history and physical, oral glucose 
tolerance test, blood wor k and VO 2 peak testing). The exercise training visits will take about 60 minutes  
to complete. Participants will be compensated as follows: 
Parking will be provided on the days the participants visit the Joslin for the study (exercise visits included).     If participants complete Joslin Visit 1, they will be compensated $100. If participants complete Joslin Visit 2, they will be compensated $80. Starting at Joslin Visit 3, participants will be compensated by $20 for each week of the exercise intervention they complete by [CONTACT_443029]. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who complete Joslin Visit 3b will be compensated $50. Subjects who undergo an additional adipose tissue biopsy will be compensated $80 per visit. If participants complete the Joslin Visit 7 , they will be compensated $80. 
Additionally, if they complete the study  with at least 90% participation in the described exercise training 
sessions , participants will be compensated an additional $120.  
The total compensation for this study will be a maximum of $580 (or $630 for subjects with type 2 
diabetes  and up to $[ADDRESS_563364]). Participants will  receive a check in 
the mail 4-[ADDRESS_563365] for 
free, which can serve as an incentive to complete the study.   
Since this s
tudy involves complex procedures and equipment, there may be unforeseen findings, which 
could make participants  ineligible to continue with the study, in which case  they  will be compensated 
as follows: If it is determined that they  are not eligible for the study after completing Joslin Visit 1, they 
will be compensated $20. Subjects will not be separately compensated for the time spent completing 
the exercise training v isits.

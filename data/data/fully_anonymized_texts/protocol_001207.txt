Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261383] the potential to increase length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217793].  Moreover, otolaryngol ogy patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain  control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications wor king synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is  a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminate d by 
[CONTACT_217827].  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since [ADDRESS_261384] examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261385] been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology pat ients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be [ADDRESS_261386] -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, [ADDRESS_261387]-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the  research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic requirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and parti cipant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology  patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngolo gy head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he 
duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217794] 4 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261388] operative care will not be 
limited by [CONTACT_217828] y, meaning that they will not be den ied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts e quivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usua l hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829] .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately [ADDRESS_261389] op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in cas e of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/ 10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_217829].  They will not have a ny 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study plac ed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least  initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s stud y participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_217795] 6

 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed [ADDRESS_261390] completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive  the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at [ADDRESS_261391] not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investig ational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the [ADDRESS_261392]’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
[CONTACT_217830] a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The s cale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study  ID and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/[ADDRESS_261393] rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfa ction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS s urveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?

2. How often did the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217796]?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usuall y 
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as a n ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to [ADDRESS_261394] “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by [CONTACT_217831] “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you  swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VA S scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment qu estionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effec tive 
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant

3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217797].  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medi cation side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.

 Subjects undergoing definitive mucosal head and neck resection including oral cavity, 
oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx  
 At least 1 night of planned inpatient stay  
4.2 Exclusion Crit eria 
 Incapable of giving informed consent  
 Age < 18  
 GFR < 30 
 Allergy to gabapentin   
 Baseline  gabapentin or lyrica use 
 Chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_217799] [ADDRESS_261397] Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited  either in the outpatient head and neck cl inic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by [CONTACT_217832] .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by [CONTACT_217833].  Patient recruited by [CONTACT_217834] a subsequent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private set ting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to  the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  Whe n and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their par ticipation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by [CONTACT_217835].  All withdraws will be reviewed by [CONTACT_217836].  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The  withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by [CONTACT_423], and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.[ADDRESS_261398] withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason d ropped out of the study before completion, whether by [CONTACT_217837] 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does  not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
[ADDRESS_261399] dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the eveni ng (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD [ADDRESS_261400] extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet) .

greater than  5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or le ss than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated a s needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will  be used for the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject 
name [CONTACT_217878].  The pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261403]’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.[ADDRESS_261404] containers in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217800].  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or i n the preop holding unit.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
The study procedures are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent.  
 Pre-treatment questionnaire . 
 Randomization group will be assigned by [CONTACT_941] s tudy data manager after she is notified of subject 
agreement to participate.  
Day of Surgery  
 One dose of study drug will be administered preoperatively  according to subject’s randomization 
group  approximately [ADDRESS_261405] an order in 
the chart that allows the participant to take the preop medication dose, and the RN to chart this 
dose as a study medication.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 12 
Version: 1. 6 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  Stand ard pain medications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be used as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies or intolerances. These will be up -titrated as needed per discretion 
of service residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be  obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  postoperatively  regardless of extubation 
time.  
 One postoperative dose  of study drug  and VAS will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of whi ch will be  prior to drug administrations.  
 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomization  groups . 
POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be conducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
[ADDRESS_261406] population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_261407] for categorical variables will b e 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
Note that in discrepancies of data between reports, such as pack years smoked by a patient, an average 
of the reported amounts will be used to en sure consistency between data reporting fluctuations.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261408] Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Event s 
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been ca used by [CONTACT_9156])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness  or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries that occur during the study period will be 
regarded as adverse events  (meaning that the event does not necessar ily have to be likely rel ated to the 
study drug to be considered an adverse event).  However, not all adverse events will meet criteria for 
reporting .  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures will be reported as  adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  (see definition below)  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  that are considered significant and likely related to 
study participation  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considere d by [CONTACT_217838] , moderate or mild.  .  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in per sistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observatio n or medical treatment.  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261409] information for the study 
member that is in charge of adverse even t follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_217839], adverse events or side effects experienced  after 
discharge so that the study members can be alerted to any events that may be related t o the medication. 
Any severe adverse events  or moderate events thought likely to be related to the study medication  that 
are reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217801] 30 day window will be recorded .    Adverse events that occur during the 
inpatient study period and a re significant/severe as defined above or that are unusual will be required to

Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by  [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or  the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study  in the [ADDRESS_261410] data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study d ocuments within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] a [ADDRESS_261411] document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.

Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261424] the potential to increase length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217793].  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful  and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical  for patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain co ntrol, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often u sed in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is  structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional im plication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
[CONTACT_217844] a lteration.  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since [ADDRESS_261425] examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261426] been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be [ADDRESS_261427] -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, [ADDRESS_261428]-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on  decreasing narcotic requirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during  their preoperative visit s.  T he 
duration of subject participation include s the subsequent inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217794] 4 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261429] operative care will not be 
limited by [CONTACT_217828] y, meaning that they will not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodo ne medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829] .  A study team m ember will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately [ADDRESS_261430] op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less t han or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team me mber will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_217829].  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medication s simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after  extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication p rotocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restriction s on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remai n in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_217795] 6

 tabulation/data anaylsis of th e pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed [ADDRESS_261431] completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  O therwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at [ADDRESS_261432] not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivere d the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the [ADDRESS_261433]’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
[CONTACT_217830] a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measure s 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subject s will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/[ADDRESS_261434] rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondar y endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captu red in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attac hed “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?

3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the su m of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to [ADDRESS_261435] “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by [CONTACT_217831] “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “n o pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be ave raged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the foll owing questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how  has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant

3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of the se questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217797].

choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their  subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subje cts may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be with drawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery  will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be request ed either by [CONTACT_217835].  All withdraws will be reviewed by [CONTACT_217836].  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immedia tely when deemed necessary or when desired by [CONTACT_423], and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.[ADDRESS_261439] withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before compl etion, whether by [CONTACT_217837] 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
[ADDRESS_261440] dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD [ADDRESS_261441] extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).

procedure.  Formal training for all study team members who will be administering the study drug or 
obtaining the VA S pain scores is required prior to subject interaction . 
5.[ADDRESS_261443] postoperative narc otic medications made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.2 5-0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetami nophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pai n greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used for the pre -operative  dose,  and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name [CONTACT_217878].  The p harmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261444]’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.[ADDRESS_261445] containers in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217800].  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop holding unit.  
 
6 Study Pr ocedures  
The study procedures are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent.  
 Pre-treatment questionnaire . 
 Randomization group will be assigned by [CONTACT_217846].  
Day of Surgery  
 One dose of study drug will be administered preoperatively  according to subject’s randomization 
group  approximately [ADDRESS_261446] an order in 
the chart that allows the participant to take the preop medication dose, and the RN to chart this 
dose as a study medication.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 12 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  Standard pain medications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be used as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies or intolerances. These will be up -titrated as needed per discretion 
of service residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  posto peratively  regardless of extubation 
time.  
 One postoperative dose  of study drug  and VAS will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of which will be  prior to drug administrat ions.  
 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomization  groups . 
POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
[ADDRESS_261447] population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in av erage morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_261448] for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of ch aracteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
Note that in discrepancies of data between reports, such as pack years smoked by a patient, an average 
of the reported amounts will be used to ensure consistency between data report ing fluctuations.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to pla cebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261449] Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol-compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle inve stigator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_217847] t he research)  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or wors ens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries that occur during the study period will be 
regarded as adverse events  (meaning that the event does not necessary have to be likely related to the 
study drug to be considere d an adverse event).  However, not all adverse events will meet criteria for 
reporting .  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures will be reported as  adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  (see definition below)  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  that are considered significant and likely related to 
study participation  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_217848] l significance  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious , moderate or mild.  .  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or i ncapacity  
 a new congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treatment.  
 
 
Adverse  Event Reporting  
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261450] 
information for the study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Mel anie Townsend, PI).  
They will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_217839], adverse events or side 
effects experienced  after discharge so that the study members can be alerted to any events that may be 
related to the medication . Any severe adverse events  or moderate events thought likely to be related to 
the study medication  that are reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217801] 30 day window will be recorded .    Adverse 
events that occur during the inpatient study period and are significant/s evere as defined above or that are 
unusual will be required to be reported in the adverse events log. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217811].  Events that are mild will not be required to be recorded in the 
adverse ev ents log.  Events that are moderate and thought likely related to the study medication will be 
reported.  Events that are moderate but deemed unlikely to be due to the study medication will not be 
required to be reported in the adverse events log.  However , these events may still be recorded in the 
adverse events log at the discretion of the PI.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217812].  
 
For all severe AE or AE that are unexpected and thought likely related to the study medication , an IRB 
event form will be submitted. For  moderate events  thought likely to be due to the medication or 
unexpected , an event form will be submitted at at the discretion of the PI . This design is intended to make 
sure that if subjects s eem to be having symptoms that aren’t expected to be caused by [CONTACT_217849], then this gets reported.  However, those side effects that are common 
after surgery (such as sedation or nausea) that could also be relat ed to study medications are noted in 
the AE log when appropriate but not generating multiple IRB reportable event forms.  The goal is to 
ensure subject safety and also only report appropriate events to the IRB.  All adverse events, whether 
mild, moderate o r severe, will be reviewed at the safety meeting by [CONTACT_217850].   
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_217851], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believe s might reasonably be related to participation in this study  in the [ADDRESS_261451] data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding  that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] a [ADDRESS_261452] document the  
event.  Sub jects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_217804] d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience sign ificant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be c onducted at 25%  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_28668] 
50% enrollment  by [CONTACT_217841].  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133605].  This safety 
monitoring will include  careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of t he number and type of serious 
adverse events.    A safety meeting will be held half way through enrollment as described above,  
[ADDRESS_261453] of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS  pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for [ADDRESS_261454] by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all advers e events and data collection forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217813].   At our interim safety meeting, we determined by [CONTACT_217852]. We determined at that time that a third party officer review 
was unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that we were aware at that point that an audit would occur.  
We will proceed  to study completion without this third party review.  We also will be reporting our study 
events and AE events in a DSM log to the Siteman monitoring committee , which will also serve as a third 
party review.

Version:  1.[ADDRESS_261463] the potential to increase length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217793].  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitati ng 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic m edication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regim ens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
[CONTACT_217827].  Dose adjustments  are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since [ADDRESS_261464]  examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version:  1.[ADDRESS_261465] been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , whic h is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be [ADDRESS_261466] -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, [ADDRESS_261467]-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quali ty improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benefit of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic require ments for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head and neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Des ign 
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an a llergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829] .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately [ADDRESS_261469] op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg i f greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pai n (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropri ate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_217829].  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are in volved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject  had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that a re needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their

 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed [ADDRESS_261470] completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be  skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at [ADDRESS_261471] not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a p roperly labeled container to 
the [ADDRESS_261472]’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallo wing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
[CONTACT_217830] a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked  “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/[ADDRESS_261473] rage daily narcotic

3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered  at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  question naire”):

3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assi gned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to [ADDRESS_261474] “mark on the line the point that 
you feel repr esent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by [CONTACT_217831] “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “ma rk the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extr eme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the pas t, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance bee n? 
0) Very poor

3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reporte d separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217797].  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated  with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.

4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from th e study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated  or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding  tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by [CONTACT_217835].  All withdraws will be reviewed by [CONTACT_217836].  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary o r when desired by [CONTACT_423], and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.[ADDRESS_261478] withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before completion, whether by [CONTACT_217837] 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
[ADDRESS_261479] dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to  receive the second POD [ADDRESS_261480] extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).

obtaining the VAS pain scores is required pr ior to subject interaction . 
5.[ADDRESS_261482] postoperative narc otic medications made available:  
 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough  pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain i n non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough  pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get  15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patien t’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used for the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single cap sules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name [CONTACT_217878].  The pharmacy will be made aware o f all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at

Version:  1.[ADDRESS_261483]’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.[ADDRESS_261484] containers in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217800].  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop holding unit.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
The study procedure s are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent.  
 Pre-treatment questionnaire . 
 Randomization group will be assigned by [CONTACT_217854].  
Day of Surgery  
 One dose of study drug will be administered preoperatively  according to subject’s randomization 
group  approximately [ADDRESS_261485] an order in 
the chart that allows the participant to take the preop medication dose, and the RN to chart this 
dose as a study medication.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 12 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  Standard pain medications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be u sed as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies or intolerances. These will be up -titrated as needed per discretion 
of service residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  postoperatively  regardless of ext ubation 
time.  
 One postoperative dose  of study drug  and VAS will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of which will be  prior to drug administrations.  
 BID study drug adminis tration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomization  groups . 
POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
[ADDRESS_261486] population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_261487] for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatm ent groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
Note that in discrepancies of data between reports, such as pack years smoked by a patient, an average 
of the reported amounts will be used to ensure consistency between data reporting fluctuations.  
 
The prim ary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes  of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version:  1.[ADDRESS_261488] Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who r eceived all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators broc hure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
 Suggests that t he research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the c ourse of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries that occur during the study period will be 
regarded as adverse events  (meaning that the event does not necessary have to be likely related to the 
study drug to be considered an adverse event).  Howeve r, not all adverse events will meet criteria for 
reporting .  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures will be reported as  adverse events if the 
abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  (see definition below)  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  that are considered significant and likely related to 
study participation  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_217855] , moderate or mild.  .  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anoma ly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treatment.  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version:  1.[ADDRESS_261489] 
information for the study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  
They will b e instructed to contact [CONTACT_217839], adverse events or side 
effects experienced  after discharge so that the study members can be alerted to any events that may be 
related to the medication. Any severe adverse events  or m oderate events thought likely to be related to 
the study medication  that are reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_217801] 30 day window will be recorded .    Adverse 
events that occur during the inpatient study period and are significant/severe as defined above or that a re 
unusual will be required to be reported in the adverse events log. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217811].  Events that are mild will not be required to be recorded in the 
adverse events log.  Events that are moder ate and thought likely related to the study medication will be 
reported.  Events that are moderate but deemed unlikely to be due to the study medication will not be 
required to be reported in the adverse events log.  However, t hese events may still be reco rded in the 
adverse events log at the discretion of the PI.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_217812].  
 
For all severe AE or AE that are unexpected and thought likely related to the study medicaiton , an IRB 
event form will be submitted. For  moderate events  thought likely to be due to the medication or 
unexpected , an event form will be submitted at at the discretion of the PI . This design is intended to make 
sure that if subjects seem to be having symptoms that aren’t expected to be caused by [CONTACT_217849], then this gets reported.  However, those side effects that are common 
after surgery (such as sedation or nausea) that could also be related to study medications are not ed in 
the AE log when appropriate but not generating multiple IRB reportable event forms.  The goal is to 
ensure subject safety and also only report appropriate events to the IRB.  All adverse events, whether 
mild, moderate or severe, will be reviewed at t he safety meeting by [CONTACT_217850].   
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to f ollow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related t o participation in this study  in the [ADDRESS_261490] data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] a [ADDRESS_261491] document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 15 
Version:  1.1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_217804] d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defin ed above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25%  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_28668] 
50% enrollment  by [CONTACT_217841].  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133605].  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropr iate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.    A safety meeting will be held half way through enrollment as described above,  
[ADDRESS_261492] of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse eve nt reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for [ADDRESS_261493] by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection fo rms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217813].  A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by [CONTACT_15365].  At our interim safety meeting, 
we determined by [CONTACT_217856]. We 
determined at that time that a third party officer review wa s unnecessary, especially in light of the fact that 
we were aware at that point that an audit would occur.  We will proceed to study completion without this 
third party review.  We also will be reporting our study events and AE events in a DSM log to the S iteman 
monitoring committee , which will also serve as a third party review.

Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261502] the potential to increase length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217793].  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased ri sk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effec ts8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pai n.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric aci d), without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unkn own in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
[CONTACT_217827].  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL /min.  It is FDA approved since [ADDRESS_261503] examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261504] been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgica l pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be [ADDRESS_261505] -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, [ADDRESS_261506]-operative swallow evaluation will be  observational,  based 
solely on the discretion of the surgeon  and is not required per the research protocol .  
2 Study Objectives  
This investigation is a quality improvement initiative designed to elucidate the benef it of g abapentin in 
pain management in subjects undergoing surgical resection of head and neck mucosal surfaces . 
 
Primary Objective  
To assess the efficacy of gabapentin on decreasing narcotic requirements for treatment of acute 
postoperative pain in head a nd neck patients undergoing surgical resection of mucosal surfaces.  
 
Secondary Objective s 
To assess subjective pain scores and participant satisfaction with pain control.  
 
  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, plac ebo-controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the o ral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he 
duration of subject participation include s the subse quent inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217794] 4 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261507] operative care will not be 
limited by [CONTACT_217828] y, meaning that they will not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic 
pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  Written informed consent will be o btained prior to the 
start of research related procedures.

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829] .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately [ADDRESS_261508] op care.  The se orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PR N breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater  than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject w ill be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_217829].  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn fro m the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administ ering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperati ve pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restriction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinic al stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_217795] 6

 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed [ADDRESS_261509] completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at [ADDRESS_261510] not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the [ADDRESS_261511]’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
[CONTACT_217857] a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far ri ght.  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of  their 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessibl e only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/[ADDRESS_261512] rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?

2. How often did the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217796]?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat s atisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score  of 0-3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to [ADDRESS_261513] “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  Thi s is followed by [CONTACT_217831] “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in  
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication e fficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as m orphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very toleran t

3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217816] s tay will be calculated for each subject.  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.

 Allergy to gabapentin   
 Baseline  gabapentin or lyrica use 
 Chro nic opi[INVESTIGATOR_217799] [ADDRESS_261516] Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited  either in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by [CONTACT_217832] .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by [CONTACT_217845].  Patient recruited by [CONTACT_217834] a subse quent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wi sh to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was ant icipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by [CONTACT_217859].  All withdraws will be reviewed by [CONTACT_217836].  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by [CONTACT_423], and documentation of the r eason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.[ADDRESS_261517] withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informed consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before completion, whether by [CONTACT_217837] 
(ie- staying intubated the night af ter surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.  
 
[ADDRESS_261518] dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5pm) , and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD [ADDRESS_261519] extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).

 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic pa tients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and p ain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/10 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.   
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used for the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name [CONTACT_217878].  The pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medica tions approximately 24 hours prior to administration, and will store these at

  Standard pain medications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be used as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies o r intolerances. These will be up -titrated as needed per discretion 
of service residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  postoperatively  regardless of extubation 
time.  
 One postoperative dose  of study drug  and VA S will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of which will be  prior to drug administrations.  
 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomiz ation  groups . 
POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
[ADDRESS_261525] population,  it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  A ssuming a 20% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_261526] for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the t wo treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were  unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
7.[ADDRESS_261527] Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be

Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the re search  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to addi tional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threate ning 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical  intervention such as medication for nausea, but 
that does not cause permanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable amount of time.  
 
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention . It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treatment.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events  that are deemed likely related to the study medication and 
unexpected or significant  must be reporte d will be  the period from the day of surgery  to the end of the 
study , which is POD [ADDRESS_261528] information for the study member that is in charge of adverse event foll ow up 
(Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_217839], 
adverse events or side effects experienced  after discharge so that the study members can be alerted to 
any events that may be related to the medication.  Reporting of these events via an adverse event report 
will be up to the discretion of the PI.  Subjects will be advised that the medication does not remain in the 
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261529] to report any subsequent event(s) tha t the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.[ADDRESS_261530] data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented  in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the  PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] a [ADDRESS_261531] document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_217804] d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomit ing, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25%  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_28668] 
50% enrollment  by [CONTACT_217841].  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_217818].  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Gaba Protocol   Page 15 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 Monit oring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.    A safety meeting will be held half way through enrollment as described above,  
[ADDRESS_261532] of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.   Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been ente red into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for [ADDRESS_261533] by [CONTACT_3433] e PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217813].  A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way throug h to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by [CONTACT_15365].

Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261541] the potential to increase length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217793].  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debil itating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfacti on and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narco tic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related t o the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mecha nism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is [ADDRESS_261542] ments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since [ADDRESS_261543] examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261544] been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be [ADDRESS_261545] -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, [ADDRESS_261546] -operative swallow function if assessed.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study su bjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he

**Note that IV and PO or per tube  morphine will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829] .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately [ADDRESS_261548] op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepati c insufficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equ al to 5/10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).  Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_217861] g physicians.  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is  at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain mana gement options in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without re striction based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer , and their 
PACU medication sheet will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_217795] 6

 tabulation/data anaylsis of the pain meds they required  The VAS score obtained after surgery  will be 
completed [ADDRESS_261549] completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next day.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at [ADDRESS_261550] not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the [ADDRESS_261551]’ s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
[CONTACT_217830] a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a  ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey wil l be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/[ADDRESS_261552] dose of pain medication on POD 2, or the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner, will be calculated . Total amount of narcotic use  in morphine equivalents  will b e divided by 
[CONTACT_217862][INVESTIGATOR_059] , multiplied by 24 hours, to obtain the av erage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] , and (e) potential side effects o f the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey question s will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?

2. How often did the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217820] h your  pain?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisf action.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to [ADDRESS_261553] “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is followed by [CONTACT_217831] “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represe nts (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centimeters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.   
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant

3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217797].

Subjects  will be recruit ed either in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by [CONTACT_217832] .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by [CONTACT_217863].  Patient recruited by [CONTACT_217834] a subsequent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible  subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to  decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent  process.

 4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a  feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was anticipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdr aw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by [CONTACT_217835].  All withdraws will be reviewed by [CONTACT_217836].  No subject  will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by [CONTACT_423], and documentation of the reason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.[ADDRESS_261557] withdraw: Withdraw is defined as a subject who signed the informe d consent document and for 
whatever reason dropped out of the study before completion, whether by [CONTACT_217837] 
(ie- staying intubated the night after surgery).  
 
Subject screen fail: A screen fail is defined as a subject who has been recruited to participate and 
approached but does not meet all inclusion criteria.

6 Study Procedures  
The study procedures are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent.  
 Pre-treatme nt questionnaire . 
 Randomization group will be assigned by [CONTACT_217854].  
Day of Surgery  
 One dose of study drug will be administered preoperatively  according to subject’s randomization 
group  approximately [ADDRESS_261565] an order in 
the chart that allows the participant to take the preop medication do se, and the RN to chart this 
dose as a study medication.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 12 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  Standard pain medications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be used as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies or intolerances. These will be up -titrated as needed per discretion 
of se rvice residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  postoperatively  regardless of extubation 
time.  
 One postoperative dose  of study drug  and VAS will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of which will be  prior to drug administrations.  
 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomization  groups . 
POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of  Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducted either after the  AM dose on POD 
[ADDRESS_261566] population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
difference of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_261567] for categorical variables will be  
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Line ar Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin as compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
differ ence and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
7.[ADDRESS_261568] Population(s) for Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medicat ion doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of the principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be

missed doses wi ll be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility th at the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Ev ent 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures ar e considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_217864] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
 
Mild and Moderate adverse events:  
A moderate adverse event is one that requires a medical intervention such as medication for 
nausea, but that does not cause pe rmanent clinical harm and that does resolve in a reasonable 
amount of time.  
A mild adverse event is one that causes mild clinical effect and may or may not require medical 
intervention. It is expected to resolve completely with observation or medical treat ment.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported will be  the period from the day of surgery  
to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_261569] information for the 
study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_217865], adverse events or side effects 
experienced.  
For all severe adverse events, an IRB event form will be submitted. For mild or moderate events, and 
event form will be submitted if the event is one that is likely related to the medication and is a n event that 
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261570] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.[ADDRESS_261571] data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded , the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators  must report unblinding to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] a [ADDRESS_261572] document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_217804] d prematu rely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effec ts, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25% and 50% 
enrollment to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_217821].  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitor ing).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.   A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half way 
through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by [CONTACT_11377] s study.  
Gaba Protocol   Page 15 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261573] of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will b e kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient information is normally placed .  The official 
source d ocument  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for [ADDRESS_261574] by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_217813].  A designated, thir d party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by [CONTACT_15365].

Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261582] the potential to increase length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217793].  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population is critical for  patient satisfaction and a n expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o improve pain control, decreasing  narcotic medi cation 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medication often used in multimodal pain regimens  that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the in hibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
[CONTACT_217827].  Dose adjustments ar e recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since [ADDRESS_261583] examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261584] been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing all types of head and neck mucosal surgeries , which i s an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be [ADDRESS_261585] -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, [ADDRESS_261586] -operative swallow function if assessed.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects i nclude  adult otolaryngology patients  over the age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the oral 
cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
recruited from the otolaryngology head and neck cancer clinic during their preoperative visit s.  T he

**Note that IV and PO or per tube morphin e will be used in amounts equivalent to the dilaudid and oxycodone medications 
above if an allergy or intolerance to dilaudid or oxycodone exist.  
 
Subjects will present for their planned procedures to the pre -op surgery office and will be taken to the pre -
op holding area  as per usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8829] .  A study team member will meet the subject in the pre -
op holding area  and will administer the pre -op medication approximately [ADDRESS_261588] op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours 
if the patient has hepatic insuff iciency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours PRN pain  (5mg if pain less than or 
equal to 5/10, 10mg if greater than 5/10) , and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN breakthrough pain 
(0.25mg if pain less than or equal to 5/10, 0.5mg if greater than 5/10) .  Alternatives to these medications 
in case of allergy or intolerance is 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN pain (1mg if pain less than or equal 
to 5/10, 2mg if greater than 5/10) and 7.5 -15mg PO/PT liquid IR morphine Q4 hours PRN pain (7.5mg if 
pain less than or equal to 5/ 10, 15mg if greater than 5/10).   Additionally, the study team member will 
place the appropriate investigational drug order in compass.  The subject will be able to receive increases 
in pain medications as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_217866].  They will not have any 
limitations set on pain medications simply because they are involved in the study.  The subject will then 
proceed with surgery as planned. No alterations to intraoperative medications or  anesthetic agents will be 
made based on  study participation.  
 
The subject will return to the PACU after extubation.  If the subject had to remain intubated, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study as he or she cannot complete pain scores while sedated.  Additionally, if the 
subject is at any point during the study placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, he or she will 
be withdrawn from the study.   The study team member  administering the preoperative dose will remind 
anesthesia to use the same post -operative initial pain management o ptions in the PACU at least initially, 
again with no restrictions on dose escalations that are needed .  The PAC U can increase the dose of 
postoperative pain medications based on patient need and MD approval  as per the usual PACU protocol  
without restrictio n based on a subject’s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the 
usual protocol until the  required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer .  The VAS 
score obtained after surgery  will be completed 45 minutes t o 1 hour after extubation in the PACU .  
Gaba Protocol   Page 6 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261589] completed surgery  (extubated)  by 5PM in order to receive the 7PM dose 
after their surgery.  Otherwise, this dose is to be skipped and the next dose administered will be at 7AM 
the next d ay.  VAS scores can still be obtained  at [ADDRESS_261590] not been already (ie if the patient remained an inpatient for longer 
than 2 days postop).   
The investigational pharmacist will have delivered the medication dose in a properly labeled container to 
the [ADDRESS_261591]’s status as a study patient.  VAS 
scores will be obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by 
[CONTACT_217830] a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a line 
measuring 10cm  during each phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validated tool that measures 10cm in 
size and is marked “no pain” on the far left  and “worst pain” on the far right .  The subject marks their pain 
level on the scale and the study team member  will measure with a ruler and record the resulting number 
in the study database.    
Subjects  will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into the study database .  All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only t o the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/[ADDRESS_261592] rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
patient baseline pain perceptions (d) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] , and (e) potential side effects of the 
medication.  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 2 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
0) Never

2. How often did the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217796]?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.  This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  45min to [ADDRESS_261593] “mark on the line the point that 
you feel represent s your current pain level  when you’re resting.”  This is fol lowed by [CONTACT_217831] “mark another point on the line that represents your pain level 
when you swallow.”  Lastly, the subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the 
line that represent s your pain when you  cough.”   The study team member administering the test 
will annotate what each mark represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm 
line from “no pain” on the left to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in 
centime ters from the left of the line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  
The results from all  available VAS scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the 
final analysis.   
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed from a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine,  Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone, Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant

 3. Do yo u experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.  
 
(d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217822].  
 
(e) During the VAS scores, study team members will also collect information about potential 
medication side effects, including those that are commonly associated with gabapentin or with 
narcotic medications.

oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx  
 At least 1 night of planned inpatient stay  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 Incapable of giving informed consent  
 Age < 18  
 GFR < 30 
 Allergy to gabapentin   
 Baseline  gabapentin or lyrica use 
 Chro nic opi[INVESTIGATOR_217799] [ADDRESS_261596] Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects  will be recruited  either in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries or 
over the phone after this clinic appointment by [CONTACT_217832] .  Potentially eligible 
patients will be identified by [CONTACT_217845].  Patient recruited by [CONTACT_217834] a subse quent surgical planning visit or in the pre -op holding are on the day of surgery.  
Eligible subjects will be  consented in a private setting and the study outline explained to the patient. 
Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wi sh to participate.  Patients  may 
choose to think about study participation but will need to decide and provide written consent prior to the 
day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed 
consent process.

 4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  They will also be withdrawn if they remain sedated or intubated 
after the surgery or are placed on alcohol withdrawal medication protocols, which also cause significant 
sedation.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to swallow medications after 
surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout rate was ant icipated and 
accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw on a continual basis 
throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by [CONTACT_217859].  All withdraws will be reviewed by [CONTACT_217836].  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will begin 
immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by [CONTACT_423], and documentation of the r eason 
and time of withdraw will be performed.   
4.4.[ADDRESS_261597] dose will designate the day 
of their procedure as POD 0.  If the procedure ends late in the evening  (ie not extubated before 5p m), and 
the subject is not able to receive the second POD [ADDRESS_261598] extubation  on POD as well as TID on 
POD 1 -2 and one time at 7am on POD 3 (see above protocol flowsheet).

 IV Dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg q2h PRN breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 
0.25mg and pain >5/10 will get 0.5mg).  
 PO/PT oxycodone 5 -10mg  q4h PRN pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 5mg, and pain 
greater than 5/10 will get 10mg).  
 PO/PT acetaminophen 1000mg q6 h for pain in non -cirrhotic patients, and 1000mg q12h in 
cirrhotic patients  
 Morphine IV and PO liquid equivalents will be substituted in cases of oxycode or dilaudid 
allergies. 1 -2mg IV morphine Q2 hours PRN will be  substituted for 0.25 -0.5mg dilaudid for 
breakthrough pain (pain equal to or less than 5/10 will get 1mg and pain >5/10 will get 2mg).   
PRN liquid IR morphine 7.5 -15mg will be substituted Q4 hours for oxycodone PRN for pain (pain 
equal to or less than 5/1 0 will get 7.5mg, and pain greater than 5/10 will get 15mg)  
 Study team members will place an order in compass for study investigation drug administration 
as per BJC protocol for investigational drug use.    
 
These medications can be up -titrated as needed at  the discretion of the physicians managing the 
patient’s care as part of the routine postoperative management.  
5.7 Packaging  
 Study medications will be in liquid or capsule form.  Gabapentin comes as a standard liquid form 
of 250mg/5ml. Capsules will be used fo r the pre -operative  dose, and will come as single capsules 
in bags labeled with study ID and name.  For post -operative doses, 6ml of either gabapentin or 
placebo will be packaged into a brown 20ml plastic syringe .  Each syringe will have the subject  
name a nd study ID on it.  The pharmacy will be made aware of all upcoming study subjects  and 
will prepare the medications approximately [ADDRESS_261602] s.  They will be responsible for delivering the 
Gaba Protocol   Page 11 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261603]’s study flow sheet ( “Gaba project subject study  flow 
chart ” attached ). 
5.9.[ADDRESS_261604] containers in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217800].  Any labels or 
bags with patient names will be discarded in the shred bins on the 6200 floor or in the preop  holding unit.  
 
6 Study Procedures  
The study procedures are outlined below and represented in the attached “ Gaba project subject study 
flow chart”.  
 
Clinic Visit  
 Consent . 
 Pre-treatment questionnaire . 
 Randomization group will be assigned by [CONTACT_217867] m anager after she is notified of subject 
agreement to participate.  
Day of Surgery  
 One dose  of study drug will be  administer ed preoperatively  according to subject’s randomization 
group  approximately [ADDRESS_261605] an order in 
the chart that allows the participant to take the preop medication dose, and the RN to chart this 
dose as a study medication.  
 Standard pain me dications orders will be provided.  Morphine will be used as a substitute for 
dilaudid or oxycodone allergies or intolerances. These will be up-titrate d as needed per discretion 
of service residents and attending physicians.  
 One VAS score will be obtained 45 minutes to 1 hour  postoperatively  regardless of extubation 
time.  
 One p ostop erative  dose  of study drug  and VAS will be administered  at 7pm  if subject s are 
extubated by 5PM  
Post-Operative Day (POD)  1-2 
 TID VAS scores will be obtained , two of which will be  prior to drug administrations . 
 BID study drug administration will be conducted according to subject ’s randomization  groups . 
Gaba Protocol   Page 12 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 POD 3  
 POD 3 VAS at 7am will be obtained.  
POD 3 or Day of Discharge  
 Post-treatment pain satisfaction questionnaire  will be c onducte d either after the  AM dose on POD 
[ADDRESS_261606] population, it is estimated that 46 subjects 
per group (total n=92) will be needed to detect with an 80% power at the 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 a 
differenc e of 20% or greater in average morphine dose (effect size d=0.6) between the placebo and 
gabapentin groups.  Assuming a 20% drop out rate, [ADDRESS_261607] for categorical variables will be 
used to compare distribution of characteristics between treatment groups to ensure successful 
randomization.  
 
The primary and secondary outcome measures will be compared between the two treatment groups via 
bivariate analyses.   In addition, a General Linear Model (GLM) approach will be used to explore the 
impact of gabapentin a s compared to placebo on each of the outcomes of interest after controlling for 
potential cofounders that were unevenly distributed between the two groups.  The estimated mean 
difference and 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
7.[ADDRESS_261608] Population(s) f or Analysis  
Protocol -compliant subjects  who received all study drug s up to the conduction of post -treatment 
questionnaire will be included for analysis.   Subjects with missed medication doses will go on to complete 
the protocol, and per the discretion of t he principle investi gator and statistician may or may not be 
include d in the data analysis.  Data integrity will be maintained such that subjects who are excluded for 
missed doses will be consistent among cases.  
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unant icipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved pro tocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1. 1 
CONFIDENTIAL  
  Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_217868])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that  develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study wit hdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_217869] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an impo rtant medical event  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported will be  the period from the day of surgery  
to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_261609] information for the 
study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up (Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_217870], adverse events or side effects 
experienced.  
 
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is ot herwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.[ADDRESS_261610], the investigator will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the sour ce document.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic 
procedures results will be recorded in the source document. Specific side effects that will be elicited at 
each interaction include nausea, vomiting, dizziness and sedation.   
 
The clinical course of any adverse event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period  will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study drug 
or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately  to the IRB. 
 
Gaba Protocol   Page 14 
Version: 1. [ADDRESS_261611] data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the study 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that partici pant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] a [ADDRESS_261612] document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_217804] d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subje cts experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25% and 50% 
enrollment to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133605].  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site da ta and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.   A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half way 
throug h to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by [CONTACT_15365].  
[ADDRESS_261613] of 1996 (HIPAA).   
Source data will be kept primarily in the electronic forms using R EDC ap for data collection.  Paper forms  
including the original consent s, questionnaires , VAS pain score sheets, adverse event reporting forms 
etc. will be kept in a locked cabinet that only study team members  have access to.  At the conclusion of 
the study, after data has been entered into a password protected spread sheet, these records will be 
destroyed in the proper manner  in shred it bins where patient i nformation is normally placed .  The official 
source document  and case report form  for this study will be the REDC ap database .  
 
All research records will be maintained in the Outcomes Office, 8th floor McMillan for [ADDRESS_261614] by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  At minimum, with 
25% accrual goal all adverse events and data collection forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] a nd discussed 
among the study team.  A designated, third party safety officer will review the study approximately half 
way through to ensure that subjects are not being harmed by [CONTACT_15365].

Version: 1.[ADDRESS_261624] the potential to increase length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217793].  Moreover, otolaryngology patients often undergo very painful and functionally debilitating 
surgeries of the head and neck and are at increased risk for postoperative pain due to both the 
neuroanatomy of this region and the need to swallow postoperatively8.   Postoperative pain control in this 
population  is critical for  patient satisfaction and an expedited return to a function al swallowing status.  
 
Within the field of pain management is the practice of multimodal pain therapy.  This strategy employs 
non-narcotic medications working synergistically t o imp rove pain control, decreasing  narcotic medication 
requirements and narcotic -associated side effects8.  Studies utilizing multimodal pain regimens 
demonstrate such benefits in acute postoperative pain management2-5.  Gabapentin is a non -narcotic 
pain medica tion often used in multimodal pain regimens that has been shown to reduce acute 
postoperative pain.  
1.2 Investigational Agent  
Gabapentin is a non -narcotic medication developed to target neuropathic pain1.  It is an amino acid  1-
(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA  
(gamma -aminobutyric acid) , without modifying the  binding, metabolism, or elimination of  GABA.   In vitro 
studies have demonstrated gab apentin binding sites in the rat brain , but the functional implication and the 
mechanism of its analgesic and antico nvulsant activity remains unknown  in humans .  The oral 
bioavailability of gabapentin decreases as dose increases.  Its half -life is 5 -7 hours, and it is eliminated by 
[CONTACT_217872] t chemical alteration.  Dose adjustments are recommended for creatinine clearance 
less than 3 0 mL/min.  It is FDA approved since [ADDRESS_261625] examined the use of  gabapentin in postoperative 
Gaba Protocol   Page 3 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_261626] been conducted with gabapentin use in adult otolaryngology patients 
undergoing head and n eck mucosal surgeries , which is an at -risk population for high levels of 
postsurgical pain . 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
Dosing regimen of gabapentin will be [ADDRESS_261627] -herpetic neuralgia is a 300 mg/day on day 1, [ADDRESS_261628] -operative swallo w function if assessed.  
3 Study Design  
3.1 General Design  
This is a prospective, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study  with the intent of providing high 
quality and reproducible data.   The study subjects include  adult otolaryngology patients  over t he age of 
18 years  undergoing open or endoscopic /robotic  tumor resection involving the mucosal surfaces of the 
oral cavity, oro pharynx, hypopharynx and larynx in a single tertiary academic center.  Participants are 
Gaba Protocol   Page 4 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_261629] operative care will not be limited by [CONTACT_217828] y, meaning that they will 
not be denied needed and appropriate narcotic pain medications simply because they are enrolled.  
Written informed consent will be obtained prior to the start of research related procedures.

Version: 1.[ADDRESS_261630] op care.  These orders will be 1000mg of Tylenol PO or 
per tube Q6 hours (or Q12 hours if the patient has hepatic insu fficiency), oxycodone 5 -10mg Q4 hours 
PRN pain, and dilaudid 0.25 -0.5mg Q2 hours PRN pain >5/[ADDRESS_261631]’ s study participation .  Subjects will remain in t he PACU per the usual protocol until the  
required level of alertness and clinical stability are reached for transfer .  The VAS score obtained after 
surgery  will be completed two hours after emergence. This i s an approximate time:  the post op VAS can 
be obtained sooner than two hours if the subject  is alert and awake.  If should not be obtained before one 
hour after anesthesia emergence. Thus it can be obtained one to two hours after the subject  has 
awakened.   
Gaba Protocol   Page 6 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_261632] operatively and will count as the 
7PM VAS score  (see above) .  A mid day VAS score at 12PM  will be obtained , pending the availability of 
the study team .   All VAS scores will be obtained with subject privacy optimized, including draw ing the 
curtain in subject room  to separate the sides of the room  from any potential roommate.  Also, the 
research team member will not vocaliz e a subject’s status as a study patient.  VAS scores will be 
obtained at rest, with cough and following a swallowing gesture.  Scores are captured by [CONTACT_217873] a pen and asking the subject to mark the location of their pain on a scale of 0 -10 during each 
phase of the VAS.   The scale is a validat ed tool that measures 10cm in size and is marked “no pain” at 0 
and “worst pain” at 10.  The subject marks their pain level on the scale and the study team member  will 
measure with a ruler and record the resulting number in the study database.    
Subjects  will fill out a discharge survey before they are discharged or at the completion of the ir 
participation  to rate their satisfaction with their inpatient pain control.  This survey will be a hard copy  
labeled with  study ID  and the data will be enter ed into t he study database .All hard copy  data will be 
stored  in a locked cabinet  accessible only to the study team .  At the end of the study, all  hard copy  data 
will be properly destroyed.   
 
Subjects wi ll have 24/[ADDRESS_261633] rage daily narcotic 
consumption.  
3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints include (a) subject satisfaction with pain control, (b) VAS pain s cores,  (c) 
subject’s baseline pain tolerance, and (d) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217823].  
 
(a) Subject satisfaction with pain control will be captured in a survey administered at POD 3 after the 
AM dose administration, or after the AM dose administration on the day of discharge, whichever 
comes sooner.  Two of t he survey questions will mirror those on the HCAPHS surveys, listed as 
followed (see attached “ post-treatment  questionnaire”):  
 
1. How often was your  pain well controlled?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
2. How often did the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_217796]?  
0) Never  
1) Sometimes  
2) Usually  
3) Always  
 
3. How satisfied are you with your overall pain control ? 
0) Very dissatisfied  
Gaba Protocol   Page 7 
Version: 1.0  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 1) Somewhat dissatisfied  
2) Neutral  
3) Somewhat satisfied  
4) Very satisfied  
 
4. Was there anything else that we could have done to make your pain control  better during your 
inpatient stay?  
A point system is created with the sum of the numeric values assigned to questions 1 -3 on a scale of 
0 to 10, with a score of 0 -3 indicates overall dissatisfaction, 4 indicates neutrality, and 5 -10 suggests 
overall satisfaction.   This will be analyzed as an ordinal variable.  
 
(b) VAS pain scores will be assessed  1-[ADDRESS_261634] “mark on the line the point that you feel represent s your current pain 
level when you’re resting.”  This is followed by [CONTACT_217874] 
“mark another point on the line that represents your pain level when you swallow.”  Lastly, the 
subject will be asked to cough and to “mark the final point on the line that represent s your pain 
when you cough.”   The study team member admi nistering the test will annotate what each mark 
represents (rest, swallow, and cough).  The scale contains a 10 -cm line from “no pain” on the left 
to “extreme pain” on the right  (see “VAS form ”).  The distance in millimeter s from the left of the 
line to the center of the patient’s three marks  will be recorded.  The results from all  available VAS 
scores for each subject will be averaged and i ncluded in the final analysis.  
 
(c) The subject’ s belief in pain medication efficacy and pain tolerance will be assessed f rom a short 
survey obtained preoperatively during the office visit  (see “pre -treatment questionnaire”) . This 
includes the following questions:  
 
1. In the past, how effective are narcotic pain medications  (such as morphine, Vicodin, Norco, 
Percocet, oxycodone,  Dilaudid)  at controlling your pain?  
0) Very ineffective  
1) Somewhat ineffective  
2) Somewhat effective  
3) Very effective  
 
2. In the past, how has your pain tolerance been?  
0) Very poor  
1) Somewhat poor  
2) Somewhat tolerant  
3) Very tolerant  
 
3. Do you experience a significant amount of pain on a daily basis aside from  the pain due to 
your current head and neck condition?  
1) Yes I do  
2) No I do not  
The results of these questions will be reported separately in the final analyses.

Subjects  will be recruited  in the outpatient head and neck clinic prior to their planned surgeries by 
[CONTACT_217832] .  Potentially eligible patients will be identified by [CONTACT_217875].  Eligible subjects will be 
approache d after their scheduled appointment in a private setting and the study outline explained to the 
patient. Written i nformed consent will be obtained from those patients  who wish to participate.  Patients  
may choose to think about study participation but will  need to decide and provide written consent prior to 
the day of surgery, either at their subsequent preoperative anesthesia clinic appointment or medical 
oncology/radiation oncology appointments.   Study  team members  will be properly trained in the informed  
consent process.  
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study prior to the expected completion if they develop 
hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug, are unable to swallow all study drugs  in the study period, or 
choose to withdrawal for other  reasons.  Subjects without a feeding tube who are unable , or unwilling , to 
swallow medications after surgery will not be given a feeding tube to remain in the study.  A 20% dropout 
rate was anticipate d and accounted for in the sample size calculation.   Subjects will be able to withdraw 
on a continual basis throughout their participation.  Withdraw can be requested  either by [CONTACT_217876].  All withdraws will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_16310].  No subject will be denied the ability to withdraw. The withdraw process will 
begin immediately when deemed necessary or when desired by [CONTACT_423], and documentation of the 
reason a nd time of withdraw will be performed.

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or freq uency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possib ility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic proce dures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by  [CONTACT_15369] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or  significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported will be  the period from the day of surgery  
to the end of th e study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_261646] information for the 
study member that is in charge of adverse event follow up ( Melanie Townsend, PI).  They will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_217839], adverse events or side effects 
experienced.  
 
 
Gaba Protocol   Page 13 
Version: 1.[ADDRESS_261647] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal phy sician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
8.[ADDRESS_261648] data is intentionally or unintentionally unblinded, the event will be 
documented in detail in the study documents within 48 hours.   Any unblinding that occurs during the s tudy 
period for an individual participant will result in exclusion of that participant’s data from final analysis.  
Study investigators must report unblinding to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] a [ADDRESS_261649] document the  
event.  Subjects will immediately be  made aware of the unblinding and will be withdrawn from completing 
the protocol.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_217804] d prematurely if 50% or more of the subjects receiving study drug (gabapentin 
or placebo)  experience significant adverse events as  defined above in section 8.1.  The study will not be 
prematurely stopped if subjects  experience less significant medication side effects, specifically nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness and sedation.  A review of adverse events will be conducted at 25% and 50% 
enrollment to ensure that they are properly tracked.  
8.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133605].  This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, 
as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10 
Monitoring).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious 
adverse events.

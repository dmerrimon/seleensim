This is a Phase  II trial testing  4 disease -specific  myeloablative   conditioning   regimens  for preparatory  
cytoreduction  of patients  receiving  allogeneic   HLA -compatible  related  or unrelated  transplants  of 
GCSF -mobilized   peripheral  blood  stem  cells (PBSC)  depleted  of T-cells by [CONTACT_93064]34+  progenitor  cells using  the CliniMACS   system.  The CliniMACS  Fractionation  system  is an 
experimental  method  requiring  an IND that positively   selects  CD34+  progenitor  cells from  PBSC  by 
[CONTACT_93065]34  monoclonal  antibody  to paramagnetic  beads  which  
can then be isolated  by [CONTACT_93066]  a magnetized  column  and released  by [CONTACT_93067].  Two 
of the four conditioning   regimens  have been  used successfully  with an alternative  similar   system,  
Isolex,  which  is no longer  being  manufactured.  Although  an IND is required,  the CliniMACS  system  
has been  used extensively  in Europe  and under  several  INDs in the United  States  including   IRB 
Protocol  06-005 at MSKCC.  
The primary  objectives  of the trial are 1) to assess whether or not each of these  cytoreductive  regimens  
is sufficiently   immuno   ablative  to permit  consistent  engraftment  and hematopoietic   reconstitution  
following   allogeneic   PBSC  transplants  depleted  of T-cells by [CONTACT_93068];  
2) to confirm  the capacity  of these  transplants  to reduce  or prevent  the development  of clinically  
significant   acute  GVHD  and chronic  GVHD,  3) to assess  the incidence  of transplant -related  mortality  
associated  with such transplants  when  administered  after each conditioning   regimen  at approximately  
day 100, 6, [ADDRESS_102809] transplant,   and 4) to assess  overall  and disease  free survival  (DFS)  
at [ADDRESS_102810] transplant.  
For this trial, patients  will be stratified  to receive  one of four myeloablative   conditioning   regimens,  
based  on their disease,  stage  of disease,  and dose of radiation  accumulated  in the course  of treatment.  
The  four myeloablative   conditioning   regimens  are: 1) Hyperfractionated  total body irradiation   to a 
dose of 1375  cGy-1500cGy  (with  lung shielding   to a dose of 800cGy)  administered  in 125cGy  
fractions  at 4-6 hour intervals  three  times  a day for a total of 11 or 12 doses  depending  on age and 
disease  risk (or, if general  anesthesia  is required,   150 cGy q12h x 8 doses to a total dose of  1375  cGy 
may be given),  followed  by [CONTACT_93069]  5mg/kg/day  x 2 (or 10mg/kg/day  x 1 ) and cyclophosphamide  
60mg/kg/day  x 2 (or fludarabine  25mg/m2   x 5 if cyclophosphamide   is contraindicated);  2) Busulfan  
0.8mg/kg/dose  q 6h x 10- 12 doses  (depending  on disease),  Melphalan  70mg/m2/day x 2, and 
fludarabine  25mg/m2/day x 5;  3) Clofarabine  20mg/m2/day x 5 ( or, for children  < 18yrs  of age, 
30mg/m2/day x 5 if deemed  suitable   and with PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473]),  Melphalan  70mg/m2/day x 2, and Thiotepa  
5mg/kg/day  x 2 (or 10mg/kg/day  x 1) or 4) Melphalan  70mg/m2/day x 2, Fludarabine   25 mg/m2/day x 
5, and Thiotepa  5mg/kg/day  x 2 (or 10mg/kg/day  x 1 day).  Patients  will also receive  anti-thymocyte  
globulin   to eradicate  host T-cells that could  contribute  to graft rejection.  
Approximately   twenty -four to forty-eight  hours  after completion  of each conditioning   regimen,  
patients  will receive  a transplant  of a CD34+  progenitor  cell-enriched,  T-cell depleted  fraction  of 
GCSF -mobilized   PBSC  after fractionation  on the CliniMACS  device,  from  his/her  HLA  compatible  
donor.  
Each  transplant  will be derived  from  a healthy,  consenting  HLA  compatible   related  or unrelated  donor.  
The donor  will receive  mobilization   therapy  with GCSF   administered  as per standard  practice.  
Leukapheresis  will be performed  on a continuous   flow cell separator  according  to institutional  
standards  commencing  on approximately  Day 5 of GCSF  treatment.   Daily  leukapheresis  of the donor  
with subsequent  CD34+  cell selection  using  the Miltenyi   CliniMACS  device  will continue  until a post- 
selection  target  of >5.0 x 106  CD34+  cells/kg  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93004] < 1.0 x 105  CD3+ cells/kg

Administrative Update 1 : [ADDRESS_102811] two but not more  than three  leukapheresis  
procedures.   There  is no limit  to the number  of CD34+ progenitors  that can be administered.  
No additional  GVHD  prophylaxis   will be administered.  Due to stringent  T-cell depletion,   no 
significant   GVHD  is anticipated.   Should   GVHD  occur,  standard  treatment  will be initiated -  per The 
Pediatric  and Internal  Medicine  Transplant  Service  guidelines.  
The sample  size is as follows:  
 
Regimen  A: TBI/Thiotepa/Cyclophosphamide:     110 patients  
Regimen  B: Busulfan/Melphalan/Fludarabine:   200 patients  
Regimen C: Clofarabine/Melphalan/Thiotepa:  60 patients 
Regimen  D: Melphalan/Fludarabine/Thiotepa:   [ADDRESS_102812]  six years.  
 
Patients  will be followed  for two years  following   transplantation.

Primary: 
 
1. To assess  the incidence  of durable  hematopoietic  engraftment  for T-cell depleted  transplants  
fractionated  by [CONTACT_93070].  
2. To assess  the incidence  and severity  of acute  and chronic  GVHD  following   T-cell depleted,  
CD34+  progenitor   cell enriched  transplants  fractionated  by [CONTACT_93071].  
3. To assess  the incidence  of non-relapse  mortality  (transplant -related  mortality)   following   each 
cytoreduction  regimen  and a transplant  fractionated  by [CONTACT_93072].  
4. To estimate  the probability   of survival  and disease -free survival  (DFS) at [ADDRESS_102813] transplant  for life for each 
disease -targeted  cytoreduction  regimen  when  used with a T-cell depleted  graft fractionated  by [CONTACT_93073].  
 
Secondary:  
 
1. To determine  the proportion   of patients  receiving  optimal  CD34+  (> 5x106/kg) and CD3+ 
(<1x105/kg) cell doses  the proportion   recurring  suboptimal  doses  (< 2x106/kg) CD34+  cells;  and 
the proportion  of patients  receiving  CD3+ T-cell doses  > 1x105/kg. 
2. To correlate  doses  of CD34+  progenitors  and CD3+  T cells with engraftment,  graft vs. host disease  
and non-relapse  mortality.  
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND  RATIONALE  
 
Allogeneic   hematopoietic   cell transplantation  (HSCT)  is an accepted  therapy  for the treatment  of acute  
lymphoblastic   (ALL)  and myeloblastic   (AML)  leukemia,  and recognized  as the curative  treatment  of 
choice  for patients  who fail to sustain  an initial   remission  (1-4). Such  transplants  are also a recognized  
as a potentially   curative  treatment for myelodysplastic   syndromes,  advanced  non-Hodgkins   lymphoma

and multiple   myeloma   (5-9). For adults  with high risk AML  in 1oCR or 2oCR, unmodified   HLA - 
matched  related  HSCTs  have led to sustained  DFS rates  of 45-60% and 40-53% respectively;  for 
patients  with high risk ALL  in 1o CR or 2o CR, the extended  DFS rates  are 45-75% and 35-40% 
respectively  (3,4,10,11).While    comparative  trials of transplants  vs chemotherapy  in adults  with high 
risk acute  AML  in first remission  have consistently  recorded  higher  DFS rates  for HSCT  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840],  
the differences  have been  significant   only in a minority   of studies  (12-15).  In these  studies,  the 
decreased  risk of relapse  observed  following   an allogeneic   HSCT  has been  offset  by [CONTACT_93074]-leukemic   mortality   resulting  from  Graft  vs Host disease  and its treatment.  
For patients  lacking  an HLA -matched  sibling,   the prospects  of transplantation  have greatly  improved  
over the last 10 years, reflecting improvements both in the selection and the rapid mobilization  of 
HLA  compatible   donors  through  the National  Marrow  Donor  Program  (NMDP) and the computerized  
worldwide  network  of donor  centers  that now includes  over [ADDRESS_102814]  survival  rates  for HLA -matched  unrelated  transplants  administered  
to patients  with AML  and ALL  in early  remission  are comparable  to those  recorded  for matched  
sibling   grafts  (16, 17).  Strikingly,   relapse  rates  following   unrelated  grafts  are lower.  However,  this 
advantage  has been  neutralized  by [CONTACT_93075].  
Thus,  the early  morbidity   and mortality  associated  with acute  GVHD  is a major  factor  limiting   the 
success  of transplantation  as is the long-term morbidity   associated  with chronic  GVHD.  The risk of 
acute  GVHD  following   allogeneic   bone marrow  transplantation  (BMT)  from  HLA -matched  siblings   is 
20-60% despi[INVESTIGATOR_93005]   A (CSA),  tacrolimus  (FK506),  
methotrexate  (MTX),  antithymocyte   globulin   (ATG)  and corticosteroids,  alone  or in combination   (18- 
21). Grades  II-IV (moderate  to severe) acute  GVHD  are associated  with an increased  risk of 
transplant -related  mortality   (21, 22). Mortality  rates  among  patients  who develop  GVHD  can be as 
high as 75% when  that disease  is unresponsive  to therapy  (22). 
Over the last [ADDRESS_102815] transplant.   However,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_93006],  
18-40% of patients  receiving  HLA -matched  related  grafts  will develop  grade  II-IV acute  GVHD,  and 
24-58% of those  who survive  over 3 months  will develop  chronic  GVHD  (18-21). In these  trials,   
lower  incidences  of acute  HVHD  have also been  invariably   counter  balanced  by [CONTACT_93076].  Higher  rates  of acute  and chronic  GVHD  are observed  following  
matched  unrelated  HSCT.   Furthermore,  rates  of GVHD  continue  to be prohibitive   following   HLA - 
non-identical  grafts  (23, 24).  Thus,  immunosuppressive   agents  are only partially  effective  in reducing  
the incidence  and severity  of acute  GVHD  and have to date failed  to decrease  the incidence  of chronic  
GVHD.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_93007],  engrafted  donor  T-lymphocytes  derived  from  the 
hematopoietic  cell graft can respond  to alloantigens   on the cell surface  of host cells,  initiating   the 
pathologic   process  leading  to GVHD  (25). 
Over  the past twenty  years,  several  techniques  for T-cell depletion  (TCD) of donor  grafts  have been  
introduced  and evaluated  for their capacity  to prevent  acute  and chronic  GVHD.  These  include  
techniques  involving   physical  adsorption  of T-cells to protein  ligands  such as lectins,  elutriation,   and 
immunoadsorption   or immuno   deletion  with T-cell or lymphocyte -specific   monoclonal  antibodies   (26- 
30).  Comparative  analyses  have demonstrated  that these  techniques  vary widely  in their capacity  to

deplete  T-cells (1.5-3.5 log 10  depletion)   (31). The relationship   between  the T-cell dose transplanted  
and the risk of acute  GVHD  is complex  and varies  depending  upon  the degree  of MHC -compatibility,  
graft source  (bone  marrow  versus  peripheral  blood),   type of GVHD  prophylaxis   (pharmacological  
versus  T-cell depletion),  method  of T-cell depletion,  conditioning   regimen,  use of in vivo depleting  
antibodies   (33-36), as well as patient  and donor  characteristics  including   underlying   disease,  age, 
gender  and parity  (37-39).  Our studies  in more  than [ADDRESS_102816] suggested  that the threshold  
dose of T-cells required  to induce  grade  II-IV acute  GVHD  after HLA -matched  sibling  transplants  is 
105  clonable  T-cells/kg  (31). A 2.8-3.0 log 10  reduction  in marrow  grafts  or a 4.0-4.5 log 10  reduction  in 
peripheral  blood  stem  cell (PBSC)  grafts  is required  if this threshold  is not to be exceeded.  This likely  
explains   the variable  reductions  in GVHD  and inconsistent  reductions  in chronic  GVHD  observed  
with several  techniques  despi[INVESTIGATOR_93008].  
Certain  methods  of T-cell depletion  are effective  in reducing  or preventing  acute  GVHD  in both HLA - 
matched  and HLA -disparate  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93009]-administration   of CSA  and/or  MTX.  The 
first is: T-cell depletion  of a marrow  allograft  by [CONTACT_93077] E-rosette  depletion  
(SBA),  an approach  reported  by [CONTACT_93078] -Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC)  (26,40)  and the 
University  of Perugia  (41) to be associated  with a 0-5% incidence  of acute  GVHD  in HLA -matched  
transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_847] a 0-8% incidence  in HLA  haplotype  transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  The second  is: 
depletion  of T-cells by [CONTACT_93079]34+  hematopoietic   cells from  GCSF  mobilized  
peripheral  blood  leukocytes  (PBSC)  and transplantation  of these  CD34+ cell-enriched,  T-cell depleted  
cell fractions  (43, 44). 
Two methods  of positive   selection  of CD34+  progenitors  have thus far been  found  to yield populations  
of CD34+  progenitor  cells adequate  to secure  engraftment  that are also sufficiently   depleted  of T-cells 
to prevent  GVHD.  One approach,  extensively  studied  at MSKCC,  requires  two steps:  a) initial   
isolation   of CD34+  cells on the Isolex  device  which  treats the cells with a murine  CD34 -specific  
MoAb  and subsequently  adsorbs  the antibody -coated  cells to anti-mouse  IGG coated  paramagnetic  
beads.  Following   separation  of the cells adsorbed  to the beads,  the cells are eluted  from  the beads.  
Thereafter,  residual  T-cells are depleted  by [CONTACT_93080].  This 
procedure  yields   a progenitor -enriched  cell fraction  that provides  CD34+ cell doses  of 0.7-29.6 (median  
6.6) x 106/kg and CD3+  T-cell doses  of 0.2-4.1 (median  1.4) x 103/kg. Such  transplants,       
administered  after total body irradiation,   Thiotepa  and either  cyclophosphamide   or fludarabine  have 
provided  consistent  engraftment  with rates  of grade  II-IV acute  GVHD  of 8% and 9% in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93010] -matched  related  or unrelated  donors  respectively,  and rates  of extensive  chronic  GVHD  of 6% 
and 11% respectively  (44). However,  this method, while  effective,  will no longer  be available  as of 
April  1 2010,  because  Baxter  is terminating  the manufacturing  of their  Isolex  system  and its

The other  technique,  which  has been  extensively  employed  in Europe  (43, 45) but has only recently  
been  studied  in the United  States,  is the CliniMACS   system  (Miltenyi  Biotec).  In this system,  GCSF - 
mobilized   PBSC  are introduced  into the closed  device,  which  treats the cells with anti CD34  MoAB  
coated  paramagnetic  beads.  The CD34+  progenitor  cells are then separated  from  other  cells by [CONTACT_93081],  and then washed  and eluted.  In the large  Perugia  series,  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93011]34+  PBSC  isolated  on the CliniMACS  device  had only a 10% probability  
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_93012]  (42). In a multicenter  trial conducted  by [CONTACT_93082],  for which  Dr. O’Reilly  was principal  investigator,   this method  
yielded  a progenitor -enriched  cell fraction  that provided  doses  of progenitor  cells ranging  from  2.4 –

31.3 (med  7.9) x 106  CD34+  cells kg and T-cell doses  of 1.1-84.9 (median  6.6) x 103  CD3+  cells/kg.  
HLA  matched  related  HSCT fractionated  by [CONTACT_93083], thiotepa  and cyclophosphamide.    These  transplants  provided  
consistent  engraftment  (1 late graft failure  in 44 patients  transplanted),  and were  associated  with 
incidences  of 20.5%  grade  2-4 acute  GVHD  and 7.6%  extensive  chronic  GVHD.   Overall  survival  for 
patients  with AML  transplanted  in 1o and 2o  remission  was 74% (46). Overall  risk of relapse  for 
patients  is 1° or 2° CR was 18%,  which  compares  favorably  with results  of unmodified   transplants  for 
these  disease  indications.  
The highly   favorable  results  of the BMT  CTN  trial, which  were  presented  at ASH,  December  2009,  
have now been  submitted  for publication   and form  the basis  for an application   to the FDA  for 
licensure  as a device  to prevent  GVHD  in patients  transplanted  for AML.   As we are waiting  for 
approval,  trials  of T-cell depleted  CD34+ PBSC  transplants  fractionated on the CliniMACS  
device will continue to require an IND. 
As noted  above,  over the last 9 years  our transplantation  program  has accrued  extensive  experience  
with CD34+E- T cell depleted  PBSC  transplants  isolated  by [CONTACT_93079]34+  progenitors  on 
the FDA  approved  Isolex  device  followed  by E. rosette  depletion.   Under  IRB #01-070, 108 patients  
received  transplants  of HLA -matched  related  or HLA  compatible   unrelated  CD34+E-  PBSC  transplants  
fractionated  by [CONTACT_93084]/THIO/Fludarabine  only 2 patients  had late 
graft failure  (1.7%)  (44).  The incidence  of acute  grade  2-4 GVHD  was 9% for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013] - 
matched  related  grafts  and 16% for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93014].   Chronic  
GVHD  of any severity  developed  in only 8% of the matched  related  and 21% of the matched  or non- 
identical  unrelated  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].   Of the patients  transplanted  for acute  leukemias  in 1o and 2o remission,  
over 65% are surviving   disease -free at up to 9 years of follow -up. 
In a separate  protocol (IRB 01-055),  we also evaluated  T cell depleted  CD34+E-  PBSC transplants  
fractionated  on the Isolex  device  administered  after a chemotherapeutic  myeloablative   cytoreduction  
regimen  consisting  of Busulfan,  0.8mg/kg/dose,  every  6 hours  x 10 doses,  melphalan  70 mg/m2/day x 
2 and Fludarabine  25 mg/m2/day x 5.  The patients  enrolled  had advanced  AML,  ALL,  MDS  or NHL.  
They  received  transplants  from  matched  related  (N=23)  and unrelated  (N=34)  donors  or HLA  non- 
identical  related  or unrelated  (N=35).   Of 91 patients  evaluable,  88 (97%) achieved  durable  
engraftment  (graft  failure  rate=3%).   Acute  grade  II-IV acute  GVHD  was observed  in 8%; chronic  
GVHD  in 7%.  The non-relapse  mortality   in this heavily  pre-treated  patient  population   was 20% at 2 
years.  DFS at 2 years was 55%,  a result  which  compares  very favorably  with published   results  of 
unmodified   grafts  applied  to patients  in similarly   advanced  stages  of leukemia   and MDS.  This regimen  
was particularly  promising   for patients  transplanted  for advanced  MDS  and secondary  AML,  and 
forms  the basis  of a trial being  conducted  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Castro -Malaspi[INVESTIGATOR_93015]   (IRB  08-008).  This trial also demonstrated  for the first time, that engraftment  of  
extensively  T-cell depleted  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells could  be consistently  achieved,  both in 
HLA -matched  and HLA  disparate  patients,  after a  myeloablative   cytoreduction  regimen  that did not 
include   total body irradiation . 
 
While   modifications   of these  protocols  were  planned  for subsequent  trials,  such as the adjunctive  use 
of KGF  to reduce  radiation  and chemotherapy -induced  injury  to the thymus  and thereby  [CONTACT_93085],   the decision  of Baxter Bioscience  to terminate  manufacture  of the Isolex  
device  and the reagents  required  for positive   selection  of CD34+  progenitor  cells has temporarily

Administrative Update 1 : [ADDRESS_102817]  fractionated  by [CONTACT_93071],  when  administered  after each of  four, disease  targeted  
cytoreductive  regimens,  to secure  consistent  engraftment  and hematopoietic  reconstitution   in HLA - 
compatible   related  or unrelated  hosts,  and to prevent  or abrogate  acute  and chronic  forms  of GVHD.  
We also seek to validate  that these  pre-transplant  conditioning   regimens,  when  administered  with a 
CD34+  progenitor  cell enriched,  T-cell depleted  graft,  fractionated  in the CliniMACs   system,  will be 
associated  with an acceptably  low incidence  of non-leukemic   mortality.  
 
The  four cytoreduction  regimens  to be tested  in this trial are: 
 
1) The combination   of 1375cGy  (adults)  or 1400-1500 cGy (Pediatrics)  hyperfractionated  total 
body irradiation   followed  by [CONTACT_93086]  (5 mg/kg/day  x 2 or 10 mg/kg/day  x 1) and cyclophosphamide  
(60 mg/kg/day  x 2) (or fludarabine   25mg/m2/day x 5 if Cyclophosphamide   is contraindicated),  which  
we have previously   evaluated  with SBA-E-  T-cell depleted  marrow  grafts  (IRB 89-119 and 01-070),  
and which  has been  associated  with consistent  engraftment,  a low incidence  of acute  and chronic  
GVHD,  and incidences  of post transplant  relapse  in patients  transplanted  for ALL  and AML  that are 
equal  to or lower  than those  reported  following   unmodified   grafts  in patients  with the same  diseases  
and stages  of disease  (40).  We have also tested  this cytoreduction  regime  together  with CliniMACS  
fractionated  T-cell depleted  PBSC  transplants  in HLA -matched  related  patients  with AML  in 1o  or 2o 
remission,  as part of the multicenter  BMT  CTN  trial (IRB  06-005).  As previously   noted,  the results  of 
this trial are among  the best reported  (44, 46).  However,  this regimen  has not yet been  evaluated  with 
HLA -compatible  unrelated  T-cell depleted  grafts  fractionated  by [CONTACT_93072].  
2) The combination   of Busulfan  0.8- 1.0mg/Kg/dose  q 6 hours  x 10- 12 doses  (with  doses  
adjusted  based  on Busulfan  pharmacokinetics),  melphalan  70 mg/m2/day x 2 and Fludarabine   25 
mg/m2/day x 5. We have previously   studied  this regimen  in combination   with Isolex  separated  T-cell 
depleted  grafts  (IRB  01-055) from  both related  and unrelated  donors.   This regimen  is applicable   to 
patients  with MDS,  AML  and multiple   myeloma  and particularly  to patients  with advanced  myeloid  
malignancies  or non-malignant   disorders  of hematopoiesis  who,  by [CONTACT_93087],  cannot  receive  a cytoreductive  regimen  containing   total body irradiation.  
 
3) The combination   of clofarabine  20 mg/m2/day x 5 ( or, for children  < 18 yrs of age, 
30mg/m2/day x 5 if deemed  suitable   and with PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473]),  melphalan  70 mg/m2/day x 2 and thiotepa  
5 mg/kg/day  x 2 (or 10mg/kg/day  x 1). This regimen  is myeloablative   and immunoablative.    This 
regimen  used with unmodified   HLA  compatible   related  or unrelated  HSCT,  has shown  particular  
promise  in the treatment  of patients  with high risk and advanced  staged  ALL  (IRB  06-125).  We have 
transplanted  a series  of [ADDRESS_102818] disease  has been  a significant  
cause  of morbidity;   five patients  developed  grade  II-IV acute  GVHD,  which  was lethal  in 1 case;  [ADDRESS_102819]  fractionated  by [CONTACT_93071].

4) The combination   of fludarabine   25mg/m2/day x 5, melphalan  70 mg/m2/day x 2 and 
thiotepa  5 mg/kg/day  x 2 (or 10mg/kg/day  x 1). This reduced  intensity,  myeloablative   regimen  was 
employed  as preparative  conditioning   for 7 CD34+  T cell depleted  Isolex  transplants  and, under  single  
patient  use INDs,  3 T cell depleted  CD34+  (CliniMACS)  PBSC transplants  to treat 10 patients:  
refractory  leukemia  (n=2),  aplastic  anemia,  (n=3),  PNH  or refractory  autoimmune   cytopenia  (n=2),  
lethal  congenital  immune   deficiencies  (n=3).  The regimen  induced  only moderate  GI toxicity.  
However,  in each of 9 evaluable  patients,  we observed  rapid  reconstitution  with full donor  chimerism  
and without  GVHD.  This regimen  is proposed  for use in (1) patients  heavily   sensitized  by 
[CONTACT_93088],  melphalan  and fludarabine   may not be adequate  to ensure  
engraftment,  (2) patients  who, because  of prior hepatic  and/or  pulmonary   injury  are at high risk of 
severe  and life threatening  toxicity  if treated  with regimen  A, B  and C and, (3) patients  with life 
threatening  nonmalignant   acquired  and genetic  disorders  of hematopoiesis   and immunity.  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a four-armed  phase  II trial designed  to evaluate  the potential  of an HLA compatible  related  or 
unrelated  GCSF -mobilized   peripheral  blood  progenitor  cell (PBSC)  transplants  depleted  of T-cells by 
[CONTACT_93079]34+  progenitors,  using  the CliniMACS   system to secure  consistent  
engraftment,  a low rate of acute  and chronic  GVHD  with an acceptably  low incidence   of non-relapse  
mortality  when  administered  after one of four disease -targeted  myeloablative   conditioning   regimens.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients  with high risk forms  of acute  leukemia,  CML,  multiple   myeloma,  myelodysplastic   syndrome  
(MDS) or other  lethal  disorders  of hematopoiesis  who fulfill   eligibility   requirements  and consent  to 
treatment,  will be stratified  to receive  one of  four myeloablative   conditioning   regimens,  based  on their 
disease  and/or  stage  of disease,  and clinical  parameters  including   age, prior history  of radiation   
therapy,  prior exposure  to specific  chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_93016].  
 
The four cytoreduction  regimens  to be evaluated  are: 
A. TBI/Thiotepa/Cyclophosphamide:  
a. Hyperfractionated  total body irradiation   to a dose of 1375-1500 cGy (depending  on 
age, stage  of disease  and requirement  of general  anesthesia)  with lung shielding)  
b. Thiotepa  (5 mg/kg/day  x 2 or 10 mg/kg/day  x 1) 
c. Cyclophosphamide   (60 mg/ kg/day  x 2) (or fludarabine  25mg/m2  x 5 if 
cyclophosphamide   is contraindicated).  
B. Busulfan/Melphalan/Fludarabine: 
a. Busulfan  (0.8 mg/kg  every  6 hours  x 10 or 12 doses),  (depending  on disease)  with 
dose modified  according  to pharmacokinetics  
b. Melphalan  (70mg/m2/day x 2 ) 
c. Fludarabine   (25mg/m2/ day x 5) 
C. Clofarabine/Melphalan/Thiotepa:  
a. Clofarabine  (20mg/m2/ day x 5) (or, for children  <18 years of age, 30mg/m2/day x 5 if 
deemed  suitable   and with PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473]),  
b. Melphalan  (70 mg/m2/day x 2)

All patients  (with  the exception  of patients  ≤ 18 who receive  transplants  from  HLA -matched  related  
siblings   in Arm A) will also receive  antithymocyte  globulin   (ATG)  (thymoglobulin   2.5 mg/kg/day  x 
2 or equine  ATG  15 mg/kg/day  x 2 or 30mg/kg/day  x 1 if thymoglobulin   is not tolerated)  during  
pre-transplant  conditioning   to deplete  radiation  or chemotherapy  resistant  host T-cells that could  
hamper  engraftment.  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93013] -non-identical  transplants  will receive  an additional  dose of 
ATG.  If patient  is receiving  a second  transplant  from  the same  donor,  ATG  administration   will be at 
the discretion  of the physician.  
 
Following   preparative  cytoreduction,  all patients  will receive  a GCSF  mobilized   PBSC  transplant  
depleted  of T-cells by [CONTACT_93079]34+  progenitor  cells with the CliniMACS  system.  
The targeted  dose progenitor  cells will be > 5 x 106  CD34+  cells/kg  with the dose of T-cells limited  
to < 1.0 x 105CD3+  cells/kg.  
 
Following   transplantation,   the patients  will receive  transfusions  and supportive   care according  to the 
guideline   of the Transplant  Service  in Pediatrics  and Medicine.  These  guidelines   will also be 
invoked  for prophylaxis   and treatment  of infectious   complications.  
 
The patients  will then be evaluated  sequentially  for toxicities,   engraftment,  acute  and/or  chronic  
GVHD,  the kinetics   and quality   of hematopoietic   and immune   reconstitution,   and both relapse -free 
survival  and overall  survival.  
 
Historically,   under  the multicenter  BMTCTN  trial 0303  (IRB  06-005 ) which  employed  the 
CliniMACS   device,  GCSF  mobilized   PBSC,  after washing,  were  suspended  in buffered  saline  only 
and then incubated  with antiCD34  coated  paramagnetic  beads  prior to separation  of the CD34+  cells 
bound  to the beads  by [CONTACT_93089].  A provision  
recommended  as an  adjunct  but not required  or known  to be necessary  was that the diluent  in which 
the washed  GCSF -mobilized   PBMC were  incubated  with the antiCD34  coated  beads  also include  
30% autologous  plasma  or intravenous  gamma  globulin   at a concentration  of 1.5 mg/ml.  This 
provision   was not used by [CONTACT_93090], including   our own.  That 
trial, as initially   noted  in the Background  for Protocol  10-050 recorded  an incidence  of acute  grade  
II-IV GVHD  of 20.5%  and a 7.6%  incidence  of extensive  GVHD.  While   these  findings  were  
significantly   better than any results  recorded  with drug prophylaxis   or methods  of T-cell depletion  
developed  at other  centers,  the incidence  of acute  GVHD  was higher  than what  we had published  
using  SBA-E-  T-cell depleted  marrow  or CD34+  (ISOLEX)  E- T-cell depleted  PBSC.  Since  we did 
not see significant  GVHD  in the small  number  of patients  that we contributed  to the trial, I ascribed  
the higher  incidence  to limited   experiences  with the CliniMACS   device  and to recent  changes  in the 
grading  system  used for acute  GVHD.  Accordingly,  no change  in procedures  were  made  to protocol  
10-050.

However,  as accrual  to 10-050 proceeded,  we also saw acute  GVHD  in up to 19% of HLA -matched  
cases,  and severe  acute  GVHD  in some  patients  who received  partially   HLA -matched  transplants.  
Again,  the data were  not different  from  the BMT  CTN  trial results.  However,  the rate of acute  
GVHD  was higher  than that reported  by [ADDRESS_102820]  of these  centers,  Perugia  U., did 
incorporate  IVIG  in the incubation  step. 
 
Considering  the possibility   that in the absence  of plasma  or IVIG,  cells can non-specifically   adsorb  
to paramagnetic  beads,  the cytotherapy  laboratory  validated  separation  of CD34+  cells on the 
CliniMACS   in the presence  or absence  of IVIG  in the incubation   period,  demonstrating  comparable  
yields  of CD34+  cells and similar  levels  of T-cell depletion.  Thereafter,  on 7/25/12,  the procedure  
was modified  to include   the IVIG.  In February  2013,  we evaluated  the incidence  of acute  grade  II- 
IV GVHD  and chronic  GVHD  in 19 patients  treated  since  then.  The incidence  of acute  grade  II-IV 
GVHD  has been  5% in the whole  group  and 0% in HLA matched  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Because  of the size of 
the group,  this reduction  in GVH  incidence  does not reach  significance.  
 
 
In order  to be able to meaningfully   compare  the incidence  of acute  GVHD  in patients  receiving  
transplants  fractionated  in the presence  or absence  of IVIG,  we wish to continue  to enroll  patients  to 
all four arms.   To insure  appropriate  representation  of patients  conditioned   on Arm B, we request  
that enrollment  on Arm B continue  for an additional  [ADDRESS_102821]  risk group  of Arm A.

cytoreductive  regimens  as detailed  in the treatment  plan. 
 
5.1.1.  Total  Body  Irradiation  
 
Hyperfractioned  TBI is administered  by a linear  accelerator  at a dose rate of < 20 cGy/minute.    Doses  
of 125 cGy/fraction  are administered  at a minimum   interval  of 4 hours  between  fractions,  three  
times/day  for a total of 11 or 12 doses (1375  or 1500 cGy)  over 4 days (Day  -9, -8, -7, and -6).  If 
general  anesthesia  is required,  150 cGy q12h x 8 doses  to a total dose of 1375  cGy may be given.  
Sequential  doses  are administered  in an anterior/posterior  or lateral  orientation.    Compensators and 
lung blocks  are used to shield  the lung, so that the lung receives  [ADDRESS_102823]  wall dose is

a. Source  and Pharmacology:  Supplier:   Orphan  Medical  Company;  Busulfan  is a 
bifunctional   alkylating   agent known  chemically  as 1,4-butanediol,   dimethanesulfonate.   BUSULFEX®  
(busulfan).  This is an agent  in which  two labile   methanesulfonate  groups  are attached  to opposite   ends 
of a four carbon  alkyl chain.  In aqueous  media,  busulfan  hydrolyzes   to release  the methanesulfonate  
groups.  This produces  reactive  carbonium  ions that can alkylate  DNA.  DNA  damage  is thought  to be 
responsible   for much  of the cytotoxicity   of busulfan.  
 
b. Formulation  and Stability:   It is supplied   as a clear,  colorless,  sterile,  solution   in 
10 mL single   use ampoules.  Each  ampoule  of BUSULFEX  contains  60 mg (6 mg/mL)  of busulfan,  the 
active  ingredient,   a white  crystalline   powder  with a molecular   formula  of CH 3SO 2O(CH 2)4OSO 2CH 3 
and a molecular  weight  of 246 g/mole.  Busulfan  is dissolved  in N,N-dimethylacetamide   (DMA) 33% 
wt/wt  and polyethylene  glycol  400, 67% wt/wt.  Busulfan’s  solubility   in water  is 0.1 g/L and the pH of

a CliniMACS  Tubing  Set, the CliniMACS  CD34  Reagent  and the CliniMACS  PBS/EDTA  Buffer   is 
intended  for the selection  and enrichment  of human  CD34  positive  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells from  a 
leukapheresis   product.  
 
The CD34  antigen  is a cell membrane  glycoprotein  expressed  by [CONTACT_93098].  The CD34  positive  cell separation  process  may be useful  in several  areas  of clinical  stem  cell 
transplantation,  including  purging  of tumor  cells,  T-cell depletion,  ex vivo cell expansion  and gene therapy.  
When  re-infused  after myeloablative  chemotherapy,  CD34  positive  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cells have 
been  shown  to reconstitute  all hematologic  lineages  and exhibit  both short  and long term repopulating  
capacities.  
 
The CliniMACS  System  uses selective  CD34  monoclonal  antibodies  conjugated  to super -paramagnetic  
particles.   The CD34  positive   target  cells are selected  in an automated  continuous   flow separation  system.  
 
The CD34 positive cells are specifically labeled for selection by [CONTACT_93099]34 
Reagent.  After  unbound  reagent  is washed  from  the suspension,  the cells are ready  for the automated  
separation  process.  The CliniMACS  System  passes  the antibody -labeled  suspension,  the cells are ready  for 
the automated separation  process.  The CliniMACS   System  passes  the antibody -labeled  suspension  through  
a column  in which  strong  magnetic  gradients  are generated.  The Selection  Column  retains  the magnetically  
labeled  CD34  positive  cells,  while  unwanted  cells flow through  the Selection  Column  and are collected  in 
the Negative  Fraction  Bag. The system  performs  several  washing  steps,  disposing  most of the liquid  into 
the Buffer  Waste  Bag. The Separated  CD34  positive  cells are released  from  the column  by [CONTACT_93100]. 
 
The components  of the CliniMACS  System  include:  
 
5.3.1 The CliniMACS Instrument

9.2 Selection  of Cytoreduction  Regimen  
 
Patients  eligible   for this protocol  include  individuals   with ALL,  AML,  CML,  multiple   myeloma,  MDS  
or other lethal disorders of hematopoiesis  or immunity  who fulfill  eligibility  requirements and consent 
to treatment.   Stratification  of patients  to one of the four disease -targeted  cytoreductive  regimens  will 
be based  on the patient’s  disease  and stage  of disease  as well as clinical  parameters  that could  increase  
risk of severe  toxicity  or disease  relapse  in the post transplant  period.   Examples  of disease  indications  
for each of the  four cytoreductive  regimen  are summarized  in Table  _1_. The basis  for selection  of a 
specific  regimen  can be briefly  described.

Regimen  A which  combines  total body irradiation,   thiotepa  and cyclophosphamide   (TBI/THIO/CTX)  
is the standard  cytoreduction  regimen  employed  for patients  with high risk ALL  or AML  in 1° or 2° 
CR.  It is also the standard  preparation  used for patients  with diffuse  large  B cell lymphoma  in 2° CR 
or greater as well as for patients  with rare malignant   disorders  such as hemophagocytic  
lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH) treated with a T-cell depleted graft.  Selection of an alternate 
cytoreduction  regimen  for these  disease  indications   will be based  on clinical  parameters  which  
preclude  TBI or suggest  that this conditioning   would  be too toxic or less likely   to induce  durable  
remissions.  
Regimen  B which  combines  busulfan,  melphalan  and fludarabine , is a regimen  that has been  tested  
with T-cell depleted  grafts  fractionated  on the Isolex  device  (IRB  01-055).  It is a chemotherapeutic  
regimen  that secures  consistent  engraftment and has been particularly  effective  for patients  with AML  
and MDS  as well as patients  with multiple   myeloma.    It  should  be the cytoreduction  regimen  of 
choice  for multiple   myeloma  and for AML  > 2° CR and for MDS,  including   patients  with advanced  
MDS  who are not eligible   for transplantation  under  protocol  08-008.  It  should  also be the regimen  
employed  for those  patients  who,  by [CONTACT_93113], prior radiation  exposure,  or 
prior cardiac,  renal  or gastrointestinal  disorders  cannot  receive  total body irradiation   or 
cyclophosphamide.  
Regimen  C, which  combines  clofarabine,  melphalan  and thiotepa   has been  tested  with unmodified  
HLA -compatible  transplants  (IRB 06-125) and has shown  particular  promise  in the treatment  of high 
risk and advanced  forms  of ALL, including   infant  ALL.   It  should  be the regimen  of choice  for 
patients  with ALL  referred  after a first relapse,  for infants  and young  children  with high risk ALL  in 
1° CR or others  with ALL  or DLBCL  who are at undue  risk of early  and/or  late toxicities  associated  
with TBI or cyclophosphamide.  
Regimen  D, which  combines  fludarabine,  melphalan  and thiotepa   has been  employed  successfully  for 
cytoreduction  of heavily  transfused  patients  with congenital  acquired  cytopenias,  aplastic  anemia,  
genetic  immune   deficiencies,  and acquired  auto immune   disorders  resulting  in severe  autoimmune  
cytopenias  and lymphoproliferative   disease  and refractory  leukemia.  The immunosuppressive   activity  
of thiotepa  and fludarabine,  coupled  with the myeloablation   induced  by [CONTACT_93114],  has 
generated  consistent  full engraftment  with only moderate  gastrointestinal   toxicities.

9.4 Cytoreduction Regimens in Preparation for Transplantation 
 
Please  note: prior  to transplant,  an additional  day of rest may be added  to the treatment  
schedule, due to unforeseen scheduling issues. 
9.4.1.  Regimen  A: Hyperfractioned Total  Body  Irradiation,  Thiotepa  and Cyclophosphamide.  
 
Hyperfractionated  TBI is administered  at a dose rate of < 20 cGy/minute.  Doses  of 125 cGy/fraction  
are administered  at a minimum  interval  of 4 hours  between  fractions,  three  times/day  for a total of 11 
or 12 doses  (1375  or 1500 cGy)  over 4 days (Day  -9, -8, -7 and -6). 
1500  cGy will be administered  to children  ≤ 18 years  of age with  ALL  > 1CR,  since  the higher  dose 
has greater  anti-leukemic  activity  and is well tolerated.  Older  patie nts, but ≤ 21 years of age, with ALL  
types  seen predominantly   in children  and adolescents  (e.g. T-cell leukemia/lymphoma   syndrome)  may 
also receive  a dose of 1500cGy  TBI, if the attending  physician  considers  it appropriate  and likely   to be 
well tolerated.  Sequential  doses  are administered  in an anterior/posterior  or lateral  orientation.   Lung  
blocks  will be used to reduce  the lung dose to [ADDRESS_102835]  wall dose is approximately  1500 cGy, so as to 
insure  that marrow  sites in the ribs are adequately  treated.  
In addition,  male patients  receiving  transplants  for ALL  or AML  will receive  an additional   dose of 400 
cGy to the testes  to reduce  the risk of relapse  from  leukemia  cells in this privileged   site. 
If general  anesthesia  is required  for TBI administration   (e.g. young  children),  a dose of 150 cGy q12h 
x 8 doses  to a total dose of 1375  cGy may be given.  
9.4.1.b  Thiotepa  
 
Thiotepa:  5mg/kg/day  IV over approximately  4 hr  daily x 2 (Day -5 and Day -4). If scheduling  of 
transplant  harvests  requires,  the dose of Thiotepa  may be administered  as a single  dose of 10mg/  kg/ 
day x 1. On days when  Thiotepa  and ATG  are both administered,  Thiotepa  will be administered  first, 
followed  by [CONTACT_93115].  In select  cases  in which  the peripheral  blood  stem  cells must be harvested  a day 
later than requested  due to a scheduling  issue  with the donor  or Stem  Cell Processing  Laboratory,  
there  may be a day of rest between  the last day of radiation  and the first day of thiotepa  (Donor  can 
only donate  on Friday).  Alternatively,  if the peripheral  blood  stem  cells must be handled  a day earlier  
than requested,  the doses  of Thiotepa  may be given  approximately  12 hours  apart  on Day -4/-5. 
Thiotepa  dosing  will be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  of ideal body weight  and will be calculated  based  
on adjusted  ideal body weight,  as per MSKCC  standard  of care guidelines.  
9.4.1.c  Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide:   60 mg/kg/day  IV over approximately  30 min daily x 2 days (d –3 and –2).  On 
days when  Cyclophosphamide   and ATG  are both administered,  Cyclophosphamide   will be 
administered  first, followed  by [CONTACT_93115].  If a patient  cannot  receive  cyclophosphamide   due to a prior 
history  of hemorrhagic  cystitis  or exposure  to high doses  of cyclophosphamide   or ifosfamide,  the 
patient  may receive  fludarabine  25mg/m2/day x 5 days.  Cyclophosphamide   dosing  will be adjusted  if 
patient  is > 125%  of ideal body  weight  and will be calculated  based  on adjusted  ideal body weight,  as

renal  toxicity.  
9.3.1d Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (thymoglobulin) and Methylprednisolone (MPD) 
Rabbit  ATG will be given  to all transplant  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  > 18 years  old. Rabbit  ATG  will also be given  to 
patients  ≤ 18 years  of age who receive  transplants  from  donors  other  than HLA -matched  related  
siblings   on this arm. Rabbit  antithymocyte  globulin   (Genzyme)  will be administered  on day -4 and -3 
at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day.   If the patient  has a history  of allergy  or intolerance  to rabbit  ATG,  equine  
antithymocyte  globulin   at a dose of 15 mg/kg  x 2 or 30 mg/kg  x [ADDRESS_102837] dose of ATG,  the second  dose can be delayed  until day 
+5. Methylprednisolone   1 mg/kg  will be given  as premedication.   Additional   medications  to prevent  or 
treat reactions  will be administered  as indicated  according  to institutional   guidelines.   Patients  receiving  
transplants  from  HLA -mismatched  donors  should  receive  an additional   dose of ATG  on day 
-2 or -1, depending  on when  the doses  are administered.  If patient  is receiving  a second  transplant  
from  the same  donor,  ATG  administration   will be at the discretion  of the physician.  ATG  dosing  will 
be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  of ideal body  weight  and will be calculated  based  on adjusted  ideal 
body  weight,  as per MSKCC  standard  of care guidelines.  
Because  Acetaminophen  depletes  glutathione   and the alkylators   require  glutathione   transferase  for 
their metabolism,  Acetaminophen  administration   is discouraged  during  the course  of cytoreduction.

For patients  with multiple   myeloma:  only .8 mg/Kg/dose  Q6H  X 10 doses/3  days IV will be 
administered.  
busulfan  dosing  and administration:  
 
Patients  will have busulfan  levels  drawn  whenever possible   after the first dose on day 1, with 
adjustments  in dosing  based  on the pharmacokinetics  of the first dose according  to institutional  
standard  clinical  practice,  as indicated.  The doses  administered  on days -9 and -8 should  be adjusted  if 
patient  is > 125%  ideal body  weight  and should  be calculated  on adjusted  ideal body weight  per 
MSKCC  standard  of care guidelines.   Once  pharmacokinetics  are available,  subsequent  dosing  will be 
adjusted  as per  institutional   guidelines.  
Keppra  (Levetiracetam)  will be administered  as per institutional   guidelines   to all research  participants  
prior to starting  busulfex  for the prevention  of busulfan -associated  seizures.  In case of allergic  
reactions  to Levetiracetam,  alternative  anti-seizure  medications  will be used as clinically   indicated.  
9.4.2.b  Melphalan  
 
Melphalan  70 mg/m2/day x 2 days IV over 30 minutes  
 
melphalan  dosing  and administration:  
Dose  should  be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  ideal body weight  and should  be calculated  on adjusted

Clofarabine  will be administered  after premedication  with hydrocortisone.   Hydrocortisone  was added  
to the amended protocol in an attempt to prevent hepatic inflammation  and elevation of transaminases. 
The timing   of conditioning   may be lengthened  by 2 days based  if deemed  clinically   necessary  and 
approved  by [CONTACT_978]. 
 
Hydrocortisone  will be dosed  at 50 mg/m2  dose IV once daily pre-clofarabine  (maximum  100 mg). 
 
9.3.3b  Thiotepa  
 
Thiotepa  will be administered  via approximately  a 4 hour intravenous  infusion   at a dose of 
10mg/kg/day  for 1 dose (day –4). Thiotepa  may also be administered  at 5mg/kg/day  IV over 
approximately  4 hr daily x 2 days (Day -5 and Day -4), depending  on scheduling  of transplant  harvests.  
In select  cases  in which  the peripheral  blood  stem  cells must be harvested  a day later than requested  
due to a scheduling  issue  with the donor  or Stem  Cell Processing  Laboratory,  there  may be a day of 
rest between  the last day of clofarabine  and the first day of thiotepa.  Thiotepa  dosing  will be adjusted   
if patient  is > 125%  of ideal  body weight  and will be calculated  based  on adjusted  ideal body  weight,   
as per MSKCC  standard  of care guidelines.  
 
9.3.3c  Melphalan  
 
Melphalan  will be administered  via approximately   a 30 minutes  infusion  at a dose of 70mg/m2/day for 
2 doses (days  -3, and -2). Melphalan  dosing  will be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  of ideal body weight  
and will be calculated  based  on adjusted  ideal body weight,  as per MSKCC  standard  of care

9.3.4a  Fludarabine  
Fludarabine  will be administered  via approximately  a 30 minute  infusion   at a dose of 25 mg/m2/day 
for 5 days (day -6 through  day -2). Fludarabine  may be adjusted  in the case of renal  toxicity.  
 
9.3.4b  Melphalan  
 
Melphalan  will be administered  via approximately   a 30 minute  infusion   at a dose of 70mg/m2/day for 
2 doses (days  -8, and -7). Melphalan  dosing  will be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  of ideal body weight  
and will be calculated  based  on adjusted  ideal body  weight,  as per MSKCC  standard  of care 
guidelines.  
 
9.3.4c  Thiotepa  
Thiotepa  will be administered  via approximately  a 4 hour intravenous  infusion   at a dose of 
5mg/kg/day  IV over approximately  4 hr daily x 2 days (Day -6 and Day -5). Thiotepa  may also be 
administered  at 10mg/kg/day  for 1 dose (day –5) depending  on scheduling   of transplant  harvests.  
Thiotepa  dosing  will be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  of ideal body weight  and will be calculated  based  
on adjusted  ideal body weight,  as per MSKCC  standard  of care guidelines.  
In select  cases  in which  the peripheral  blood  stem  cells must be harvested  a day later than requested  
due to a scheduling  issue  with the donor  or Stem  Cell Processing  Laboratory,  there  may be a day of 
rest between  the last day of melphalan  and the first day of fludarabine   and thiotepa.

9.3.4d  Rabbit  Anti-thymocyte  Globulin  (Thymoglobulin®) and Methylprednisolone (MPD)  
 
Rabbit  ATG  will be administered  in the pre-transplant  period  for all research  participants  on this arm. 
Research  participants  will receive  rabbit  ATG  (Thymoglobulin®)   at 2.5 mg/Kg/day  x 2 days on days - 
3 and -2. If the patient  has a history  of allergy  or intolerance  to rabbit  ATG,  equine  antithymocyte  
globulin   at a dose of 15 mg/kg  x 2 or 30 mg/kg  x [ADDRESS_102842] dose of ATG,  the second  dose can be delayed  until day +5.  Methylprednisolone   will be given  
at 1 mg/Kg/day  x 2 days with the ATG  administration   and will be discontinued   thereafter.  Patients  
receiving  transplants  from  HLA -mismatched  donors  should  receive  an additional   dose of ATG  on day 
-1. If patient  is receiving  a second  transplant  from  the same  donor,  ATG  administration   will be at the 
discretion  of the  physician.  ATG  dosing  will be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  of ideal body weight  and 
will be calculated  based  on adjusted  ideal body  weight,  as per MSKCC standard  of care guidelines.  
Because  Acetaminophen  depletes  glutathione   and the alkylators   require  glutathione   transferase  for 
their metabolism,  Acetaminophen  administration   is discouraged  during  the course  of cytoreduction .

Donor  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cells:  stimulation,   harvesting,  isolation   and T-cell depletion .  For 
related  donors , GCSF  will be administered  according  to MSKCC standard  of care.  For unrelated  
donors , the G-CSF will be administered  and the leukapheresis  obtained  according  to the National  
Marrow  Donor  Program  protocol  and IND.  Mononuclear  cell fractions  collected  on the fourth  and 
fifth days will be pooled.  
 
HLA-compatible donors (9/10 or 10/10 HLA-matched), whenever possible, will be further prioritized 
based  on KIR/HLA  genotype  combinations  between  the donor  and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Donors  who are 
KIR3DS1  (40%  of the population)   are prioritized   in order  to improve  transplant -related  mortality   and 
to prevent  viral reactivation61. For patients  with AML/MDS/blastic  CML,  two donor  populations  are 
desired:  1) donors  who exhibit  the HLA -C1 class  I KIR ligand  group  and who are KIR2DS1 -positive  
(34%  of all donors)  62, and 2) donors  who are negative  for KIR2DL3  and homozygous  for KIR2DL2  
(cenBB  compound  haplotype,  17% of all donors)  63. In addition,  allele  level typi[INVESTIGATOR_93024]3DL1  may be incorporated  into donor  selection,  where  donors  with KIR3DL1  alleles  with low 
affinity  will be selected  over donors  with high affinity  for the patients  HLA -Bw4  allele64. For 
AML/MDS/blastic  CML  patients  whose  HLA -C alleles  belong  to the HLA -C2 class  KIR ligand  group  
(HLA -C2C2)  and who are at higher  risk of relapse65-67, consideration  may be given  to choosing  an 
HLA -C1C2  donor.   In this situation,  the donor  will, by [CONTACT_108],   be mismatched  for one HLA -C locus  
in order  to capture  donor  NK alloreactivity  due to “missing   self.”  
 
 
Isolation  of CD34+  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells with the CliniMACS  TM System,  Miltenyi  
Biotec. 
The apheresis  product  is collected  from  a blood -related  or matched  unrelated  donor.  Aliquots  of the 
apheresis  product  are collected  and then tested  and screened  as per blood  banking  guidelines.   The 
apheresis  product  is then prepped  for the CliniMACS   Cell Selection  System.  After  washing  the GCSF  
mobilized   PBSC,  the cells are suspended  in CliniMACS   PBS/EDTA  buffer to  which  is added  sterile  
human  intravenous  Immune  Globulin   at a concentration  of 1.5mg  IVIG/ml.  This fluid  is then used 
during  incubation   of the PBSC with the antiCD34  antibody  coated  paramagnetic  beads.  
The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell 
sorting,  which  can select  or remove  specific  cell types  depending  on the cell-specific  immunomagnetic  
label used.  The apheresis  product  is first co-incubated  with the CliniMacs   CD34  reagent  (antibody - 
coated  paramagnetic  particles).  After magnetic  labeling   and washing,  the cells are passed  through  a 
high-gradient   magnetic  separation  column  in the CliniMACS   clinical  cell selection  device.  
Magnetically  labeled  CD34+  cells are retained  in the magnetized  column,   and CD34-negative  cells flow 
through  as the effluent  fraction  and discarded.  The CD34+positive  cells retained  in the column  are eluted  
by [CONTACT_93116],  then washing  the cells through  the column  and 
collecting   them.  The final CD34+  cell enriched  product  is concentrated  by [CONTACT_93117].   Before  infusion,  the CD34+  cells will be washed  in normal  
saline  for intravenous  infusion   containing  1% human  serum  albumin,  and suspended  in a volume  of 
25-[ADDRESS_102845]  testing.  After  each step (apheresis,  platelet  washing,  CD34  labeling   and washing,  enrichment),  
QC testing  includes;  Sterility.   Endotoxin,   gram  stain,  Total  nucleated  cells (TNC),  flow cytometry  
phenotype/analysis   of CD45,  CD34,  and CD3,  and viability   assessed  by 7-AAD  is assessed.  To ensure  
sterility,  14-day sterility  tests are  performed  for in-process  sterility  testing  and a gram  stain is 
performed  on the final product  prior to release.

Patients  recruited  to this transplantation  trial are individuals   who are either  referred  by [CONTACT_93119]- 
referred  for peripheral  blood  stem  cell transplantation  as a potentially   curative  treatment  for their malignancy  
or other  life threatening  disorders.  Prior  to consideration  for transplant,  all patients  undergo  a series  of 1-3 
hour consultations  discussing  the risks and potential  benefits  of an allogeneic   stem  cell transplantation  and the

different  procedures  which  will be a normal  part of the transplant  course.  The risks and potential  benefits  of 
the transplant  procedure,  as well as the participation   in any given  research,  experimental,  or therapeutic  
protocol  are also discussed.  
 
 
11.1 Toxicities/Side  effects  of conditioning  regimens  
 
The risks of short -term treatment  with G-CSF are likely  negligible.   However,  administration   of GCSF  is 
frequently  associated  with low grade  fever  and low back pain which  usually  resolves  within  one day following  
cessation  of GCSF  treatment.  Furthermore,  there  has now been  one recorded  patient  who developed  acute  
splenomegaly  and splenic  rupture  in response  to high dose GCSF.  The bone pain may require  treatment  with 
analgesics.  The risks of a leukapheresis  are negligible,   involving   an occasional  vasovagal  response  to 
venipuncture  and the minimal  hemodynamic   alterations  associated  with single  unit phlebotomies.   To protect  
against  these  risks,  leukapheresis  are conducted  in the Blood  Bank  Donor  Room  with full medical  and nursing  
supervision  and support  systems  to address  adverse  events.  
 
11.1.1  Total  Body  Irradiation  
Likely  
• Nausea  and vomiting   - virtually   all patients  will experience  nausea  and vomiting   after irradiation.  
This can be diminished   somewhat  with mild  anti-emetics.  Strong  sedatives  or phenothiazine  
derivatives  should  be avoided  just before  radiation  treatment,  as they frequently  cause  excessive  
drowsiness  and/or  symptomatic   orthostasis,  which  prevent  delivery  of TBI done in the standing  
position.  
 
• Myelosuppression  is the major  dose-limiting   toxicity.  
 
• Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]   - most patients  will get some  degree  of hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_93026]  2-3 weeks of 
transplantation.  
 
• Increased  risk of infection  
 
• Mucositis  - most patients  will develop  moderate  to severe  mucositis  of the oral and GI tracts,  which  
will be managed  with aggressive  nursing  mouth  care,  analgesics  and prophylactic   antifungal  and 
antiviral   agents.  
 
• Late effects  - there  is the possibility   of cataract  formation.  Although  mild  cataracts  may occur  in up to 
70% of cases  with single   dose TBI, we have seen cataracts in < 30% of patients  treated  with 
hyperfractionated  TBI. 
 
• Sterility   is extremely  common  following   total body irradiation   and administration   of alkylating  
chemotherapy;  the risk increases  with the number  of years  since  puberty.  
 
Less  Likely  
• Parotitis  - some  patients  will experience  symptomatic  parotitis  within  the first [ADDRESS_102849] radiation.  
This resolves  spontaneously  over several  days.  
 
• Diarrhea  - most patients  develop  some  diarrhea  in the first week  post irradiation.   This can be treated  
symptomatically.  
 
• Fever – low grade  fever  [greater  than 38°C]  may occur  for [ADDRESS_102850] irradiation.   This can be treated  
symptomatically.

• Erythema  - this may occur  in patients  within  24 hours  and resolves  in 2-3 days.  
 
• Hypothyroidism   has been  reported  in small  numbers  of adult patients  following   TBI plus alkylating  
chemotherapy,  and this will be routinely   monitored  post transplant  with hormonal  replacement  as 
indicated.  
 
• There  is a possibility   that secondary  malignancies  may develop,  particularly  due to the combined  
effects  of radiation  and an alkylating   agent  [cyclophosphamide].   The age-adjusted  incidence  of 
secondary  cancer  in transplant  patients  after radiation  and chemotherapy  has recently  been  estimated  
to be 6.[ADDRESS_102851] cancers  in the general  population;   and most  of these  were  non- 
Hodgkin's   lymphomas.  
 
• veno-occlusive  disease  of the liver (VOD)  
 
11.1.2  Thiotepa  
Likely  
• Myelosuppression  is the major  dose-limiting   toxicity,   occurring  regularly  at doses  >405mg/m2.  Other  
non-fatal toxicities   have been  observed  almost  exclusively   after administration   of thiotepa  at doses  
greater  than 1000mg/m2. 
 
• Increased  risk of infection.  
 
• Cutaneous  erythema  and bronzing   is seen in most patients  given   900mg/m2. Erythema  develops  4- 
14d after the first dose and may last up to 3wks.  Bronzing   may persist  for months.  
 
Less  Likely  
 
• Nausea,  vomiting,   diarrhea  - occasional,  rarely  severe.  
 
Rare  but Serious  
 
• CNS  toxicity   manifested  by [CONTACT_93120],   disorientation,   confusion,  irritability,   bizarre  
behavior,  is usually  not observed  at doses  <1000mg/m2. 
 
• Interstitial  pneumonia  
 
• Renal  failure  
 
• Transient  hepatic  transaminase  elevations   are occasionally  seen,  but rarely  severe.  
 
11.1.3  Cyclophosphamide  
Likely  
• Myelosuppression  
 
• Increased  risk of infection  
 
• Edema  and weight  gain secondary  to inappropriate   ADH  secretion  can occur  in some  patients,  but 
can usually  be corrected  with medical  management  
 
• Gastrointestinal:   anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,   and diarrhea  occur  commonly,   but are reversible.

• Elevated  transaminases  are usually  transient  
 
• Alopecia,  amenorrhea,  azoospermia  would  be expected  to occur.  
 
Less  Likely  
 
• Hemorrhagic  cystitis  can be severe  and in few cases,  life threatening.  
 
Rare  but Serious  
 
• Cardiotoxicity   can be severe  and in few cases,  life threatening.  
 
11.1.4  Busulfan

• Fatigue  
 
• Anorexia  
 
• Nausea  and Vomiting  
 
• Mucositis

• anaphylaxis  
 
• seizures  
 
• kidney  failure  
 
• veno-occlusive  disease  of the liver (VOD)  
 
11.1.6  Fludarabine  
Likely  
• Nausea,  vomiting,   mouth  sores,  stomach  cramps  and diarrhea,  jaundice,  and elevations  of liver enzymes.  
 
• Scaling  and redness  of the  skin, which  is usually   of short  duration.  
 
• Transient  but significant  myelosuppression   at the doses  called  for in this protocol.   Fludarabine   is also 
profoundly   immunosuppressive.    These  toxicities  place  the patient  at increased  risk for infections   for 
periods  of 1-2 months.  
 
 
 
Rare  but Serious  
 
• Effects  on the nervous  system  are not usually  seen at the fludarabine  dose used in this protocol,  but, when  
they occur,  can include  cerebellar dysfunction  with loss of balance  and trouble  walking,  blurring  of vision  
or, in extremely  rare cases,  blindness,  and mental  agitation  or confusion.

11.1.7  Clofarabine  
Likely  
• Reversible  hepatotoxicity   is the major  dose-limiting   toxicity.    This is most commonly   demonstrated  by a 
transient  elevation  of transaminases.   Hyperbilirubinemia   was less common.  
• Dermatitis  and pruritus  
• nausea,  vomiting   , diarrhea,  abdominal  pain 
• myelosuppression   and pancytopenia  
• headache

11.1.8  Rabbit  Antithymocyte  Globulin  (Thymoglobulin)  
 
The ATG  to be used in this trial is a purified  preparation  of rabbit  gamma  globulin  containing  high 
concentrations  of antibodies  against  human  lymphocytes.  The preparation  may contain  low levels  of 
antibody  that cross -react  with human  platelets,  white  cells or red cells.  The potential  side effects of ATG  
are: 
 
Likely  
 
• Fever,  shaking,  chills   and lowered  blood  pressure:  These  are regularly  observed,  particularly  during  initial 
infusions  of the rabbit  globulin.    They  probably  result  from  a breakdown  of cells binding   the antibody.  
 
• Skin rash and itching:  A frequent  complication  which  is probably  due to minor  allergic  reactions  to rabbit  
globulin.  These  symptoms  will usually  be prevented  by [CONTACT_93121]-histamines  as well as with 
concomitant  administration   of corticosteroids.  
 
• Platelet  and white  cell count  depression:  These  are frequently  observed  and are probably  caused  by [CONTACT_93122].  Platelet  transfusions  will be administered  to reduce  
the chance  of bleeding  or life threatening  hemorrhage.  
 
 
Less  Likely  
 
• Serum  sickness:   Approximately   30% of patients  treated  with rabbit  globulin   will develop  a late immune  
reaction  to the globulin   resulting   in serum  sickness  3-10 days after the administration.     This may lead to

11.2 Toxicities/Side  effects  of the transplant  and the combined  effects  of the conditioning  regimen 
and transplant  
 
In addition  to tracking  patients  for survival  and relapse,  all participants  may also be monitored  for post- 
transplant  toxicities.  
 
Grade  3-4 toxicities  which  occur  within  30 days following  a transplant  AND  are also possibly,  probably,  or 
definitely  attributable  to the CliniMACS  device  will be graded  and attributed.  Additional  toxicities  will be 
reviewed  and graded/attributed  at the discretion  of the PI. 
 
Toxicities  which  are attributable  to underlying   malignancy   and/or  expected  toxicities   from  the transplant  will 
not be tracked.  
 
The grading  for monitoring   transplant  related  toxicities  will be based  on the CTCAE  4.0 (57).

11.2.5  Graft   Failure  / Poor  Marrow  Function  
 
T cell depletion  of donor  cells is associated  with an increased  incidence  of graft failure  in allogeneic  transplant  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  After  allogeneic  transplantation,  the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]'s  marrow  function  may be poor and leukopenia, 
anemia,  or thrombocytopenia  may result  from  many  causes including  graft rejection  induced  by [CONTACT_93123]  T-cells,  or ongoing  suppression  of engrafted  donor  blood -forming  cells by [CONTACT_93124],  infection  or marrow  
suppression  or immunosuppressive   drugs  and other  medications.   Graft  failure  may result  in death  if not reversed.  
In patients  with immune  rejection  second  transplants  can be administered  with immunosuppressive  therapy,  
including  non-myeloablative  conditioning  regimens.  For patients  who are engrafted  with donor  cells but have 
severe  cytopenia   affecting  one or more  blood  cell lineages,  secondary  transplants  of CliniMACS  fractionated  
CD34+  T-cell depleted  PBSCs may be administered  to booster  and replenish  donor  hematopoietic  cells without  
conditioning   or after treatment  with anti- thymocyte  globulin.  
 
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_102854] Disease  
 
Acute  or chronic  GVHD  may develop  after allogeneic   transplantation  that can be disabling   and can lead to 
death.   GVHD  is thought  to be initiated   by T cells contained  in the PBSC  graft.   CD34+ selection  and CD3+ 
depletion  reduces  the number  of T cells in the PBSC  but GVHD  can occur  after  TCD  transplants.  Acute  and/or  
chronic  GVHD  will be treated  with immunosuppressive   drugs  as per the transplant  service  guidelines.  
 
11.2.7  Veno -occlusive  Disease  (VOD)  of the Liver  
VOD  is a manifestation  of damage  to the liver by [CONTACT_93125]:  
• Hyperbilirubinemia   (total  bilirubin   > 2 mg/dL)  
• Hepatomegaly  or right upper  quadrant  pain, or 
• Rapid  weight  gain (> 5% above  baseline)  
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93030].   TCD  is not expected  to affect  the risk of VOD.  
11.2.8  End Organ  Damage  
 
End organ  damage  of all or any of the major  organs,  including   the brain,  may occur  as a result  of cumulative  
toxicity  from  anti-neoplastic   therapy,  reactions  to other  drugs,  and as a result  of destructive  processes  (e.g.,  
infection, GVHD , etc.) and may have a fatal outcome.  Toxicities may occur in any individual  patient due to 
multiple   events  and cumulative  effects that may involve   any and all organs,  including   the brain.   Brain  damage  
can result  in severe  loss of cognitive  or neurologic   function.   Data  from  previous  studies  do not suggest  that  
the risk of end organ  damage  is appreciably  affected  by [CONTACT_93126].  
 
11.2.9  Disease  Relapse  
 
Allogeneic   transplantation  using  T cell depleted  peripheral  blood  stem  cells has, in some  cases,  been  
associated  with an increased  incidence  of leukemic   relapse  in patients  with chronic  myelogenous  leukemia,  
compared  to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93031].  The risk of relapse  has not been  increased  in 
patients  with acute  leukemias.  Nevertheless,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_93032] a transplant,  relapse  may occur.

Administrative Update 1 : [ADDRESS_102855] an increased  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_93033]  (47, 48).  This syndrome  should  be included  in the differential  diagnosis  of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_93034],  diarrhea,  hepatomegaly  or lymphadenopathy.    Biopsy  evaluation  is 
required  to make  the diagnosis.   EBV  PTLD may rapi[INVESTIGATOR_93035].   Management  
of suspected  EBV  PTLD should  be discussed  with one of the Protocol  P.I.s.   EBV  PTLD  can be treated  with 
rituximab   and/or  infusion   of 106  T cells/kg  from  the donor.   Rituximab  has been  shown  to induce  regression  in 
50 - 70% of cases  (49).  However,  Rituximab  does not enter  the CNS  and is not effective  in treating  CNS  
disease.   Donor  lymphocyte  infusions   may induce  regression  in > 90% of cases  of EBV  PTLD and are 
effective  in CNS  disease  but may cause  GVHD  (50). EBV -immune  cells are experimental,  but can also induce  
regression  of EBV PTLD without  risk of graft vs host disease  (51, 52). 
 
11.2.11  Death  
 
There  is an approximately  5-10% risk of treatment  related  mortality   within  the first month  of transplant  due to 
the risk of severe  regimen  related  toxicity,  hemorrhage,  opportunistic   infection,  or other  complications.    It is 
not expected  that the regimens  to be used in this protocol  will increase  this risk. 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC   RESPONSE/OUTCOME   ASSESSMENT  
 
 De finition  of e ve nts in the post-trans  plant  course  important  for analys  is and tre atme  nt 
 
12.[ADDRESS_102856]  cytogenetic  studies  at about  1 month,  100 days,  6 months,  12 months,  and 24 months  posttransplant  
or as needed  thereafter.  
 
12.2 Graft   failure  or rejection  
 
Primary  non-engraftment  is diagnosed  when  the patient  fails to achieve  an ANC  500/l at any time in the first 
[ADDRESS_102857]-transplant.  If the patient's  leukemia  recurs during  this interval,  the patient  is scored  as having  
refractory  leukemia.  In such a situation,  the absence  of donor  hematopoiesis  is not evaluable  for graft failure  or 
rejection. If host T-cells capable of specifically inhibiting  donor hematopoietic  progenitor growth in vitro are 
concurrently  detected  during  graft failure,  a presumptive  diagnosis  of immune  mediated  rejection  is made  (53, 
54). If (1) after achievement  of an ANC  500/mm3, the ANC  declines  to <500/mm3   for more  than 3 
consecutive  days in the absence  of relapse,  or, (2) there  is absence  of donor  cells in the marrow  and/or  blood   as 
demonstrated  by [CONTACT_93127],  a diagnosis  of secondary  graft failure  is made.  If, 
however,  recurrence  of host leukemia   is detected  concurrently,  the patient  is not evaluable  for graft failure  or 
rejection.  
Patients  with evidence  of graft failure  without  evidence  of recurrence  of host leukemia   may have additional  
studies  drawn  to ascertain  cause  and define  relevant  histoincompatibilities.    These  analyses  may include   (1) 
Evaluation  of bone marrow  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_93036],  when  indicated,  (2) 
Culture  and/or  molecular  analyses  of marrow  and blood  for viral pathogens  potentially   causing  graft failure  
including   CMV,  HHV6  and parvovirus  B 19, (3) Immunophenotypic   and genetic  analysis  of circulating  T- 
cells and NK cells to ascertain  their origin   and potential  function,  (4) Analysis  of the functional  activity  of 
residual  circulating   lymphocytes  to determine  whether  and to what  degree  they exhibit   cytotoxic  or cyto- 
inhibitory   activity  against  donor  host or third party  PHA -stimulated  blasts  or clonogenic   hematopoietic  
progenitor  cells.  If donor -specific   reactivity  is identified,   attempts  will be made  to identify  targeted  
specificities   (HLA  or minor   alloantigens)   whenever  possible.

Administrative Update 1 : [ADDRESS_102858]  BMT -CTN  and IBMTR  systems  clinical  criteria  as defined  by [CONTACT_93128],  et al (55) will be used to 
establish  and grade  acute  GvHD.  
To determine  the severity  of acute  GvHD,  data will be collected  approximately  weekly  to characterize  the 
severity  of symptoms  and signs  caused  by [CONTACT_93129].  Real time data 
collection   will include   descriptive  characteristics  of rash and estimated  body surface  area involved,  extent  of 
dermal/epi[INVESTIGATOR_93037],  identification   of concomitant  causes  of increased  bilirubin   other  than GvHD,  
presence  or absence  of nausea,  vomiting   or anorexia  persistent  after engraftment,  peak  diarrhea  volume  with 
annotations  concerning  the presence  after engraftment,  peak  diarrhea  volume  with annotations  concerning  the 
presence  or absence  of urinary  mixing   and estimates  of true diarrhea  volume,   presence  or absence  of 
abdominal  cramps,  presence  or absence  of frank  stool blood  or melena,  concomitant  causes  of GI symptoms  
other  than GvHD,  biopsy  results,  identification   of any agents  used for treatment  and autopsy  results.  
Patients  will be observed  for acute  and/or  chronic  GvHD  as long as they have not received  donor  derived  
leukocytes  infusion   (DLI).  If at any time,  a patient  receives  DLI,  that time will represent  the end-time for 
evaluation  of GvHD.  Graft -versus -host disease  occurring  after DLI infusions   will be analyzed  separately.  
Patients  with moderate  to severe  acute  GvHD  (grade  II-IV) will be treated  in standard  fashion  with high-dose 
I.V. methylprednisolone   (2-20mg/kg/day)   or in combination   with other  immunosuppressants   as per ongoing  
trials on GvHD  and at the discretion  of the treating  attending.  Patients  failing   to respond  to steroids  will be 
considered  for treatment  with experimental  treatments  available   at the time of diagnosis   of GvHD.  
Chronic  GvHD  will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to the criteria  of Sullivan  (56) treated  with standard  or 
experimental  immunosuppressive   therapy.  Treatment  will consist  of corticosteroids,  cyclosporin  A or 
azathioprine,   or combinations  of these  agents.  Other novel  treatments  could  be used if available,  i.e. 
thalidomide   and psoralen/ultraviolet   A phototherapy  (PUVA).  
 
12.4.  Transplant  related  mortality  
Transplant-related mortality  (TRM)  includes   fatal complications   resulting  from  the allogenic   transplant  and/ 
or treatment regimens  such as graft failure,  GvHD,  hemorrhages,  and infections.  
12.5.  Infections  
 
The occurrence  of life-threatening  opportunistic   infections   will be evaluated  according  to the criteria  
established  by [CONTACT_93130].  The infection -related  
mortality  will be also determined.  Patients  will be considered  to have died from  infection  if death  is attributed  
to a recent  severe  infection  and/or  infection  was identified  at autopsy.  Patients  with relapsed  disease  or GVHD  
before  death  will be excluded  from  the above  definition,   even  if an infection  was the final cause  of death.  
 
12.6.  Disease  relapse  and recurrence  
 
Relapse  of MDS,  ALL  and AML  will be defined  by [CONTACT_93131] 5%, by [CONTACT_93132],  or by [CONTACT_93133]: 10 -050 A(26)

site. Cytogenetic  and/or  Molecular  analysis  of the marrow  and/or  peripheral  blood   will also be obtained  for the 
diagnosis   of relapse.  
Relapse  of myeloma  and lymphoma   will be diagnosed  by [CONTACT_93134].  A sustained  risk in the serum  concentration  of myeloma  paraprotein  will also be 
considered  evidence  of relapse.  
Disease  recurrence  
 
In non-neoplastic   diseases,  disease  recurrence  would  be considered  if engraftment  of donor  hemopoietic   cells 
have not been  achieved  and function  or phenotypic   abnormalities   of hemopoietic   or lymphoid   lineages  
affected,  occur.

13.0 CRITERIA  FOR  REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Research  participants  may be removed  from  the study  if requested  by [CONTACT_93135].  Management  
will depend  on where  they are in their treatment  course.  Such  research  participants  will receive  appropriate  
supportive   care.  Patients  may also be removed  from  the study  at any point deemed  appropriate  by [CONTACT_93136].  
 
Patients  may be removed  from  study,  and not followed  further,  if one or more  of the following   events  occur:  
 
- Significant   noncompliance   on the part of the patient  
- Refusal  of the patient  to continue  treatment  or observations  
- Progressive  disease  or relapse  
- Decision  by [CONTACT_93137]’s  best medical  interest

Administrative Update 1 : [ADDRESS_102866] modified  the eligibility  criteria to include individuals  under the age of 70. In addition, patients with 
mismatched  donors  will receive  an additional   dose of ATG.  
Given  the modification   in the patient  population,   treatment,  and the classification  of risk used for patient  
evaluation,  we proposed  amendment  3 to the protocol  to accrue  an additional  30 patients  to each of the  six 
strata,  determined  by [CONTACT_93138]  (section  4.2). The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_93040]  [ADDRESS_102867]

An additional  treatment  regimen,  consisting   of Melphalan,  Fludarabine,  and Thiotepa,  will be administered  to 
the poor risk patients  on this protocol  as defined  in the Eligibility  Criteria  section.  This regimen  was added  to 
the protocol  with the approval  of Amendment  7 on 12/4/2012.  Thirty  (30) poor risk patients  will receive  this

In addition,  recent  data at MSKCC  suggests  that the addition   of immune  gammaglobulin   (IVIG)  added  to the 
incubation   fluid at a concentration  of 1.5 mg IVIG/ml  during  incubation   of the antiCD34  beads  with the

As result of the increased  accrual  proposed  in Amendment  15, accrual  adjustments for arm A and the

optimal  CD34+,  CD3+,  and CD3+  T-cell doses  will be computed.  A logistic  regression  model  and a Cox 
proportional  hazards  model  will be used to correlate  the dose of CD34+  progenitors  and CD3+  T cells with 
engraftment,  GvHD,  and non-relapse  mortality.  
 
As a result  of four treatment  related  deaths  within  the first nineteen  patients  in the poor  risk group  of

15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section entitled  Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria. Obtain  informed 
consent,  by [CONTACT_93139].  
During  the registration  process registering  individuals  will  be required  to complete  a protocol 
specific  Eligibility  Checklist.  The individual  signing  the Eligibility  Checklist  is confirming 
whether  or not the participant   is eligible   to enroll   in the study.  Study  staff are responsible   for 
ensuring  that all institutional  requirements  necessary to enroll  a participant  to the study have been 
completed.   See related  Clinical  Research  Policy   and Procedure  #401  (Protocol  Participant  
Registration).    15.2 Randomization  
This research  study  does not require  a randomization.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will be assigned  to the study  and will be responsible   for both 
pediatric  and adult accruals.  The responsibilities   of the CRC and principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_93048],  data collection,   abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,   problem  
resolution  and prioritization,   and coordinate  the activities  of the protocol  study  team.   The data 
collected  for this study  will be entered  into The Clinical  Research  Data  Base  (CRDB),  a secure  
database.   Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
[CONTACT_93146]  at Miami  Cancer  Institute  will assist  with data analysis.   Identifiable   data will 
not leave  MSKCC,  and only de-identified   data will be shared  over secured  email.   [CONTACT_93147]  has 
cared  for some  of these  patients  and has familiarity   with this clinical  entity  in his capacity  as a 
clinician   who was previously  the Co-Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_93049].  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data.   Routine  data quality   reports  will be generated  to assess missing  data and 
inconsistencies.   Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow-up will be monitored 
periodically   throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the 
study  team  for discussion  and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_2362],  at a 
minimum   of two times  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety Monitoring  
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring   (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.   The plans  address  the new policies  set 
forth  by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety  
Monitoring   of Clinical   Trials”  which  can be found  at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html.  The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were

established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The MSKCC Data  and Safety  
Monitoring   Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm  
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  and 
quality.    There  are institutional   processes  in place  for quality   assurance  (e.g.,  protocol monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification   audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  research  
QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional   committees  that 
are responsible  for monitoring   the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.   The committees:  Data  and 
Safety  Monitoring   Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data  and Safety  
Monitoring   Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  Research  Council  and 
Institutional   Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its level of 
risk and degree  of monitoring   required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) Will be addressed  and the monitoring  
procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040]  a transp lant, the patient’s  disease  may recur.  In this case,  standard  and/or  experimental  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  such as phase  I/II drugs,  antibodies  or cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  will be available  to the patient  for 
consideration   as treatment  options.  
 
B e nefits  : 
 
A transplant  is administered  with curative  intent.   The approaches  being  evaluated  may achieve  this 
goal and may also be effective  in preventing  acute  and chronic  graft vs. host disease.  
The results  of this study  will also define  risks and benefits  of T-cell depleted  grafts fractionated  on the 
CliniMACS   device,  when  administered  after each of the cytoreduction  regimen  proposed  for study.  
This may greatly  accelerate  further  development  of transplantation  approaches  employing   this 
approach  to T-cell depletion.  
Consent  Process:  Participation  in this study  is voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to sign a 
statement  of informed  consent  which  must conform  to MSKCC  IRB guidelines.

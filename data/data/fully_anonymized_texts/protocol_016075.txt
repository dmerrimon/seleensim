Abstract/Description 
Pulse oximeters were introduced clinically around [ADDRESS_883311] clinical settings 
including surgery, recovery, intensive care, and other special applications where patients may 
be at risk of inadequate oxygenation or ventilation. There are numerous manufacturers of these 
devices. The instruments intended for clinical use are required by [CONTACT_656051] [ZIP_CODE]-2-61 over the range of SpO2 70-100%. The 
instruments are calibrated by [CONTACT_656052]. This study protocol was started in [ADDRESS_883312] been 
studied, using more than 100 different manufacturers’ devices. Because of continuing 
improvements in pulse oximeter design, continuing introduction of new products to the market, 
and ongoing challenges in performance, the testing is still needed to ensure and improve safety 
and performance of pulse oximeters.

4.SpO2 probe placement site selection
a.Probes are placed on sites selected by [CONTACT_656058],
with at least one device capable of measuring pulsatility amplitude (i.e.,
sometimes commonly referred to as perfusion index) on the same hand and/or
adjacent digit. All fingers, including the thumb and pi[INVESTIGATOR_509211], are used to test the
performance of pulse oximeters, and, in some cases, placement occurs on the
same side as the arterial line. One or both of the lab’s FDA 510(k)/CE reference
oximeters are always used for all studies.
i. After Fall [ADDRESS_883317] Forehead Sensor may also be used.
ii. Prior to Fall 2022 UCSF Hypoxia Lab reference pulse oximeters were
Nellcor N-595 and Masimo Rad 7 non-color, non-touch screen.
b.Adjacent finger pulse oximeter probes are optically isolated from each other
using a custom isolation divider made of molded kydex and a modified Masimo
disposable optical light shield (Image 1). Averaging time for devices is also
recorded on the day of the study, if changes to the settings are made. In general,
devices are kept on default averaging time settings, unless otherwise noted.

computed
 
from
 
end-expi[INVESTIGATOR_656043]2

adjusted
 
by
 
[CONTACT_656064]
 
[ADDRESS_883319] 60 seconds but typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 60-180 seconds
prior to sampling at each plateau (of note, in patients with lower perfusion, the
plateau may be held for longer ~120-240 seconds to ensure adequate SpO2
stabilization). The 6 target plateaus are achieved in two separate desaturation
'runs' as outlined in the supplementary figure. Each "run" lasts ~15 min. Plateaus
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_656046]2 decades of
70% to 80%, 80% to 90% and 90% to 100%.
b.A calculated saturation (ScO2) based on end tidal O2, end tidal CO2, assumed
A-a gradient, and p50, is used in addition to SaO2 and SpO2 data from reference
devices to estimate plateau stability in real time. Study investigator visually
inspects ScO2 and reference device SpO2 curves in real time to ensure stable
plateaus prior to and during sampling. A custom configuration of labview
interprets ScO2 and SpO2 of reference devices in real time to calculate slope for
the past [ADDRESS_883320] SpO2 change over the next 1 minute. A green
light is displayed to indicate if predicted SpO2 change is < 2% and ScO2 change
is < 2%. A red light is otherwise displayed. Generally, these indicators are used
to determine sampling along with the discretion of the study investigator
c.SaO2 from ABLs is also analyzed in real time in Labview, and a red indicator is
displayed if SaO2 changes by [CONTACT_726] 1.5% between samples, indicating
instability
8.Blood sampling
a.During controlled hypoxemia, up to [ADDRESS_883321] (<70mL total) are obtained at different steady-state levels of hypoxemia
from 70-100%. Prior to the study sample being drawn, a discard sample (~0.5 -
1mL) of ~2-3x the circuit dead space is drawn. Blood samples are withdrawn in
<5 seconds into a 3mL heparinized syringe. Samples are visually inspected, air
bubbles are expelled through a vented tip cap, and the syringe is gently mixed
(by [CONTACT_656065]). Syringes contain lyophilized balanced Li-heparin with a
goal of 20IU/mL blood (liquid heparin may impact/dilute results including pO2).
Samples are drawn after stability as measured by [CONTACT_656066]2
(Nellcor PM1000N with DS-100A1 Adult Reusable SpO2 Sensor, Masimo
Radical [ADDRESS_883322] Set DCl Adult Reusable Sensor 3ft) and calculated saturation
as outlined above. Blood samples obtained from the arterial line are immediately
analyzed by [CONTACT_3252]-oximetry (Radiometer ABL90 Flex Plus) to determine true
functional saturation (SaO2) value. If sample is not run immediately (e.g.,
running the sample on a third ABL90 to confirm results) then it is gently mixed
via vortex prior to analyzing. Readings from the test pulse oximeters are
recorded and compared to these functional saturation (SaO2) "gold-standard"
blood values. (Note: Some manufacturers and labs have been known to use

fractional
 
saturation
 
O2Hb
 
instead
 
of
 
functional
 
saturation
 
for
 
calibration).
 
Up
 
to
 
three

machines
 
are
 
used
 
in
 
parallel
 
to
 
confirm

A

blood
 
sample
 
is
 
initially
 
run
 
on
 
two

the
 
ABLs;
 
if
 
there
 
is

difference
 
in
 
the
 
SaO2
 
values,
 
the
 
sample
 
is

a
 
third
 
time
 
on
 
an
 
additional
 
ABL
 
it
 
was
 
not

the
 
three,

of
 
the
 
SaO2
 
values
 
are
 
not
 
within
 
0.5%
 
of
 
each
 
other,
 
then
 
that

point
 
is
 
excluded
 
during

If

are

then
 
the

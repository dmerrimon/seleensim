V. HYPOTHESIS 
Briefly state the pro blem, backgrou nd, importance  of the research, and  goals of the prop osed project. 
 
Neuropathic pain is a chronic debilitating condition affecting 3 – 4% of the global popu lation. It results in profound 
decreases in patients’ quality of life and is associated with a significant economic burden. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_669195], as many as three-fourths of  patients continue to 
expe rience uncontrolled moderate to severe pain. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC ), an over-the-coun ter antioxidant and 
precursor to glutathione synthesis, is a free radical scavenger that affects pain by [CONTACT_669220] (ROS), and subsequently, decreasing levels of oxidative stress and pain. In a small clinical study, NAC 
decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_669196], and  in non-clinical research, NAC alleviated 
neuropathic pain in a rat model. These data suggest that NAC may be a promising adjunct to standard treatments for 
clinical neuropathic pain. 
The specific aim of the current research is to conduct a small, pi[INVESTIGATOR_669197] , as an adjunct 
to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2512], in patients with incompletely controlled ne uropathic pain. Thirty-six men and women wi th non-cancer  
neuropathic pain will be treated with [ADDRESS_903920] of NAC on pa in, mood, and  stress; assess the safety of NAC in neuropathic 
pain patients; and calculate patient compliance with medication do sing instructions. 
This study will be the first to evaluate the potential benefits of NAC treatment as an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_669198]. With positive outcomes from the addition of NAC therapy, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_669199] a large, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to further 
evaluate the use of NAC in neuropathic pain. If indeed  NAC is effective in neuropathic pain, it will be an inexpensive and 
clinically significant addition to the armamentarium of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_669200], 
ultimately improving the lives of the millions of patients affected by  [CONTACT_595143].

VII. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
Include information regarding pre-clinical and early human studies.  Attach appropriate citations. 
 
Neuropathic pain is a chronic debilitating con dition arising from damage to or dysfunction of the nervous system 
resulting in symptoms like burning and tingling sensations, nu mbness, and itching. It affects approximately 3.8 million 
patients in the Un ited States (Bennett, 1997) and 3 –4% of the population worldwide (Global Indus try Analysts, Inc. 
Report, 201 1). 
Persistent neuropathic pain has a significant impact on quality of life as well as a substantial burden on  society. 
Patients report decreased overall physical and mental health, decreased mobility, increased mood d isorders, and increased 
sleep disturbances and fatigue (Jensen, 200 7). In fact, Bouha ssira and  colleagues (2008) reported that neuropathic pain is 
associated with greater psychological stress and increased intensity compared to nociceptive pain. Further, neuropathic 
pain has tremendous  economic cos ts in terms of direct medical expenses, lost productivity, and c aregiver burden 
(O’Connor 2009). 
The causes of neuropathic pain are heterogeneous and include such etiologies as diabetes mellitus, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], 
multiple sclerosis, herpes zoster, and HIV-related neuropathies. Initial treatment includes addressing the underlying cause 
of the pathology; however, the pain often remains, and its treatment is especially challenging. A recent report by [CONTACT_669221]’s Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group d escribed evidence-based 
guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain (O’Connor, 2009). According to the report, tricyclic antidepressants, 
selective serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608], calcium chann el α2-δ ligands, topi[INVESTIGATOR_24242], and in some cases, 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_669201]-line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_669202]. Often, multiple medications are used in an attempt to con trol 
neuropathic pain. However, even wi th treatment, as many as 50-75% of patients still have persistent moderate to severe 
neuropathic pain (McDermott, 2006). 
Clearly, additional therapeutic options are needed  to improve outcomes in patients with neuropathic pain. One 
particular agent that has shown promise in non-clinical studies of neuropathy is N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC ), a derivative of 
the amino acid cysteine and an antioxidant, which appears to affect neuropathic pain by [CONTACT_52999] a free radical scavenger. 
It acts by [CONTACT_669222], resulting in increased cellular 
clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased oxidative stress, and subsequen tly, dec reased pain. In a rat spi[INVESTIGATOR_669203] (SNL) of neuropathic pain, Kim and co lleagues (2004) implicated ROS in the pathology of 
neuropathic pain. They showed that ROS scavengers ameliorated SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and prevented the 
development of neuropathic pain in these rats. Gao,  et al. further detailed the role of ROS in neuropathic pain with 
expe riments that show ed that elevated levels of ROS were associated with increased phosp horylation of N-methyl-D- 
aspartate (NMDA) receptors, central sensitization, and hyperalgesia in a rat SNL model of neuropathic pain. Naik, et al. 
(2005) show ed that NAC in particular significantly reduced  the increased sensitivity to mechan ical, thermal, and co ld 
allodynia tests in a peripheral neuropathy model (chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve) in rats. Further, the 
Investigators noted that glutathione levels were decreased following injury. 
In a c linical research study, Orban, et al (2006) theorized that NAC decreased ROS, resulting in decreased pain 
intensity, as measured by  [CONTACT_669223], in patients undergoing knee ligamentoplasty.  Patients treated w ith [ADDRESS_903922] proced ure used less morphine (0.22 mg/kg vs 0.47  mg/kg, p<0.05)  in the first 48 
Version: 10Sept 2012 
Page  4 of 15  Rev. Date: 9-1-[ADDRESS_903923] shown decreased self-reported use in marijuana (Gray, 2010) and tobacco 
(Knackstedt, 2009) users and decreased use and cravings in coc aine addicts (LaRowe, 2006;  LaRowe, 2007; Mardikian, 
2007 ). Especially relevant to the proposed research, the doses of NAC used in these studies, generally 2400  mg/day for 
four weeks, were w ell-tolerated. No  patients experienced serious adverse events, and no p atients were discontinued  from 
the studies due to adverse events. 
These data suggest that additional research with NAC in pain is warranted. To our knowledge, there have been no 
studies that have evaluated NAC as an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_669204]. Therefore the 
proposed research w ill be the first to prospectively study the effect of NAC on pain medication use (as measured by  
[CONTACT_669224]) in this population.

Include a b rief description of the project design including the setting in which the research will be co nducted and 
proced ures. If applicable, include a d escription of procedu res being performed already for diagno stic or treatment 
purpos es. 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_669205]-based app roaches to the treatment of neuropathic pain, only about half of patients achieve 
even pa rtial relief. NAC is a potential adjuvant to standard treatment that may improve overall treatment effectiveness. The 
proposed research w ill examine the effect of NAC use in patients who se neuropathic pain is not controlled with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Spec ifically, we will enroll [ADDRESS_903924] pain. Study participants will be treated wi th 1200 mg NAC twice daily for four weeks, and efficacy, 
safety, and co mpliance data will be collected w eekly. Statistical analysis will be performed wi th the primary outcome 
variable being amount of breakthrough medication, measured in morphine equivalents, required daily. 
Study  Participants.  Study participants will be N=36 men and women who 1) a re 18 to 65 years old; 2) have been 
diagnosed with non-cancer  neuropathic pain; 3) are currently taking a stable (same dose and do sing schedule for at least 6 
months) dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_643278]; 4) require short-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_669206] “as-needed”  basis to control 
breakthrough pain; and 5)  report a score of 5 or higher on the 10-point visual analogue scale. Patients will be excluded from 
the study if they 1) are pregnant or nursing; 2) have a serious, unstable medical or psychiatric illness that in the op inion of 
the Investigator would preclude them from safely participating in the study; 3) have an active stomach ulcer or a history of 
seizures or asthma; 4) use breakthrough medications other than opi[INVESTIGATOR_669207]; or 5) 
are using illicit drugs. Po tential study participants will be recruited from the VCU Primary Care and  Neurology Clinics. 
The clinics serve approximately 1,500 p atients with a diagnosis of neuropathic pain, and  approximately 600 of these 
patients are being treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388]. These patients are equally men and women, p redominately African- 
American (65%) and of low socioecono mic status. 
 
Recru itment and  Informed Consen t. [CONTACT_215942] receives referrals for pain management from both the VCU Primary 
Care and Neurology Clinics. As su ch, he w orks closely with practitioners from both clinics. Prior to the start of the study, 
[CONTACT_215942] will meet with these clinicians to describe the study, its eligibility criteria, and  outcome measures. As 
described below, these clinicians will be asked to refer patients to this study. A Research As sistant (RA) will help recruit 
potential participants for this study. With appropriate IRB approval (already obtained), the trained RA will utilize the i2b2 
Cohort Identification Pro gram to identify potential study participants based on their diagnosis of neuropathic pain, use of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], and attendan ce at the Primary Care or Neurology Clinic. The RA will work with clinic staff to 
Version: 10Sept 2012 
Page  5 of 15  Rev. Date: 9-1-[ADDRESS_903925] that the 
RA will identify about  8-10 un ique patients/week to approach abo ut participation in this research study. 
For p atients who are interested in the study, the RA will tell them that their decisions to participate in the study are 
entirely voluntary. Also, the RA  will assure potential participants that their study data is confidential, will not be shared 
with anyone ou tside the research team, and if published or presented, w ill only be done as aggregate data.  For patients 
who are interested in participating in the study and who  meet the eligibility criteria, the RA  will answer any questions they 
have about  the study and then ob tain informed co nsent for study participation. 
 
Study  Procedures. This will be an open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_669208]. Patients who meet all study eligibility criteria and who have signed an  informed con sent form will be 
enrolled in the study. Study  participants will be treated with 2400 mg NAC (1200  mg twice daily). 
 
Screening 
At Screening, basic demographic and medical information will be collected. 
1)   Demographics. Age, race, ethnicity, and gender  data will be collected. 
2)   Medical history. A complete medical history will be done. 
3)   Medication use. A medication inventory form, including questions about prescription, no n-prescription, and 
medical/nutritional supplement use will be completed. 
4)   Pregnancy  test. Women of  childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy  test. 
5)   Urine drug test. A urine sample will be analyzed for five classes of drugs [cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana  
(THC), methado ne, and  sedative hypnotics]. 
6)   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_669209].  Participants will be asked to record their scheduled and breakthrough pain 
medication use in a medication diary. The RA  will provide directions to the participants regarding the proper 
completion of the diaries. Participants will also be asked to bring their medicine bottles with them to each visit, 
and u se will be confirmed by  [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_10685]. 
 
Baseline Period 
Immediately following Screening, study participants will enter the study Baseline Period, which lasts two weeks.  The 
patients will come in for a visit at the end of each we ek.  At the first Baseline Period Visit, pain medication use will be 
assessed. 
1)   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_669210]. 
 
Study  participants will come in for a second B aseline Visit approximately one w eek after the first visit.  At the second 
Baseline Period Visit, pain medication use will be assessed and b aseline assessments will be completed. 
1)   Physical examination. A complete physical examination including evaluation of general appearance, review of 
body  systems, and assessment of vital signs wi ll be done. 
2)   Pregnancy  test.  For women of childbearing potential as described above. 
3)   Urine drug test as described above. 
4)   Pain intensity assessment. Pain intensity will be measured by  [CONTACT_10540] 10-point Visual Analogue Sc ale, a 10-mm 
horizontal line w ith anchors of “no pain at all” and  “worst pain imaginable” on which patients’ pain intensities are 
measured (Katz, 199 9) 
5)   Pain quality evaluation.  Pain quality will be evaluated by [CONTACT_669225] (PQAS), a 20- 
question measure that assesses the type of  pain experienced  (Jensen, in press). 
6)   “Pain problem” assessment.  The degree to which participants have a chronic “pain problem” will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_10540]15-item Profile of Chronic Pain: Screening (PCP:S; Ruehlman, 200 5). 
7)   Pain impact assessment. The impact of pain on the patients’ lives will be assessed by [CONTACT_669226] (Chibnall and Tait, 1994) 
8)   Mood  assessment. Mood will be assessed by [CONTACT_669227] (PHQ-9), a validated 9- 
question assessment of depression (Kroenke, 200 1). 
9)   Stress evaluation. Stress will be measured by [CONTACT_117671] ((PSS), a 10-item instrument for 
measuring the perception of stress (Cohen et al, 1983).

Trea tment Period 
At the end of the Baseline Period, the participants will start the four-week, study Treatment Period. Participants will come 
to the clinic weekly during the Treatment Period. 
1)   Pain, mood, and stress assessments as described above.  The PCP:S will only be repeated at the end of the study. 
2)   Pregnancy  test. For women of  child-bearing potential as described above. Wo men who beco me pregnant during 
the Treatment Period will be withdrawn from the study. 
3)   Adverse event assessment. Adverse events will be assessed at each visit. 
4)   Medication compliance assessment. Medication compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_669228]. A special 
eCAP will be placed on  each prescription vial at the time of dispensing.  A card in the cap records the date and 
time each  time that the vial is opened  and transmits the data wirelessly to a co mputer. 
5)   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_669210]. 
6)   Dispense medication. At each visit, participants will be given a one-week supp ly (+/- two days) of study 
medication and scheduled for their next visit. 
 
NAC will be provided as  600-mg capsu les, and study participants will be instructed to take two, 600-mg capsu les 
twice daily in the morning and e vening. If patients miss a dose of study medication, they will be instructed to take the dose 
if it is more than six hours before their next scheduled dose. If it is six hours or less until their next dose, participants will 
be instructed to skip the dose of NAC . 
X. PLAN FOR CONTROL OF INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS , BIOLOGICS, AND DE VICES.  
Investigational drugs  and biologics:  IF Investigational Drug Pharmacy Service (IDS) is not  being used,  attach the IDS 
confirmation of receipt of the manag ement plan. 
 
Investigational and humanitarian use devices (HUDs): Describe yo ur plans for the control of investigational devices 
and HUDs including: 
(1) how you will maintain recor ds of the produ ct’s delivery  to the trial site, the inventory at the site, the use by e ach 
subject, and  the return to the spo nsor or alternative disposition of unused pr oduct(s); 
(2) plan for storing the investigational product(s)/ HUD as specified by  [CONTACT_456] (if any)  and in accordance  with 
applicable reg ulatory requirements; 
(3) plan for ensuring th at the investigational prod uct(s)/HUDs are used only in accor dance  with the approved 
protocol; and 
(4) how you will ensure that each sub ject understands the correct use of the inves tigational product(s)/HUDs (if 
applicable) and check  that each  subject is following the instructions prop erly (on an ong oing basis). 
 
NAC is a compound that is available without a prescription. For this research, study participants will be seen and 
medication will be dispensed from the research assistant's (RA’s) office on the 4th floor of the VMI  building. Study 
medication will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked office in the research coordinator's office on the 4th floor of the 
VMI building. Only the RA and the study investigators (Drs. Michael Weaver, Dace S vikis, and Pamela Dillon) will have 
access to the cabinet in which the drug will be stored. The cabinet will contain a thermometer that is checked on a  weekly 
basis and the medication storage temperature will be recorded on  a temperature log. 
 
Study  medication receipt, dispensing, return and disposition records will be maintained and stored in the Re gulatory 
Binder.  All study medication order forms, packing slips, and invoices will be filed in the Re gulatory Binder. In add ition, 
subject-specific dispensing/use/return logs will be maintained.  Finally, records detailing the destruction of unused study 
medication will be filed in the Re gulatory Binder.  An electronic monitoring system (e.g., MEMS)  will be used to track 
subject medication compliance.  In add ition, the RA will reconcile all study medication dispensed and returned during each 
scheduled study participant visit. The RA will also reconcile all unused study medication on a monthly basis. 
 
Study  participants will be given wr itten instructions regarding the dosing schedule and use of the study medication.  In 
addition, the study Investigator or the RA  will verbally review the proper use of the study medication with the participants 
at the study visit.  Medication co mpliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_669229]. A special eCAP will be placed on 
Version: 10Sept 2012 
Page  7 of 15  Rev. Date: 9-1-[ADDRESS_903926] in the cap records the date and time each  time that the vial is 
opened  and transmits the data wirelessly to a computer.  The Investigator or RA will discuss any instances of non- 
compliance with the study participants at the scheduled visits. 
 
The Investigator or RA will package the N AC in vials; a one-week supp ly (+/- 2 days) will be supplied to each 
participant at each scheduled visit. The vials will be labeled with the name [CONTACT_174398], strength, quan tity, 
dosing instructions, the study participants’ initials and subject numbers, and the date dispensed. 
 
 
XI. DATA ANALYSIS  PLAN 
For investigator–initiated studies. 
 
The primary outcome of interest in this research is the amount of breakthrough medication, c onverted to morphine 
equivalents, used by [CONTACT_669230]. The amount of breakthrough medication used by  [CONTACT_388149] a wee kly 
basis will be con verted to morphine eq uivalents and analyzed using a repeated measures analysis implemented through a 
mixed linear model (MLM) to see if there is a significant within subjects Time (Baseline, Week  1, Week 2, Week 3 and 
Week  4) factor. If there is a significant Time factor, a post-hoc test assessing the significance of the change in Week  [ADDRESS_903927]-hoc tests will be condu cted comparing Week  
1, Week  2 and Week 3 morphine use to the Baseline morphine use; these subsequent tests will be adjusted using a 
Bonferroni adjustment to accommodate the multiple comparisons. 
Second ary analyses will examine total amount of pain medication used (in morphine eq uivalents), pain (by [CONTACT_669231]), mood (by [CONTACT_669232]-9) and stress (by [CONTACT_669233] S), and Baseline values will be compared to end of study 
values by [CONTACT_669234] t-tests. All statistical efficacy analyses will be done only in those subjects who  complete the entire 
Treatment Period and will be calculated at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_903928] one dose of NAC. 
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_669235]. Medication compliance will be evaluated using the 
eCAP data, and percent of doses taken w ill be calculated. 
 
 
XII. DATA A ND SAFETY MONITORING 
 If the research involves greater than minimal risk and there is no provision made for data and s afety monitoring 
by [CONTACT_669236], include a data and safety-monitoring plan  that is suitable for the level of risk to be faced by 
[CONTACT_669237]. 
 If the research involves greater than minimal risk, and there is a pro vision made for data and safety monitoring 
by [CONTACT_669236], describe the spons or’s plan. 
 If you are serving as a S ponso r-Investigator, identify the Co ntract Research Organization (C RO) that you will be 
using and describe the provisions made for data  and safety monitoring by [CONTACT_2024].  Guida nce on additional 
requirements for Spo nsor-Investigators is available at  http://www.research.vcu.edu/irb/wpp/flash/X-2.htm 
 
The principal investigator, [CONTACT_215942], will be responsible for overall data safety and monitoring during the study. All 
research staff who regularly come in contact [CONTACT_52701], (e.g., Research As sistants) will be instructed on 
procedures for managing and reporting adverse events (AEs). All adverse events will be documented, and records 
regarding the events will be retained in the study binder for review by  [CONTACT_3476]. [CONTACT_215942] will be informed 
immediately, in person or by [CONTACT_756], of any potential or actual serious adverse event (SAE), and he will report all SAEs 
to the IRB within 24 hours. 
The Research Assistant (RA) will generate a quarterly report of aggregate data for [CONTACT_215942]. The report will 
summarize rates of recruitment, participants’ demographic characteristics, AEs, SAEs (as defined the FDA), and rates of 
follow-up. [CONTACT_669249] ver will review the report and decide whet her recruitment will continue as planned.  If he decides that 
the study protocol should be amended for patient safety reasons  or that recruitment should be discontinued  for safety 
reasons, he will inform the IRB of such in a w ritten report. Finally, a copy of the aggregate data report will be provided 
annu ally to the IRB. 
Data safety will be insured as follows. To protect confidentiality, each participant will be assigned a  subject ID number 
Version: 10Sept 2012 
Page  8 of 15  Rev. Date: 9-1-[ADDRESS_903929] ID number will 
also appear on the computer-directed assessment module (for baseline screening and as sessment).  Participant names will 
appe ar only on the consent form (signature), and the participant tracking form that contains information ab out the 
participant and others in his/her family or social network who are likely to know the participant’s whereabouts (for contact 
[CONTACT_158874]). 
All patient identifying information will be kept in a locked, limited-access  file cabinet separate from other study data. 
Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a ll other study data will be kept in a separate, locked, limited-access file cabinet.  A RA will doub le enter 
all study data into a web-based database (REDCap). 
All data collected during this study that is presented in reports and publications will be presented in aggregate form,

all records will be stored in locked file cabinets accessible only by [CONTACT_8362]. 
 
 
 
 
B. SUBJECT  POPULAT ION 
Describe the subject population in terms of sex, race, ethnicity, age, etc., and  your a ccess to the po pulation th at will 
allow recruitment of the necessary number of participants.  Identify the criteria for inclusion or exclusion of all 
targeted po pulations and include a justification for any e xclusions.  Explain the ra tionale for the involvement of 
special cases of subjects, such as c hildren, pregna nt women, h uman fetuses, neona tes, prisoners or others who are 
likely to be v ulnerable.  If you plan to allow for the enro llment of Wards of the State (or any  other age ncy, institution, 
or en tity), you  must specifically request their inclusion and follow guidance in VCU IRB WPP XV-3: Wards and 
Emancipated Minors  available at  http://www.research.vcu.ed u/irb/wpp/flash/XV-3.htm. 
 
Study  participants will be N=36 men and women who 1) are 18 to 65 years old; 2) have been diagnosed with non-cancer 
neuropathic pain; 3) are currently taking a stable (same dose and do sing schedule for at least 6 months) dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_669212]; 4) require short-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_669213] “as-needed”  to control breakthrough pain; and 5) report a score of 
5 or higher on the 10-point visual analogue scale. Patients will be excluded  from the study if they 1) are pregnant or 
nursing; 2) have a serious, unstable medical or psychiatric illness that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_669214]; 3) have an active stomach ulcer or a history of seizures or asthma; 4) use 
breakthrough medications other than opi[INVESTIGATOR_669207]; or 5) are using illicit drugs. Po tential study 
participants will be recruited from the VCU Primary Care and Neurology Clinics. The clinics serve approximately 1,500 
patients with a diagnosis of neuropathic pain, and  approximately 600 of these patients are being treated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_192836]. These patients are equally men and women, predominately African-American (65%) and of low 
socioeconomic status. 
 
 
C. RESEARCH MATE RIAL 
Iden tify the sour ces of research material obtained from individually identifiable living human su bjects in the  form of 
specimens, records, or data.  Ind icate whether the material or data will be obtained sp ecifically for research  purposes 
or whether use will be made of existing sp ecimens, record s, or d ata. 
 
Data used in this study will be ob tained strictly for research purposes.  Multiple methods of  data collection will be used, 
Version: 10Sept 2012 
Page  10 of 15  Rev. Date: 9-1-[ADDRESS_903930] computer entry by [CONTACT_67036], interview data, and  pencil and paper survey data. 
 
 
D. RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
Describe in detail your plans for the recruitment of subjects including: 
(1) how potential subjects will be identified (e.g., school p ersonnel, health care professionals, etc), 
(2) how you will get the names and co ntact information for potential subjects, and  
(3) who will make initial conta ct with these individuals (if relevant) and h ow that contact [CONTACT_669238] e. 
If you plan to involve special cases of subjects, such as children, pr egnant women, h uman fetuses, neonates, prisone rs 
or others who are likely to be vul nerable, describe any spe cial recruitment proced ures for these pop ulations. 
 
 
[CONTACT_215942] receives referrals for pain management from both the VCU Primary Care and Neurology Clinics. As such, 
he wor ks closely with practitioners from both clinics. Prior to the start of the study, [CONTACT_215942] will meet with these 
clinicians to describe the study, its eligibility criteria, and ou tcome measures. As described below, these clinicians will be 
asked to refer patients to this study. A Research As sistant (RA) will help recruit potential participants for this study. With 
appropriate IRB approval (already obtained), the trained RA  will utilize the i2b2 Cohort Identification Pro gram to identify 
potential study participants based on their diagnosis of neuropathic pain, use  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], and attendance at the 
Primary Care or Neurology Clinic. The RA  will work with clinic staff to determine when these patients have visits 
scheduled and will coordinate with the clinicians to be available to tell appropriate patients about the study if they are 
interested. With a p otential participant pool of approximately [ADDRESS_903931] that the RA will identify about  8-10 un ique 
patients/week to approach about participation in this research study. 
For p atients who are interested in the study, the RA will tell them that their decisions to participate in the study are 
entirely voluntary. Also, the RA will assure potential participants that their study data is confidential, will not be shared 
with anyone ou tside the research team, and if published or presented, w ill only be done as aggregate data.  For patients 
who are interested in participating in the study and who  meet the eligibility criteria, the RA  will answer any questions they 
have about  the study and then ob tain informed co nsent for study participation. 
 
 
 
 
E. PRIVACY OF PARTICIPANTS 
NOTE:  Privacy  refers to individuals and  their interests in controlling access to their identities, their physical person, 
and h ow and what kind of information is  obtained about them. Privacy also encompasses the interests of defined 
communities (e.g. those  with a certain diagnosis or social circumstance) in controlling access to the group identity and 
information about the group or individuals as part of the grou p. 
 
Describe how the privacy interests of subjects (and communities, if appropriate) will be protected including: 
(1) in the research setting (e.g., in the identification, recruitment, and  intervention settings) and 
(2) with the information being sought and the way it is sought. For e xample, prov iding drapes or barriers, 
interviewing in a private room, and c ollecting only the amount of sensitive information needed  for identification, 
recruitment, or the cond uct of the study. 
 
Consent, assessments, and other study activities will be cond ucted by  [CONTACT_669239]. Participant information will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in a locked room and will be accessible only 
to the study team. 
 
 
F. CONFIDENT IALITY OF DATA  
NOTE:  Confidentiality refers to the way private, ident ifiable information about a subject or defined community is 
maintained a nd shar ed. 
 
Check a ll of the following preca utions that will be used to maintain the co nfidentiality of identifiable information: 
Version: 10Sept 2012

IRB USE  - Do Not Delete  
 Pape r-based records will be kept in secure location and only accessed by  [CONTACT_669240]-related data (data is coded w ith a key stored in a separate secure location) 
For research involving web-based surveys, data is secured via passwords and encryption 
Audio or video recordings of subjects will be transcribed and  then destroyed to prevent audio or visual identification. 
Note the date of destruction (e.g., 3 months from close of study; after transcription is determined to be error free).

G. POTEN TIAL RISKS 
Describe potential risks (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess their likelihood and  seriousn ess. 
Where  appropriate, describe alternative treatments and proced ures that might be adva ntageous  to the subjects. 
 
NAC is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to it.  NAC should be used with caution in patients with 
asthma or severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_669215]. It shou ld also be used with caution in 
patients with conditions predisposing to gastrointestinal hemorrhage (e.g., esophageal varices and peptic ulceration) 
because drug-induced nausea and vomiting may increase the risk of such hemorrhage in patients predisposed to the 
cond ition and  because of the theoretical risk that mucolytics may disrupt the gastric mucosal barrier. 
The most common side effects of oral NAC are nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, or constipation.  Rarely, it causes 
rashes with or without mild fever or drowsiness. 
A rare side effect of NAC is hypersensitivity/anaph ylactoid reaction, which may manifest as a bronchospastic allergic 
reaction, allergic dermatitis or facial edema. 
Adequa te and well-controlled studies in pregnant and breastfeeding women ha ve not  been do ne.  Therefore, pregnant 
women wi ll not be allowed to participate in this study.  If a woman beco mes pregnant while she is in the study, she will be 
discontinued from treatment immediately. 
There have not  been any drug-drug interaction studies, and there are no w ell-documented drug interactions with NAC . 
 
 
H. RISK REDUCTION 
Describe pr ocedures for protecting ag ainst or minimizing potential risk. Where ap propriate, discuss provisions for 
ensu ring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse events to the subjects.  Describe the 
prov isions for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects, if any. 
 
To minimize the risk of harm to participants in this study, patients with unstable medical or psychiatric illnesses will not 
be enrolled in the study.  Patients with a history of sensitivity to NAC , those with asthma or severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_27580], and  those with active peptic ulcer disease also will not be enrolled in the study.  To optimize the safety of 
subjects enrolled in the study, all participants will be asked about  side effects and adverse events on a  weekly basis, and 
any adverse events reported by [CONTACT_669241]. 
 
 
I. ADDITIONAL SAFE GUARDS FOR VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS  
Describe any  additional safeguards to protect the rights and welfare of participants if you plan to involve special cases 
of subjects such as  children, pregna nt women, h uman fetuses, neon ates, prisoners or others who are likely to be 
vulne rable. 
 
Safeguards to protect the rights and  welfare of participants might relate to Inclusion/E xclusion Criteria: (“Adults with 
moder ate to severe cognitive impairment will be excluded.” “Children  must have diabetes. No normal controls who 
are children will be used.”) Conse nt: (“Participants must have an adult care giver who ag rees to the par ticipant 
taking part in the research and will make s ure the participant complies with research proced ures.”  “Adults must be 
able to assent.  Any dissent by [CONTACT_669242].”) Benefit: (“Individuals who have not 
shown benefit to this type of drug  in the past will be excluded.”).

J. RISK/BENEFIT  
Discuss why the risks to participants are  reasonable in relation to the anticipated be nefits to subjects and in r elation 
to the importance of the knowledge  that may reasonably be  expected to result. If a test article (investigational new 
drug, device, or biologic) is involved, name [CONTACT_669248]. 
 
While there are risks associated with the use of NAC , these risks will be minimized as d escribed abo ve.  Further, NAC has 
been used safely in a number of conditions, and the formulation to be used in this study is available without a prescription. 
The benefit of the research may be significant.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_669216], as many as three-fourths of  patients continue to experience uncontrolled moderate to severe pain. With positive 
outcomes from the ad dition of NAC therapy to opi[INVESTIGATOR_669217], the pi[INVESTIGATOR_669218] a large, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to further evaluate the use of NAC in 
neuropathic pain. If indeed  NAC is effective in neuropathic pain, it will be an inexpensive and clinically significant 
addition to the armamentarium of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_669200], ultimately improving 
the lives of the millions of patients affected by  [CONTACT_595143]. 
 
 
K. COMPEN SATION PLAN  
Compens ation for participants (if applicable) should be described, including possible total compensation, pro-rating, 
any propo sed bo nus, and any propo sed red uctions or pen alties for not completing the project. 
 
Participants will be compensated for the time and effort that they spend participating in this research study.  They will 
receive $25  for completing the Screening Visit, $15 for completing each of the two Baseline Visits, $[ADDRESS_903932] three, weekly Treatment Period Visits, and $[ADDRESS_903933] study visit. At the end of the study, 
participants will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_903934] attended  each of their study visits. Thus, the potential maximum 
compensation for this study is $200.  Compensation will be prorated based on the visits attended for those participants who 
miss study visits or discontinue from the study. 
 
 
 
 
L. CONSENT  ISSUES  
 
1. CONSENT  PROCESS  
Indicate who will be asked to pro vide consent/assent, who will obtain consent/assent, what language (e.g., English, 
Spanish) will be used by  [CONTACT_57669] o btaining conse nt/assent, where and when will cons ent/assent be obtained, what steps 
will be taken to minimize the po ssibility of coercion or un due influence, and how much time will subjects be afforded 
to make a d ecision to participate. 
 
For p atients who are interested in the study, the RA will tell them that their decisions to participate in the study are entirely 
voluntary. Also, the RA  will assure potential participants that their study data is confidential, will not be shared with 
anyone ou tside the research team, and if published or presented, will only be do ne as aggregate data.  For patients who are 
interested in participating in the study and who meet the eligibility criteria, the RA will answer any questions they have 
about  the study and then obtain informed co nsent for study participation. The informed cons ent process will be cond ucted 
by [CONTACT_669243] (as only English-speaking participants will be recruited) in private areas in or near the clinics. 
Potential participants who  want additional time to decide abo ut study participation will be allowed to take a blank consent 
form home with them and may go through the consent process at a subsequent clinic visit.
